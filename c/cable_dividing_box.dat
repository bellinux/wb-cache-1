40|$|A random {{sequential}} box-covering algorithm {{recently introduced}} {{to measure the}} fractal dimension in scale-free networks is investigated. The algorithm contains Monte Carlo sequential steps of choosing {{the position of the}} center of each box, and thereby, vertices in preassigned <b>boxes</b> can <b>divide</b> subsequent <b>boxes</b> into more than one pieces, but <b>divided</b> <b>boxes</b> are counted once. We find that such box-split allowance in the algorithm is a crucial ingredient necessary to obtain the fractal scaling for fractal networks; however, it is inessential for regular lattice and conventional fractal objects embedded in the Euclidean space. Next the algorithm is viewed from the cluster-growing perspective that boxes are allowed to overlap and thereby, vertices can belong to more than one box. Then, the number of distinct boxes a vertex belongs to is distributed in a heterogeneous manner for SF fractal networks, while it is of Poisson-type for the conventional fractal objects.

40|$|Abstract. The {{shape of}} a cable hanging under its own weight and uniform {{horizontal}} tension between two power poles is a catenary. The catenary is a curve which has an equation defined by a hyperbolic cosine function and a scaling factor. The scaling factor for power cables hanging under their own weight {{is equal to the}} horizontal tension on the <b>cable</b> <b>divided</b> by the weight of the cable. Both of these values are unknown for this problem. Newton's method was used to approximate the scaling factor and the arc length function to determine the length of the cable. A script was written using the Python programming language in order to quickly perform several iterations of Newton's method to get...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  8 a, a fall {{incident}} {{may not be}} identified if the subject is overlapped by the other. To solve this problem, the bounding <b>box</b> is <b>divided</b> into two equal boxes if overlapping occurs. The width of the silhouette is used to identify whether the overlapping occurs or not. The optical flow features are then extracted in each <b>divided</b> <b>box.</b> The one which has larger average downward optical flow is used to identify possible fall action. As a result, the fall incidents can be extracted correctly as shown in Fig.  8 b, and Fig.  8 a demonstrates the result without using the bounding box division strategy.|$|R

5000|$|Cable-Claremont Airport (as it {{was known}} until 1961) was founded in 1945 by Maude and Dewey Cable, who bought the land for $8,500. [...] The <b>Cables</b> <b>divided</b> the land, selling the {{northern}} portion for what the entire parcel had cost the Cables. That parcel was developed into a quarry by Holliday Rock, which recently erected its national headquarters near the approach end of Runway 24. The first runway, 1-19, built by Dewey Cable himself, was 1500 ft long. It ran north-south, perpendicular to the prevailing winds, and had a steep gradient. The main runway, 6-24, was completed six months later. Unlike the first runway, it ran east-west (parallel to the wind, which is ideal), had a hard, flat surface, and by 1947 was 2350 ft long and 150 ft wide.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} under glasshouse and field conditions with the general objectives of understanding the mechanisms of interference between wheat and two annual grass weed species viz. Phalaris minor and Phalaris paradoxa by adopting replacement and additive series designs and the <b>divided</b> <b>box</b> technique to partition competition effects. Replacement series experiments showed that wheat exhibited intraspecific competition in monoculture. In general, wheat outcompeted both Phalaris spp. in mixtures and was more competitive than both weeds at 75 : 25 % and 50 : 50 % mixture ratios. In additive series experiments, {{it was observed that}} yield components of spring wheat were significantly reduced at density of 200 and 50 Phalaris spp plants m⁻² under glasshouse and field conditions respectively. Wheat yield reduction was 22. % and 20. 9 % following competition during spring against P. paradoxa and P. minor respectively; however, it was 60. 8 and 34. 9 % during winter at a weed density of 400 plants m⁻².

50|$|The system {{consists}} of three types of stations: Power Stations with 135 hp (101 kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. Terminal stations in Forsby and Köping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power stations. Angle stations lack motors and only change {{the angle of the}} cable track by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The pulling cables go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut by counterweights in towers in the power stations. The heavier carrying <b>cable</b> is <b>divided</b> into four runs along each section, connected by tension stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.|$|R
