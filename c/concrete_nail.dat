5000|$|I {{feel all}} the senses {{in my body}} that I don’t want to feel, all the {{unwanted}} pain. I really got depressed. And my (burned) skin (including face) is extra sensitive. When it’s hot I feel the heat and when it’s cold I also feel very cold. My left foot was shattered in 10 places. It’s all held together by screws. Hopefully, after 20 weeks (since Nov. 13) the bones will heal; I’m still under heavy medication. And I still take pain relievers. The pain is terrible.Three days ago (Jan. 26), I had two shrapnels removed from my body. They were all <b>concrete</b> <b>nails.</b>|$|R

The agency grew to include hundreds of diverse musical performers on its roster (the Buzzcocks, Nine Inch <b>Nails,</b> <b>Concrete</b> Blonde, Iggy Pop, General Public, Charlie Peacock, Let's Active, R.E.M., Sting, Morrissey), as well as representing actors. The music division of FBI was merged into InterTalent Agency in 1992, and Copeland moved to Los Angeles soon thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|In the U.S., older barns {{were built}} from timbers hewn from {{trees on the}} farm and built as a log crib barn or timber frame, {{although}} stone barns were sometimes built in areas where stone was a cheaper building material. In {{the mid to late}} 19th century in the U.S. barn framing methods began to shift away from traditional timber framing to [...] "truss framed" [...] or [...] "plank framed" [...] buildings. Truss or plank framed barns reduced the number of timbers instead using dimensional lumber for the rafters, joists, and sometimes the trusses. The joints began to become bolted or nailed instead of being mortised and tenoned. The inventor and patentee of the Jennings Barn claimed his design used less lumber, less work, less time, and less cost to build and were durable and provided more room for hay storage. Mechanization on the farm, better transportation infrastructure, and new technology like a hay fork mounted on a track contributed to a need for larger, more open barns, sawmills using steam power could produce smaller pieces of lumber affordably, and machine cut nails were much less expensive than hand-made (wrought) <b>nails.</b> <b>Concrete</b> block began to be used for barns in the early 20th century in the U.S.|$|R
