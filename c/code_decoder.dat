50|$|QR codes {{have become}} common in {{consumer}} advertising. Typically, a smartphone {{is used as}} a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a web browser).QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides a way to access a brand's website more quickly than by manually entering a URL. Beyond mere convenience to the consumer, the importance of this capability is that it increases the conversion rate (the chance that contact with the advertisement will convert to a sale), by coaxing interested prospects further down the conversion funnel with little delay or effort, bringing the viewer to the advertiser's website immediately, where a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewer's interest.Although initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes are used over a much wider range of applications, including commercial tracking, entertainment and transport ticketing, product and loyalty marketing (examples: mobile couponing where a company's discounted and percent discount can be captured using a QR <b>code</b> <b>decoder</b> which is a mobile app, or storing a company's information such as address and related information alongside its alpha-numeric text data {{as can be seen in}} Yellow Pages directory), and in-store product labeling. It can also be used in storing personal information for use by organizations. An example of this is Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) where NBI clearances now come with a QR code. Many of these applications target mobile-phone users (via mobile tagging). Users may receive text, add a vCard contact to their device, open a URI, or compose an e-mail or text message after scanning QR codes. They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code-generating sites or apps. Google had an API, now deprecated, to generate QR codes, and apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices.QR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text, contact information, connect to a wireless network, or open a web page in the telephone's browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hardlinking or object hyperlinking. QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation (aGPS) or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} decoding shortened block codes are the padding of received codeword with zeros or correction of the syndrome polynomial values. Such approaches make stream-oriented decoding of continuous input data stream impossible. The paper {{offers a new}} technique for decoding the shortened Reed-Solomon codes. Its hardware implementation allows us to provide stream processing, reduce latency in clock cycles, and decrease a required quantity of hardware resources as compared to decoder implementation with padding of received packet with zeros. A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is that the decoder processes a stream of code words of different lengths without changing their structure and insertion of additional delays {{and that it is}} possible to use the modules of existing Reed-Solomon decoders for full codeword length. To enable this, a notion of error locator corrector for shortened code is introduced and a technique of their calculation is offered.
