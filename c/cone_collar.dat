25|$|The video {{features}} the band {{in a dark}} room, where the appearance of falling water {{in front of the}} band distorts and blurs the band members' faces (an idea suggested by Cobain). Throughout the video, clips such as cells multiplying at an incredible rate, to a living organism in its embryotic stages are shown. The video clip also features Kurt Cobain swinging away on a chandelier throughout the room, and water begins to flow into the room. In addition, the video shows parts involving a dog wearing a <b>cone</b> <b>collar.</b> Images of a baby swimming underwater (a reference to the cover of Nevermind) and a pistol floating appear. Towards the end, a clip of the band appears, with Cobain in the front, lying on the ground and kissing the camera.|$|E
50|$|Fully synchronous, hydrau-pneumatic {{systems are}} {{designed}} to change gears based on engine performance and other velocity indicators, delivering torque to drive wheels. These transmissions have synchronizing mechanisms (called <b>cone</b> and <b>collar</b> synchronizers) that {{are designed to}} keep gear dog-teeth from being broken off.|$|R

40|$|A {{one piece}} {{reusable}} fastener capable of joining materials together {{from one side}} (blind backside) comprises a screw driven pin ending in a wedge-shaped expander cone. The cone cooperates within a slotted collar end which {{has a number of}} tangs on a cylindrical body. The fastener is set by inserting it through aligned holes in the workpieces to be joined. Turning the pin in one direction draws the <b>cone</b> into the <b>collar,</b> deforming the tangs radially outward to mate with tapered back-tapered hold in the workpiece, thus fastening the two pieces together. Reversing the direction of the pin withdraws the <b>cone</b> from the <b>collar,</b> and allows the tangs to resume their contracted configuration without withdrawing the fastener from the insertion hole. The fastener is capable of joining materials together from only one side with substantial strength in tension and shear over many resue attachment cycles, with no special operations on the main assembly parts other than the tapering of the back end of the insertion hole...|$|R
40|$|A few {{components}} {{pertaining to}} a crashed aeroengine {{were examined in}} the laboratory to establish {{whether or not the}} split cone on the HPTR shaft had moved forward during flight which could cause subsequent damages leading to engine flame out. From the evidences, it has been established that the split cone and the IBB sub-assembly were in position on their respective shafts. Analysis shows that the rubbing between the split <b>cone</b> and IBB <b>collar</b> had occurred due to movement of LP/HP spool as a whole. A few checks are recommended to examine this aspect on the crashed engine...|$|R
40|$|The Vredefort {{structure}} {{located in}} the center of the Witwatersrand basin in South Africa and the Sudbury structure in Canada are widely considered the two oldest and largest impact structures still evident on Earth. Both structures are very similar in a number of geological aspects (e. g., association with major economic ore deposits, similar ages of ca. 2 Ga, abundant pseudotachylite as well as shatter <b>cone</b> occurrences, overturned <b>collar).</b> However, whereas the geological community generally accepts an impact origin for the Sudbury structure, a number of researchers are still reluctant to accept this for the Vredefort Dome. Therefore, the aim of this review is to present new data, highlight the most obvious shortcomings in the current database, and to summarize the major arguments in the genetic controversy...|$|R
40|$|A {{metallic}} threaded composite fastener, particularly {{suited for}} high temperature applications, has a body member made of {{high temperature resistant}} composite material with a ceramic coating. The body member has a head portion configured to be installed in a countersunk hole and a shank portion which is noncircular and tapered. One part of the shank may be noncircular and the other part tapered, or {{the two types of}} surface could be combined into a frustum of a noncircular <b>cone.</b> A split <b>collar</b> member made of high strength, high temperature tolerant metal alloy is split into two halves and the interior of the halves are configured to engage the shank. The exterior of the collar has a circumferential groove which receives a lock ring to secure the collar halves to the shank. In the assembled condition torque may be transmitted from the body to the split collar by the engaged noncircular portions to install and remove the fastener assembly into or from a threaded aperture and shear loads in the collar threads are transferred to the shank tapered portion as a combination of radial compression and axial tension loads. Thus, tension loads may be applied to the fastener shank without damaging the ceramic coating...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: (1) Develop a sham moxibustion device; (2) {{determine}} whether volunteer participants and practitioners can distinguish the sham procedure from real moxibustion during treatment for prevention {{of the common}} cold; and (3) assess the feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial of the device. Design: Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: A community outpatient health station in Chaoyang district, Beijing, China, from early November through late December 2003. Methods: Sham and real moxibustion pillars were made by affixing moxa <b>cones</b> onto special <b>collar</b> bases. These pillars resemble each other in appearance, burning procedure and residue, but {{the base of the}} sham pillar isolates the moxa-produced heat and smoke and prevents them from radiating to the skin. These devices were tested in a pilot clinical trial in which patients received moxibustion at Zusanli (ST 36) for prevention of the common cold. Volunteers (n = 71) aged 55 - 75 years were given pre-treatment questionnaires to assess their knowledge of moxibustion and their expectations and motives for participating in the trial, randomized into treatment (n = 36) and placebo-controlled (n = 35) groups, and treated once every 2 days for 1 month. Questionnaires assessing the effectiveness of the blinding were given to the volunteers {{at the end of the}} trial and to practitioners after each treatment session. Result: There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in past moxibustion experience, knowledge of moxibustion, expectations and motivation. The number of volunteers in the treatment group and the placebo group who believed they received: (1) real moxibustion; (2) sham moxibustion; and (3) were uncertain as to which they received is 30, 0, 5; 29, 0, 4, respectively. The results show no significant statistical differences (P = 1. 000). The number of volunteers in the treatment group and the placebo group who were believed, by the two practitioners who provided the treatments, to have received: (1) real moxibustion; (2) sham moxibustion; and (3) and an undisclosed treatment were 10, 6, 19; 9, 4, 20 and 11, 7, 17; 12, 5, 16, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the practitioners (P = 0. 811 and 0. 840). Conclusion: The sham moxibustion device was successfully validated in the present study. The results demonstrate that these specially designed real and sham moxibustion pillars can be used together to provide an effective placebo-control in moxibustion research and can successfully fulfill the double blinding protocol in moxibustion clinical trials. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
