A good example is the premixed charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> combustion. A strategy in which early injection is used causing a burning {{process in which the}} fuel burns in the premixed condition. In <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engines, soot (particulate matter) and NOx emissions are an extremely unsolved issue.
