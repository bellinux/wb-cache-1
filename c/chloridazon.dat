50|$|The {{issue is}} {{specifically}} addressed in major regulatory frameworks. In Europe, for instance, “nonrelevant” metabolites are distinguished from metabolites that are “relevant for groundwater resources” or even “ecotoxicologically relevant”. The latter are those whose risk to soil or aquatic biota is comparable or {{higher than the}} parent and must meet the same standards as their parent. Groundwater-relevant metabolites are those likely to reach groundwater in concentrations above 0.1 μg/liter and to display the same toxicity as the parent compound. In the past toxicology issues typically emerged only decades after market introduction. Examples are the detection of <b>chloridazon</b> products (first marketed in 1964) in surface and groundwater, or tolylfluanid (first marketed in 1971). That these substances were overlooked for so long may partially be attributable to prior limits on analytical capabilities. However, labeling some metabolites as nonrelevant may have resulted in directing attention away from them. The decision to tolerate up to 10 μg/liter of “nonrelevant” metabolites in groundwater and drinking water is politically highly contentious in Europe. Some consider the higher limit acceptable as no imminent health risk can be proven, whereas others regard it as a fundamental deviation from the precautionary principle.|$|E

These products, that need to be identified, may present a more toxic effect than the parent compound. MethodsThe exact and unequivocal structural characterization of the detected by-products of <b>Chloridazon</b> was performed by in-depth analysis of the liquid chromatography/negative electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (LC/ESI+/MS 2) fragmentation. Such a technique is a powerful and sensitive analytical tool to study environmental issues. The reactive radicals that induce the degradation of <b>Chloridazon</b> were generated by selective excitation of titanium dioxide as photocatalyst and also by UV photolysis of hydrogen peroxide. ResultsSeveral processes are initiated by hydroxyl radical reaction with <b>Chloridazon.</b> Among them (i) hydroxylation of the phenyl group at the ortho, meta and para positions; (ii) a second hydroxylation process as a secondary reaction is also obtained within the phenyl moiety; (iii) scission of the phenyl-N bond through a hydrolysis process; and (iv) a substitution of the chlorine atom by a hydroxyl group. ConclusionsLC/ESI-Q-TOFMS appeared to be a valuable and precise tool for structural elucidation of the unknown by-products that were generated during hydroxyl radical reactions with <b>Chloridazon.</b> Several hydroxylated and dihydroxylated isomers were identified together with dechlorinated and bridge opening products.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} experiments with undisturbed soil columns were performed {{for assessing the}} mobility and persistence of <b>chloridazon</b> and lenacil in a clayey soil in the marshes of Lebrija, southwest Spain. In the laboratory we tried to evaluate the herbicides fate when applied with doses greater than normal, as it happens by overlap when spraying the herbicides. Thus, the herbicides doses in the field experiments {{were similar to those}} applied by the growers in the area, while the doses applied to the soil columns were four times greater. Apart from that, in the field experiments the herbicides were incorporated into the soil just after the application, by sprinkling irrigation, as it is usually made by the growers. Sometimes, however, there is a delay in irrigating after herbicide application, which may favour adsorption by the soil. To evaluate how this can influence the fate of the studied herbicides in the soil, in the soil columns water was applied for the first time one week after applying the herbicides. Both herbicides showed a low mobility, being the amounts of residues found in the top 0. 05 m of soil several times greater than deeper in the soil. Negligible amounts of <b>chloridazon</b> were found at about 4 weeks after application, both in the field and in the soil columns. Lenacil showed a greater persistence, taking about 7 weeks after application for the herbicide to dissipate. The half-life values calculated from the field samples were 11 d for <b>chloridazon</b> and 16 d for lenacil. Calculations from the data of the soil column samples yielded half-life values of 4 d for <b>chloridazon</b> and 14 d for lenacil. The air temperature recorded in the laboratory during the experiments (18 ± 2 oC) was greater than in the field (average maximim temperature = 17. 2 oC; average minimum temperature = 8. 7 oC; minimum temperature = 1. 5 oC), which may explain the quicker dissipation of the herbicides in the soil columns. Also the higher herbicide concentration in column experiments could to have enhanced biodegradation process. For the studied conditions, neither <b>chloridazon</b> nor lenacil represent a serious risk of groundwater contamination. The values of the coefficient of variation of the herbicide residues in soil samples from the columns were similar to those from the field, suggesting that the technique for herbicide application in the soil columns should be improved to decrease variability.

There have recently been intensive debates in Germany about the pollution of groundwater and the problems faced by water utilities endeavouring to maintain the high quality of German drinking water.

The influence of the organic solvent used in gradient LC, {{as well as the}} amount of co-extracted humic material on the ESI process is studied. The eluotropic strength of the organic solvent was found to have a distinct effect on the sensitivity of ESI-MS if coupled with LC gradient separations.

40|$|Organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, {{perfluorinated}} compounds (PFCs), and pesticides, {{are important}} environmental contaminants. To obtain more information regarding {{their presence in}} marine organisms, an increasing demand exists for reliable analytical methods for quantification of these micropollutants in biotic matrices. Therefore, we developed extraction procedures and new analytical methods for the quantification of 14 pesticides, 10 PFCs, and 11 pharmaceuticals in tissue of marine organisms, namely blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). This paper presents these optimized analytical procedures and their application to M. edulis, deployed at five stations in the Belgian coastal zone. The methods consisted of a pressurized liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for pharmaceuticals and pesticides, and of a liquid extraction using acetonitrile and SPE, followed by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry for PFCs. The limits of quantification of the three newly optimized analytical procedures in M. edulis tissue varied between 0. 1 and 10 ng g- 1, and satisfactory linearities (= 0. 98) and recoveries (90 – 106 %) were obtained. Application of these methods to M. edulis revealed the presence of five pharmaceuticals, two PFCs, and seven pesticides at levels up to 490, 5, and 60 ng g- 1, respectively. The most prevalent micropollutants were salicylic acid, paracetamol, perfluorooctane sulfonate, <b>chloridazon,</b> and dichlorvos...|$|E
40|$|Chlorophyll {{fluorescence}} {{analysis is}} a simple and rapid method for detecting herbicide effects after a short time following their application in photosynthetic apparatus in plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were carried out against two broad of weeds to describe how the Kautsky curve and its parameters were affected by herbicides. Desmedipham + phenmedipham + ethofumesate changed the chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve at all time intervals except four hours after spring (HAS) in Amaranthus retroflexus L. and at all doses of Portulaca oleracea L. 4 HAS. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence inhibition was evident by <b>chloridazon</b> at doses of 650 and 325 g a. i. ha- 1 in P. oleracea and A. retroflexus respectively, for all time intervals. Furthermore, chlorophyll fluorescence decays only occurred by clopyralid in A. retroflexus at the highest dose. A biomass effective dose (ED 50 and/or ED 90) based on log-logistic dose-response curves for A. retroflexus were considerably {{higher than that of}} P. oleracea. The maximum quantum efficiency (FV/Fm) was stable, whereas the relative changes at the J step (Fvj) and area (the area between the Kautsky curve and the maximum fluorescence (Fm)) was more sensitive to all three herbicides. There was a relatively good correlation between fluorescence parameters taken 24 hours after the spraying and the dry matter taken three weeks later, for both species under study...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{proportion}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in sugar beet rotations, volunteer oilseed rape can occur in increased numbers in subsequent crops. The sulfonylurea triflusulfuron is widely used for broad-leaved weed control in sugar beet, but may no longer be effective to control imidazolinone-tolerant volunteers when imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape is grown, which is due to a cross-tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate six different herbicide strategies for the control of tolerant volunteer oilseed rape. As a result, imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape showed a distinctive cross-resistance to triflusulfuron in the field. Mean herbicide efficacy was 14 % and was only slightly increased by combination with metamitron. Imidazolinone-susceptible and -tolerant oilseed rape varieties showed different response to the herbicide treatments. A significantly higher reduction of plant fresh mass (shoot) > 90 % was caused by herbicide treatments that included the active ingredients desmedipham, phenmedipham, ethofumesate, <b>chloridazon</b> and quinmerac. The results showed that triflusulfuron is no longer suitable to control volunteers if they are derived from imidazolinone-tolerance expressing varieties. However, alternative herbicides are available. Generally, increased attention has to be paid to volunteer management within the whole crop rotation if imidazolinonetolerant oilseed rape is grown. Appropriate tillage strategies after oilseed rape harvest have to be followed by effective herbicide treatments in the subsequent sugar beet, for example a mixture of metamitron, phenmedipham, desmedipham, ethofumesat and lenaciel...|$|E
40|$|Rainwater, sampled over {{a period}} of 2 1 / 2 years in various regions of {{south-western}} Germany with different use of pesticides, was analyzed by GC and HPLC for 27 compounds and 3 metabolites. In total 10 herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, dichlorprop, MCPA, mecoprop, metamitron, pendimethalin, simazine, terbuthylazine and triallat), 1 insecticide (parathion), and 2 metabolites (desethylatrazine and desethylsimazine) were detected. Not detected were fungicides, most of the insecticides and the following herbicides: <b>chloridazon,</b> 2, 4 -D, metazachlor and trifluralin. Most of the positive results were in the range of 0. 1 #mu#g/l, and maximum concentrations were 1 - 2 #mu#g/l. The maximum deposition by precipitation was 0. 7 g/ha"* year for a single compound. The yearly deposition for the sum of all pesticides detected was between 0. 2 to 1. 6 g/ha. Wet deposition played the major role and dry deposition was of minor importance. For some pesticides there was a correlation between local use and amount of pesticide deposited by precipitation. In bioassays with duckweed (Lemna gibba), mustard (Sinapis alba), oats (Avena sativa) and Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) the effect of long-term exposure to sublethal concentrations of the pesticides was studied, and threshold levels were estimated. It was shown, that threshold levels were about 100 times the rainwater concentrationsSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 058) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium des Innern, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{movement}} to subsurface drains was monitored in two typical crop production areas in Germany. Field trials {{were conducted on}} two subsurface-drained soils, a silt loam and a poorly structured sandy soil, under different climatic conditions. Over a period of one year, the drainflow was measured and the drain water was analysed for all applied herbicides. Different leaching behaviour was observed at the two field sites. Following autumn application of pendimethalin and isoproturon to the Soester Börde soil, maximum concentrations of about 62 mug litre (exp - 1) for isoproturon and 0. 7 mug litre (exp - 1) for pendimethalin were observed in drainflow from this silt loam. The early occurrence of both herbicides in the drain water only two days after application is consistent with fast flow through macropores. In contrast, on the subsurface-drained sandy soil in Brandenburg, isoproturon did not reach the drains until two months after autumn application and was found at maximum concentrations of only 1. 4 mug litre (exp - 1); pendimethalin was not detected in the drain water. Pesticide movement after spring application seemed to be of minor importance. At both locations, spring application led to low concentrations of pesticides in the drainflow (pendimethalin < 0. 01 mug litre (exp - 1); metolachlor < = 0. 05 mug litre (exp - 1); <b>chloridazon</b> < = 0. 15 mug litre (exp - 1); metamitron < = 0. 02 mug litre (exp - 1); terbuthylazine < = 1. 4 mug litre (exp - 1) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the factors influencing the main removal mechanisms (adsorption and biodegradation) for organic micropollutant (OMP) removal during river bank filtration (RBF) {{and the possibility of}} developing a predictive model of this process for OMP removal during RBF. Chapter 2 analysed the sorption and biodegradation behaviour of 14 OMPs in soil columns filled with technical sand (representative of the first meter of oxic conditions in RBF systems. Breakthrough curves were modelled, based on the advection-dispersion equation, to differentiate between OMP sorption and biodegradation. Retardation factors (indicators for OMP sorption) for most compounds were close to 1, indicating little sorption of these compounds and thus the mobile behaviour of these compounds during passage in soils. The influence of active and inactive biomass (bio-sorption), sand grains and the water matrix on OMP sorption was found to be negligible under the conditions investigated in this chapter. Although trends were observed between charge or hydrophobicity of charged OMPs and their biodegradation rates, a statistically significant linear relationship for the complete OMP mixture could not be obtained using these physico-chemical properties. However, a statistically significant relationship was obtained between OMP biodegradation rates and the functional groups present in the molecular structure of the OMPs. The presence of ethers and carbonyl groups increased biodegradability, while the presence of amines, ring structures, aliphatic ethers and sulphur decreased biodegradability. Chapter 3 examined relationships between functional groups present in the molecular structure of a mixture of 29 OMPs (of which 11 were the same as in Chapter 2) and their biodegradation rates obtained from lab-scale soil columns and constructed a multi-linear regression model for biodegradation rate prediction based on this. This model was then validated with field data. In contrast to Chapter 2, where technical sand was used to fill the columns, lab-scale columns here were filled with soil from an operational RBF site. A statistically significant relationship was found between OMP biodegradation rate and the functional groups present in the molecular structures of the OMPs. OMP biodegradation rate increased in the presence of carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups, and carbonyl groups, but decreased in the presence of ethers, halogens, aliphatic ethers, methyl groups and ring structures in the molecular structure of the OMPs. Differences between the predictive models obtained in Chapter 2 and 3 could be explained by the different soil types and water qualities used (Schie Canal water and technical sand in Chapter 2, Lek River water and soil from an operational RBF site in Chapter 3). The predictive model obtained from the lab-scale soil column experiment in Chapter 3 gave a good indication of biodegradability for approximately 70 % of the OMPs monitored in the field (80 % excluding the glymes). The model was found to be less reliable for the more persistent OMPs (OMPs with predicted biodegradation rates lower or around the standard error = 0. 77 d- 1) and OMPs containing amide or amine groups. These OMPs should be carefully monitored in the field, to determine their removal during RBF. Water quality was reported to be an important factor in OMP removal during soil passage, however it is unclear if this is the only important factor and therefore Chapter 4 explored the effect of soil type on OMP removal. Sorption and biodegradation behaviour of 20 OMPs was investigated in lab-scale columns filled with two different soil types and fed with the same water quality - the columns were simulating RBF under oxic conditions. Differences in retardation factors and OMP biodegradation rates were statistically not significant between the two soil types, although these soil types were characterized by a different cationic exchange capacity, organic matter and sand/silt/clay content. This result was supported by the microbial community composition (richness, evenness) of the two soils that became more similar {{during the course of the}} experiments as a result of feeding both columns with the same water quality. This indicates that microbial community composition and thereby OMP removal in soils is primarily determined by the aqueous phase (organic matter quantity and quality, nutrients) rather than the soil phase. These results imply that different RBF sites located along the same river may show similar OMP removal (in case of similar water quality and residence time). Chapter 5 investigated the effect of the water quality in more detail, and more precisely the effect of different organic carbon fractions (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, transphilic and the complete river water organic carbon) obtained from river water on the OMP biodegradation rate. Additionally, the effect of short-term OMP and DOC shock-loads (e. g. quadrupling the OMP concentrations and doubling the DOC concentration) on OMP biodegradation rates was investigated to assess the resilience of RBF systems to, for example, climate change. The results imply that – in contrast to what is observed for soil systems operating on wastewater effluent - OMP biodegradation rates during RBF are not affected by the type of organic carbon fraction (obtained from river water) fed to the soil column, in case of stable operation. No effect of a short-term DOC shock-load on OMP biodegradation rates was observed, for none of the different organic carbon fractions dosed. This means that the RBF site investigated in this chapter is resilient towards transient higher DOC concentrations in the river water (e. g. following a decrease in river discharge due to seasonal effects). However, a temporary OMP shock-load increased OMP biodegradation rates for the river water organic matter and hydrophilic organic carbon fractions. These increased biodegradation rates could not be explained by any of the parameters investigated in this chapter (ATP, DOC removal, SUVA, richness/evenness of the soil microbial population or OMP category (hydrophobicity/charge). The effect of redox condition on OMP biodegradation rate as well adaptive behaviour of a mixture of 15 OMPs (largely similar to the OMP mixtures used in Chapter 3, 4, and 5) in laboratory-scale soil columns fed with river water was analysed in Chapter 6. Dimethoate, diuron, and metoprolol showed redox dependent removal behaviour with degradation rates larger for the oxic zone compared to the suboxic/anoxic zone. OMPs that showed persistent behaviour in the oxic zone (atrazine, carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide and simazine) were also not removed under more reduced conditions. Adaptive behaviour was observed for five OMPs: dimethoate, <b>chloridazon,</b> lincomycin, sulfamethoxazole and phenazone. Newly developed, or existing, RBF sites exposed to these OMPs for the first time may require up to 9 months following start-up to reach full removal capacity. For some chemicals, such as dimethoate, even longer start-up times could be required since full removal capacity was not reached in our tests even after 15 months. The adaptation time observed for some OMPs could not be explained by their physico-chemcial properties (hydrophobicity, charge, molecular weight) or functional groups. Finally, adaptive behaviour of the biomass towards OMPs was found to be an important factor that should be incorporated in predictive models for OMP removal during RBF.
