[...] While the technique clearly illustrates changes in minerals which reflect genuine compositional differences, the method by which such phenomena occur is not understood. It is thought to involve the interaction of several electronic forces, including the incoming electrons emitted by the SEM machine, local charge variations in the sample being imaged, the flow of ions in the sample, and any electric fields existing; these may be controlled by structures within the sample which assist in the accumulation of charge.|$|E

40|$|<b>Charge</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging in the {{scanning}} electron microscope can provide {{new insights into the}} scale and composition of alkali feldspar microtextures, and such information helps considerably with the interpretation of their geological histories and results of argon isotope thermochronological analyses. The effectiveness of this technique has been illustrated using potassium-rich alkali feldspars from the Dartmoor granite (UK). These feldspars contain strain-controlled lamellar crypto- and microperthites that are cross-cut by strain-free deuteric microperthites. The constituent albite- and orthoclase-rich phases of both microperthite generations can be readily distinguished by atomic number contrast imaging. The <b>charge</b> <b>contrast</b> results additionally show that sub-micrometre-sized albite ‘platelets’ are commonplace between coarser exsolution lamellae and occur together to make cryptoperthites. Furthermore, <b>charge</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging reveals that the orthoclase-rich feldspar is an intergrowth of two phases, one that is featureless with uniform contrast and another that occurs as cross-cutting veins and grains with the { 110 } adularia habit. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the featureless feldspar is tweed orthoclase, whereas the veins and euhedral grains are composed of irregular microcline that has formed from orthoclase by ‘unzipping’ during deuteric or hydrothermal alteration. The <b>charge</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging results are especially important in demonstrating that deuteric perthites are far more abundant in alkali feldspars than would be concluded from investigations using conventional microscopy techniques. The unexpected presence of such a high volume of replacement products has significant implications for understanding the origins and geological histories of crustal rocks and the use of alkali feldspars in geo- and thermochronology. Whilst the precise properties of feldspars that generate contrast remain unclear, the similarity between <b>charge</b> <b>contrast</b> images and corresponding cathodoluminescence images of deuteric microperthites indicates that trace element chemistry and possibly also elastic strain within the crystal play a major role...|$|E

The major components are {{shown to be}} detrital material such as silicates and clay minerals and neutralization products such as gypsum and metal hydroxides. X-ray mapping and progressive sludge leaching experiments are performed to locate the major nickel bearing species. Progressive leaching was performed for two hours at pH 4, 3. 5, and 3. It is observed that there is incomplete nickel extraction for all leach conditions. X-ray mapping establishes that the remaining nickel is due to minor amounts of Ni/S and Ni/O and more significantly colloidal sized nickel-silicon-aluminum complexes; which seem to result from neutralization. <b>Charge</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging was also considered for characterization.

This enables structural cartilage examinations by contrast-enhanced MRI. In {{line with}} the development of a clinically applicable protocol for such examinations, this study describes the temporal pattern of Gd-DTPA 2 - distribution in femoral knee cartilage at three different doses in healthy volunteers. Nineteen volunteers (ages 21 - 28 years) were examined with a 1. 5 T MRI system.

The cartilage was analyzed before and four times (1 - 4 h) after an intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA 2 - at single, double, and triple doses: 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 mmol/kg body weight, respectively. The increase in R 1 postcontrast was linearly dose-related at all times. The highest R 1 values were registered at 2 and 3 h postcontrast, suggesting 2 h to be optimal in the clinical situation.

40|$|Visual {{inspection}} (optical microscope point counting) and silica abundance {{show that}} laminated shale from the Late Cretaceous of Colombia contains {{high levels of}} detrital quartz silt and sand particles.

In addition, many "sand" grains that otherwise appear to represent simple detrital quartz particles are actually of biogenic origin, representing the tests of agglutinated foraminifera, formed from cemented silt-sized quartz particles. Finally, CCI shows that original detrital grains have undergone authigenic modification, with both syntaxial overgrowths and micro-quartz. Without recognition of these features, the relative proportion of detrital quartz (sand) would otherwise be greatly overestimated, with important implications for environmental interpretation.

40|$|SummaryPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>contrast</b> agent <b>charge</b> on the <b>contrast</b> agent uptake ratio (CUR) in cartilage and to image the naturally occurring variations in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content present in bovine articular cartilage. MethodsIn an ex vivo bovine osteochondral plug model, we utilized three <b>charged</b> <b>contrast</b> agents (Gadopentetate/Magnevist [− 2], Ioxaglate/Hexabrix [− 1], and CA 4 + [+ 4]) and μCT to image cartilage. The X-ray attenuation of the cartilage tissue after equilibration in each contrast agent was also related to the initial X-ray attenuation of each contrast agent in solution to compute the uptake of the respective contrast agent (i. e., the CUR). ResultsUse of the cationic contrast agent resulted in significantly higher equilibrium X-ray attenuations in cartilage ECM than either of the anionic contrast agents (Gadopentetate [− 2] and Ioxaglate [− 1]). The CUR (Mean±SD) as computed in this study was 2. 38 (± 0. 26) for the cationic contrast agent indicating a 2. 38 fold increase in computed tomography (CT) attenuation of the cartilage. For the anionic contrast agents, the CUR was 0. 62 (± 0. 26) for Ioxaglate [− 1] and 0. 52 (± 0. 17) for Gadopentetate [− 2], indicating exclusion of 38 % Ioxaglate and 48 % Gadopentetate from the cartilage extracellular matrix. The cationic contrast agent exhibited significant correlations between CT attenuation and GAG content whereas Ioxaglate and Gadopentetate did not (R 2 = 0. 83 for CA 4 +, R 2 = 0. 20 for Ioxaglate, and R 2 = 0. 22 for Gadopentetate). ConclusionElectrostatic attraction of CA 4 + allowed effective imaging of the GAG components of articular cartilage at 50 % lower molar concentration than Ioxaglate and 20 -fold lower molar concentration than Gadopentetate.

40|$|Earthworms of {{the family}} Lumbricidae, which {{includes}} many common species, produce and secrete up to millimeter-sized calcite granules, and the intricate fine-scale zoning of their constituent crystals is unique for a biomineral. Granule calcite is produced by crystallization of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) that initially precipitates within the earthworm calciferous glands, then forms protogranules by accretion on quartz grain cores. Crystallization of ACC is mediated by migrating fluid films and is largely complete within 24 11 of ACC production and before granules leave the earthworm. Variations in the density of defects formed as a byproduct of trace element incorporation during calcite crystall growth have generated zoning that can be resolved by cathodoluminescence imaging at ultraviolet to blue wavelengths and using the novel technique of scanning electron microscope <b>charge</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging. Mapping of calcite crystal orientations by electron backscatter diffraction reveals an approximate radial fabric to the granules that reflects crystal growth from internal nucleation sites toward their margins. The survival within granules of ACC inclusions for months after they enter soils indicates that they crystallize only within the earthworm and {{in the presence of}} fluids containing biochemical catalysts. The earthworm probably promotes crystallization of ACC in order to prevent remobilization of the calcium carbonate by dissolution.
