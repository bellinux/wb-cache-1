30|$|The {{importance}} of space-geodetic techniques, such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), for {{the understanding of}} the Earth’s atmosphere is steadily increasing. In particular, near real-time global positioning system (GPS) data can be used for numerical weather prediction applications (e.g., <b>Crewell</b> et al. 2008; Deng et al. 2011; Dousa and Bennitt 2013). However, at the same time dynamic processes in the neutral atmosphere critically affect the error budget of these space-geodetic techniques. For this reason, it is urgently necessary to use an adequate model for atmospheric conditions, in both the deterministic and stochastic components of the data analysis. Further, it is of great importance to provide an approach for operational and not just for experimental purposes.|$|E
