40|$|Micro {{energy grids}} (MEGs) are used {{extensively}} {{to meet the}} <b>combined</b> <b>electricity,</b> <b>heating,</b> and cooling energy demands {{for all types of}} customers. This paper develops a hazard matrix for a MEG and utilizes two advanced risk modeling approaches (fault tree and layer of protection analysis (LOPA)) for MEGs’ risk analysis. A number of independent protection layers (IPLs) have been proposed to achieve a resilient MEG, hence increasing its safety integrity level (SIL). IPLs are applied using co-generators and thermal energy storage (TES) techniques to minimize the hazards of system failure, increase efficiency, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed modeling and risk assessment approach aims to design a resilient MEG, which can utilize those potentials efficiently. In addition, an energy risk analysis has been applied on each MEGs’ physical domains such as electrical, thermal, mechanical and chemical. The concurrent objectives achieve an increased resiliency, reduced emissions, and sustained economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{closure of}} {{a part of the}} {{municipal}} combined heat and power (CHP) plant of Košice city would result in the loss of 200 MW thermal output within a realtively short period of time. The long term development plan for the Košice district heating system concentrates on solving this problem. Taking into account the extremely high (90 %) dependence of Slovakia on imported energy sources and the desirability of reducing the emission of pollutantst the alternative of supplying of 100 MW thermal output from geothermal sources is attractive. However the indices of economic efficiency for this alternative are unsatisfactory. Cogeneration of <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat</b> in a CHP plant, the most efficient way of supplying heat to Košice at the present time. If as planned, geothermal heat is fed directly into the district heating network the efficiency would be greatly reduced. An excellent solution of this problem would be a new conception, preferring the utilization of geothermal heat in support of a <b>combined</b> <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat</b> production process. The efficiency of geothermal energy utilization could be increased through a special heat pump. This paper deals with several aspects of the design of a heat pump to be integrated into the system of the CHP plant...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{technologies for}} small-scale distributed generation are shifting the focus from the centralized {{to the local}} production of electricity. Besides the electricity-only production, the evolution of small-scale cogeneration units is enabling energy efficiency improvements {{with respect to the}} separate production of <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat.</b> Additional benefits may be obtained by exploiting the potential small-scale cooling production technologies. The combination of technologies to form distributed multi-generation systems {{is one of the most}} promising issues in the evolution of the energy sector. This paper discusses the technologies and schemes allowing for effective deployment of distributed multi-generation solutions, and introduces the relevant efficiency indicators and the technical aspects concerning the interaction among the equipment producing different types of energy.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cell}} performance strongly depends on {{properties of the}} fuel cell stack bipolar plates (BPs). Bipolar plates are {{a key component of}} fuel cells. Functions of materials used for fuel cells include even distribution of gas fuel and air, conduction of electricity between the adjacent cells, heat transfer from the cell as well as prevention of gas leakage and cooldown. Due to multifunctionality of fuel cell plates, choice of materials used for plates is immensely difficult. This paper presents opportunities of application of a new technology of powder sintering for creation of parts for <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>generators.</b> Sintered stainless steel 316 LHD was investigated as a candidate material for bipolar plate materials. 316 L powders were compacted with the following load: 700 MPa, 550 MPa, and 200 MPa, and then sintered at the temperature of 1250 o C in hydrogen medium. The main criterion for selection of a particular material for components of fuel cells is their corrosion resistance in operating conditions of hydrogen fuel cells.

40|$|The {{capability}} of Wind Powered Thermal Energy Systems (WTES) to provide dispatchable energy from an intermittent, renewable resource makes them highly attractive to replace fossil fired <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>generators</b> {{in all areas}} of an energy system. The presented study for the workshop emphasizes two topics. On the one hand it aims to give a complete overview of theoretical concepts that can be referred to as WTES for supply of both <b>heat</b> and <b>electricity.</b> Therefore, it considers possible advantages and drawbacks from an overall system’s point of view. On the other hand a techno-economic analysis based on the estimation of levelized costs of heat supply for room heating is carried out. The novelty of this study is the comparison of five specific WTES concepts, which either make use of electric boilers, hydro-dynamic retarders or heat pumps. Furthermore, in order to consider economies of scale three different system sizes are analysed ranging from the application of a small single wind turbine to WTES consisting of a wind park with rated power of several megawatts. The aim of this investigation is to identify regions where certain WTES are commercially interesting compared to traditional heating technologies.

PVT are seen as promising technology for residential applications where the heat can be exploited on site. In this work, the performances of three different PVT modules are evaluated in real operating conditions at the SolarTech LAB. Performance evaluation is conducted both by means of conventional and innovative performance indexes (corrected thermal efﬁciency and second law efﬁciency) which are expressly introduced in this work {{to take into account}} PVT peculiarities. Dedicated experiments outlined the importance of adopting these peculiar indexes when comparing different PVT modules. In terms of heat recovered, the best roll-bond conﬁguration increases the thermal efﬁciency by 8 % points with respect to the conventional sheet-and-tube one. PVT modules have lower thermal efﬁciency than commercial only thermal modules (41 % vs. 55 %), however, the second law efﬁciency outlines the advantages of producing <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat</b> instead of only heat (16 % vs. 2 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Trigeneration {{refers to}} the <b>combined</b> {{production}} of <b>electricity,</b> <b>heat,</b> and cooling. In a competitive energy market framework, the adoption of Combined Heat, Cooling, and Power (CHCP) plants may become profitable with respect to traditional systems, where <b>electricity,</b> <b>heat,</b> and cooling are produced or purchased separately. This paper illustrates and evaluates the possible benefits of adopting different trigeneration alternatives {{in the design of}} a new energy system, with the specific focus on comparing different cooling production solutions. For the cooling side of CHCP systems, most of the literature refers to absorption groups fed by cogenerated thermal energy. Here, the trigeneration concept is extended to also include conventional electric chillers, heat pumps, or direct-fired absorption chillers. Comparative analysis of the trigeneration solutions is carried out for a hospital site, by performing time-domain simulations to characterize the out-of-design operation and different regulation strategies of the equipment. Poor effectiveness of using classical energy efficiency indices is discussed. A more effective economic analysis, where buying/selling electricity in a competitive market is specifically considered, is then performed. Finally, a multiscenario analysis is carried out for assessing the impact of electricity and gas price variations on the choice of the most convenient trigeneration solutio...|$|R
40|$|Trigeneration {{stands for}} the <b>combined</b> {{production}} of <b>electricity,</b> <b>heat,</b> and cooling (CHCP). This paper reviews and compares CHCP system based on solar energy with respect to traditional CHCP ones. A further comparison is made among the possible technologies for solar CHCP to assess the technical solutions more suited to residential applications. Beyond photovoltaic based systems, two other solutions are proposed: a concentrated sunlight all-thermoacoustic system and an hybrid thermo-photovoltaic system. In a grid-connected energy market, the adoption of CHCP plants may become profitable with respect to traditional systems, where the single energies are produced or purchased separately. Specifically, the onset of solar trigeneration {{can lead to a}} substantial improvement, overcoming many of the traditional drawback associated with micro-cogeneration and trigeneration. The result is a trigeneration system based totally on renewable energy. This is especially attractive for the residential demand, provided that a cost-effective technical solution is available...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Multi-generation (MG) systems {{represent}} a promising solution for improving energy generation effi-ciency. In particular, trigeneration systems for <b>combined</b> production of <b>electricity,</b> <b>heat</b> and cooling power exhibit {{a potential for}} widespread diffusion, above all exploiting small-scale distributed cogenerators such as microturbines in urban areas, where the air conditioning demand is ever increasing. Managing MG systems is a challenging task, due to the energy flow interactions among the manifold equipment within the plant and with external energy net-works. This paper presents a black-box modelling ap-proach suitable for formulating optimization problems for MG system operation. A composite trigeneration plant is used to exemplify two of the possible objectives, namely, minimum operational cost and maximum energy saving. The methodology and the results presented prove to be effective for interpreting possible operational schemes. In particular, energy and economic optimization strategies may be conflicting in dependence on the various energy load levels and electricity market prices...|$|R

40|$|A large market {{potential}} for small <b>electricity</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>generators</b> {{can be identified}} in the domestic sector. Among the under development micro-scale power generation technologies the ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) concept is a promising solution, already proven in the MW-range of power. There is still a prospective for smaller units for domestic users, with low temperature thermal demand. A test bench for a micro-CHP unit, currently run with a prototypal prime mover, is under development at University of Bologna. In particular, the system in study in the test facility is a micro-ORC system, rated for up to 3 kW. The ORC input heat is provided from an external source, which can be an external combustion system (a 46 kW biomass boiler will {{be connected to the}} thermal cycle) or an electric heater. The heat source delivers hot water to the bottoming ORC, currently operated with R 134 a as working fluid, which evolves in a recuperated cycle, with a 3 -piston reciprocating expander, producing mechanical/electric power. The residual low-value heat is discharged to the environment with a water cooled condenser. The hot and cold water circuits have been realized in the lab to test the ORC performance. The micro-ORC internal layout and the external hot and cold water lines have been instrumented, implementing an acquisition and control software by means of LabVIEW software.
