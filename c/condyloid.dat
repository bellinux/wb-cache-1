5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) {{at the back of}} the jawbone, is large and about as high as the <b>condyloid</b> process behind it. The angular process, below the <b>condyloid,</b> is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the <b>condyloid.</b> There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising {{at the back of the}} jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long <b>condyloid</b> {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of}} the jaw which houses the root of the lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus tao is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus from the Pleistocene of Zhoukoudian in China. It is known {{from a number}} of mandibles (lower jaws), which were {{initially}} identified as the living species Miniopterus schreibersii in 1963 before being recognized as a separate species, M. tao, in 1986. Miniopterus tao is larger than living M. schreibersii and has more closely spaced lower premolars and more robust talonids (back groups of cusps) on the lower molars. The back part of the mandible is relatively low and on it, the coronoid and <b>condyloid</b> processes are about equally high. The average length of the mandible is 12.0mm.|$|E
5|$|The mandible, {{which is}} {{severely}} damaged and lacks the <b>condyloid,</b> coronoid, and angular processes {{at the back}} of the bone, contains the second and third molar and part of the lower incisor, but the first molar is missing. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is small. The preserved alveoli, the impressions left by the roots, show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these. The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and V-shaped. The third molar is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and V-shaped. The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7mm. The length of the second molar is 2.5mm and the width is 2.2mm. The third molar has a length of 2.5mm and width of 1.8mm.|$|E
25|$|They {{receive the}} blood from the {{superior}} petrosal sinuses {{at the base of}} the petrous portion of the temporal bone; they communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and <b>condyloid</b> emissary veins; and they receive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diploë.|$|E
500|$|Wołoszyn {{described}} the {{species on the}} basis of two mandibles, one damaged and with the third premolar (p3) through third molar (m3), and the other intact and with the fourth premolar (p4) through second molar (m2). Miniopterus tao is a large member of the [...] "schreibersii group" [...] and about as large as Miniopterus rummeli from the Miocene of Germany. The mandible is robust and generally resembles M.schreibersii. The mental foramen (an opening at the outer side of the jaw) is located between the lower canine and second lower premolar (p2). The coronoid process (a projection {{at the back of the}} mandible) is low and rounded and is connected to the <b>condyloid</b> process behind it by a nearly horizontal ridge, which contains a slight raising at its back. Compared to M.schreibersii, the <b>condyloid</b> process is more slender, but the base of the angular process (at the lower back corner of the jaw) is more robust. In M. rummeli, the back part of the mandible is higher and the coronoid process is distinctly higher than the <b>condyloid</b> process.|$|E
500|$|... ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus {{is known}} {{from a single}} {{mandible}} with the incisor and three molars in it. Much {{of the back of}} the jaw is missing, including the angular, <b>condyloid,</b> and coronoid processes. The mental foramen, a foramen (opening) at the front of the jaw, in the diastema between the incisor and molars, opens upwards, a little more so than in the living marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). The masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles and are located on the outer surface of the mandible, are similar to those of Oryzomys. The molars are very worn, so that only traces of the cusps remain; no accessory small cusps are visible. Each of the teeth has two roots. The length of the toothrow is 3.6mm and the depth of the mandible below the first molar is also 3.6mm.|$|E
500|$|Lamberton {{recognized}} a third species, Cryptoprocta antamba, {{on the basis}} of a mandible (lower jaw) with abnormally broad spacing between the <b>condyloid</b> processes at the back. He also referred two femora (upper leg bones) and a tibia (lower leg bone) intermediate in size between C.spelea and C.ferox to this species. The specific name refers to the [...] "antamba", an animal allegedly from southern Madagascar described by Étienne de Flacourt in 1658 as a large, rare, leopard-like carnivore that eats men and calves and lives in remote mountainous areas; it may have been the giant fossa. Goodman and colleagues could not locate Lamberton's material of Cryptoprocta antamba, but suggested that it was based on an abnormal C.spelea. Together, the fossa and C.spelea form the genus Cryptoprocta within the family Eupleridae, which also includes the other Malagasy carnivorans—the falanouc, the fanalokas, and the Galidiinae. DNA sequence studies suggest that the Eupleridae form a single natural (monophyletic) group and are most closely related to the mongooses of Eurasia and mainland Africa.|$|E
