25|$|A <b>carbon</b> <b>pile</b> {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a {{stack of}} carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A <b>carbon</b> <b>pile</b> resistor {{can also be used}} as a speed control for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts. A <b>carbon</b> <b>pile</b> resistor can be incorporated in automatic voltage regulators for generators, where the <b>carbon</b> <b>pile</b> controls the field current to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the carbon microphone.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} method for manufacturing a suspended single <b>carbon</b> nanowire and <b>piled</b> nano-electrode pairs, and a suspended single <b>carbon</b> nanowire and <b>piled</b> nano-electrode pairs manufactured using said method. A suspended single carbon nanowire, which is manufactured at a high yield by the method for manufacturing a suspended single carbon nanowire according to the present invention, has a minimized dimension, and a suspended carbon nanomesh, which is manufactured at a high yield by the method for manufacturing piled nano-electrode pairs according to the present invention, is thin and dense. The present invention also provides a gas sensor or an electrochemical sensor, to which a suspended single <b>carbon</b> nanowire and <b>piled</b> nano-electrode pairs manufactured by the method according to the present invention are applied. clos...|$|R
25|$|There is a dam {{known as}} the Bear Valley Dam located on <b>Carbon</b> Run. Spoil <b>piles</b> and {{abandoned}} mining land occupies much of the stream's watershed. In some reaches, the stream flows underground due to infiltration into mine pools, but returns to the surface {{in the form of}} a discharge. An anticlinal known as Anticlinal No. 8 or Red Ridge ends at the valley of Carbon Run.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{investigations}} {{were conducted on}} natural corrosion deposits {{to better understand the}} role of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the accelerated corrosion process of <b>carbon</b> steel sheet <b>piles</b> in port environments. We describe the abundance and diversity of total and metabolically active SRB within five natural corrosion deposits located within tidal or low water zone and showing either normal or accelerated corrosion. By using molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis, and sequence cloning based on 16 S rRNA, dsrB genes, and their transcripts, we demonstrated a clear distinction between SRB population structure inhabiting normal or accelerated low-water corrosion deposits. Although SRB were present in both normal and accelerated low-water corrosion deposits, they dominated and were exclusively active in the inner and intermediate layers of accelerated corrosion deposits. We also highlighted that some of these SRB populations are specific to the accelerated low-water corrosion deposit environment in which they probably play a dominant role in the sulfured corrosion product enrichment...|$|R
40|$|In this study, methane–ethylene jet {{diffusion}} flames modulated by acoustic excitation in an atmospheric environment {{were used to}} investigate the effects of acoustic excitation frequency and mixed fuel on nanomaterial formation. Acoustic output power was maintained at a constant value of 10 W, while the acoustic excitation frequency was varied (f = 0 – 90 Hz). The {{results show that the}} flame could not be stabilized on the port when the ethylene volume concentration (ΩE) was less than 40 % at f = 10 Hz, or when ΩE = 0 % (i. e., pure methane) at f = 90 Hz. The {{reason for this is that}} the flame had a low intensity and was extinguished by the entrained air due to acoustic modulation. Without acoustic excitation (f = 0 Hz), the flame was comprised of a single-layer structure for all values of ΩE, and almost no carbon nanomaterials were synthesized. However, with acoustic excitation, a double-layer flame structure was generated for frequencies close to both the natural flickering frequency and the acoustically resonant frequency. This double-layer flame structure provided a favorable flame environment for the fabrication of carbon nanomaterials. Consequently, the synthesis of carbon nano-onions was significantly enhanced by acoustic excitation near both the natural flickering frequency and the acoustically resonant frequency. At f = 20 Hz (near the natural flickering frequency) for 0 % ≤ ΩE ≤ 100 %, a quantity of <b>carbon</b> nano-onions (CNOs) <b>piled</b> like bunches of grapes was obtained as a result of improved mixing of the fuel with ambient air. High-density CNOs were also produced at f = 70 Hz (close to the acoustically resonant frequency) for 40 % ≤ ΩE ≤ 100 %. Furthermore, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized only at 80 Hz for ΩE = 0 %. The suitable temperature range for the synthesis of CNTs was slightly higher than that for the formation of CNOs (about 600 °C for CNTs; 510 – 600 °C for CNOs) ...|$|R
