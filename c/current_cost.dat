5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

The BBC suggested that the deregulation should be conditional {{on a number of}} further changes to regulation. These included that Ofcom changes the transmission mode of broadcast on all multiplexes from 16QAM to 64QAM so more services could be squeezed onto the digital terrestrial platform.

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{describes}} the assumptions, scenarios and calculations underlying best {{estimates of the}} <b>current</b> <b>costs</b> of three notifiable fish diseases in the United Kingdom: infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haemorrhagic necrosis (IHN). The benefits of avoiding a major disease outbreak are effectively the return on spending to maintain disease free status. <b>Current</b> <b>costs</b> of salmonid disease freedom are {{the costs associated with}} the efforts of control, surveillance and monitoring activities from both the private and public sectors. The simulated effects of disease outbreak and avoidance costs on the public sector, domestic consumers, exporters are analysed and factored to generate estimates of maintaining disease freedom. The estimates of the average <b>current</b> <b>costs</b> of maintaining disease freedom per annum in the study period ranges between £ 13. 5 million to £ 23. 6 million per annum in total for all diseases.

25|$|Select The Preferred Policy – The authors {{suggest that}} the overall best biofuel comes from the {{sugarcane}} in Brazil after comparing the economic & the environmental costs. The <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO2 emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in {{the volume of the}} business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.|$|E
25|$|MTBE, a major {{gasoline}} additive (10% by volume), {{was discovered}} in the city's water wells in August 1995. The MTBE was found almost by accident since it {{was not on the}} list of known contaminants and acceptable level had not been set. The city waters engineers had to research the hazard and they raised the alarm. Within a year all five wells were closed, leading to the loss of 45% of the city's water supply. One well had a concentration of 600 parts per billion, while another rose from 14 parts per billion to 490 parts per billion within a year. The California EPA guidelines now call for no more than 35 parts per billion. The city's well field is in the Charnock Sub-Basin, a small aquifer in Mar Vista, Los Angeles that both Santa Monica and Culver City draw upon. To maintain supply to customers Santa Monica was forced to purchase water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) at a cost of over $1.1 million per year. Cleanup of the site is ongoing at a <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> of $3 million per year, paid for by the responsible parties, principally: Shell Oil Company, Chevron, and Exxon. Following this discovery other water districts began testing that revealed tens of thousands of MTBE pollution cases across the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> {{of living}} {{adjustment}} {{is based on}} the consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely checks the prices of 211 different categories of consumption items in 38 geographical areas to compute 8,018 item-area indices. Many other indices are computed as weighted averages of these base indices. CPI-W is based on a market basket of goods and services consumed by urban wage earners and clerical workers. The weights for that index are updated in January of every even-numbered year. People who say that the CPI-W overestimates inflation recommend updating the weights each month; this produces the Chained Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U). People who say that the C-CPI-U [...] disadvantages the elderly point out that seniors consume more medical care than younger people, and that the costs of medical care have been rising faster than inflation {{in other parts of the}} economy. According to this view, the costs of the things the elderly buy have been rising faster than the market basket averaged to obtain CPI-W, CPI-U or C-CPI-U. Some have recommended fixing this by using a CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E).|$|E

There must be neither companies to fill their own pockets out of it, nor trustees who can cramp the management, or interfere with the officering, or shorten the supplies of it. Put one man of reputation and sense at its head; give him what staff he asks for, and a fixed annual sum for expenditure--specific accounts to be printed annually for all the world's seeing--and let him alone. The original expenditure for building and fitting must be magnificent, and the current expenditure for cleaning and refitting magnanimous; but a certain proportion of this <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> should be covered by small entrance fees, exacted, not for any miserly helping out of the floor-sweepers' salaries, but {{for the sake of the}} visitors themselves, that the rooms may not be incumbered by the idle, or disgraced by the disreputable. You must not make your Museum a refuge against either rain or ennui, nor let into perfectly well-furnished, and even, in the true sense, palatial, rooms, the utterly squalid and ill-bred portion of the people. There should, indeed, be refuges for the poor from rain and cold, and decent rooms accessible to indecent persons, if they like to go there; but neither of these charities should be part of the function of a Civic Museum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A company’s profits may {{be defined}} as the {{positive}} difference between its income revenues and operational costs. Today, most companies use traditional costing methods and/or traditional Activity-Based Costing (ABC) to determine their operational costs with a view to direct operational and business process changes so that profits are realized. A tripartite approach is presented towards determining requirements and specifications of enterprise information systems for profitability (EISP). In the first part, an understanding of the nuances of traditional costing and ABC as is currently practiced in enterprises is presented to point the shortcomings of these <b>current</b> <b>costing</b> practices. The second part provides a case study that vividly demonstrates the problems in the <b>current</b> <b>costing</b> methods and clearly points their inadequacies towards profitability. The third part presents a framework for the specifications of enterprise information systems for profitability through ontology-based enterprise modeling, EABEM and Temporal-ABC for the attainment of improved knowledge about costs. ...|$|R
