5|$|During {{the passage}} from Ceylon, at one o'clock every day, the ships signalled each other their {{longitude}} that they <b>calculated</b> <b>using</b> their chronometers.

5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then <b>calculated</b> <b>using</b> the equationc=λf.|$|E

5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be <b>calculated</b> <b>using</b> general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be <b>calculated</b> <b>using</b> various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius {{approximately}} 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis. Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, <b>calculated</b> <b>using</b> national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|E
