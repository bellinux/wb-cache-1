40|$|In the {{introduction}} to this book, three possible results of a <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> systematic review were described: an intervention {{is found to be}} effective, it is found to be ineffective or harmful, or insufficient evidence is available to determine its effectiveness. This chapter addresses {{the ways in which the}} <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> might inform public health intervention research by iden-tifying the areas where insufficient evidence is found or where there is con-flicting evidence. We also discuss specific measures to improve the quality of intervention research. This chapter is intended to serve as a guide for organ-izations that fund public health intervention research and for researchers themselves. Because the information in this chapter is based entirely on our review process, it is not a comprehensive summary of the entire field of in-tervention research. We hope, however, that it will help a range of organiza-tions set research agendas and contribute to improving research quality. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION RESEARCH In the course of developing the <b>Community</b> <b>Guide,</b> we learned a great deal about the quality of public health intervention research and how it could be improved. This section describes lessons learned that might contribute to the overall public health intervention research agenda. The numerous partners involved in the <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> provided a wide range of insights, ideas, and examples about how their organizations use the <b>Community</b> <b>Guide.</b> These examples serve as the basis for this section.

Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs (Best Practices) and The <b>Guide</b> to <b>Community</b> Preventive Services(The <b>Community</b> <b>Guide)</b> are used to assist with this effort. We examined CCC plans {{to determine the extent to}} which they followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) tobacco control and funding recommendations. MethodsWe obtained 69 CCC plans, current as of August 1, 2011, to determine which CDC recommendations from Best Practices and The <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> were incorporated. Data were abstracted through a content review and key word search and then summarized across the plans with dichotomous indicators. Additionally, we analyzed plans for inclusion of tobacco control funding goals and strategies.

40|$|ContextUncontrolled {{hypertension}} {{remains a}} widely prevalent cardiovascular risk {{factor in the}} U.

Team-based care has the potential {{to improve the quality of}} hypertension management. The goal of this <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of team-based care in improving blood pressure (BP) outcomes. Evidence acquisitionAn existing systematic review (search period, January 198022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cJuly 2003) assessing team-based care for BP control was supplemented with a <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> update (January 200322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cMay 2012). For the <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> update, two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed quality of eligible studies. Evidence synthesisTwenty-eight studies in the prior review (198022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2003) and an additional 52 studies from the <b>Community</b> <b>Guide</b> update (200322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2012) qualified for inclusion. Results from both bodies of evidence suggest that team-based care is effective in improving BP outcomes. From the update, the proportion of patients with controlled BP improved (median increase= 12 percentage points); systolic BP decreased (median reduction= 5. 4 mmHg); and diastolic BP also decreased (median reduction= 1. 8 mmHg). ConclusionsTeam-based care increased the proportion of people with controlled BP and reduced both systolic and diastolic BP, especially when pharmacists and nurses were part of the team. Findings are applicable to a range of U. S. settings and population groups. Implementation of this multidisciplinary approach will require health system 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 clevel organizational changes and could be an important element of the medical home.
