5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
5|$|An {{operations}} plan {{suited for}} {{an attack on a}} small enemy formation was drafted by Ziegler, who was an adviser to Dam and the command staff of the 7th Infantry Division. Ziegler's plan, codenamed Operation Duc Thang I, called for the South Vietnamese to assault Ap Tan Thoi from three different directions: three rifle companies from the 11th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, to move from the north; the Dinh Tuong Civil Guards Regiment to march north from the south in separate columns; and a company of 13 M113 armored personnel carriers with an infantry company on board from the southwest. The M113 carriers and the infantry company could act as both a mobile reserve and a reaction force, so it was positioned where it could be shifted to the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> if the Viet Cong began to retreat. In addition, Dam would also deploy two rifle companies at Tan Hiep airfield, which could be brought to the battlefield by helicopters from the US Army 93rd Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} forces {{set up a}} JOC at Mangula at 09:30 on 19 January with 1 Commando present. A tracking team led by Lieutenant Nigel Henson first made contact around noon on 21 January, when concealed ZIPRA cadres from Gang 2 fired upon them with an RPD machine-gun and AK-47 and SKS rifles. Henson's men withdrew and 1 Commando set up stop points around the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> to contain the guerrillas during the day; night-ambush positions were then set up as darkness fell. The RLI moved up again at dawn {{the next day and}} met the insurgents at 07:30, when a stick of five 1 Commando men led by Lieutenant Bruce Snelgar was sighted in an area of thick bush by three guerrillas from Gang 2. The cadres caught Snelgar's stick by surprise, opening fire with a heavy burst of RPD bullets. Snelgar and Trooper McMaster were wounded and Trooper Anthony Brading was shot dead. In the battle which ensued all three ZIPRA fighters were killed with no further loss to the RLI.|$|E

The cleavage bonds between dimers of SOD during thermal dissociation and type of interactions between specific amino acid residues were also simulated. Two identical <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> between two subunits were identified.

5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E

30|$|The gel {{strength}} {{is dependent on}} the structure of the particle network making up the gel. This can be coupled to the particle concentration of the gel [8]. A gel with a larger particle concentration contains closely packed particles that have plenty of <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> between the particles. These <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> are of critical importance since it is here that the chemical siloxane bonds between the particles are formed. A high amount of <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> therefore lead to a stronger gel. These statements are supported in recent study [65], which showed that the structure of gel is highly dependent on the number of particles.|$|R
40|$|The wheel-rail {{interaction}} {{problem has}} been widely studied {{in the past few}} decades. In this problem, dynamic responses at the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> remain the central issue since they induce damage to the rail over time. In particular, the dynamic responses at the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> between the wheels and rails present difficulties in understanding and mathematical modeling. Even with the computer power one has today, its mathematical modeling employs the versatile numerical analysis method, the finite element method (FEM) remains a formidable challenge due to its extremely small <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> and in turn the extremely high stress levels. In addition, friction at the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> is another challenge in the modeling. These extremely high stress levels and difficulties in modeling friction at the small <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> lead to the simplified analytical and finite element (FE) models available in the literature. However, to-date, these simplified mathematical and computational models are far from satisfactory. Therefore, in the investigation reported here, simplified analytical and FE models are first studied {{in order to understand the}} parameters of the models and to provide a foundation for more detailed studies. In these simplified analytical and FE models, the wheels are treated as traveling point loads. Subsequently, a more detailed FE model employing three-dimensional (3 D) finite elements for the wheel and rail is studied while the computed results are compared with those of the same FE model but with the wheel replaced by the traveling point loads. In this model, frictions at the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> are considered. In parallel, the effect of block dampers on the dynamic responses at the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> is studied. Various configurations of attaching the block dampers to the rail are considered. Conclusions are then drawn from the accuracy and efficacy of replacing the wheels by traveling point loads, and the effect on the dynamic responses of added block dampers to the rail. Advisor: C. W.

25|$|The Coulomb {{approximation}} mathematically {{follows from}} the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over {{a small fraction of}} their overall area, that this <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> (you can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of contact mechanics in the mid-twentieth century may be attributed to names such as Bowden and Tabor. Bowden and Tabor were the first to emphasize the importance of surface roughness for bodies in contact. Through investigation of the surface roughness, the true <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> between friction partners is found to be less than the apparent <b>contact</b> <b>area.</b> Such understanding also drastically changed the direction of undertakings in tribology. The works of Bowden and Tabor yielded several theories in contact mechanics of rough surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The discs are {{commonly}} made from cast iron {{and a certain}} amount of surface rust is normal. The disc <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.|$|E

40|$|To {{research}} the dynamic {{characteristics of the}} joint surfaces from the microperspective, the fractal prediction model of the normal contact damping of joint surfaces is established based on the “solid-gap-solid” contact model which was proposed by the author, tribology theory, and contact fractal theory. And the kinetic model of joint surfaces is improved to a certain extent. The influences of actual <b>contacting</b> <b>area,</b> friction coefficient, and the fractal dimension on the normal contact damping are revealed {{by the research of}} numerical simulation. Simulation results show that the normal contact damping of joint surfaces decreases to a constant value with the increase of actual <b>contacting</b> <b>area,</b> increases with the increase of friction coefficient, and decreases with the increase of fractal dimension. Actual <b>contacting</b> <b>area</b> influences the location of the turning point of the Cn*-μ (critical friction coefficient), and the critical friction coefficient increases with the increase of actual <b>contacting</b> <b>area.</b> Normal damping coefficient of joint surfaces continuously decreases with the increase of fractal dimension and the difference of magnitude exists between normal contact damping coefficients with different fractal dimension values...|$|R

25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal <b>contact</b> <b>area.</b> The linearity between applied load and true <b>contact</b> <b>area,</b> arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this article}} we discuss three aspects of cell contact formation: (a) the {{molecular}} architecture of the cytomatrix in cell-to-substrate focal contacts, (b) the dynamic properties of membrane- and microfilament-associated proteins in the <b>contact</b> <b>areas,</b> and (c) the involvement of microtubules in the coordinated and directed formation of new substrate contacts during cell locomotion. We show that different microfilament-associated proteins exhibit distinct patterns of association with focal contacts: some proteins are specifically associated with focal contacts (vinculin and talin); a-actinin is enriched in the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> but also is present along the stress fibers and in the lamellipodium; actin and filamin are detected throughout the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> but in apparently reduced amounts compared with the associated stress fibers; and tropomyosin, myosin, and spectrin are either absent from the endofacial surfaces of <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> or are present in only very small amounts. Fluorescence photobleaching recovery analyses performed with living cells microinjected with fluorescently labeled actin, vinculin, and a-actinin indicate {{that each of these}} proteins maintains a dynamic equilibrium between a soluble cytoplasmic pool and a membrane-bound fraction.

25|$|New {{models are}} {{beginning}} to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction. Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction.

25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle <b>contact</b> <b>area.</b> Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E
30|$|In {{the fully}} brittle regime, {{stress on the}} fault surface is {{supported}} by small solid-solid <b>contact</b> <b>areas,</b> i.e., ‘asperities’ in the original sense (Dieterich and Kilgore 1994). In this configuration, frictional strength is reduced with increasing pore pressure as expressed by Equation 1 with α[*]=[*] 1 (Figure 8 a). At high temperatures and pressures, solids at the real <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> yield and pore spaces are reduced by dissolution-precipitation processes. This causes an increase in <b>contact</b> <b>areas,</b> which results in a decrease in α and τ 0. The fully plastic deformation regime was associated with tube- or inclusion-like pore geometries (Figure 8 b). In this configuration, direct mechanical effects of pore pressure almost disappeared and an α of approximately 0 was attained. In the modeling presented here, α was changed linearly across the brittle-ductile transition zone (Figure 9 a).|$|R
