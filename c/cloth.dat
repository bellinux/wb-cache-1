40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} foodborne illness {{and the growing}} use of chemical sanitizers in the food industry led the authors to an investigation of alternative, chemical-free methods of sanitizing surfaces using fiber <b>cloths</b> with hot water. The sanitizing performance of kitchen fiber <b>cloths</b> and all-purpose fiber <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 167 degrees F (75 degrees C) was {{compared with that of}} generic <b>cloths</b> such as antibacterial <b>cloths</b> and cleaning <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 167 degrees F (75 degrees C) or chemical sanitizers [...] quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) and hypochlorite. The QAC sanitizer resulted in the lowest overall concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The sanitizing performance of the kitchen fiber <b>cloths</b> was {{similar to that of the}} antibacterial <b>cloths</b> (S. aureus: p =. 144; E. coli: p =. 120) and cleaning <b>cloths</b> (S. aureus: p =. 297; E. coli: p =. 062) sanitized with QAC. Use of the fiber <b>cloths</b> resulted in lower concentrations of bacteria on stainless-steel kitchen surfaces, compared with the use of the generic <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 167 degrees F (75 degrees C). Concentrations of bacteria on the surfaces after use of the all-purpose fiber <b>cloths</b> were similar to concentrations of bacteria after use of the generic <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hypochlorite...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{cleaning}} <b>cloths</b> in food industries has {{been implicated in}} the spread and growth of infective bacteria. Generic <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 750 C and chemical sanitizers such as quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and hypochlorites currently used in food industries were compared with environmentally conscious alternatives such as fiber <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 750 C. The results indicated that concentrations of Staphylococcus meus and Escherichia cofion the fiber <b>cloths</b> were significantly lower than concentrations of bacteria {{on most of the}} generic <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 750 C or a chemical sanitizer. Concentrations of bacteria on the fiber <b>cloths</b> sanitized with hot water at 750 C also were lower than concentrations on <b>cloths</b> sanitized with chemical sanitizers. Concentrations of bacteria on the generic <b>cloths,</b> however, were significantly increased...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of Korean {{wrapping}} <b>cloths</b> (bojagi) in the late Joseon period {{and the types of}} decorations applied to them. Korean wrapping <b>cloths</b> called bojagi are pieces of <b>cloths</b> used by households of all social classes for practical purposes such as wrapping presents and covering food. In addition to the basic purposes, the making of bojagi was also an activity to express the down-to-earth wishes and the satisfaction of creation by the designer. With regard to the decorative feature of Korean wrapping <b>cloths,</b> five types of, patchwork, embroidered, painted, printed, and oiled-paper wrapping <b>cloths,</b> were examined. The patchwork wrapping <b>cloths</b> (jogakbo) show the frugality of Joseon women in addition to the well-developed composition skill of lines and colors. The embroidered wrapping <b>cloths</b> were prepared for special rituals and ceremonies such as weddings. Painted wrapping <b>cloths</b> were decorated with a Chinese-colors technique (called dangchae) or sometimes with black ink painting. For printed wrapping <b>cloths,</b> various sizes of woodblock printings and roller printings were used. Although monotone black ink was the main color applied to the printing, there was also wrapping <b>cloths</b> made from chintz having brilliant fast colors. Oiled-paper wrapping <b>cloths</b> called sikjibo were in use only for covering food. Cut-out work was employed to decorate it...|$|R
40|$|Spectra {{and decay}} time of {{fluorescence}} from dyed <b>cloths</b> were measured under nitrogen laser excitation. The fluorescence spectra and decay time were various for respective dyed <b>cloths.</b> Thus, fluorescence {{results can be}} used to identify dyes on <b>cloths.</b> The identification is possible for <b>cloths</b> dyed with a combination of two dyes and for faded <b>cloths.</b> The advantages of the laser-induced fluorescence method are that it is a non-destructive method and can be applied to weak fluorescent dyes...|$|R
50|$|The dried {{bodies were}} wrapped in various layers of cotton <b>cloths,</b> mostly painted.

5|$|The head is a {{rectangular}} {{section of the}} <b>cloth</b> which is worn at the front. The head section can be at {{the middle of the}} <b>cloth,</b> or placed at one or both ends. The papan inside of the head can be used to determine whether the <b>cloth</b> is kain panjang or sarong.|$|E
5|$|The helm {{on which}} the crest was borne was {{originally}} a simple steel design, sometimes with gold embellishments. In the reign of Elizabeth I a pattern of helm unique to the Royal Arms was introduced. This is a gold helm with a barred visor, facing the viewer. The decorative mantling (a stylised <b>cloth</b> cloak that hangs from the helm) was originally of red <b>cloth</b> lined with ermine, but was altered to <b>cloth</b> of gold lined ermine by Elizabeth.|$|E

50|$|Men {{also contributed}} to the {{endeavor}} by creating drawings that could be transferred to <b>cloths.</b> In the 1960s, missionaries had taught men to draw illustrations for the folktales used in literacy primers. <b>Cloths</b> featuring elaborate and fantastic narratives sold well overseas and production grew. These <b>cloths</b> were not always items to be celebrated and commoditized. Engrained in the fabric of many of these items were horrid memories contained by narratological stylizations, but such containment, as illustrated in nearly all story <b>cloths,</b> never fails to cease at the exact moment of departure for the West.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>cloth</b> is dry, the resist {{is removed}} by boiling or {{scraping}} the <b>cloth.</b> The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist is removed {{the contrast between}} the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern. This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished <b>cloth.</b> At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The <b>cloth</b> woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished <b>cloth</b> in Manchester.|$|E

5000|$|The Jews {{traditionally}} used colour, [...] "And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, {{they made}} <b>cloths</b> of service..." [...] which {{were to be}} used by the priests inside the tabernacle. Since all of the other items made from fabric for use in the tabernacle were made from fine linen {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the <b>cloths</b> of service were also made from linen. (...) Unfortunately, Exodus does not give the dimensions of the <b>cloths,</b> nor does it indicate how or when the <b>cloths</b> were to be used.|$|R
5000|$|Swiffer Sweeper is a {{combination}} sweeper-mop. That is, it can use either dry or wet-type disposable <b>cloths.</b> The wet <b>cloths</b> are for mopping and they have scrubbing strips which are for scrubbing tough dried-on greases. The dry type is for sweeping fine dirt, dust, hair, lint, and more. It was originally known as [...] "Swiffer" [...] {{because it was the}} only product. Originally it had only dry <b>cloths</b> and that one could get refills from numbers of 5 to 64. Wet <b>cloths</b> for mopping were introduced in 2001.|$|R

5|$|In China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Gambia, {{and other}} parts of West Africa and {{southeast}} Asia, patterned silk and cotton fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques in which the <b>cloth</b> is printed or stenciled with starch or wax, or tied in various ways to prevent even penetration of the dye when the <b>cloth</b> is piece-dyed. The Chinese ladao process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include tie-dye, batik, Rōketsuzome, katazome, bandhani and leheria.|$|E
