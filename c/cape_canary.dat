50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>canary</b> is 11-13 cm in length. The {{adult male}} has a green back with black edging to the wing {{feathers}} wings and tail. The underparts, rump and tail sides are yellow, {{and the lower}} belly is white. The rear head and neck are grey, and the face is cinnamon. The female is similar, but with a less grey on the head. The juvenile has greenish-yellow underparts with heavy brown streaking. This species is easily distinguished from the yellow-fronted canary by its lack of black face markings.|$|E
40|$|Temperature and {{rainfall}} {{related to}} altitudinal gradients influence ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to physical factors. In this study, the line transect method was {{used during the}} years 1996 – 2001 to compare resident (potentially breeding) bird communities in three altitudinal divisions in Highveld/Drakensberg grasslands in Lesotho: lowlands (2200 m a. s. l.). In total, 105 resident species were recorded. The total number of species recorded in lowlands was higher than that in highlands and foothills, but this difference was not statistically significant. The highland and foothill {{did not differ in}} numbers of species. A group of five species dominated at all three sites, and the proportion of dominant species in relation to the whole assemblage was very similar. The composition of the dominant group (species with more than 5 % of pairs) and the group of species most often encountered (in more than 80 % of transects) was, however, different. Only two species, <b>Cape</b> <b>Canary</b> Serinuscanicollis and Karoo Prinia Priniamaculosa were dominant in all three study areas, and just one species, the Cape Bunting Emberizacapensis, was dominant in two plots. Similarly, only two species, the Cape Turtle-Dove Streptopelia capicola and <b>Cape</b> <b>Canary</b> had a high frequency of occurrence in all three study areas, and two otherspecies, theKaroo Prinia and Cape Bunting — in two study areas. Simpson’s Diversity Index was strikingly the same (S = 0. 96) for all three avian assemblages (lowland, foothill and highland) investigated. However, proportions of breeding pairs of some congeneric species were found to change with the altitude. The granivores were more common (44 – 45 %) in the foothills and highlands than in lowlands (36 %), while insectivores were more common in the highlands (50 %) than in foothills and lowlands (36 – 37 %). In general, avifauna is relatively diverse and unique in the Highveld/Drakensberg grasslands. Results presented here provide data for further investigation of the effect of the supposed climate warming on the diversity and structure of avian communities...|$|E

30|$|Although {{only the}} list for herpetofauna (except for serpentoid reptiles) could be {{considered}} fairly complete, {{the results indicate that}} the Kamdebooberge has a rich and varied faunal diversity. Among amphibians, Amietophrynus rangeri (Raucous Toad) and Strongylopus grayii (Clicking Stream Frog) are southern African endemics (Minter et al. 2004). Out of the five species of reptiles recorded, two are of high conservation importance. The Afroedura karroica (Karoo Flat Gecko) is endemic to the Sneeuberg range and its immediate surroundings, while Cordylus cordylus (Cape Girdled Lizard) is an Eastern Cape and Western Cape endemic. Pseudocordylus microlepidotus (Cape Crag Lizard) and Trachylepis homalocephala (Red-sided Skink are southern African endemics (Branch 1998). Among the birds recorded, Macronyx capensis (Orange-throated Longclaw) and Serinus canicollis (<b>Cape</b> <b>Canary)</b> are southern African endemics (Hockey et al. 2005). The importance of the Kamdebooberge for raptors-especially as a possible nesting site is evident, particularly for rugged terrain species such as Aquila verreauxii (Verreaux’s/Black Eagle), and from previous sightings of Aquila pennata (Booted Eagle) and Polemaetus bellicosus (Martial Eagle). From a conservation perspective the most important among recorded mammals is the South African endemic Pelea capreolus (Grey Rhebok), given its patchy montane distribution and its population stronghold in the Sneeuberg (Skinner and Chimimba 2005).|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 117 bird species has been {{recorded}} in Sehlabathebe National Park, south-east Lesotho, consisting of 29 vagrants, 18 visitors and 70 breeding and probable breeding residents. For each species status was determined and abundance roughly estimated. Quantitative studies on breeding bird communities were carried out {{by means of the}} line transect method on four transects with the total length ca 30 km in the park and on two transects with the total length of ca 20 km outside the park. In the park, dominant species were represented by the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, Ayres ’ Cisticola Cisticola ayresii, Yellow-rumped Widow Euplectes capensis and Wailing Cisticola Cisticola lais. Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, <b>Cape</b> <b>Canary</b> Serinus canicollis, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Bunting Emberiza capensis and Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi, Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sicklewinged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, Thick-billed Lark Galerida magnirostris, Red-winged Starling Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba Cape Sparrow, Grey-headed Sparrow Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and Golden Bishop Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park, although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this regard...|$|E

We discuss the two contrasting models that have been previously presented for {{the origin of the}} carbon of the oceanic carbonatite source: recycled marine carbonates via subduction vs. primordial carbon.
