50|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> {{messaging}} was technologically {{demonstrated in}} Paris {{for the first}} time in 1997. Some mobile operators use <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> for communicating the area code of the antenna cell to the mobile user (via channel 050), for nationwide or citywide alerting, weather reports, mass messaging, location-based news, etc. Not all operators have the <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> messaging function activated in their network yet, and many handsets do not have the capability to support <b>cell</b> <b>broadcast.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thus, one <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> message {{can reach}} {{a huge number}} of {{terminals}} at once. In other words, <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> messages are directed to radio cells, rather than to a specific terminal. A <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> message is an unconfirmed push service, meaning that the originator of the message does not know who has received the message, allowing for services based on anonymity. Mobile telephone user manuals describe how the user can switch the receiving of <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> messages on or off.|$|E
50|$|Receiving NL-Alert is free. A user {{does not}} have to {{register}} to receive alerts, but may need to configure a device to receive <b>cell</b> <b>broadcasts.</b> Increasingly, mobile phones are pre-configured by their manufacturers to receive <b>cell</b> <b>broadcasts,</b> including NL-Alert, via 2G, 3G and 4G systems.|$|R
30|$|An {{efficient}} {{technique to}} maximize the potential number of devices camping on the fake cell is by advertising the id of the rogue base station based {{on the list of}} neighboring <b>cells</b> <b>broadcasted</b> by legitimate base stations. Note that such information can be extracted from the unprotected downlink broadcast MIB and SIB messages. From the data sniffed from such broadcast messages, one can efficiently tune the transmitted power of the rogue cell as well such that the UEs will handoff to the rogue base station.|$|R
50|$|SMPP {{is often}} used to allow third parties (e.g. {{value-added}} service providers like news organizations) to submit messages, often in bulk, but it may be used for SMS peering as well. SMPP is able to carry short messages including EMS, voicemail notifications, <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcasts,</b> WAP messages including WAP Push messages (used to deliver MMS notifications), USSD messages and others. Because of its versatility and support for non-GSM SMS protocols, like UMTS, IS-95 (CDMA), CDMA2000, ANSI-136 (TDMA) and iDEN, SMPP is the most commonly used protocol for short message exchange outside SS7 networks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> is {{designed}} for simultaneous delivery to multiple users in a specified area. Whereas the Short Message Service-Point to Point (SMS-PP) is a one-to-one and one-to-a-few service (requires multiple SMS messages, as each message can only carry one phone number), <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> is a one-to-many geographically focused messaging service. <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> messaging is also supported by UMTS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> is a {{technology}} that allows a text or binary message to be defined and distributed to all mobile terminals connected {{to a set of}} cells. Whereas SMS messages are sent point-to-point, <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> messages are sent point-to-area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> {{is not as}} {{affected}} by traffic load; therefore, it may be usable during a disaster when load spikes (mass call events) tend to crash networks, as the 7 July 2005 London bombings showed. Another example was during the tsunami catastrophe in Asia. Dialog GSM, an operator in Sri Lanka was able to provide ongoing emergency information to its subscribers, to warn of incoming waves, to give news updates, to direct people to supply and distribution centers, and even to arrange donation collections using Celltick's <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> Center, based on <b>Cell</b> <b>Broadcast</b> Technology.|$|E
50|$|The MTPAS access class may be {{indicated}} on the SIM card or in protected storage on the handset itself, {{by a set}} of numbers in the range 0 - 15 giving a total of 16 flag bits in the Access Control Class Elementary File (EFACC) in a USIM. It is not hierarchical so it can allow level 1 access while disallowing level 6 access. If the 16-bit control word is, 1010-0000-0011-1111 only phones with the MTPAS access level of 1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16 will accept requests for placing a call. The <b>cell</b> <b>broadcasts</b> the Access Control Classes it allows (or bars) in a System Information Block (SIB) message. It {{is important to note that}} the decision whether to permit a call is not made by the cellular network but by the handset itself.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of uplink {{co-operative}} reception with constraints on both backhaul bandwidth and the receiver aperture, or number of antenna signals that can be processed. The problem is cast as a network utility (weighted sum rate) maximization subject to computational complexity and architectural bandwidth sharing constraints. We show that a relaxed version of the problem is convex, and can be solved via a dual-decomposition. The proposed solution is distributed in that each <b>cell</b> <b>broadcasts</b> a set of demand prices based on the data sharing requests they receive. Given the demand prices, the algorithm determines an antenna/cell ordering and antenna-selection for each scheduled user in a cell. This algorithm, referred to as LiquidMAAS, iterates between the preceding two steps. Simulations of realistic network scenarios show that the algorithm exhibits fast convergence even for systems with large number of cells. Comment: IEEE ICC Conference, 201...|$|R

50|$|Cell towers {{frequently}} use a {{directional signal}} to improve reception in higher-traffic areas. In the United States, the FCC limits omnidirectional cell tower signals to 100 watts of power. If the tower has directional antennas, the FCC allows the <b>cell</b> operator to <b>broadcast</b> up to 500 watts of {{effective radiated power}} (ERP).|$|R
40|$|The {{backhaul}} network {{is a critical}} challenge towards the success of 5 G and corresponding difficulties are many-fold, such as network coverage expansion, very high bandwidth, ultra- low latency and energy consumption, at a minimum cost. No single backhaul solution can address all these requirements but, on the other hand, {{not all of the}} backhaul links require the same set of stringent requirements. To this end, we propose a novel scheme that capitalises on the diversity in both performance requirements and backhaul capabilities to maximise the system-centric as well as user-centric performance indicators. The user-centric backhaul provisioning scheme uses multiple attribute decision making (MADM) for the user-cell-backhaul association criteria in a way that intelligently associates users with available cells based on corresponding dynamic radio and backhaul conditions while abiding by users' requirements. Radio <b>cells</b> <b>broadcast</b> multiple bias factors, each reflecting a dynamic performance indicator of the end-to-end network performance such as capacity, latency, resilience, energy consumption, etc. A given user would employ these factors to derive a user-centric cell ranking that motivates it to select the cell with radio and backhaul capabilities that conform to the user requirements. Reinforcement learning is used by the radio cell to optimise the bias factors for each performance indicator in a way that maximises the system performance and users' end-to-end quality of experience (QoE). Preliminary results based on a case study show considerable improvement in users QoE when compared to state-of-the-art user-cell association schemes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractâLocation-based channel access {{protocols}} {{have been}} proposed {{as a means to}} broadcast safety related messages through inter-vehicle communications. The protocols divide the road into fixed-size cells and assign a channel to each <b>cell.</b> To <b>broadcast,</b> a vehicle would use the channel assigned to the cell it is currently traveling within. To improve bandwidth utilization, a vehicle may acquire channels dynamically from adjacent cells that are not occupied by other vehicles. In a TDMA setting where each channel is a time slot, message delay occurs as the vehicle must wait for the arrival of the next time slot it owns. This message delay time depends heavily on the adopted cell-to-channel mapping function. We examine an existed naive channel allocation scheme and proposed three new ones. An analysis shows that the proposed schemes may reduce the delay by 50 % to 90 %. I...|$|R

This work models and considers real-time streaming broadcast for stored-video over the downlink of a single <b>cell.</b> The <b>broadcast</b> capacity of the system subject to dead-line constraints are derived for both uncoded and coded wireless broadcast schemes. Even under the deadline requirements, it is shown in this work that network coding is asymptotically throughput-optimal and can strictly outperform the best non-coding policy by analytically quantifying the optimal capacity when the file size is sufficiently large. A simple network coding policy is also proposed that achieves the asymptotic capacity while maintaining finite transmission delay (queueing + decoding delay). A new temporal-queue-length-based Lyapunov function is used to prove the optimality of this policy.

A WMN-type architecture considered as an alternative for an operator access network must meet similar requirements such as high availability and guaranteed QoS in order to support triple-play content provisioning. In this paper we introduce an architecture of such a Carrier-grade Wireless Mesh Access Network (CG-WMAN). We then present our contribution, an approach to seamlessly integrate unidirectional <b>broadcast</b> <b>cells</b> (i. e. DVB-T) into such a CG-WMAN.

This work models and considers realtime streaming broadcast over the downlink of a single <b>cell.</b> The <b>broadcast</b> capacity of the system subject to deadline constraints are studied for both uncoded and coded wireless broadcast schemes. For the uncoded scenario, an optimal transmission policy is devised based on finite-horizon dynamic programming, and a closed-form expression of the optimal throughput is developed in the asymptotic regime, as the size of the file approaches infinity. For the coded scenario, the optimal capacity in the asymptotic regime of large file size is also derived, which is strictly larger than that of the non-coding policies. A simple transmission policy is proposed that can achieve the asymptotic capacity while maintaining finite transmission delay (queueing + decoding dleay).
