5|$|In 1921, brothers-in-law Rinzō Satake and Shōkō Sasaki {{consulted}} with Kanae {{to develop a}} pastel <b>crayon</b> with an oil binder; development took three years and resulted in the world's first oil pastel, marketed under the name Cray-Pas through the Sakura Color Products Corporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of Dragon Ball Z Kai earned a viewer ratings {{percentage}} of 11.3, ahead of One Piece and behind <b>Crayon</b> Shin-chan. Although following episodes had lower ratings, Kai {{was among the}} top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan {{for most of its}} run.|$|E
5|$|The game {{retains the}} classic pastel / <b>crayon</b> visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are {{noticeable}} — water animation has been improved, the black outlines around objects {{are not as}} thick and the backgrounds are less cluttered; but the visuals are still tightly-centered on those of the SNES game.|$|E

5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey <b>Crayon,</b> Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1802 {{with a series}} of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey <b>Crayon,</b> Gent., serialized from 1819–20. He continued to publish regularly—and almost always successfully—throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video {{recording of the}} murders in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her <b>crayon</b> pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{companies}} to offer up a line of wax <b>crayons</b> aimed for kindergarten use. Located out of New York, NY, it is unclear when this company started producing <b>crayons</b> but based on a known ad from 1881, they clearly offered wax <b>crayons</b> in boxes of 6, 12, and 18 colors.|$|R
50|$|Sharpeners with {{a single}} blade for use on wax <b>crayons</b> are available, and {{sometimes}} included in boxes of <b>crayons.</b> These often have plastic blades, which are adequate for the soft wax.|$|R
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special <b>crayon</b> (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
5|$|After the war Knight {{returned}} to her previous themes of the ballet, the circus and Gypsies, and continued to divide her time between London and Malvern. In 1948 Knight painted backstage at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, mostly observing {{the work of the}} wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions. The same year she painted a large group portrait of Princess Elizabeth and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts of the canvas, the finished painting was not well received. A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in Glasgow, in 1952. The following year Knight {{returned to}} the theatre, painting and producing <b>crayon</b> studies, backstage at the Old Vic in London during the Birmingham Repertory Theatre's production of Henry IV, Part 1 & Part 2. Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of Jean Rhodes, a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked backstage at the Royal Opera House during performances and rehearsals by the Bolshoi Ballet.|$|E
5|$|Irving Blum {{made the}} {{original}} thirty-two canvases {{available to the}} public through an arrangement with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death. However, the original Campbell's Soup Cans is now a part of the Museum of Modern Art permanent collection. A print called Campbell's Soup Cans II is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 200 Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962 (Acrylic on canvas, 72inches x 100inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest single canvas of the Campbell's Soup can paintings. It is composed of ten rows and twenty columns of numerous flavors of soups. Experts point to it {{as one of the most}} significant works of pop art both as a pop representation and as conjunction with immediate predecessors such as Jasper Johns and the successors movements of Minimal and Conceptual art. The very similar 100 Cans from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery collection is shown above. The earliest soup can painting seems to be Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato Rice), a 1960 ink, tempera, <b>crayon,</b> and oil canvas.|$|E
50|$|The Day the <b>Crayons</b> Came Home is a 2015 children's {{book written}} by Drew Daywalt and {{illustrated}} by Oliver Jeffers. The book is a sequel to The Day the <b>Crayons</b> Quit. The book is about <b>crayons</b> who are scattered {{around the world and}} in the house of a boy named Duncan, and how they communicate with him through postcards. The book is a colorful picture book.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, {{tests in}} a {{certified}} asbestos-testing laboratory found the tremolite form of amphibole asbestos in {{three out of}} eight bigger brands of children's <b>crayons</b> that are made partly from talc: Crayola, Prang, and RoseArt. In Crayola <b>crayons,</b> the tests found asbestos levels from 0.05% in Carnation Pink to 2.86% in Orchid; in Prang <b>crayons,</b> the range was from 0.3% in Periwinkle to 0.54% in Yellow; in Rose Art <b>crayons,</b> it was from 0.03% in Brown to 1.20% in Orange. Overall, 32 different types of <b>crayons</b> from these brands contained more than trace amounts of asbestos, and eight others contained trace amounts. The Art and Creative Materials Institute, a trade association which tests the safety of <b>crayons</b> {{on behalf of the}} makers, initially insisted the test results must be incorrect, although they later said they do not test for asbestos. In May 2000, Crayola said tests by Richard Lee, a materials analyst whose testimony on behalf of the asbestos industry has been accepted in lawsuits over 250 times, found two of its <b>crayons</b> tested negative for asbestos. In June 2000, Binney & Smith, the maker of Crayola, and the other makers agreed to stop using talc in their products, and changed their product formulations in the United States.|$|R

50|$|The Art Lesson is semi-autobiographical, {{following}} {{the character of}} Tommy, an enthusiastic painter and drawer. He makes pictures for his relatives and draws on the sidewalk, on bedsheets, and even on walls. For his birthday he gets a box of 64 <b>crayons.</b> But his new first-grade teacher rejects them, and makes him draw {{the same thing as}} everybody else in his class, with a few school <b>crayons</b> and on a single sheet of paper. He makes a bargain with the school Art Teacher: one page for the drawing that the rest of his class is making, with school <b>crayons,</b> and the second for his own <b>crayons</b> and his own art.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of specialty <b>crayons</b> {{beginning in the}} 1970s added {{a number of new}} names to the Crayola lineup, {{but it was not until}} the explosion of new product lines and [...] "fun" [...] alternate names for regular colors in the 1990s that the number of names appearing on Crayola <b>crayons</b> expanded exponentially. Together with the addition of new <b>crayons</b> to the regular packaging, these names create a potentially confusing maze of information, thereby necessitating this list.|$|R
