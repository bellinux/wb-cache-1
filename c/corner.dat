40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the current condition of interest <b>corners</b> and materials used in these <b>corners</b> in pre- school education institutions in Istanbul. The research suits a scanning model which was performed via filling out a survey form created by researchers in 74 pre-school classes of 25 different schools in 12 districts of Istanbul. It was seen in the study, where frequency distribution and percentage calculations were used in statistical analysis, that although playing house, library and music <b>corners</b> were highly available, number of materials used in these <b>corners</b> weren’t sufficient enough. Moreover, we observed that visual-audial, woodwork-joinery and computer <b>corners</b> were rarely used whereas water and sand <b>corners</b> weren’t available in any of the classes. The study has shown that despite materials of art were the most common ones, art <b>corners</b> weren’t the mostly seen <b>corners</b> in the classes. Temporary interest <b>corners</b> like jobs, new year, health and traffic were mostly available but tailoring and writing <b>corners</b> weren’t available in any of the classes.
