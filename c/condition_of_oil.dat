40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} the oil risks and firm attributes that could affect the share prices {{of oil and gas}} companies in Malaysia. Most of the studies conducted in regards to the oil and gas sector takes into account the contributing factors such as the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> futures in NYMEX and focuses on prominent oil exporting and importing countries. In contrast, this paper empirically assesses the dynamics of global, national and company level factors that could influence the share prices of oil and gas listed companies in Bursa Malaysia. This study employed time series and panel data analysis in analyzing Malaysia’s data within the daily duration of June 1 st, 2005 until May 29 th, 2009. The empirical results show that the global oil demand is positively associated to the oil price and that the oil price is positively related to the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> futures traded in Bursa Derivatives. Furthermore, the global oil demand, Bursa Derivatives oil futures, earnings per share and price to book are positively associated while the price to earnings ratio is negatively associated to the share prices of oil and gas companies listed in Bursa Malaysia. The practicality and valuable attribute of the results obtained from the study can be further analyzed by investors and market analysts in gaining {{a better understanding of the}} trading of share prices of oil and gas companies in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|According to {{quantitative}} studies, oil {{seems the}} only natural resource that is robustly linked to civil war onset. However, recent debates on the nexus <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and internal conflict have neglected {{the fact that}} there are a number <b>of</b> peaceful rentier <b>oil</b> states in existence. Few efforts have been made to explain why some oil-exporting countries have experienced civil war while others have not. We thus address this puzzle, by arguing that civil war risks depend on the specific <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> production and how they come to structure state–society relations. Specifically, we expect that states that are either highly dependent on oil or who have problematic relations with oil regions are prone to civil war. However, these risks will be mitigated either when democratic institutions can manage conflicts peacefully or when abundant oil revenues can be spent in such a way as to buy peace. We test this conditional argument by comparing 39 net oil exporters, using a (crisp-set) Qualitative Comparative Analysis – a methodology particularly suited to test conditional relationships in medium-N samples. Our results largely confirm our conditional hypotheses. <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> production are ambiguous, and particular combinations thus explain the onset of civil war.

40|$|Abstract − Assessment {{of power}} {{transformer}} condition {{is very important}} for utilities, to ensure continuous power transmission and power supply. Therefore, different techniques are used for condition assessment, as off-line diagnostics and on-line monitoring. The off-line diagnostics has some time period between consecutive diagnoses, and during that period the condition is unknown. Diagnostic tools in monitoring system usually comprise comparison of values of monitored quantities to preset limits, and alarming if these limits are exceeded. In this way weak diagnostic capabilities are achieved. Therefore, a new diagnosis model for assessment of <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> immersed power transformers was developed. This model is aimed to continuously and automatically diagnose transformer condition. The diagnosis principle is interpretation of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data using several standardized interpretation methods. Then, on the basis of obtained diagnoses an overall diagnosis is inferred using VAC, VEV or VSC inference methods in a similar way as it is done by the human diagnostician. The diagnostic model shows excellent application flexibility, high robustness and significant diagnostic accuracy...|$|E

The dielectric properties of an insulating material change with moisture, ageing and contamination.

PDC measurement technique has gained immense popularity due to its ability to assess the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and paper separately without opening the transformer tank[1].

40|$|The oil-paper {{insulation}} {{in power}} transformers {{is subjected to}} various stresses due to environmental conditions, voltage and fault stresses.

Thus, the life of a transformer can be effectively determined by the life of its paper insulation. When paper degrades, it produces several by-products such as CO, CO 2, and Furans and they migrate to the oil. There has been a growing trend throughout the world to study and estimate the deterioration of insulation strength of paper using such by-products as indicators. There are more direct approaches to obtain indications of paper insulation degradation such as Tensile Strength (TS) and Degree of Polymerization (DP) measurements of paper.
