5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{conductivity}} {{is commonly}} observed in nominally undoped diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. This conductivity {{is associated with}} hydrogen-related species adsorbed at the surface, and it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by annealing or other surface treatments.|$|E

5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary Sudokus (proper puzzles) have {{a unique}} solution. A minimal Sudoku is a Sudoku from which no clue <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> leaving it a proper Sudoku. Different minimal Sudokus can have a {{different}} number of clues. This section discusses the minimum number of givens for proper puzzles.|$|E

5|$|Small {{amounts of}} the {{impurities}} NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate. Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the edge set of H.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|P90 USG:The P90 USG (United States Government) {{model is}} similar to the {{standard}} P90, except the reflex sight housing is aluminium, and the sight has a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight.|$|E

5|$|Shown {{right is}} an X-ray {{structure}} showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS {{was used as}} a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA can be especially problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed.</b> Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} space {{on the surface of}} the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
