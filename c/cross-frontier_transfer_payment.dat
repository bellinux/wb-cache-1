30|$|The {{existing}} literatures mainly {{focus on}} the effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on local financial efficiency. This paper studies the different efficiencies of three kinds of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> systems. In China’s current financial <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system, there are three kinds of transfer payments: tax refund, categorical <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> and condition payment. The proportion of tax refund since the tax reform in 1994 is continually declining while the other two kinds of payment are increasing. It is of great significance to study the effect of structural changes in <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on financial efficiency in order to optimize the form of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and improve the financial funds efficiency. The following structure of this paper is as follows: based on the present literature research, the second part measures the financial efficiency with the SE-DEA model and analyzes the change trend of overall efficiency of fiscal funds. The third part constructs the theory model of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure’s effect on local government’s expenditure behavior and analyzes how the change of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure affect local government fiscal efficiency in the condition of unchanged amount of central <b>transfer</b> <b>payment.</b> The fourth part uses the quantile regression method to empirically test the relationship between <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure and local financial efficiency. The firth part summarizes the conclusions and briefly describes the significance of this study.|$|R

30|$|Under the {{background}} of tax system reform, China has formulated the “methods of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> in transitional period” in 1999. But this <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system, as an incomplete <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system, cannot really reflect the impact of subsidy structure from central to local on the local financial efficiency. Therefore, the empirical research sample is the data after 2000. While after 2012 the local government <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> did not disclose, the empirical research using 2000 ~ 2011 provincial panel data.|$|R
30|$|China’s biased of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> {{system is}} mainly {{reflected}} in two aspects. Firstly, <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> {{from the central}} government to the local government is bias towards wealthier regions. Empirical evidence shows that regions with higher per capita GDP (mainly referring to {{the eastern part of}} China) are likely to receive more <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from the central government than regions with lower per capita GDP (mainly referring to the central and western regions, especially the western region); in short, rich areas get more <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> (Luo and Cao 2006). Such biased <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system is likely to widen the gap between {{the rich and the poor}} and the degree of urbanization between more developed regions and less developed regions. Western China is the region with the smallest per capita GDP and the lowest level of urbanization, and thus, instead of receiving the least amount of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> it should receive a greater proportion; otherwise, the current <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system harms the western regions more than it harms any other region.|$|R
50|$|In Keynesian economics, the <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> {{multiplier}} (or <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> multiplier) is {{the multiple}} by which aggregate demand will increase {{when there is}} an increase in <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> (e.g. welfare spending, unemployment <b>payments).</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>payments</b> are not in the same theoretical category as government spending on goods and services because such payments are not directly injected into a goods market. Instead, the spendable funds are transferred to a member of the public, who then may spend some or all of them. For this reason <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> are analyzed as negative taxes, and their multiplier is usually considered to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (specifically positive rather than negative) from that of taxes.|$|R
30|$|According to the Suggestions Concerning the Reform and Improvement of <b>Transfer</b> <b>Payment</b> from Central Government to Local Government {{endorsed}} by the State Council, local counterpart funds are no longer necessary to special <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> unless the State Council stipulates otherwise. However, {{it must be noted}} that the scattered feature and complexity of special <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> may hinder urbanization.|$|R
30|$|The {{geographic}} information {{is used in}} the local polynomial RD model to analyze the impact of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on urban-rural income gap. In comparison with other research, the executive variable of western geographic boundaries of distance, in a certain sense, captures the relative unobserved factors around the Midwest boundary line, effectively overcomes the endogeneity problem, greatly improves estimation accuracy of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> effect on income gap, and examines the robustness of results and validity of model. The results show that <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> will expand the rural-urban income gap when regulating the equilibrium of regional finance. If most of the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> continues to be used in an urban area or infrastructure by local government to make achievements in short time with neglecting the special care in peoples’ livelihood project, then even the amount of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> funds is huge, and narrowing the income gap between urban and rural would be of no avail. Therefore, in the process of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system reform and improvement, in addition to strictly implementing the “notices on reforming and improving the central’s <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> to local government,” according to the analysis results, policy suggestions are as follows: (1) empirical results show <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> has a significant expanding effect on rural-urban income gap. Central government should adjust the structure of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> to gradually increase the general <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and to improve the degree of freedom of local governments in addressing fiscal expenditure {{and at the same time}} integrating the special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> with the principles of zero growth or little decrease. The increasing capital should show the rural tendency and focus on improving the rural residents of people’s livelihood. The influence mechanism analysis shows that the expanding effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on rural-urban income gap is due to benefit of rural residents being less than that of urban residents. Therefore, it is important to constraint the local government behavior that implements policies of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment.</b> First, government function should change into “public service” and correct bias problem of fiscal expenditure structure. Second, a rural area should be paid attention in financial expenditure, especially in the construction of rural livelihood projects. It should be committed to promoting the equalization of public services in urban and rural areas and to effectively ease the problem of expanding income gap between rural and urban. (2) From a point of view, using efficiency and coverage of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> by local government is to be improved. It is necessary to perfect the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system in a county and establish fiscal expenditure performance accountability.|$|R

30|$|The 1994 {{tax system}} {{gradually}} widens the gap of per capita fiscal income across provinces, but {{the implementation of}} <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> plan since 1995 prevented the gap from widening quicker (Liu 2008). However, the effect of financial <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> is not as obvious, so {{it is necessary to}} improve the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system so that it can play a greater role.|$|R
30|$|Above all, {{this paper}} draws the {{conclusion}} that <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> contributes to the inequality of urban-rural income through the analysis of discontinuity regression of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on income gap between urban and rural. This paper acquires the consistent results of robustness check. In addition, the effective test results verify the feasibility of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on income gap between urban and rural.|$|R
30|$|Among {{these three}} types of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments,</b> since the tax refund is {{relevant}} with growth of local government revenue and central government has no restriction on the capital, the inaccurate budget cannot contribute to the “flypaper effect”. Therefore, it is generally considered that efficiency of tax refund has no different with revenue of local government. However, the large scale of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> contributes to the financial not matching with the responsibility. The categorical <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and condition payment would reduce the effort of local government, which brings the loss of efficiency (Qiao et al., 2006). Especially the condition <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> since the fixed fund is for specified purpose, local government must execute with clear regulations made by the central government. It {{is due to the}} inaccuracy of capital demand, lag of disbursement of funds, as well as dispersion of supervision and management that the “flypaper effect” appears. From the perspective of practical experience, at the beginning of tax reform in the 90 s of last century, <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from central financial to different local government is quite equal. Along with the strategy of western development (1999), revitalizing Northeast (2003), and rise of central China (2005), the proportion of tax refund is decreasing year by year, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> to the backward regions is increasing in order to promote fair. However, the policy effect is not satisfactory, the public expenditure in the backward regions has not been improved significantly, supply of public goods is still insufficient and regional gap of public service is still widening (An and Ren, 2008). Fan and Zhang (2010) found that each 1 % increasing in the proportion of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> would decrease the long-term growth rate by 0.03 %. In addition, in order to improve the efficiency of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> central government begins to cleanup the condition <b>transfer</b> <b>payment.</b> In 2014, the item of condition <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> is compressed from 220 to 150, which is for the purpose of solve the arbitrary of condition <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> abuse of power, corruption and other issues.|$|R
30|$|On the {{relationship}} between <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and financial efficiency, the early public financial theory considers the central <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> and local tax are treated as equal by local government, and the revenue structure of local government does not affect arrangement of local financial expenditure, as well as fiscal expenditure efficiency (Wilde, 1968; Bradford and Oates, 1971;). The “flypaper effect” found {{at the end of}} 1970 shows that higher the proportion of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> in revenue structure of local government, the larger the scale in financial expenditure (Hines and Thaler, 1995; Brennan and Pincus, 1996). Although the “flypaper effect” has no direct relationship with financial efficiency of local government, it has been proved that the financial revenue structure has effect on expenditure behavior of local government. Since the 1990 s, foreign studies focus on the issue of fairness and efficiency of transfer payment: whether the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> can make the local government provide public service more fairly and efficiently (Gamkhar and Shah, 2007). In the literature of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and financial efficiency, the recent empirical studies generally think the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> efficiency is lower than the local tax. Oates (1994) suggests that local government {{pay more attention to the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from higher level of government than local tax revenue, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> efficiency is lower than that of local revenue. Baker et al. (1999) studied the Canadian’s subsidies system changed from unlimited amount to limited amount and found that this changing can improve capital efficiency and conserve spending of local government. Borck and Owings (2003) consider that it is the political reason not the efficiency that plays an important role that contributes the lower efficiency of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> of central government. Albouy (2010) evaluated the efficiency and fairness of federal government fiscal equalization in USA, and suggested that the federal fiscal transfer policy is neither fair nor efficiency, and on the contrary, the problem of inefficiency and lacking of assistance to minority nationalities are aggravated. Bhatt and Scaramozzino (2013) empirically evaluated {{the relationship}} between <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and financial deficit in India and suggested that the fiscal <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> system distorts the incentive status and has a significant positive correlation with government’s fiscal deficit. The domestic studies mainly concern about the equalization effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> (Liu and Jiao, 2002; Ma and Yu, 2003; Guo et al., 2009; Jia et al., 2010). The literature of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> efficiency is little. An (2007) suggested that it was due to unstandardized allocation of payment allocation, lacking of effective supervision and opaque operation that contributes to the low efficiency of financial <b>transfer</b> <b>payment.</b> Qiao et al. (2006) suggested both the categorical grant and condition grant have the moral risk, which reduces local government fiscal effort. Fan and Zhang (2010) study {{the relationship between}} <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> and economic growth and suggested the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> policy is inefficient, which may reduce the potential of economic growth. However, Tang and Wang (2012) suggested that the higher local government depends on central financial <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> the more capital invests to the strong rigidity area of science, education and agriculture, which improves the efficiency of local government finance. The view explains the efficiency of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> is higher than that of revenue from another perspective.|$|R
30|$|After the tax-sharing reform, central fiscal {{revenue was}} {{transferred}} down to local governments in three forms: tax rebates, general-purpose <b>transfer</b> <b>payments,</b> and special purpose <b>transfer</b> <b>payments.</b> 6 The three {{are designed for}} different goals and correspondingly have different intergovernmental authority-accountability features. First, the form of tax rebates is designed to encourage local tax extraction, and the main goal of tax rebates is to balance resistance to the economic reform, especially from developed regions in eastern China. Thus, tax rebates have an unfair effect. In {{the early years of}} the reform, tax rebates increased to almost 80 % of government expenditures, while it remained at the rate of 50 % before 2000, and the majority went to developed regions. Second, the general-purpose <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> was designed to balance expenditure gaps among regions, and it contributed the political effect of achieving social equality and maintaining social stability (Treisman 1999; Wang 2002). The majority of these funds flowed to the western or frontier areas, minority regions, rural areas, and impoverished areas. Third, the form of special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> is unique in its purpose, special distribution mechanism, and practical results. According to economic analyses, special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> are a modification for externality through subsidies to regional marginal revenue and altering relative prices to solve the financial shortage of public goods, especially goods that have strong externality. However, scholars have pointed out that the function of special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> works by political logic (Dixit and Londregan 1998). The profit of special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> belongs to specific regions while the national fiscal system bears the costs; thus, local government may over-apply for special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments.</b> The distributors of special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> make decisions politically rather than economically, so there are a considerable number of inefficient projects (Weingast et al. 1981).|$|R

The <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> were politically charged in provinces that giving more than they received from the federal government.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{we believe}} that <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> should be more {{targeted}} to invest in rural areas, at the same time, the central government should rationalize the structure of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> as soon as possible, and correct the urban bias and structure bias of local fiscal expenditure.|$|R
30|$|After {{revenue-sharing}} system reform, {{the proportion}} of tax refund in fiscal <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> continued to decline, and {{the proportion of}} categorical grant and condition grant is increased. The paper studies how <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure effect fiscal efficiency from the perspective of local financial revenue structure.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the central}} <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> has the double goal of “fairness” and “efficiency” (Zhu, 1997), {{not only the}} “efficiency”, but also the “fairness” {{should be taken into}} consideration. The {{domestic}} literature on <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> having fairness effect (Yin et al. 2007; Jia, 2009) has indicated that tax refund and condition grant is the way of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> that is most unequal. In combined with the results, the policy can be acquired: the categorical grant is conductive to fairness, and tax refund is more conductive to efficiency. But the condition grant has neither fairness nor efficiency. The direction of optimizing the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure is to reduce the proportion of condition grant while increasing that of categorical grant or tax refund.|$|R

40|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>payments</b> {{are a major}} {{component}} of personal income, accounting for almost 17 percent of personal income in 1996 in the U. S. A variety of studies have addressed the relationship between <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> and the producing economy at the national level. However. little empirical research about the issue at the state level has been undertaken. In this study, I pursue a state-level approach to investigate the impacts of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> upon the producing economy as represented by nonfarm earnings. Vector error correction models (VECM) are developed for Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, and Wyoming. One state from each BEA region is selected based on the highest growth rate of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> as a proportion of personal income. The variables used in the models include: the three-month treasury bill rate, GDP, state farm income, state <b>transfer</b> <b>payments,</b> state dividends, interest, and rent, and state nonfarm earnings. Quarterly observations spanning 1969 : 1 to 1997 : 3 are used. ^ Unit root and cointegration tests are conducted prior to estimating the state VECM models. After determining the number of cointegrating vectors, restrictions that reflect the presence of stationary variables in the models are imposed during estimation. Impulse responses based on Cholesky and structural decompositions are obtained through the lag of sixteen quarters. Finally, a bootstrap resampling strategy is used to generate confidence bounds for the impulse responses from the models. ^ Both the Cholesky and structural decomposition results show a mix of positive and negative impacts upon nonfarm earnings from <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> across the eight states. According to the empirical confidence bounds, the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> impacts are significant only in South Carolina and Wyoming. Thus, the overall tone of the impact of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> is weak if the confidence bounds are strictly relied upon. As expected, there are some differences in the impulse responses patterns provided by the Cholesky and structural decompositions. However, both approaches generally show that GDP and nonfarm earnings (own shocks) have strong impacts upon state economies. ...|$|R
30|$|The current {{literature}} {{in this area}} mainly takes the residents of metastatic income as the breakthrough point and analyzes the direct regulating function of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> in income distribution (Wang and Caminada 2011; Albouy 2012; etc.). However, the transfer income contains not only the direct central subsidies but also the subsidies from local levels. In fact, the local governments rely heavily on the higher <b>transfer</b> <b>payment.</b> From the perspective of local government implementing the <b>transfer</b> <b>payments</b> purely, research {{on the role of}} income redistribution of higher levels could be focused on, but such studies are rare. The {{current literature}} can be divided into three categories: first is the research about <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> with the policy target on resident income. Meng (2013) evaluates the policy effect of “ 8 - 7 poverty assistance,” estimates with the income of national poverty county as the breakpoint, and suggests that the poverty county farmers’ income significantly increase by 38 %. From the perspective of poverty gap in county farmers, the poverty alleviation policy and poverty subsidies are still not effective (Yao and Wang 2009; Park and Wang 2010). Second is the research on the effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> structure on regional income. Lu and Chen (2012) used the method of marginal revenue analysis and found that the general <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> subsidies benefit the poor area more while the failure of equitable distribution is possible in the marginal benefit distribution of special <b>transfer</b> <b>payments.</b> Third is the research on the effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on local government behavior. Wagener (2000) found externality existed in the implementation of central policy by local government through the theoretical model, which has an effect on policy implementation. He and Dong (2015) suggested that the <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> played an incentive effect on improving people’s livelihood based on residents’ happiness maximization to analyze the mechanism of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on expenditure behavior. Zeng and Hu (2009) theoretically analyzed the fiscal system in China and suggested that the central, provincial, and municipal government expenditure have urban bias, which makes the country and township governments with the financial difficulties have to take the responsibility of providing public goods and to strengthen the urban-rural income gap. Due to the asymmetric information, Yin and Zhu (2011) found {{that as a result of}} a government pursuing economic growth rate rather than the welfare of the residents, the public service-oriented government had financial expenditure bias deviating from the goal of construction. Important progress has been made in the current literature, and shortcomings still exist, such as first, the model design in the empirical analysis of the current related research still has the endogeneity problem of the urban and rural residents’ income in the implementation of <b>transfer</b> <b>payments.</b> Due to the interference of other factors, the consistent estimates are difficult to be obtained, which reduces the credibility of conclusions and policy recommendations. Second is that the policy evaluation of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> is focused on the poverty alleviation to farmers’ income, which makes it necessary to verify the different effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> on income gap between urban and rural areas. Third is that manipulation is possible in making the residents’ income as the breakpoints, and it is necessary to verify the empirical results with the strong exogeneity of instrumental variables. Fourth is that the current literature about the urban and rural income gap is based on the national or provincial level; the county level is still to be further studied.|$|R
