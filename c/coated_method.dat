40|$|International audienceWe have {{designed}} a convenient, specific, sensitive and continuous lipase assay {{based on the}} use of natural triacylglycerols (TAGs) from the Aleurites fordii seed oil which contains α-eleostearic acid (9, 11, 13,cis,trans,trans-octadecatrienoic acid) and which was coated in the wells of microtiter plates. The coated TAG film cannot be desorbed by the various buffers used during the lipase assay. Upon lipase action, α-eleostearic acid is liberated and desorbed from the interface and then solubilized into the micellar phase. Consequently, the UV absorbance of the α-eleostearic acid is considerably enhanced due to the transformation from an adsorbed to a water soluble state. The lipase activity can be measured continuously by recording the variations with time of the UV absorption spectra. The rate of lipolysis was monitored by measuring the increase of OD at 272 nm, which was found to be linear with time and directly proportional to the amount of added lipase. This microtiter plate lipase assay, based on coated TAGs, presents various advantages as compared to the classical systems: (i) coated TAGs on the microtiter plates could be stored for a long-time at 4 °C, (ii) higher sensitivity in lipase detection, (iii) good reproducibility, and (iv) increase of signal to noise ratio due to high UV absorption after transfer of α-eleostearic acid from an adsorbed to a soluble state. Low concentrations, down to 1 pg mL(- 1) of pure Thermomyces lanuginosus or human pancreatic lipase, could be detected under standard assay conditions. The detection sensitivity of this <b>coated</b> <b>method</b> is around 1000 times higher as compared to those obtained with the classical emulsified systems. This continuous high throughput lipase assay could be used to screen new lipases and/or lipase inhibitors present in various biological samples...|$|E

40|$|The present Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} the {{hydrogen}} production via a novel process involving a biogas autothermal reforming (ATR) unit with {{the adoption of a}} catalytic wall-flow filter located downstream from the ATR processor to effectively filter and in-situ gasify the carbon emissions eventually generated. This work was aimed to produce 50 Nm 3 /h of green hydrogen from the ATR of a model biogas (60 : 40 Vol ratio) by using catalytic structured supports. Moreover, a solution for the eventual carbon formation during the biogas ATR was addressed. A nanostructured delafossite catalyst to ensure the gasification of soot in absence of O 2 was synthesized. In addition, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a techno-economic analysis for the hydrogen production from biogas were also carried out. Concerning the identification of the suitable support structure to improve the coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions during the hydrogen production from biogas ATR, homogenous SiSiC lattices composed of Cubic, Octet and Kelvin cells and the Conventional Foam structure coated with Ni based catalysts doped with noble metals were investigated. The different catalytic geometries were tested using a model biogas composed of clean methane and carbon dioxide (60 : 40 Vol ratio) with a steam to carbon ratio (S/C) fixed at 2. 0. The effect of the space velocity, inlet temperature and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) on methane conversion and hydrogen yield were studied for each catalytic support. The O/C ratios evaluated was equal to 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2. Space velocity (GHSV) values from 2000 to 20000 h- 1 in standard conditions (equivalent to 5000 - 85000 h- 1 in operating conditions), and, inlet temperatures of 500, 600 and 700 °C were employed. The combined effect of chemical reaction and some properties and parameters such as: pressure drop and specific surface area on the steady-state performances of an adiabatic reactor at high flow rates has been analyzed. ASPEN simulations were performed to calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium at the different boundary conditions to validate the data and to determine the hydrodynamic properties. This study has demonstrated that the rotated cubic cell support shows the best performance in transforming the biogas into hydrogen with high CH 4 conversion (< 95 %) and an H 2 yield higher of 2. 1 using an O/C ratio of 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2, S/C ratio of 2 and GHSV of 20000 h- 1. Besides, this support can ensure a high reliability of the ATR process due to its lower pressure drop (6 - 40 Pa/m) with the lower specific surface area comparing to the other structures tested. The conventional foam has presented also good performances for all the GHSV values in terms of CH 4 conversion but it is less selective for hydrogen production. With respect to the catalyst for gasification of carbon in a reducing atmosphere (H 2, CO, H 2 O, CO 2), nano-materials based on transition metal were synthesized via a solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. LiFeO 2 catalyst was selected as the most promising candidate for the soot gasification catalyst on the soot trap application close coupled to the ATR reactor for syngas post-treatment process. Afterwards, some issues in mixed atmosphere, i. e., when simultaneous carbon gasification with CO 2 and steam in the presence of H 2 and CO take place, were studied. It was demonstrated that the carbon gasification is inhibited during an isothermal reaction at 650 °C for 40 minutes when CO and H 2 are used as co-reagents. But even in these extreme reduced conditions, the LiFeO 2 -catalyst gasified 32. 9 % of the initial carbon, compared to 8 % for the non-catalytic case. when H 2 is used as co-reagent in the steam carbon gasification, the reaction is inhibited, the carbon conversion decreases from 73. 1 % to 46. 6 %. Analogously, when CO is a co-reactant in the carbon gasification with CO 2, the reaction is inhibited, the soot conversion declines from 70. 2 % to 31. 6 %. However, it was observed that in mixed atmosphere gasification reactions, when CO 2 and H 2 O simultaneously reacts with carbon, there is a passive combination of steam and carbon dioxide in the gasification reaction. This means that the two gases operate on separated active sites without influencing each other. LiFeO 2 was also coated on the monoliths (15 / 20 μm mean pore size and 45 % porosity) and the coated filters' performance was evaluated during the soot particles loading. The pressure drop across the filters was very low (< 8 mbar) during loading showing that the applied <b>coated</b> <b>method</b> on the filters was successfully. On the other hand, the catalytic filter coupled with the rotated cube cell was tested at the pilot plant to examine their interaction, the effect of the coating method and the penalty in pressure drop of all system. A pressure drop of 0 - 68 mbar obtained during the test proves that the coating method did not alter the operation of the plant. As for testing at the demonstration plant, firstly, a monolith (Rh/Pt) was tested close coupled with an uncoated filter using an O/C ratio from 0. 9 to 1. 3, S/C ratio equal to 2. 0, an inlet temperature (Tin) of 450 °C with a GHSV from 5000 to 14000 h- 1. The overall result fully agrees with the prediction from the simulation. The thermodynamic equilibrium was reached during the testing time with a methane conversion of 98 % and hydrogen yield of 2. 0. Moreover, tests with the integration of the catalyzed conventional foam and the catalytic trap downstream of the reforming reactor were performed. The boundary conditions were a space velocity of 4000, S/C= 2 and O/C= 1. 1. A thermodynamic equilibrium and a methane conversion higher than 98 % were achieved. The plant was able to reach the predicted conversions and concentrations at nominal capacities corresponding to 50 Nm 3 /h (100 Kg/day) of pure hydrogen, creating a negligible pressure drop during the operation time of the processor. Finally, this thesis also deals with a comparative LCA of three different hydrogen production process from biogas. The investigated processes are: the biogas ATR, the biogas steam reforming (SR) and the water hydrolysis (a biogas-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE) followed by an electrolyzer). They were compared using environmental (GWP) and energetic (GER) impacts in order to highlight their weaknesses and strengths. H 2 from biogas ATR has been demonstrated to be the most promising process in terms of the emissions reduction and energetic efficiency considering its life cycle from the extraction and processing of raw materials to the production of high purity hydrogen. The ICE + Electrolyzer process require a large amount of energy and biogas to sustain the electrochemical reactions. This feature makes such system the least energetically efficient with the most negative environmental impact. With a process efficiency of 65 %, 63 % and 25 % for ATR, steam reforming and electrolysis process, respectively. Lastly, the economic analysis was performed to evaluate the H 2 final cost. On the one hand, {{it was found that the}} process is economically favorable for H 2 production higher than 100 Nm 3 /h. On the other hand, in 10 years of amortization using this technology, the final cost for H 2 production of 100 Nm 3 /h from biogas is 3 €/Kg H 2, lower than the European target (5 €/kg H 2).

40|$|In {{all fields}} of {{wildlife}} research and management, fundamental biodiversity and species distributional data are required. Yet, the difficulty that wildlife researchers face detecting small and cryptic species, in particular snakes and lizards (squamates), {{has led to}} gaps in fundamental knowledge. The lack of fundamental ecological data limits our understanding about the role many squamates perform in ecosystems and diminishes our ability to manage potential threats. Indeed, the dearth of squamate data is so pervasive that the global threat to squamates in 2015 could not be assessed. This situation is of great concern since squamates are a particularly speciose vertebrate group. Collecting fundamental data on squamates is ordinarily achieved with capture, trapping, or visual encounter methods. These methods are often costly, since researchers need {{to remain in the}} field for protracted periods, and are ethically questionable due to direct and indirect impacts on target and non-target fauna. Thus, developing survey methods that can effectively, efficiently, and ethically provide fundamental data are paramount for squamate research and management. 	The most direct solution to ameliorate data deficiency is to improve detection methods and the most direct solution to improve detection methods is to adopt new technologies. In recent decades camera-traps have become a valuable tool for monitoring mammals, fish, {{and to a lesser extent}} birds. For example, camera-traps are both more effective and more cost-effective than labour-intensive methods, such as live-trapping, for detecting numerous mammal species. However, the use of camera-traps to monitor squamates hitherto has been limited. While camera-traps have real limitations, their use for detecting squamates has been limited due to misconceptions about camera-trapping technology. It might be that camera-traps are as useful for monitoring squamates as they have been for other taxa, but considerable research might be required to develop an effective method. Hence, this thesis addresses the following question: Is camera-trapping a cost-effective and ethical method for monitoring terrestrial squamates? 	As camera-traps had not been used to monitor a squamate assemblage, a suitable method needed to be developed. The method would need to detect the range of squamate species occurring in an area, including small species (snout-vent length ≤ 50 mm), and generate ecologically meaningful data. By reviewing how camera-traps function at a technical level, and assessing attempts to use camera-traps for detecting ectothermic species, the Camera Overhead Augmented Temperature (<b>COAT)</b> <b>method</b> was developed. The <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> positions the camera-trap so as to take overhead images of squamates as they pass under the camera-trap. In the first field trial, the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> detected the majority of squamate and mammal species known to occur on the study area. Detections included small squamates with a SVL ≤ 50 mm. Most species could be identified to species-level, and several species could be identified to individual-level. While the results were encouraging, the pilot study did not address the main question of the thesis. 	With development of the <b>COAT</b> <b>method,</b> the next logical step was to compare the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> to existing standard squamate-survey methods to assess whether camera-traps were effective. As a first comparison, the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was compared to cage and Elliott traps and artificial refuges. These labour-intensive methods had been used on the study area since 2011 as part of a long-term monitoring program. The <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was found to be more effective and more cost-effective than the labour-intensive methods for detecting squamates and mammals simultaneously, and mammals alone. The <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was no more, but importantly, no less effective than the labour-intensive methods for detecting squamates alone. There was weak evidence that the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was more cost-effective than the labour-intensive methods for squamates alone. Importantly, given that several mammal and squamate individuals perished in the labour-intensive <b>methods</b> survey, the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was ethically superior. 	Despite the encouraging results, six aspects of Version 1 of the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> were identified as areas requiring improvement or further analysis. Three aspects related to the instrument (i. e., camera-trap) and three related to the concentration methods. To improve the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> the time-lapse trigger, a more sensitive passive infrared (PIR) trigger, and adjusted camera focal length were examined. Both the time-lapse trigger and more sensitive PIR trigger increased squamate detections. Unfortunately, regardless of sensitivity the PIR sensor resulted in biased detections, which the time-lapse trigger did not. It was also revealed that by adjusting the camera’s focal length all squamates, including small species, could be identified to species-level. Thus, the second version of the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> dictated that both time-lapse and PIR triggers be used simultaneously, and camera focal length be adjusted. 	When first designed, two concentration methods were included in the <b>COAT</b> <b>method.</b> Bait, specifically peanut butter and oats, was included to attract mammals, and drift fences were included to channel fauna to the detection zone. Additionally, a cork floor tile was positioned in the detection zone of the camera-trap. It was included to create a thermal contrast between fauna and the background substrate, necessary for the camera-trap to trigger. However, the tile appeared to function as a concentration method. While inclusion of each component was logical, their effects on squamate detections were not empirically tested. Thus, three further field experiments were conducted. The presence of bait and drift fences did not affect squamate detections. Both the presence and material of the tile affected squamate detections. Whether the tile functioned as a concentration method was not clear and could not be explored within the scope of this thesis. Although these experiments did not directly improve the <b>COAT</b> <b>method,</b> they deepened the understanding of how the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> functions, and highlighted future research directions. 	Given the improvements made to the <b>COAT</b> <b>method,</b> a final comparison was required to provide a definitive answer to the main question of the thesis. The <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was compared to artificial refuges and pitfall traps. Version 2 of the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> was both more effective and more cost-effective than the labour-intensive methods examined for inventorying the squamate assemblage. More squamate species on average were detected per transect with camera-traps than with artificial refuges or pitfall traps. Over the entire survey, all 10 squamate species were detected with camera-traps, yet only seven and six squamate species were detected with artificial refuges and pitfall traps respectively. Again, camera-traps had less impact upon fauna as several squamates and amphibians perished in pitfall traps. With this final comparison, the central question of the thesis could be confidently answered in the affirmative. 	Development of the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> has several important implications. First, this is the first camera-trapping method that can be used to monitor a squamate assemblage. This provides wildlife researchers with a new tool to address both existing and new types of questions. Camera-traps have been used to great effect in mammology, and the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> should provide herpetologists those same benefits. Second, by being more cost-effective, the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> will save precious research funds and should increase data collection overall. Lastly, the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> detects both squamates and mammals simultaneously. Wildlife researchers currently using camera-traps to monitor small-mammals can use the <b>COAT</b> <b>method</b> and include squamates as target fauna. Results from this research are encouraging and provide a critical first chapter in how camera-traps can be utilised to monitor squamates...|$|R

50|$|Reverse {{roll coating}} is a roll-to-roll <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> for wet coatings. It is {{distinguished}} from other roll <b>coating</b> <b>methods</b> by having two reverse-running nips. The metering roll and the applicator roll contra-rotate, with an accurate gap between them. The {{surface of the}} applicator roll is loaded with an excess of coating prior to the metering nip, so its surface emerges from the metering nip with a precise thickness of coating equal to the gap. At the application nip, the applicator roll transfers all of this coating to the substrate, by running {{in the opposite direction}} to the movement of the substrate, wiping the coating onto the substrate.|$|R

40|$|Bioprosthetic {{heart valve}} {{replacements}} often calcify and fail, particularly when {{used to treat}} pediatric patients. Even recent advances in processing methods have been insufficient to completely address the risk of complications in the pediatric population. Fully synthetic tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV) replacements have been suggested as an ideal replacement, {{as they can be}} seeded with autologous cells to form a viable tissue that is capable of somatic growth and hemostasis. However, this technology is still in development, and will not be available to patients within a short (5 - 10 year) time period. In the interim, some studies have investigated <b>coating</b> <b>methods</b> for current valve replacements to try to improve their biocompatibility in the short term. However, many of these proposed mechanisms face many regulatory issues because of the processing steps involved. In this work, we investigated the characteristics of pediatric valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and their comparability to a potential surrogate cell source, dermal fibroblasts, for long-term TEHV development. We found that these cells behave similarly, particularly when cultured on collagen type I substrates. This study provides additional guidance for the development of TEHVs specifically for pediatric patients and expands current knowledge about pediatric VICs, a previously understudied cell population. The next studies focused on advancing short-term solutions for biocompatibility in bioprosthetic heart valve replacements. Due to the individual variability and difficulty analyzing bioprosthetic tissue, a model surface was developed to aid the optimization of surface <b>coating</b> <b>methods</b> for tissue valves. The bioprosthetic valve surface model (BVSM) was shown to have comparable surface mechanical properties, residual toxicity from glutaraldehyde fixation, and content of reactive groups for surface coating. Additionally, the BVSM was easy to construct, highly reproducible, and allowed for fine-tuning of the surface characteristics which could be altered for future studies of cellular interactions with the surface. In general, the BVSM developed in this work can be applied to optimize and analyze surface <b>coating</b> <b>methods</b> quickly and easily and to answer questions related to cell behavior in response to the surface coatings. Finally, the BVSM was applied in a final study to optimize our proposed two-step surface <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> for bioprosthetic heart valve replacements. This two-step <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> involves non-toxic, mild reactants and conditions which create a thin, polyethylene glycol (PEG) -based hydrogel coating on the surface. This coating can also include other molecules of interest without changes to the reaction protocol. Through the optimization on the BVSM, we demonstrated the formation of a thin, continuous surface coating that successfully repelled protein adsorption and did not significantly affect the BVSM surface mechanical properties. Based on this success, the <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> was translated directly to bioprosthetic tissue samples. Results showed areas of coating formation of the coating on the tissue, confirmed by both SEM and XPS analysis, and that the areal coverage of the coating could be improved with an increase in catalyst concentration. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this proposed <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> for modifying the surface of bioprosthetic heart valve tissue, which could improve the biocompatibility of these devices. In future studies, this coating can be easily modified with molecules to encourage in situ endothelialization for even better hemocompatibility, particularly for pediatric patients. The cell characterization, optimization tools, and <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> developed here could lead to breakthroughs in current device biocompatibility and will support the long-term development of TEHVs as an ideal pediatric valve replacement...|$|R

Three main parameters {{have been identified as}} major influences on the spray coating processes. These are nozzle to substrate distance, solvent and mixed solvents effects, and substrate temperature and annealing treatment. Such spray coating techniques show great potential for large scale production, since these methods have no limitation in substrate size and low utilization of polymers which is promising to substitute the conventional spin <b>coating</b> <b>methods.</b> Currently available printing and <b>coating</b> <b>methods</b> are also briefly discussed in this review...|$|R

30|$|It {{was also}} {{observed}} that dip <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> tends to produce uniform layer of titania {{on the outer}} surface of pumice, whereas solvent evaporation method was apparently capable to deliver titania deeper into internal part of pumice. In this case, shading effect might be encountered for the product of solvent evaporation method, making its photodegradation performance slightly lower than the one of dip <b>coating</b> <b>method.</b> The outcomes of this result suggest that both dip coating and solvent evaporation method could be optimized to produce a promising technology {{for the elimination of}} organic pollutants, such as phenol. However, it still needs further improvement and study to find the optimal conditions for the photodegradation system to bring out products which can eliminate waste effectively and efficiently.|$|R
30|$|The {{products}} of dip <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> had slightly lower catalyst detachment level than the {{products of}} the solvent evaporation method. This might be attributed to the homogen layer of immobilized titania, which dip <b>coating</b> <b>method</b> could generate, thus making the immobilized titania better able to withstand the external disturbance. On the other hand, for solvent evaporation method, the immobilization process of titania would be random, which gave the possibility for titania to form aggregates on the pumice surface (see Fig.  6 c, d). In this case, those aggregates {{would not be able to}} hold up against extreme disturbance, making the outer immobilized photocatalyst to detach rather easily. However, the difference between the mechanical strength of those two products is considerably small.|$|R
