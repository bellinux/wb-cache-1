The model {{presented in this paper}} helps make capacity planning decisions on the combination of open operating rooms (ORs) and estimated overtime to satisfy the allocated OR time to each specialty. The model combines both decisions on determining the amount of OR time to open and to allocate to different surgical specialties. The decisions made are based on OR costs, overutilization and underutilization costs, and <b>contribution</b> <b>margins</b> from allocating OR time. The results show the importance of having a good estimate of specialty usage of OR time to determine the amount of needed capacity and highlighted the tradeoff that the OR manager faces between opening more ORs versus extending the working time of the ORs already in use.

However, anti-trust law has never precisely defined the term “monopoly”, which makes evaluating the interactions between the prohibition of monopoly and encouraging competition increasingly challenging. In 2006, the Hong Kong Government appointed Arculli 2 ̆ 6 Associates Solicitor Firm to study issues relating to competition in the auto-fuel retail market in Hong Kong. A test based on <b>contribution</b> <b>margins</b> was recommended, leading to the conclusion that price fixing is not a crime in the industry.

40|$|Abstract Background Due to a {{continuing}} age {{shift in the}} German society hospital providers {{are concerned about the}} additional costs associated with the treatment of elderly patients. It is not clear if cardiac catheterization in aged patients leads to higher resource utilization and if DRG-revenues do compensate for this factor. Methods Procedure-related and administrative data of all patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at a tertiary heart center between 2007 and 2011 were collected and analyzed. Then a profitability analysis was performed by comparing the case related variable costs with the Diagnosis-related group (DRG) per case revenues. A particular emphasis was placed on a comparative analysis of identical clusters of procedures. Results The most frequently performed catheterization procedure (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0091800) was associated with significantly higher material expenditure in very old patients (1782 ̆ 00912 ̆ 00948 2 ̆ 0 ac) than in old (1712 ̆ 00912 ̆ 00928; p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 001) and young patients (1722 ̆ 00912 ̆ 00939; p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 046). Furthermore, radiation time and the length of hospital stay were increased in very old patients (3. 52 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0093. 80 min and 6. 22 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0094. 80 days) compared to old (2. 72 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0092. 80 min and 4. 62 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0093. 80 days; p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001) and young patients (2. 52 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0092. 50 min and 4. 52 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0093. 90 days; p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001). Due to higher DRG revenues very old patients achieved higher absolute <b>contribution</b> <b>margins</b> (20652 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0091033 2 ̆ 0 ac) than old (18042 ̆ 00912 ̆ 0091902 2 ̆ 0 ac; p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001) and young patients (17712 ̆ 00912 ̆ 009902 2 ̆ 0 ac; p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001). However, the <b>contribution</b> <b>margins</b> per day were significantly smaller (4402 ̆ 00912 ̆ 009226 2 ̆ 0 ac) than those in old (4882 ̆ 00912 ̆ 009234 2 ̆ 0 ac; p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 001) and young patients (4842 ̆ 00912 ̆ 009206 2 ̆ 0 ac; p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 001). Conclusions Catheterization of very old patients is related to lower <b>contribution</b> <b>margins</b> per day despite higher material and time expenditures.

Hospital administrators have consequently focused their attention towards maximizing OR profitability, and thereby hospital profitability, through <b>contribution</b> <b>margins.</b> This focus, in addition to the boom in demand for elective surgery, has led to a rapid growth of OR facilities. Historically, nurses have been chiefly responsible for the daily functioning of the surgical suite. Increasingly, facilities are hiring a physician medical director for the OR, as represented by a surgeon, anesthesiologist, or both. In some instances, all three branches of surgery, anesthesia, and nursing will be represented in the daily OR management infrastructure. By working collegially, these three fields can mobilize all resources necessary to maximize OR productivity. Because medical needs and regulatory requirements are constantly changing, the concept of appointing a medical director in the OR, an operating room manager, has gained acceptance.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveManagement {{of lower}} {{extremity}} arterial disease with endovascular intervention {{is on the}} rise. Current practice patterns vary widely across and within specialty practices that perform endovascular intervention. This study evaluated reimbursement and costs of different approaches for offering endovascular intervention and identified strategies to improve cost-efficiency. MethodsThe medical records of all patients admitted to a university health system during 2005 for an endovascular intervention were retrospectively reviewed. Procedure type, setting, admission status, and financial data were recorded. Groups were compared using analysis of variance, Student t test for independent samples, and χ 2. ResultsA total of 296 endovascular interventions were completed, and 184 (62 %) met inclusion criteria. Atherectomy and stenting were significantly more costly when performed {{in the operating room}} than in the radiology suite: atherectomy, $ 6596 vs $ 4867 (P =. 002); stent, $ 5884 vs $ 3292, (P <. 001); angioplasty, $ 2251 vs $ 1881 (P =. 46). Reimbursement was significantly higher for inpatient vs ambulatory admissions (P <. 001). Costs were lowest when the endovascular intervention was done in the radiology suite on an ambulatory basis and highest when done as an inpatient in the operating room ($ 5714 vs $ 12, 278; P <. 001). <b>Contribution</b> <b>margins</b> were significantly higher for inpatients. Net profit was appreciated only for interventions done as an inpatient in the radiology suite. Reimbursement, <b>contribution</b> <b>margins,</b> and net profit were significantly lower among private pay patients in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting. The 30 -day hospital readmission after ambulatory procedures was seven patients (6 %). ConclusionsPractice patterns for endovascular interventions differ considerably. Costs vary by procedure and setting, and reimbursement depends on admission status and accurate documentation; these dynamics affect affordability. Organizing vascular services within a hub will ensure that care is delivered in the most cost-efficient manner. Guidelines may include designating the radiology suite as the primary venue for endovascular interventions because it is less costly than the operating room. Selective stenting policies should be considered. Contracts with private insurers must include carve-outs for stent costs and commensurate reimbursement for ambulatory procedures, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT; American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) coding must be proficient to make ambulatory endovascular interventions fiscally acceptable...|$|R

The ®rm faces uncertain product demand and has the option to dynamically readjust its resource investment levels, thereby changing the capacities of its linear manufacturing process. The cost to adjust a resource level either up or down {{is assumed to be}} linear. The model developed here explicitly incorporates both capacity investment decisions and production decisions, and is general enough to include reversible and irreversible investment. The product demand vectors for successive periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. The optimal investment strategy is determined with a multi-dimensional newsvendor model using demand distributions, a technology matrix, prices (product <b>contribution</b> <b>margins),</b> and marginal investment costs. Our analysis highlights an important conceptual distinction between deterministic and stochastic environments: the optimal investment strategy in our stochastic model typically involves some degree of capacity imbalance which can never be optimal when demand is known.

Some suggestions are made for improving {{the usefulness of the}} relevant cost approach. The production planning and control function can provide some of the information that is required for calculating the relevant costs involved in a particular order acceptance decision. This information concerns capacity cost behaviour to calculate incremental costs and planned capacity utilization to calculate opportunity costs.

Often considered the pinnacle of the revenue management process, optimization is about evaluating multiple options on how to sell your product and to whom to sell your product.

A business must decide between optimizing prices, total sales, <b>contribution</b> <b>margins,</b> or even customer lifetime values. Secondly, the business must decide which optimization technique to utilize. For example, many firms utilize linear programming, a complex technique for determining the best outcome from a set of linear relationships, to set prices in order to maximize revenue. Regression analysis, another statistical tool, involves finding the ideal relationship between several variables through complex models and analysis. Discrete choice models can serve to predict customer behavior in order to target them with the right products for the right price.
