50|$|This {{lipstick}} did {{not come}} in a tube; it was applied with a brush. Carmine dye was expensive and the look of carmine <b>colored</b> <b>lipstick</b> was considered unnatural and theatrical, so lipstick was frowned upon for everyday wear. Only actors and actresses {{could get away with}} wearing lipstick. In 1880, few stage actresses wore lipstick in public. The famous actress, Sarah Bernhardt, began wearing lipstick and rouge in public. Before the late 19th century, women only applied makeup at home. Bernhardt often applied carmine dye to her lips in public.|$|R
5000|$|Music {{video for}} [...] "Kiss It" [...] was {{directed}} by Corey Nichols and released on VEVO on March 31, 2014. It shows Dev and Sage in a vintage villa with an inflatable pool and marble figurines. Dev sings the chorus while she's at the phone smoking and browsing magazines with disinterestedness. The video serves as the advertising campaign for the make-up chain of CK <b>Colors</b> <b>lipsticks.</b> Sage appears shirtless in the video, while he's cutting the garden grass with a mower. A [...] "flip-book" [...] lyric video with pop-art style was released on December 10, 2013 on the Dev's fansite YouTube channel.

40|$|Context: Lip {{prints are}} very useful in {{forensic}} investigation and personal identification. Like finger prints, even lip prints can be instrumental in identifying a person positively. Aims: Indians {{are closer to}} Mongoloids than to Caucasoids or Negroids {{as indicated by the}} phylogenetic tree. Most of the studies on lip prints are done in their own population. We have compared lip prints of Manipuris with other Indians (Aryans and Dravidians) who are both close to Mongoloid race and are genetically similar. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 students 50 males and 50 females were selected of whom 30 males and 30 females were of Aryan and Dravidian features and 20 males and 20 females showed the Mongol features. Study materials used were Red <b>colored</b> <b>lipstick,</b> Lip brush, Cellophane tape, White chart paper and Magnifying lens. The lip prints were analyzed by dividing them into eight compartments. Results: Analysis of lip prints showed that the most common and the least common pattern in both males and females (Aryans-Dravidians and Mongols) were the same, but the compartment wise distribution of the lip patterns was different. Conclusion: In the present study, it is established that there is no similarity of lip prints from one individual to another individual and between males and females. Regarding the comparison with Mongols, more studies with a larger sample size is necessary...|$|R

50|$|The use {{of herbal}} {{cosmetics}} {{dates back to}} around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red <b>lipstick</b> <b>color,</b> with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, and body oils.|$|R
5000|$|Lead is {{not listed}} as an {{ingredient}} in lipstick, but trace amounts {{can be found}} in the mineral based additives. Lead is naturally occurring in soil, water, and air.

[...] The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics made a list of chemicals for concern which can contain toxic chemicals such as lead.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Elizabeth Arden began to {{introduce}} different <b>lipstick</b> <b>colors.</b> She inspired other companies {{to create a}} variety of lipstick shades. In the 1930s, lipstick was seen as symbol of adult sexuality. Teenage girls believed that lipstick {{was a symbol of}} womanhood. Adults saw it as an act of rebellion. Many Americans, especially immigrants, did not accept teenage girls wearing lipstick. A study in 1937 survey revealed that over 50% of teenage girls fought with their parents over lipstick.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the body}} is rewashed and dried, a {{moisturizing}} cream {{is applied to the}} body. The body will usually sit {{for as long as possible}} for observation by the embalmer. After being dressed for visitation or funeral services, cosmetics are applied to make the body appear more lifelike and to create a [...] "memory picture" [...] for the deceased's friends and relatives. For babies who have died, the embalmer may apply a light cosmetic massage cream after embalming to provide a natural appearance; massage cream is also used on the face to prevent them from dehydrating, and the infant's mouth is often kept slightly open for a more natural expression. If possible, the funeral director uses a light, translucent cosmetic; sometimes, heavier, opaque cosmetics are used to hide bruises, cuts, or discolored areas. Makeup is applied to the lips to mimic their natural color. Sometimes a very pale or light pink lipstick is applied on males, while brighter <b>colored</b> <b>lipstick</b> is applied to females. Hair gels or baby oil is applied to style short hair; while hairspray is applied to style longer hair. Powders (especially baby powder) are applied to the body to eliminate odors, and it is also applied to the face to achieve a matte and fresh effect to prevent oiliness of the corpse. Mortuary cosmetizing is not done for the same reason as make-up for living people; rather, it is designed to add depth and dimension to a person's features that lack of blood circulation has removed. Warm areas - where blood vessels in living people are superficial, such as the cheeks, chin, and knuckles - have subtle reds added to recreate this effect, while browns are added to the palpabrae (eyelids) to add depth, especially important as viewing in a coffin creates an unusual perspective rarely seen in everyday life. During the viewing, pink-colored lighting is sometimes used near the body to lend a warmer tone to the deceased's complexion.|$|R

50|$|Simpson is {{successful}} {{in creating a}} powerful piece out of Stereo Styles from {{the seriousness of the}} black and white to the undertone of sarcasm in the descriptive words written in the center. Through her layout and representation of the young woman in the ten photos, the principles of cosmetic advertising of the 1980s {{can be used as a}} reference of influence. Similar to lipstick layouts, where the names of the specific <b>colors</b> of <b>lipstick</b> are written under each individual tube. By using the advertisement format her piece transforms simple hairstyles into individual personalities through the use of photography and descriptive words. However, where advertisement's product names are specific to one subject, Simpson's work does not provide a specific photo to a matching word. In this way, the viewer is able to form their own opinion of what hair style expresses the adjective best.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years of {{research}} carried out {{on the basis of a}} financial support by MIUR, many samples have been encountered of different nature, colour, origin and physical state. In examining containers present in the Italian Archaeological depositories and Museums, we have found or we were adviced of interesting coloured materials and we were asked to identify them. The identification is sometimes rich of information about the ancient technology for preparing elaborated formulates, such as cosmetics, drugs, ointments, perfumes, pigments, lakes, dyes. Thereby, their analysis enables important passages of the production to be understood and some literary sourced to be interpreted. In examining some materials present on bones due to particular rituals of the first centuries after Christ in Aemilia, a particular identification of manganese based materials was encountered. The presence of manganese oxides can be related to the geology of the Aemilian territory. However, similar compounds are present in Etruscan tiles decorated with Egyptian blue and other pigments in Marzabotto. This fact supply information on the commerce of Egyptian blue far before Roman Empire times and the passage of manganese oxide treatment for painting to subsequent cicilizations. The necessity for ancient populations to paint testimonies of past religious or military chiefs lead to a search for materials coming from far centuries, such as Baltic amber, Egyptian blue, indigo… In places with an always more ancient chronology, such as Verucchio Aemilia, these materials are found in large amounts. It is not clear whether indigo was extracted from Isatis tinctoria or an Indigofera. Traces of saffron and indigotine on fictile antefissae in Cuma testifies the use of re-painting the artefacts every while, as a sign of respect for the temples. Ancient <b>colored</b> <b>lipsticks</b> contain pink ingredients, that may be purpurissum, but could be also the cheaper purpurissum puteolanum, as revealed by SERS analysis of Pompeiian samples. Residuals of precious materials are found also in small containers of the Roman ages. Smal traces of gold an a black preparation identify the knowledge of a gilding technique on alabaster, whit the black assisa applied on small spots. The ensemble of materials and their use enable an amount of knowledge to be supposed in ancient populations in order to make their life more comfortable and elegant...|$|R

40|$|Until {{the early}} 1970 's {{there was little}} concern about dyes which contain {{benzidine}} {{as an integral part}} of their chemical structure. Furthermore, use of the finished dyes was not considered dangerous. To ascertain whether azo dyes are associated with risk of development of bladder tumors in workers who handpaint Yuzen-type silk kimonos in Kyoto, we investigated the disintegration of dyes to benzidine. In these studies, we found that in rats and mice benzidine-based dyes are metabolized to benzidine and that the azo linkage of benzidine dyes is reduced by Escherichia coli and soil bacteria. These experimental findings were reported previously. In this report, we outline an approach to these studies. Many of the dyes used to <b>color</b> paper, textiles, <b>lipstick,</b> bait used by fishermen, as well as hair dyes, and dyes used in research, for pharmaceutical products, and by defence personnel for the detection of liquid chemical warfare agents, have been shown to be potentially mutagenic or carcinogenic.

50|$|In 1950 chemist Hazel Bishop {{formed a}} company, Hazel Bishop Inc., to promote her {{invention}} of long-lasting, non-smearing 'kissproof' lipstick ("stays on you... not on him"), which quickly gained acceptance. At {{the end of}} the 1950s, a cosmetic company named Gala introduced pale shimmery lipstick. Later, Max Factor created a popular <b>lipstick</b> <b>color</b> called Strawberry Meringue. Lipstick manufacturers began creating lipsticks in lavender, pale pink, white, and peach. Since parents generally frowned on teen girls wearing red lipstick, some teen girls began wearing pink and peach lipsticks, which became a trend. White or nearly white lipstick was popular in the 1960s. Rock groups such as the Ronettes and the Shirelles popularized white lipstick. Girls would apply white lipstick over pink lipstick or place under-eye concealer on their lips. During that time, many lipsticks were either matte, sheer, or slightly shiny. In the 1960s, lipstick was associated with femininity. Women who did not wear lipstick were suspected of mental illness or lesbianism.|$|R

50|$|The red <b>color</b> {{of modern}} <b>lipstick</b> {{can come from}} {{synthetically}} derived pure iron oxide (common iron rust), however most leading brands use the more economical synthetic colors. In the United States, every batch of synthetic dye and pigment must have a sample sent to the US FDA for testing and certification that the batch is pure and its contaminants are below the levels specified by law. Synthetic colors {{are listed in the}} ingredients as a code (e.g.: F &D red no 6) and may contain up to 10 parts per million of lead / 3 parts per million of arsenic. There is some controversy over the presence of these trace ingredients, especially since makeup worn on the lips is not just absorbed through the skin, but also swallowed with drinking and eating. Since lowering these levels would make the production and sale of practically all lipstick illegal, and since the FDA has determined that the existing levels are safe, the cosmetic industry continues to produce and sell lipstick.|$|R

In 1992, she {{appeared}} in Pepsis Super Bowl commercial, aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford. In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game.

5000|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{many women}} {{in the western world}} {{influenced}} by feminism decided to go without any cosmetics. The anti-cosmetics movement was an outgrowth of this; feminists in this movement object to cosmetics' role in the second-class status of women, making them mere sex-objects who must waste time with cosmetics. Cosmetics in the 1970s were divided into a [...] "natural look" [...] for day and a more sexualized image for evening. Non-allergic makeup appeared when the bare face was in fashion as women became more interested in the chemical value of their makeup. [...] Modern developments in technology, such as the High-shear mixer facilitated the production of cosmetics which were more natural looking and had greater staying power in wear than their predecessors. [...] The prime cosmetic of the time was eye shadow, though; women also were interested in new <b>lipstick</b> <b>colors</b> such as lilac, green, and silver. [...] These lipsticks were often mixed with pale pinks and whites, so women could create their own individual shades. [...] "Blush-ons" [...] came into the market in this decade, with Revlon giving them wide publicity. [...] This product was applied to the forehead, lower cheeks, and chin. Contouring and highlighting the face with white eye shadow cream also became popular. Avon introduced the lady saleswoman.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of the contact of two lipsticks, one with common fixer and one with ultra fixer, on the color of a composite resin immediately, 30 min and 24 h after photoactivation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety specimens were prepared with a composite resin, Filtek-Z 350. Specimens were polished and divided into 9 groups (n= 10) according to time elapsed after photoactivation (A- immediately; B- 30 min; C- 24 h) and the contact with lipstick (UF- lipstick with ultra fixer; F- lipstick with common fixer). The control group was represented by specimens that did not have any contact with lipstick (C- without <b>lipstick).</b> <b>Color</b> measurements of the specimens were carried out using a spectrophotometer (Easyshade - CIE L* a* b* system). For UF and F groups, the baseline color of the specimens was measured immediately before pigmentation and the lipsticks were applied dry after 1 hour. The excess lipstick was removed with absorbent paper and final color checking was performed, including the control group. Differences between the final and baseline color measurements were calculated and data were analyzed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test at 5 %. RESULTS: The means between the differences of color values were: AUF: 16. 0; AF: 12. 4; AC: 1. 07; BUF: 9. 51; BF: 8. 3; BC: 0. 91; CUF: 17. 7; CF: 12. 41; CC: 0. 82. CONCLUSION: Groups where lipstick was applied showed greater staining than the control group at the three evaluation times. The lipstick with ultra fixer stained more than the lipstick with common fixer.
