This paper presents firings of a study that examined whether or not lotteries enhance public education spending. Data for 1987 from all 50 states were compared and examined using regression analysis to answer the question: Is school finance enhanced in lottery versus nonlottery jurisdictions? The analysis included four dependent variables, two indicating "support for education " and two "tax effort for education " and two independent variables indicating {{the presence or absence}} of a state lottery. Findings showed that state lottery revenues did not help schools. State per-capita income was the most powerful environmental determinant of school support. Wealthy states that adopted lotteries in advance of other states provided higher levels of school support than nonlottery states; lotteries alone did not make states wealthy. It is recommended that states renounce lotteries altogether. Six tables are included. Contains 14 references.

40|$|Tax havens {{represent}} a crucial, but neglected, test of deep {{trends in the}} international political economy. Over the last decade, and again after {{the onset of the}} financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>tax</b> havens have come under sustained pressure from powerful developed states and the international organisations they dominate. Despite their diminutive geographic and power profile, the havens have shown a puzzling resilience. Although like other economies havens have suffered from the financial crisis, they have nevertheless confounded predictions of decline premised on their purported vulnerability to discriminatory financial regulations imposed from onshore. This article explains the continued growth in offshore finance by the rise of new developing country markets. More broadly, the increasing availability of alternative markets means that G 7 states are losing the crucial leverage they previously enjoyed by threatening to close their markets. The fortunes of tax havens are thus indicative of a tectonic shift: the rise of developing economies is producing a relative decline in the ability of core G 7 states to dominate global economic governance.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that a budget consolidation strategy can work with only a small and short lived negative impact on growth. However, this time consolidation {{is taking place in}} the aftermath of a deep crisis which had lead to increased levels of uncertainty. In addition the financial sector, as well as its regulation is under reconstruction. Firms and consumers are deleveraging, and many countries are trying to consolidate at the same time. We develop ten guidelines for consolidation during such a difficult economic period. We compare them to other guidelines published and, to the extent possible, cross-check whether the upcoming consolidation programs being implemented or revealed in various countries comply with our guidelines. We propose to follow a "high road" on cutting deficits, which includes an active growth enhancing component during the consolidation period. The "active component" should be financed by deeper cuts in subsidies, by eliminating obsolete government expenditure as well as by increasing the efficiency of the public sector. Taxes should not be raised permanently – a temporary contribution to consolidation will be needed, but tax structures in general should be made more growth and employment friendly. budget consolidation, financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>tax</b> and expenditure structure...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In a {{macroeconomic}} environment with the non-tradable shares reform, financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>tax</b> reform and monetary policy, {{to examine the}} dynamic characteristics and factors of the debt maturity structure, this research tends to offer an empirical analysis about Chinese listed companies in different industries. Design/methodology/approach: Learned from Leary (2009), Voutsinas and Werner (2011), this study designs a model of debt maturity structure with an unbalanced panel data set. Consists of 1352 Chinese listed companies with 8124 observations {{during the period of}} 2003 - 2011, the sample passed Hausman test, and the findings support the fixed effects model. Findings: Besides the factors that have been confirmed by previous researches, debt maturity structure is also sensitive to other factors, such as economic expectations, monetary policy, financial restrictions and changes in tax rates. Research limitations/implications: There are still many cases, which affect the debt maturity structure, are worth of further exploring, for instance, the impact of lagged monetary policy, the determinants of short-term debt ratio and the cost of operating. Practical implications: From the macro point of view, research in this area enables the government to introduce more suitable policies that direct and promote the development of the bond market. From the micro point of view, it spurs corporations to choose proper finance structure. - 876 -Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management...|$|E
