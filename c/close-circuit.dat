For high performance we need to integrate the knowledge from computer vision and video coding technology. This need arises due to the recent expansion of new technologies based on the wireless networks in the burgeoning Internet, <b>close-circuits</b> security cameras, mobile devices, home entertainment, and YouTube. While wired networks today enjoy almost unbounded bandwidth, wireless networks still operate under stringent bandwidth constrains. Thus, video communication over wireless networks requires improvement in the areas of compression, quality, and computational complexity in the video coding technology.

The latter can be potentially used for additional industrial processes, such as thermal desalination, material drying, residential heating, greenhouse heating, and a wide variety of membrane distillation processes that can desalinate water without using additional energy, thus saving water and energy. These applications avoid environmental damage and they are able to capture and later use energy currently wasted.Crystal Lagoons’ sustainable cooling system for thermal power plants was successfully applied to Endesa’s San Isidro combined-cycle thermal power plant for more than a year. The project proved mathematical models, validating sustainability and optimal heat and cold transfer rates. This technology is currently being commercialized.Crystal Lagoons has recently created an alliance with a well renowned European scientific research institution in order to develop its first desalination plant.

Neonatal hamster lung tissue was transplanted into adult hamster cheek pouches. After vasculaxization (8 - 10 days), pulmonary and cheek pouch vessels were observed by intravital microscopy in hamsters anesthetized with pentobar-bital. By gassing the suffusion solution (bicarbonate-buffered Ringer's) (pH 7. 4 at 35 - 37 °C) with either low oxygen (95 % N,/ 6 % COi) or high oxygen (75 % Na/ 5 % CO 2 / 20 % Oj) and after sealing {{the top of the}} chamber, extravascular pressure was altered by varying the fluid volume of the closed chamber. Changes in arteriolar diameters in response to positive and negative square-wave pressure pulses were quantified using a video micrometer and <b>close-circuit</b> TV system. Pulmonary arterioles showed a passive dilation or constriction in response to increases or decreases in transmural pressure (± 20 mm Hg). These responses were not altered either by changes in Po? or nitroprusside. In contrast, cheek pouch arterioles showed myogenic responses by constricting 'when transmural pressure was increased and vice versa. These responses were potentiated at high Po? and abolished with nitroprusside.

Analyzed cycles are with Regenerative Heat Exchanger (RHE), Fragmented Compression and Inter-Cooling (FC&IC). The HTGR imposes the working agent and hot source’s parameters. The cooling conditions give the cycle’s minimal temperature. In the 1 st paper’s section, for ideal processes cycles, we show that: A) the boundary parameters and design schemes inflict: A 1) the compression ratios (ε), A 2) the specific net work per 1 kg He (wnet), and A 3) the thermal efficiencies (ηth); B) the performances are increasing with the IC’s number. In the 2 nd section {{we are taking}} into consideration the irreversibility’s factors (temperature difference at RHE, revolving machines isentropic efficiencies, and pressure drops) doing sensitivity analyses about their influences on real processes cycle’s performances. We show that: 1) cycle’s performances are not continuous growing with IC’s number, and 2) the main influences on design’s option are given by: 21) the temperature difference at RHE and 22) the pressure drops. In the 3 rd section we adjusted all the quality factors in a similar manner, reducing the irreversibilities, showing the synergic influences. The 4 th section relaxes the hot source’s restrictions.

The configuration was designed such that the anodic carbon felt could behave as a filter enabling removal and bioelectrochemical oxidation of particulate and soluble organic matter from wastewater. Three reactors (each with approximately 10 L liquid volume) were set up to evaluate three different operational settings: (i) <b>close-circuit</b> operation enabling current production; (ii) open-circuit operation without current production; and (iii) control reactor without electrode {{to account for the}} effect of electrode as a filter. The reactors were operated for over 200 days during which key process parameters (SCOD removal, SS removal, turbidity, electricity production, electrolyte pH) were quantified. The results indicated that current production (maximal current of approximately 120 mA) could increase the SCOD removal efficacy from 11 % to 77 % at a SCOD removal rate of approximately 0. 1 kg SCOD/m 3 d. No measurable difference between SS removal efficiencies in open and close circuit (83 %), and clogging of the electrode filter were observed. A high coulombic efficiency (more than 80 %, based on the SCOD removed) and low internal resistance (2. 7 Ω) were achieved, indicating that the configuration is suitable for handling real wastewater containing particulate matter.

In this study, the whole process for CRT glass recycling has been tested to obtain a product able to meet the required market standard. A mechanical process at industrial scale has been tested, consisting of an attrition operation controlled by a screening unit. It has been monitored in order to set up the best working conditions in terms of fine particles production and quality control. The products (input, oversize and undersize) have been characterized by image and chemical analysis to determine morphologic, morphometric and compositional properties. The analysis on under-size product allowed individuating the suitable rotational speed and water content to control fine particle production and decontamination. The obtained glass cutlets, thus, have been utilised in a thermal process at laboratory scale to produce a porous glass suitable for structural and insulating applications in building constructions, using calcium carbonate as foaming agent. Different operative conditions have been tested, varying process temperature and concentration of the foaming agent. The properties of porous glass obtained have been investigated by physical analysis, in order to set up the proper conditions...|$|E
