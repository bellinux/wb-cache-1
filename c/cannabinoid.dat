Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia have been investigated for potential inhibitory effects on the hepatitis B virus. Its traditional use as an anti-inflammatory {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as leukotriene antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an anti-inflammatory effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E

At least 113 different <b>cannabinoids</b> have been isolated from the Cannabis plant To the right, the main classes of <b>cannabinoids</b> from Cannabis are shown. The best studied <b>cannabinoids</b> include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN).|$|R
50|$|Synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> {{encompass}} {{a variety}} of distinct chemical classes: the classical <b>cannabinoids</b> structurally related to THC, the nonclassical <b>cannabinoids</b> (cannabimimetics) including the aminoalkylindoles, 1,5-diarylpyrazoles, quinolines, and arylsulfonamides as well as eicosanoids related to endocannabinoids.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{laboratory}} {{synthesis of}} <b>cannabinoids</b> were {{often based on}} the structure of herbal <b>cannabinoids,</b> and a large number of analogs have been produced and tested, especially in a group led by Roger Adams as early as 1941 and later in a group led by Raphael Mechoulam. Newer compounds are no longer related to natural <b>cannabinoids</b> or are based {{on the structure of}} the endogenous <b>cannabinoids.</b>|$|R
25|$|Shimon Ben-Shabat, of Ben-Gurion University, {{discovered}} the chemical. 2-AG was a known chemical compound but its occurrence in mammals and its {{affinity for the}} <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors were first described in 1994-1995. A research group at Teikyo University reported the affinity of 2-AG for the <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors in 1994-1995, but the isolation of 2-AG in the canine gut was first reported in 1995 by the research group of Raphael Mechoulam at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which additionally characterized its pharmacological properties in vivo. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, next with Anandamide, was the second endocannabinoid discovered. The <b>cannabinoid</b> established {{the existence of a}} <b>cannabinoid</b> neuromodulatory system in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Endocannabinoids are eicosanoids {{acting as}} {{agonists}} for <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors and they occur naturally in the body. <b>Cannabinoid</b> receptor-related processes are for example involved in cognition, memory, anxiety, control of appetite, emesis, motor behavior, sensory, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses, immune responses and inflammatory effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these specialized <b>cannabinoid</b> {{receptors in the brain}} led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low <b>cannabinoid</b> receptor efficacy and affinity. In populations of low <b>cannabinoid</b> receptor density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat).|$|E
30|$|AM- 2201 has a {{very high}} {{affinity}} for <b>cannabinoids</b> receptor (CB 1). Synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> have a better affinity for <b>cannabinoids</b> receptors (CB 1 to CB 2 receptors); therefore, they are related to higher charges of toxicity and hospital admission compared to abusers of natural cannabis. The most commonly observed clinical signs that suggested toxicities related to synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> include tachycardia, agitation and irritability, hypertension, vertigo, hallucination, nausea, confusion, delusion, dizziness, and chest pain. Acute kidney damage is also strongly related to abuse of synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> (Madras and Kuhar 2013).|$|R
50|$|Studies are {{currently}} available which suggest {{an association between}} synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> and psychosis. The use of synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> {{can be associated with}} psychosis and physicians are beginning to investigate possible use of synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> in patients with inexplicable psychotic symptoms. In contrast to most other recreational drugs, the dramatic psychotic state induced by use of synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> has been reported, in multiple cases, to persist for several weeks, and in one case for seven months, after complete cessation of drug use. Individuals with risk factors for psychotic disorders are often counseled against using synthetic <b>cannabinoids.</b>|$|R

25|$|For centuries hashish and {{marijuana}} from the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa L. {{have been used}} for medicinal and recreational purposes. In 1840, Schlesinger S. was apparently the first investigator to obtain an active extract from the leaves and flowers of hemp. A few years later, in 1848, Decourtive E. described the preparation of an ethanol extract that on evaporation of the solvent gave a dark resin, which he named “cannabin”. In 1964 the main active constituent of C. sativa L., Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and synthesized by Mechoulam's laboratory. Two types of <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors, CB1 and CB2, responsible for the effects of THC were discovered and cloned in the early 1990s. Once <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors had been discovered, it became important to establish whether their agonists occur naturally in the body. This search led to the discovery of the first endogenous <b>cannabinoid</b> (endocannabinoid), anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide). Later on other endocannabinoids were found, for example 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). These findings raised further questions about the pharmacological and physiological role of the <b>cannabinoid</b> system. This revived the research on <b>cannabinoid</b> receptor antagonists which were expected to help answer these questions. The use of the <b>cannabinoid</b> agonist, THC, in its many preparations to enhance appetite is a well known fact. This fact led to the logical extension that blocking of the <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors might be useful in decreasing appetite and food intake. It was then discovered that the blockage of the CB1 receptor represented a new pharmacological target. The first specific CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist was rimonabant, discovered in 1994.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{analysis}} of <b>cannabinoid</b> binding in CB1 and CB2 receptor knockout mice found <b>cannabinoid</b> responsiveness even when these receptors {{were not being}} expressed, indicating that an additional binding receptor may {{be present in the}} brain. Binding has been demonstrated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) on the TRPV1 receptor suggesting that this receptor may be a candidate for the established response.|$|E
25|$|Honokiol {{has been}} shown to promote neurite {{outgrowth}} and have neuroprotective effects in rat cortical neurons. Additionally, honokiol increases free cytoplasmic Ca2+ in rat cortical neurons. Honokiol is a weak <b>cannabinoid</b> CB2 receptor ligand but the naturally occurring derivative 4-O-methylhonokiol was shown to be a potent and selective <b>cannabinoid</b> CB2 receptor inverse agonist and to possess antiosteoclastic effects.|$|E
25|$|The CB1 {{receptor}} {{is found}} {{primarily in the}} brain and mediates the psychological effects of THC. The CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system. <b>Cannabinoids</b> act as immunomodulators at CB2 receptors, meaning they increase some immune responses and decrease others. For example, nonpsychotropic <b>cannabinoids</b> {{can be used as a}} very effective anti-inflammatory. The affinity of <b>cannabinoids</b> to bind to either receptor is about the same, with only a slight increase observed with the plant-derived compound CBD binding to CB2 receptors more frequently. <b>Cannabinoids</b> likely have a role in the brain’s control of movement and memory, as well as natural pain modulation. It is clear that <b>cannabinoids</b> can affect pain transmission and, specifically, that <b>cannabinoids</b> interact with the brain's endogenous opioid system and may affect dopamine transmission.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cannabinoids</b> {{have shown}} diverse and {{critical}} {{effects on the}} body systems, which alter the physiological functions. Synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> are comparatively innovative misuse drugs {{with respect to their}} nature of synthesis. Synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> therapy in healthy, chain smokers, and alcoholic individuals cause damage to the immune and nervous system, eventually leading to intoxication throughout the body. Relevant studies were retrieved using major electronic databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The extensive use of Cannabis Sativa L. (C. Sativa) and its derivatives/analogues such as the nonpsychoactive dimethyl heptyl homolog (CBG-DMH), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) amongst juveniles and adults have been enhanced in recent years. <b>Cannabinoids</b> {{play a crucial role in}} the induction of respiratory, reproductive, immune and carcinogenic effects; however, potential data about mutagenic and developmental effects are still insufficient. The possible toxicity associated with the prolong use of <b>cannabinoids</b> acts as a tumor promoter in animal models and humans. Particular synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> and analogues have low affinity for CB 1 or CB 2 receptors, while some synthetic members like Δ 9 -THC have high affinity towards these receptors. <b>Cannabinoids</b> and their derivatives have a direct or indirect association with acute and long-term toxicity. To reduce/attenuate <b>cannabinoids</b> toxicity, pharmaceutical biotechnology and cloning methods have opened a new window to develop <b>cannabinoids</b> encoding the gene tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase. Plant revolution and regeneration hindered genetic engineering in C. Sativa. The genetic culture suspension of C. Sativa can be transmuted by the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to overcome its toxicity. The main aim of the present review was to collect evidence of the endo-cannabinoid system (ECS), <b>cannabinoids</b> toxicity, and the potential biotechnological approach of <b>cannabinoids</b> synthesis...|$|R

25|$|When THC {{enters the}} blood stream and reaches the brain, it binds to <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors. The {{endogenous}} ligand of these receptors is anandamide, {{the effects of}} which THC emulates. This agonism of the <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and norepinephrine; neurotransmitters which are {{closely associated with the}} acute effects of cannabis ingestion, such as euphoria and anxiety.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Cannabinoids</b> {{represent}} unique compounds {{for treating}} tumors, including astrocytomas. Whether CB 1 and CB 2 receptors mediate this therapeutic effect is unclear. Principal Findings: We generated astrocytoma subclones that express set levels of CB 1 and CB 2, {{and found that}} <b>cannabinoids</b> induce apoptosis only in cells expressing low levels of receptors that couple to ERK 1 / 2. In contrast, <b>cannabinoids</b> do not induce apoptosis in cells expressing high levels of receptors because these now also couple to the prosurvival signal AKT. Remarkably, <b>cannabinoids</b> applied at high concentration induce apoptosis in all subclones independently of CB 1, CB 2 and AKT, but still through a mechanism involving ERK 1 / 2. Significance: The high expression level of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors commonly found in malignant astrocytomas precludes the use of <b>cannabinoids</b> as therapeutics, unless AKT is concomitantly inhibited, or <b>cannabinoids</b> are applied at concentration...|$|R
50|$|Using {{selective}} breeding and production control, HortaPharm created Cannabis strains that produce virtually single <b>cannabinoids,</b> approximately 98% tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol, {{relative to the}} total of other <b>cannabinoids</b> present.|$|R
25|$|The <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors CB1 and CB2, two G protein-coupled receptors {{that are}} located in the central and {{peripheral}} nervous systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cannabinoid</b> binding sites exist {{throughout}} {{the central and}} peripheral nervous systems. The two most relevant receptors for cannabinoids are the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are expressed predominantly {{in the brain and}} immune system respectively. Density of expression varies based on species and correlates with the efficacy that cannabinoids will have in modulating specific aspects of behavior related to the site of expression. For example, in rodents, the highest concentration of <b>cannabinoid</b> binding sites are in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, regions of the brain involved in the initiation and coordination of movement. In humans, <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors exist in much lower concentration in these regions, which helps explain why cannabinoids possess a greater efficacy in altering rodent motor movements than they do in humans.|$|E
25|$|Cannabinoids usually {{contain a}} 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring, a variedly derivatized {{aromatic}} ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors, constituting {{a family of}} about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds. Like most other neurological processes, the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction, the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response. It is now understood that <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors appear in similar forms in most vertebrates and invertebrates and have a long evolutionary history of 500 million years. The binding of cannabinoids to <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors decrease adenylyl cyclase activity, inhibit calcium N channels, and disinhibit K+A channels.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{three different}} associations between <b>cannabinoids</b> and cancer. First, it assesses evidence that smoking of cannabis preparations may cause cancers of the aerodigestive and respiratory system. There have been case reports of upper-respiratory-tract cancers in {{young adults who}} smoke cannabis, but evidence from a few epidemiological cohort studies and case-control studies is inconsistent. Second, there is mixed evidence {{on the effects of}} THC and other <b>cannabinoids</b> on cancers: in some in vitro and in vivo studies THC and some synthetic <b>cannabinoids</b> have had antineoplastic effects, but in other studies THC seems to impair the immune response to cancer. As yet {{there is no evidence that}} THC or other <b>cannabinoids</b> have anticancer effects in humans. Third, Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may treat the symptoms and side-effects of cancer, and there is evidence that it and other <b>cannabinoids</b> may be useful adjuvant treatments that improve appetite, reduce nausea and vomiting, and alleviate moderate neuropathic pain in patients with cancer. The main challenge for the medical use of <b>cannabinoids</b> is the development of safe and effective methods of use that lead to therapeutic effects but that avoid adverse psychoactive effects. Furthermore, medical, legal, and regulatory obstacles hinder the smoking of cannabis for medical purposes. These very different uses of <b>cannabinoids</b> are in danger of being confused in public debate, especially in the USA where some advocates for the medical use of <b>cannabinoids</b> have argued for smoked cannabis rather than pharmaceutical <b>cannabinoids.</b> We review the available evidence on these three issues and consider their implications for policy...|$|R
50|$|Psychoactive <b>cannabinoids</b> {{from the}} {{marijuana}} plant (phytocannabinoids), {{from the body}} (endocannabinoids), and from the research lab (synthetic <b>cannabinoids)</b> produce their discriminative stimulus effects by stimulation of CB1 receptors in the brain.|$|R

25|$|The {{areas of}} the brain where <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors are most prevalently located are {{consistent}} with the behavioral effects produced by cannabinoids. Brain regions in which <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors are very abundant are the basal ganglia, associated with movement control; the cerebellum, associated with body movement coordination; the hippocampus, associated with learning, memory, and stress control; the cerebral cortex, associated with higher cognitive functions; and the nucleus accumbens, regarded as the reward center of the brain. Other regions where <b>cannabinoid</b> receptors are moderately concentrated are the hypothalamus, which regulates homeostatic functions; the amygdala, associated with emotional responses and fears; the spinal cord, associated with peripheral sensations like pain; the brain stem, associated with sleep, arousal, and motor control; and the nucleus of the solitary tract, associated with visceral sensations like nausea and vomiting.|$|E
40|$|Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have well {{documented}} immunomodulatory effects in vitro, but not following oral administration in humans.

CBD concentrations in the lymph were 250 -fold higher than in plasma, while THC concentrations in the lymph were 100 -fold higher than in plasma. Since <b>cannabinoids</b> are currently in clinical use {{for the treatment of}} spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to alleviate nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients, lymphocytes from those patients were used to assess the immunomodulatory effects of <b>cannabinoids.</b> The levels of <b>cannabinoids</b> recovered in the intestinal lymphatic system, but not in plasma, were substantially above the immunomodulatory threshold in murine and human lymphocytes. CBD showed higher immunosuppressive effects than THC. Moreover, immune cells from MS patients were more susceptible to the immunosuppressive effects of <b>cannabinoids</b> than those from healthy volunteers or cancer patients.
