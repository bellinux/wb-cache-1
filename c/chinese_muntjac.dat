25|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} variability between {{closely related species}} is the muntjac, which was investigated by Kurt Benirschke and his colleague Doris Wurster. The diploid number of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac,</b> Muntiacus reevesi, {{was found to be}} 46, all telocentric. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian muntjac, Muntiacus muntjak, they were astonished to find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.|$|E
5000|$|Landseer's {{painting}} of a red deer stag, Monarch of the Glen, {{is one of the}} most notable images of Victorian Scotland. The species, a member of the biological order artiodactyla or [...] "even-toed ungulates", is still 400,000 strong, although its existence in the pure form is threatened by hybridisation with introduced sika deer. Very much a hill-dwelling species in Scotland (and so typically smaller in stature than its European forest-loving cousins), it is generally replaced by roe deer in lower-lying land. Although found elsewhere in the UK, no wild populations of Chinese water deer and no or very few <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> exist in Scotland. It has isolated populations of feral goats Capra hircus and feral sheep (Ovis aries), such as the herd of 1,000 Soay sheep on St Kilda. Since 1952 a herd of semi-domesticated reindeer have lived in the Cairngorm National Park, the species having become extinct in Scotland after it was recorded as having been hunted in Orkney in the 12th century.|$|E
40|$|The {{telomere}} binding proteins TRF 1 and TRF 2 {{maintain and}} protect chromosome ends and confer karyotypic stability. Chromosome {{evolution in the}} genus Muntiacus is characterized by numerous tandem (end-to-end) fusions. To study TRF 1 and TRF 2 telomere binding proteins in Muntiacus species, we isolated and characterized the TERF 1 and - 2 genes from Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak vaginalis; 2 n = 6 female) and from <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus reveesi; 2 n = 46). Expression analysis revealed that both genes are ubiquitously expressed and sequence analysis identified several transcript variants of both TERF genes. Control experiments disclosed a novel testis-specific splice variant of TERF 1 in human testes. Amino acid sequence comparisons demonstrate that Muntiacus TRF 1 and in particular TRF 2 are highly conserved between muntjac and human. In vivo TRF 2 -GFP and immuno-staining studies in muntjac cell lines revealed telomeric TRF 2 localization, while deletion of the DNA binding domain abrogated this localization, suggesting muntjac TRF 2 represents a functional telomere protein. Finally, expression analysis {{of a set of}} telomere-related genes revealed their presence in muntjac fibroblasts and testis tissue, which suggests the presence of a conserved telomere complex in muntjacs. However, a deviation from the common theme was noted for the TERT gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase; TERT expression could not be detected in Indian or <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> cDNA or genomic DNA using a series of conserved primers, while TRAP assay revealed functional telomerase in <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> testis tissues. This suggests muntjacs may harbor a diverged telomerase sequence...|$|E

40|$|Numerous deer {{species have}} been {{introduced}} beyond their native range into ecosystems around the world. Their economic value leads to further accidental and deliberate releases and lack of control is contributing to range expansion in Australia, South America and Europe. Despite localised or regional concern, the scale and generality of detrimental impacts have not been widely recognised. We review the direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and evidence for interspecific effects on native deer. In New Zealand, where large herbivores were previously absent, severe and novel impacts {{have been found in}} susceptible forests. Even where ecosystems contain native deer, invasion by taxonomically exotic deer species carries the risk of cascade effects on spatial plant dynamics and forest composition. In Patagonia, introduced deer have disrupted forest composition, whereas in Europe, ecosystem impacts of introduced species can differ from those of over-abundant native deer. Introduced <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus reevesi) within a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England differ from native European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in their distribution of herbivory among differing habitats, and provide much lower rates of endozoochorous seed dispersal. Frequent concern is expressed that introduced deer species may have detrimental effects on native deer and other ungulates, although potential epidemiological effects have not been investigated. Apparent competition, with introduced prey resulting in increased predation rates on native deer, may be occurring between South American huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and southern pudu (Pudu puda). Habitat and dietary overlap is often substantial among native and introduced ungulates, including deer, and exploitation competition is likely. Evidence includes spatial responses of native to non-native deer and negatively correlated changes in population abundance, but demographic mechanisms have not been demonstrated previously. In a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England, substantial habitat and dietary overlap occurs between native roe deer and high-density introduced <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac.</b> This roe deer population has shown a reduction in body weight and fertility following establishment and increasing abundance of non-native <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac,</b> compatible with interspecific competition. European roe deer also appear susceptible to competition from larger grazing deer, including native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and introduced fallow (Dama dama). The widely introduced fallow deer may be a particularly effective competitor in sympatry with intermediate or concentrate feeders. There is need for further investigation of potential interactions of introduced and native deer species, and a wider recognition of the ecological impacts of introduced deer...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} {{single-stranded}} d(TC) n specific binding proteins has been {{detected in the}} nuclear extracts of several mammalian species that included mouse, human, African green monkey, chimpanzee, and <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac.</b> Southwestern analysis of 500 mM KCI nuclear extracts has shown that these proteins cluster in a similar size range, 55. 5 to 57 kD. An additional 54 kD band was present for the three primate species examined. The single-stranded d(TC) n binding activity was confirmed with bandshift assay. Specific double-stranded binding activity for duplex d(TC) n. d(GA) n or single-stranded d(GA) n was not detected. The conservation of size distribution and d(TC) n-binding activity across the species examined indicates that this class of single-stranded binding proteins may have an important biological function in vivo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{black muntjac}} (Muntiacus crinifrons, 2 n =  8 ♀/ 9 ♂) is a {{critically}} endangered mammalian species that {{is confined to}} a narrow region of southeastern China. Male black muntjacs have an astonishing X 1 X 2 Y 1 Y 2 Y 3 sex chromosome system, unparalleled in eutherian mammals, involving {{approximately half of the}} entire genome. A high-resolution comparative map between the black muntjac (M. crinifrons) and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> (M. reevesi, 2 n =  46) has been constructed based on the chromosomal localization of 304 clones from a genomic BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) library of the Indian muntjac (M. muntjak vaginalis, 2 n =  6 ♀/ 7 ♂). In addition to validating the chromosomal homologies between M. reevesi and M. crinifrons defined previously by chromosome painting, the comparative BAC map demonstrates that all tandem fusions that have occurred in the karyotypic evolution of M. crinifrons are centromere–telomere fusions. The map also allows for a more detailed reconstruction of the chromosomal rearrangements leading to this unique and complex sex chromosome system. Furthermore, we have identified 46 BAC clones {{that could be used to}} study the molecular evolution of the unique sex chromosomes of the male black muntjacs...|$|E
40|$|Understanding deer habitat use is {{important}} in predictive management of increasing deer populations and in assessing the potential for inter-specific competition, particularly between native and introduced species. Habitat usage by roe deer and introduced <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> was studied in a 1200 ha study area within Thetford Forest, a commercially managed coniferous forest in Eastern England. Habitat use was related to forest growth stage and vegetation composition by pellet-group clearance transects conducted every 2 months from March 2000 to March 2001. Higher densities of roe deer were found in young plantations, while muntjac numbers were lower in open restocks and grassy areas and higher in older stands and areas with greater cover of bramble Rubus fruticosa agg. Overall, muntjac showed greater habitat selectivity than roe deer. The overlap between the two species in use of individual stands (single, even-aged management compartments) was significantly lower than overlap in use of growth stages (consisting of many individual stands), suggesting ecological partitioning at finer spatial scales. However, overlap in habitat use as measured by Pianka’s index remained substantial at both scales (mean 0. 40 ± 0. 16 S. D. for stands and 0. 55 ± 0. 11 for growth stages). Habitat overlap was greatest in winter when both species aggregate on bramble. There is, therefore, potential for exploitation competition {{in the event of}} food scarcity...|$|E
40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{cascading}} effects on ecosystems, keystone species {{should be a}} focus of conservation and management efforts. However, in order to manage populations of keystone species – such as deer – effectively, {{there is a need}} to quantify how the distribution and abundance of populations may change in the future, and to understand the potential consequences of these changes for biodiversity. By relating species’ abundance data within their historic ranges to habitat variables, I developed a novel methodology to assess habitat suitability for deer across Britain, none of which are currently at equilibrium with their environment. The resultant models performed well in describing the observed, contemporary distribution of roe, red and <b>Chinese</b> <b>muntjac</b> deer in Britain. In particular, the model for the non-native muntjac deer highlighted the potential for this species to expand its range significantly in the future. I estimated, for the first time, the rate and pattern of the future spread of deer at a landscape scale across Britain, using a spatially explicit population model (SEPM). The SEPM accounts for range-limiting processes such as species-specific dispersal ability and environmental barriers to dispersal. The SEPM performed well in describing the observed spread of roe, red and muntjac deer in Britain between 1972 and 2007, and predicted the spread of, and overlap between, species to continue to increase in the future. From sensitivity analyses, I found that the spread of deer was strongly influenced by adult and juvenile survival. I also investigated the impacts of deer on their environment using two approaches. First, using vegetation data collected in 35 woodland sites across Britain, I found negative relationships between the density of roe deer and the diversity and abundance of shrub-layer vegetation. Second, I investigated the potential cascading effect of this negative relationship between deer density and shrub layer vegetation on bird populations. I used a long-running dataset on bird abundances across Britain, to construct and contrast two multi-species composite population trends for birds: one for deer-sensitive woodland birds and the second for deer-tolerant woodland birds. The divergence in these trends showed a striking association to a composite population trend for deer (also calculated using data from long-running volunteer surveys). These results demonstrate the potential for rapid and profound impacts of keystone herbivores across multiple tropic levels, which are likely to increase as a consequence of the predicted future expansion of such species. ...|$|E
