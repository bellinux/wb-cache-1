40|$|Abstract. Reform offers {{economic}} {{gains for}} society at large, but can represent {{a threat to}} the interests of <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> <b>Public</b> sector reform faces opposition from voters employed in public sector. Norwegian data allow for an analysis this interpretation. Survey data show that <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> prefer less reform {{than the rest of the}} population. The voting behavior of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> is more sensitive to reform than is that of other voters (the swing voter hypothesis), and hence: shares of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> in a local jurisdiction have a negative impact on the probability of reform. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{as to whether or not}} the <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> should be granted the right to strike has become an increasingly important question in recent years. The swell in the number of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> and increased militancy and strike activity in the public sector adds greater importance to this controversial question. There has been a substantial increase in the number of government employees in recent years, accompanies by a sharp increase in the number of <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> strikes.

50|$|Controversies {{about the}} {{institution}} of the Civil Service in Greece are widespread. Typically, they concern the allegedly large numbers of <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> the lack of adequate meritocracy in their employment, the strong ties that significant portions of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> maintain with political parties and the clientelism that this relationship incubates, internal inequalities of wages among <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> and inequalities of the high income of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> relevant to that of private sector workers.

40|$|Academic {{freedom has}} gone through three {{distinct}} eras yet each era overlaps a great deal with the one following it. The first era was the bureaucratic. It was exemplified by the negotiations between administrators and professors in the 1920 s. The American Association of University Professors and the American Association of Colleges began cooperating and a hierarchical structure emerged, with the tenured professor {{at the top of}} the faculty. The second era was the political era and it was mainly a result of loyalty oaths, which began after the first World War and then escalated again during the 1930 s when communism became a major concern. The political era then gave way to the legal era when the first academic freedom cases went to the United States Supreme Court in the 1950 s. The first cases were the result of political pressures that became legal pressures. Most of the early court cases were based on communism. The legal era has produced changes. There are now more rights; for students and teachers of all levels, including pre-college levels, are guaranteed some academic freedom rights. However, the First Amendment and academic freedom are not synonymous because a professor usually cannot win a case based solely on his free speech rights under academic freedom. It is only when academic freedom is guaranteed through some form of due process, custom or contract—and that guarantee has been violated—that a professor normally wins a suit. There are times, too, when a professor's free speech rights have been violated and she can then win a suit based on the First Amendment, but academic freedom is not always a part of the decision. Many times academic freedom is simply used as dictum in a decision that is, in fact, based on a different part of law such as <b>contract</b> law, <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> law, or a First Amendment violation. Academic freedom has been recognized by the courts but standing alone it is not usually sufficient to win a suit...|$|R
50|$|As <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> {{salary and}} benefit {{obligations}} increase over time, {{particularly with regard}} to pensions and <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> retiree healthcare, the impacts on the local government budget become more significant and can even lead to bankruptcy. Local politicians end up having to reduce public services and/or raise taxes or other revenues such as fees and charges. To the extent that taxes are raised, the tax proceeds will generally either directly or indirectly pay for <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> salary and benefit obligations. Research has shown that many local tax increases are concentrated in California communities that have the largest <b>public</b> <b>employee</b> pension problems.|$|R
40|$|Surveys are a {{commonly}} used means of measuring transparency levels, {{but they are}} potentially vulnerable to perceptual biases. This study sought to examine perceptual differences by the respondents’ identities as general citizens or <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> and the possible negative perceptions that one group may have of the other concerning responses to a survey-based measure of transparency. The survey was designed {{on the basis of}} existing literature, suggesting that transparency has up to six facets. Two samples were taken: from citizens who visited district offices to file civil applications during the survey period; and from <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> involved in processing these applications. A total of 472 surveys were used for analysis: 233 citizens and 239 <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> The results indicated that the two groups had different understandings of transparency. Data from <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> produced a three-factor solution, which was labeled as Efficiency, Reliability, and Access. For citizens, a two-factor solution was a better fit, with the factors being described as Accessibility (a wider notion than Access) and Utility. The findings suggest that <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> adopt a somewhat technical view of transparency, whereas citizens have more practical concerns about it. Only citizens’ unfavorable perception of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> had a negative influence on the level of transparency. This study contributes to the understanding of how <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> and citizens have qualitatively different perceptions of transparency. Points for practitioners To assess progress in governmental transparency, we must measure it, and surveys offer an accessible and potentially cost-effective approach. However, the survey responses of citizens and <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> show that they understand transparency in qualitatively different ways, with citizens’ perceptions of transparency also influenced by their perceptions of <b>public</b> <b>employees.</b> If governments are to increase public trust in policymaking and administration, they must focus on improving transparency as it is understood by the public rather than how it is understood by public servants...|$|R

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>employees</b> do {{not enjoy}} the same free speech rights under the First Amendment as do {{ordinary}} citizens. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently adopted a virtual per se rule precluding free speech rights for <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> while they are performing ordinary job duties. This Note argues that such a per se rule both lacks policy justification and, more importantly, would undermine {{the purposes of the}} First Amendment by impeding academic freedom and permitting viewpoint discrimination. Rejecting the per se rule best preserves the free speech rights of <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> and in turn allows them to speak freely about governmental operations—an especially important function of <b>public</b> <b>employees,</b> who are firsthand witnesses to government activities...|$|R

The Court in Garcetti did not dramatically change the way it analyzed <b>public</b> <b>employees</b> 2 ̆ 7 First Amendment rights. Instead, it restated the principles on which those claims rest, emphasizing management rights and the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.
