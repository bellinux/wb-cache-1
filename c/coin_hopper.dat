50|$|Hopper fill slip is a {{document}} used {{to record the}} replenishment of the coin in the <b>coin</b> <b>hopper</b> after it becomes depleted {{as a result of}} making payouts to players. The slip indicates the amount of coin placed into the hoppers, as well as the signatures of the employees involved in the transaction, the slot machine number and the location and the date.|$|E
50|$|Short pay {{refers to}} a partial payout made by a slot machine, which {{is less than the}} amount due to the player. This occurs if the <b>coin</b> <b>hopper</b> has been {{depleted}} as a result of making earlier payouts to players. The remaining amount due to the player is either paid as a hand pay or an attendant will come and refill the machine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coin</b> <b>hopper</b> is a {{container}} where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the coin tray when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a [...] "Cash Out" [...] button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or [...] "drops," [...] excess coins into a [...] "drop bucket" [...] or [...] "drop box." [...] (Unused coin hoppers {{can still be}} found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.) ...|$|E
50|$|It also {{develops}} and manufactures several (electronic) components, software {{products and}} systems as <b>coin</b> <b>hoppers,</b> pushbuttons, topper boxes and control mechanisms for the professional gaming industry. In 2005 Suzo merged with Happ Controls {{to form the}} Suzo-Happ Group - later stylized as SUZOHAPP. It is active in more than 60 countries worldwide. In North America, the organization does business as Happ based in Elk Grove, IL, and Suzo, based in Oud-Beijerland, the Netherlands, is responsible for international operations.|$|R
50|$|Integration of {{technology}} allows kiosks {{to perform a}} wide range of functions, evolving into self-service kiosks. For example, kiosks may enable users to order from a shop's catalogue when items are not in stock, check out a library book, look up information about products, issue a hotel key card, enter a public utility bill account number in order to perform an online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise. Customised components such as <b>coin</b> <b>hoppers,</b> bill acceptors, card readers and thermal printers enable kiosks to meet the owner's specialised needs.|$|R
50|$|The first {{compiler}} {{was written}} by Grace Hopper, in 1952, for the A-0 System language. The term compiler was <b>coined</b> by <b>Hopper.</b> The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. The first autocode and its compiler were developed by Alick Glennie in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered {{by some to be}} the first compiled programming language. The FORTRAN team led by John W. Backus at IBM is generally credited as having introduced the first complete compiler, in 1957. The first FORTRAN compiler took 18 person-years to create.|$|R
50|$|Ticket-in, ticket out (TITO) {{machines}} {{are used in}} casino slot machines to print out {{a slip of paper}} with a barcode indicating the amount of money represented. These can in turn be redeemed for cash at an automated kiosk. The machines utilize a barcode scanner built into the bill acceptor, a thermal ticket printer in place of a <b>coin</b> <b>hopper</b> (some rare {{machines are}} set up to pay with coins if the payout is less than the payout limit, and to print a ticket in situations where a handpay would normally be required) and a network interface to communicate with a central system that tracks tickets.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Hopper was {{initially}} sympathetic to Soviet efforts to collectivize industry and agriculture under state control, believing the United States could benefit by emulating their centralized planning models. His {{writing in the}} early 1930s reflected his belief that the Bolsheviks were modernizing [...] "backward" [...] portions of Asia by advancing industrialization in the Far East, a positive improvement in his estimation. In the early 1930s he correctly predicted that rising Soviet power and influence in the Far East would lead to conflict there with the United States. In view of the famines and widespread starvation that gripped Soviet Russia in 1930s, <b>Hopper</b> <b>coined</b> the phrase that Russia was ready to [...] "starve itself great".|$|R
