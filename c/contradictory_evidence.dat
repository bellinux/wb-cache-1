Based on the <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidence,</b> Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 1480 to 1482 has puzzled biographers; <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidence</b> exists {{suggesting}} either that Josquin {{was still in}} France, or {{was already in the}} service of the Sforza family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae, composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically does not fit with the usual date of 1503–4 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent some of that time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th-century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one of the musicians present.|$|E

30|$|For this purpose, we {{estimate}} the bivariate model of Singh (2010) under the ARDL framework {{over the period}} of 1960 – 2014. We also use the Johansen cointegration for the robustness of the results, because augmented Dickey–Fuller test and Phillips–Perron tests give contradictory results about the order or integration. Then, we allow the structural breaks in the data series and apply the Clemente–Montanes–Reyes unit root test. This test shows that all the series have the same order of integration and are stationary at first difference. Therefore, in the presence <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidences</b> {{on the order of}} integration we use two different cointegration methodologies. However, we rely on ARDL for the estimation of error correction model as it can be applied irrespective of I(0) or I(1).|$|R

40|$|Most {{multimedia}} {{surveillance and}} monitoring systems nowadays utilize multiple types of sensors to detect events of interest as {{and when they}} occur in the environment. However, due to the asynchrony among and diversity of sensors, information assimilation- how to combine the information obtained from asynchronous and multifarious sources is an important and challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose a framework for information assimilation that addresses the issues- “when”, “what ” and “how ” to assimilate the information obtained from different media sources in order to detect events in multimedia surveillance systems. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical probabilistic assimilation approach to detect atomic and compound events. To detect an event, our framework uses not only the media streams available at the current instant but it also utilizes their two important properties- first, accumulated past history of whether they have been providing concurring or <b>contradictory</b> <b>evidences,</b> and- second, the system designer’s confidence in them.

25|$|To {{explain the}} small stature of H.nbsp&floresiensis, Brown et al. have {{suggested}} that in the limited food environment on Flores, H.nbsp&erectus evolved a smaller body size via insular dwarfism, a form of speciation which has been observed in other species on Flores alsonbsp&– including several species of the proboscidean genus Stegodon, an elephant-like creature.
