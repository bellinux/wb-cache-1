40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{relative}} performance of uncrushed aggregates and <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for concrete in strength gaining. The study was conducted for medium grade concrete (concrete having cube compressive strength at 28 days between 6 Mpa to 50 Mpa). There is a general belief that <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> contribute higher strength in concreting compared to uncrushed aggregates. Contrary to this belief, our study revealed: uncrushed aggregates perform better than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> in gaining strength for medium grade concrete. From the laboratory test of strength determination it was explored that uncrushed aggregate provide more strength (22 % at 28 days) than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for medium grade concrete. Similar results were found for low grade concrete (cube strength at 28 days up to 15 Mpa) in a previous study relevant to mention: uncrushed aggregate is cheaper than crushed aggregate in the market of Bangladesh. Consequently, concrete with uncrushed aggregates will be cheaper. It can be concluded that uncrushed aggregates are appropriate for medium grade concrete for better performance {{in terms of strength}} and economy.

40|$|Due to {{increasingly}} strict {{environmental regulations}} regarding extraction of gravel the concrete industry {{need to reduce}} the use of gravel {{and replace it with}} <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> in concrete. Gravel is very suitable for concrete because of its round grain shape with a smooth surface and very often also a suitable particle size distribution. <b>Crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> very often have a more flake grain shape and higher content of fine particles. The characteristic of <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> depends on parameters such as; type of rock, crushing method and degree of refinement. With a suitable rock type and by choosing the right crushing setup it is possible to produce <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for concrete. The use of VSI crushers may improve the grain shape but is not always necessary. In case of very high content of fines an air classifier can be used to reduce the filler content (or by washing). Concrete consists of cement, water, aggregates and very often also additional materials and admixtures. Replacing gravel with crushed aggregate as a direct 1 : 1 substitute might be difficult because of the grain shape of <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> and its higher fine content. Very often mix-design adjustments are required to achieve the same concrete properties as with gravel and to ensure the fresh concrete workability it might be needed to increase the cement paste. For environmental and concrete technical reasons, it is desirable to substitute gravel with <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> without increasing the cement paste and to succeed, it requires some kind of refinement of the hard rock. When choosing crush methods to improve the properties of the <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> decisions always include economic considerations and it is necessary to understand how varying degrees of processing effect the concrete properties. This include a need for test methods that makes it possible to determine if a crushed material is good enough for concrete. This master thesis aims to investigate if it is possible to determine if a crushed aggregate is suitable for concrete by using some practical and simple aggregate test methods. Aggregates with different degree of refinement has been used in the study; conventional crushed and materials processed with a VSI and an air classifier. Fine aggregates 0 / 4 mm and also the properties of the fines, particles smaller than 0, 25 mm, {{have a major impact on}} the concrete workability so focus in this investigation is <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> smaller than 4 mm. The results from this work show that there are correlations between the outcomes from aggregate tests and from concrete tests and that it is possible to assess if a crushed material is suitable for concrete without carry out a large scale concrete tests. It is difficult to assess a material with only one single aggregate test method but a combination of two tests methods describes well how the material will behave in a concrete. Important when producing <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for concrete is the particle shape and the particle size distribution. These two parameters are important for how the material affects the concrete properties and aggregate test methods that can describe these parameters are desirable.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} from a comparison study of two methods, the sieve stability test and the J-ring test, for testing the resistance of fresh self-compacting concrete (SCC) to segregation.

Different mixes of fresh SCC with natural, blended natural and crushed, and <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> were tested in parallel using both the test methods. Concrete were cast in plastic pipes with 2 m height using some of representative mixes with <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Specimens from different heights were taken for testing compressive strength and chloride migration coefficient.

40|$|Crushed rock {{becomes more}} and more common as {{aggregate}} in concrete, due to the restriction to use natural gravel. Today <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> is commonly used from the size of 8 mm and upwards. Natural gravel is still used for the finer gradings.

In order to use <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> in all fractions in concrete {{it is important to have}} more knowledge about the rock material, crushing techniques and the influence on rheology of the concrete. In this project, a method has been developed to describe the geometrical characteristics of <b>crushed</b> fine <b>aggregates.</b> The materials have been sieved into different fractions and sample for analysis have been prepared for three different fractions. The method is based on image analysis where images of the material are taken with scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy.

40|$|Rewetting events after {{a drought}} produce a pulse of soil {{respiration}} (the “Birch Effect”) {{that leads to}} a loss of carbon from soil, especially in Mediterranean ecosystems. Two main hypotheses have developed to explain the Birch effect: the “metabolic explanation”, based on the rapid consumption of intracellular osmolytes previously accumulated to survive to dry conditions, and the “physical explanation”, based on the consumption of carbon made accessible by physical destruction of internal structures of the soil. Here, we compared the respiration response of intact and crushed 9 e 4 mm aggregates from a California grassland soil under two different rewetting schemes: (1) successive short dry/wet events and (2) increased drought periods followed by a single rewetting. In intact aggregates, both microbial biomass and respiration rates were relatively stable through both experimental treatments. In <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates,</b> through multiple short dry/wet cycles, both respiration rate and microbial biomass increased, while as drought length increased, biomass was unaffected but the magnitude of the following rewetting pulse increased. A mechanism that explains both these results is that crushing aggregates exposes occluded particular material that must be degraded into an immediately bioavailable form for microbes to take it up and metabolize it. Nitrification was generally higher in intact than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates,</b> suggesting the importance of physical association between nitrifiers and resources in regulating overall soil nitrification. This work suggests that physical processes are most important in driving respiration pulses through multiple rewetting cycles and that the physical association of organisms, substrates, and mineral particles are critical in controlling the functioning of the “microbial landscape”...|$|E

40|$|Recycled {{concrete}} aggregates (RCA) {{are used}} in new concrete mixes, termed recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Among losses in most fresh and hardened properties, literature reports that RAC suffers increased levels of drying shrinkage compared to equivalent mixes incorporating conventional aggregates. This paper describes the procedure and results {{of a range of}} experiments conducted on a commercial RCA and its use in new concrete mixes. In particular, this work quantifies the effect 100 % RCA has on the drying shrinkage of the resulting concrete. A commercially available RCA was characterised by analysing the particle shape and texture, percentage of solid contaminants, particle size distribution, water absorption and particle densities. The types of rocks present were analysed through the preparation of thin sections. Three concrete mixes were prepared and tested for workability, 7 and 28 day compressive strengths and 112 days of drying shrinkage. The mixes included a 40 MPa control mix incorporating natural <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> and two equivalent RAC mixes, one with 30 % fly ash as a partial cement replacement and one without. The results indicated that the commercial RCA has been produced quite efficiently with negligible solid contaminants. However, due to adhered mortar found on the aggregate particles, the RCA was found to have rougher particle textures, increased water absorptions and lower densities than conventional <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Due to these properties and the subsequent increased water demand the RAC mixes suffered lower compressive strengths and higher drying shrinkages than the control mix.
