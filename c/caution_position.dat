50|$|Penske Racing's primary defense {{concentrated}} on their {{interpretations of the}} IRL rulebook. They stated that at the commencement of a yellow <b>caution</b> period, the <b>positioning</b> of the cars is a judgement call made quickly by the officials. They also stated that the ruling of a car passing another car under a caution period is specifically listed as not protestable or appealable under the existing rules.|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONTranshiatal oesophagectomy is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} technique for resection of tumours of the lower oesophagus. We present a life-threatening complication associated with the placement of a corrugated neck drain during this procedure. PRESENTATION OF CASEOur patient underwent a transhiatal oesophagectomy for a lower oesophageal tumour. He developed persistent bilateral pneumothoraces despite chest drain insertions. Following removal of the corrugated neck drain, both lungs were successfully re-inflated. DISCUSSIONTo the authors’ knowledge, this serious complication has been described only once before in the medical literature; other surgeons should {{be made aware of}} this problem. CONCLUSIONAlternative drainage systems should be considered to help prevent this injury. Exercise <b>caution</b> if <b>positioning</b> corrugated drains in the neck...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{agricultural}} {{growth in}} sub-Saharan Africa is sometimes {{attributed to the}} absence of major technological breakthroughs suited to its agroclimatic environment. This implies that there is little room for growth in agricultural production in the existing technological environment. Viewed in this way, development of superior technologies becomes the most important issue in policies for accelerating agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Without belittling the importance of improved technology, the two chapters under discussion <b>caution</b> against this <b>position.</b> Book chapterPRIFPRI...|$|R
60|$|The Mohican {{had indeed}} made his {{appearance}} {{in the same direction}} as that by which Jasper had rejoined his friends. Instead of coming directly on, however, no sooner did he pass the bend, where he was concealed from any who might be higher up stream, than he moved close under the bank; and, using the utmost <b>caution,</b> got a <b>position</b> where he could look back, with his person sufficiently concealed by the bushes to prevent its being seen by any in that quarter.|$|R
25|$|At {{this point}} in the series, Hutton faced {{pressure}} from the press: journalists found fault with his <b>caution,</b> the <b>positions</b> in which he placed fielders and his use of bowlers. However, the selectors were also criticised for continuing to appoint Hutton as captain on a match-by-match basis instead of for the whole series. Hutton believed that they may have been looking unsuccessfully for an alternative captain. Hutton again faced fitness concerns going into the third Test, not declaring himself fit until just before the match. Rain prevented a result; Hutton scored 66, Wisden complementing his strokeplay, and earned praise for securing a psychological advantage in pressuring Australia on a turning pitch in their second innings, even though a result was out of the question. Finding the English spinners very difficult to play, Australia collapsed to 35 for eight before time ran out. After the match, the Australians came under pressure from press who began to search for reasons for the team's perceived poor performances. In contrast, Hutton was appointed captain {{for the rest of the}} series, as well as for the forthcoming M.C.C. winter tour of West Indies.|$|R
5000|$|J. L. Austin and John Searle's {{speech act}} {{theory has been}} {{described}} by several ethnographers, anthropologists, and linguists as being based in a specifically Western linguistic ideology that renders it inapplicable in certain ethnographic contexts. [...] Jef Verschueren characterized speech act theory as privileging “a privatized view of language that emphasizes the psychological state of the speaker while downplaying the social consequences of speech,” [...] while Michael Silverstein argued that the theory’s ideas about language “acts” and “forces” are “projections of covert categories typical in the metapragmatic discourse of languages such as English.” [...] Scholars have subsequently used speech act theory to <b>caution</b> against the <b>positioning</b> of linguistic theories as universal applicable, citing that any account of language will reflect the linguistic ideologies held by those who develop it.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{automobiles}} have complex instrumentation. In {{addition to}} displays of {{engine rotational speed}} and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission <b>position).</b> <b>Cautions</b> may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded {{so they can be}} reported to diagnostic equipment. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent airbag systems which contain sensors, logic and actuators. Anti-skid braking systems use sensors to control the brakes, while cruise control affects throttle position. A wide variety of services can be provided via communication links as the OnStar system. Autonomous cars (with exotic instrumentation) have been demonstrated.|$|R
60|$|In this instance, {{the dead}} tree that {{contained}} the canoe {{of which they}} had come in quest lay about half-way between the extremity of the narrow slip of land and {{the place where it}} joined the main shore; and knowing that there was water so near him on his left, the old man led the way along {{the eastern side of the}} belt with some confidence walking boldly, though still with caution. He had landed at the point expressly to get a glimpse into the bay and to make certain that the coast was clear; otherwise he would have come ashore directly abreast of the hollow tree. There was no difficulty in finding the latter, from which the canoe was drawn as before, and instead of carrying it down to the place where Deerslayer lay, it was launched at the nearest favorable spot. As soon as it was in the water, Hurry entered it, and paddled round to the point, whither Hutter also proceeded, following the beach. As the three men had now in their possession all the boats on the lake, their confidence was greatly increased, and there was no longer the same feverish desire to quit the shore, or the same necessity for extreme <b>caution.</b> Their <b>position</b> on the extremity of the long, narrow bit of land added to the feeling of security, as it permitted an enemy to approach in only one direction, that in their front, and under circumstances that would render discovery, with their habitual vigilance, almost certain. The three now landed together, and stood grouped in consultation on the gravelly point.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reexamine the {{assumption}} in American historiography that the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s monumental decision in the Civil Rights Cases striking down the 1875 Civil Rights Act represented the end of the Nineteenth Century commitment to 2 ̆ 2 equality under the law 2 ̆ 2 and the civil rights issue. The evidence shows that while the decision had overwhelming support, much of this was support for the Court’s view that such legislation was not within the scope of Federal power. Eleven states responded to the Supreme Court’s decision by rapidly enacting civil rights legislation. The research centered on gathering data (legislative journals, proposed bills, and newspapers) to examine the depth and nature of this response. The evidence does seem to suggest that the legacy of 2 ̆ 2 equality under the law 2 ̆ 2 did continue into the 1880 ’s. Also the great degree, of partisan behavior displayed by some toward the bills and the <b>caution</b> in defining <b>positions</b> shown by others indicates that politicians were very concerned with the power of the black voter. The black man 2 ̆ 7 s rights and the black man 2 ̆ 7 s vote were not forgotten by the politicians in the 18802 ̆ 7 s...|$|R
40|$|Birth {{injuries}} of the new-born infants {{might be}} caused either by mechanical or anoxic traumas that occur during the birth. The injuries {{might be a}} result of insufficient attention or inadequate efforts of the obstetrician but might as well occur completely independently of the obstetrician´s activities. The character and extent of birth injuries are very wide and vary from the insignificant ones that are cured completely without any consequences to those that leave long-term consequences and that may even end in the death of the new-born infant. Cranial injuries of the new-born infants include: caput succedaneum (swollen scalp), cephalohaematoma, petechiae, suffusion, eye injuries, scalpel-incised wounds, parietal bones fractures, spinal cord injuries and intracranial haemorrhage. This Baccalaureate thesis surveys the knowledge of the nursing staff as far as birth cranial injuries are concerned and concentrates also at specific aspects of nursing new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum (swollen scalp) and cephalohaematoma. The theoretical part comprises the most important pieces of medical knowledge in nursing new-born infants with birth cranial injuries. The first goal of this thesis was to map the level of knowledge of the birth cranial injuries among the nursing staff. In compliance with this goal a hypothesis was stipulated: ?Members of the nursing staff are well-informed about birth cranial injuries. ? This hypothesis was verified and confirmed. It was found out that members of the nursing staff have good knowledge about birth cranial injuries, their predispositions and prevention. A quantitative research was carried out using the questioning method (the questionnaire technique was used). The research was carried out at the Neonatal Departments of the hospitals Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s, Nemocnice Písek, a. s. and Nemocnice Strakonice, a. s. The second goal of this thesis was to map the specific aspects of nursing new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum (swollen scalp) and cephalohaematoma. In compliance with this goal a research question was stipulated: ?What are the specific aspects of nursing the new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma?? It was found out that nursing new-born infants with caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma does not comprise many specific aspects. The {{most important thing is to}} nurse such infants carefully and with <b>caution,</b> to <b>position</b> their heads on the side without caput succedaneum or cephalohaematoma, to check regularly the bilirubin level, to observe carefully the cephalohaematoma or caput succedaneum (its colour, size, localization) and to watch the behaviour of the new-born, mainly whether it shows any signs of pain. The research was carried out in a qualitative way using the question method ? the depth interview technique. The research file consisted of two nurses and two midwives from the Neonatal Department of the České Budějovice Hospital, a. s. The research has revealed that the nursing staff at neonatal departments is well informed about birth cranial injuries and that the nursing methods applied at new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma do not differ much from the methods used in case of physiological infants. The output of the thesis is an educative material concerning birth cranial injuries that is intended for the nursing staff at neonatal departments...|$|R
