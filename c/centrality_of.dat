5|$|The commonness and <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> wine {{in daily}} life in biblical times is {{apparent}} from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E

Although two results look similar, we can observe from the periodic graph that the nodes 3 and 4 {{are much more}} important than the node 1 but the classical betweenness <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> nodes 3 and 4 are larger than that of node 1 by only 8.3  %. By means of our definition and algorithm, the betweenness <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> nodes 3 and 4 are larger than that of node 1 by 50  %. Therefore, we strongly believe that our betweenness centralities are better than the classical definition for the 1 -dimensional periodic graph. In the following section, we provide experimental results to prove the above belief.|$|R

5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of {{inspiration}} for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> {{the doctrine of}} not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that {{does not apply to}} anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E

This paper attempts to use agent-based modeling techniques associated with geographic information to study the affiliation network between churches and participants. Using churches in ZIP Code 30318 in Atlanta in Georgia, this study specifies the preferences of participants as personal radii and choice patterns. Results suggest (1) personal radii of participants are positively related {{to the size of}} affiliation network and the <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> churches; (2) the change of choice pattern of participants can lead to a sharp reduction in size of the affiliation network of churches; (3) The <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> churches among the affiliation network are corresponding to population density of census tracts.

This article presents {{a study on the}} application of social network analysis (SNA) to combating this problem.

In this study, it is utilised to analyse supply chains for the identification of parties that are likely to be involved in counterfeiting activities. After identifying the suspects in a supply chain, the company can deter and detect counterfeiting by tightening surveillance on these parties. The feasibility of using SNA as an anti-counterfeiting tool is investigated in a case study, the findings of which indicate that SNA can effectively help companies to prevent sources of counterfeit products from infiltrating into the supply chain.

40|$|In {{real world}} complex networks, the {{importance}} of a node depends on two important parameters: 1. characteristics of the node, and 2. the context of the given application. The current literature contains several centrality measures that have been defined to measure {{the importance of}} a node based on the given application requirements. These centrality measures assign a centrality value to each node that denotes its importance index. But in real life applications, we are more interested in the relative importance of the node that can be measured using its centrality rank based on the given centrality measure. To compute the <b>centrality</b> rank <b>of</b> a node, we need to compute the <b>centrality</b> value <b>of</b> all the nodes and compare them to get the rank. This process requires the entire network. So, it is not feasible for real-life applications due to the large size and dynamic nature of real world networks. In the present project, we aim to propose fast and efficient methods to estimate the global <b>centrality</b> rank <b>of</b> a node without computing the <b>centrality</b> value <b>of</b> all nodes. These methods can be further extended to estimate the rank without having the entire network. The proposed methods use the structural behavior <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> measures, sampling techniques, or the machine learning models. In this work, we also discuss how to apply these methods for degree and closeness centrality rank estimation...|$|R
