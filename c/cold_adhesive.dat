40|$|In the roofing industry, {{modified}} bitumen membranes {{are generally}} applied by torching {{with an open}} flame or mopping with hot bitumen or asphalt and <b>cold</b> <b>adhesive.</b> These methods can ensure a strong and watertight seam of overlapping membranes. However, mopping creates health and odor concerns while torching carries the risk of fire. Use of cold-applied, solvent-based adhesives is growing rapidly {{but there are still}} limitations associated with volatile organic compound (VOC) issues and longer curing times than torched or mopped systems. A growing demand for self-adhesive roof membranes, driven in part by insurance companies and legislation to increase the safety of the installation workers, stimulates the development of suitable formulations to improve the quality and expand the scope of these products. Although there are regional differences, premium self-adhesive roofing compounds are generally composed of multiple ingredients: bitumen/asphalt, a mixture of SBS and SIS block copolymers, SB di-block polymer, tackifying resin, naphthenic oil, oxidise...|$|E

40|$|On-demand binding {{requires}} {{books to}} be printed and finished in quick turnaround time. In order {{to serve the}} on-demand binding market, the binders have the options of hot melt <b>adhesives</b> or <b>cold</b> emulsion <b>adhesives.</b> <b>Cold</b> emulsion <b>adhesive</b> bookbinding has been available in the industry for a long time. In the past few years, this type of binding process was more favorable as compared to hot melt because of its durability, flexibility, and strength. But the process of cold emulsion binding faced a serious drawback of curing time where the bound bookblock requires {{a minimum of two}} hrs. of curing time before trimming when books are cured naturally. As of recent technological advancement, it is possible now to bind a book by <b>cold</b> emulsion <b>adhesive</b> and trim it in 15 minutes after forced cured. This process is offered by Planax North America, Inc. There has been no testing done where the study evaluates the two different curing processes for <b>cold</b> emulsion <b>adhesives,</b> namely natural curing and accelerated curing on a preheated plate. Consequently, this thesis research investigates both curing processes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate which curing process is better suited for <b>cold</b> emulsion <b>adhesives.</b> This was accomplished by comparing page-pull and page-flex values taken from thirty five books cured by each curing process (total of seventy books). Moffett page-pull and page-flex testing equipment were used for this test. It was found that natural curing resulted in higher page-pull values whereas forced curing resulted in higher page-flex. However, it was noticed that both types of curing process resulted in page-pull and page-flex values within the recommended industrial bookbinding guidelines. It can be inferred that on-demand books can be cured by forced curing which ultimately results into faster turnaround for production benefits yet books are within the industrial guidelines in regard to page-pull and page-flex strength values...|$|R

Three-ply experimental LVL from OPT veneers were bonded using two adhesive spread levels, 250 and 500 g m - 2 for single glue line. Laminated veneer lumber from rubberwood was used as control. The dimensional stability properties investigated include dimensional changes associated with changes in relative humidity of 30 to 90 %, hysteresis over a range of 30 to 90 % and durability against biological attack through soil burial. Amongst the three adhesives, OPT LVL manufactured with EPI (VAc) had the highest Fibre Saturation Point (FSP) and the least was experienced by OPT LVL bonded with PVAc. Totally, the magnitude of hysteresis was below 1. 00 which in the average 0. 69 to 0. 82 for OPT LVL panels while rubberwood LVL, 0. 81 to 0. 94, respectively.

Foil spools from an unwind and is nipped to a substrate. Foil sticks to the tacky adhesive on the substrate, and an image with a bright foil surface is created. Foil that does not adhere to the adhesive remains on a thin polyester liner, and waste is directed to a rewind spool. Because the adhesive is applied on press like a conventional ink, no expensive stamping die has to be created.|$|R

40|$|Generally, it is {{relatively}} easy to obtain a high joint strength with most modern bonding systems if these are cured under ideal factory conditions. However, civil engineering construction joints are cured on site and are required to last the lifetime of the structural member in harsh environmental conditions. This implies that site joints might not be constructed and cured as well as those fabricated in the factory. The paper compares two possible methods for bonding an FRP composite patch/plate to a steel adherend suitable for construction sites. The first method utilises the accepted technique of bonding two dissimilar materials using a two-part <b>cold</b> cure <b>adhesive.</b> The second method employs a pre-impregnated FRP composite plate in conjunction with a compatible film adhesive; these comparisons are undertaken by examining the results of double-strap butt joint tests. A possible site technique using the pre-impregnated FRP composite to upgrade a steel beam whilst it is under a low frequency vibration load is investigated; this represents the repair of a steel bridge constantly under traversing traffic. The butt joint test results show that on average, the pre-impregnated composite in conjunction with the film adhesive leads to a failure load which is 15 % higher than that of the <b>cold</b> setting <b>adhesive</b> technique. The results of the rehabilitated beam tests show that the bonded joint between the pre-impregnated CFRP composite and the steel adherend did not suffer any significant damage from the low frequency vibrations imposed upon the steel beam during the cure period.

Though the Adhesive Applied Roof Systems (AARS) are gaining popularity in North America, systematic review of the existing national and international standards revealed that there is no proper testing procedure established to quantify the peel resistance of AARS. The objective of the present study is to develop a peel testing procedure based on systematic laboratory investigations. Specimens (6 in. x 6 in. or 152 mm x 152 mm) composed of insulation and cover board were adhered together by applying <b>cold</b> <b>adhesives.</b> To represent the realistic conditions of the field construction, specimens were prepared using components from four industrial sources. Specimens were then subjected to a peeling force at two different locations with various peel angles ranging from 7. 5 ° to 45 ° to simulate the blister shape, that can occur on AARS under several wind action. Additional specimen sizes were also tested for selected combinations to evaluate the size effect. A total of 378 specimens with various physical parameters were constructed, cured for 28 days and tested using an Instron machine at a constant loading speed. For all cases, the failure load as well as the failure mode was recorded. Data analysis indicates that the failure load decreases as the peel angle increases, though it increases with the sample size. Generalized curves reflecting the peel resistance versus peel angle and the sample size are presented. Failure mode analysis identified the weakest link of the AARS samples under simulated wind induced peeling force. Based on the experimental investigation, a standard peel test method was drafted. This standard has an essential importance for the evaluation of AARS performance under wind-induced peel forces, which will be applicable to the new roofing assemblies as well as the existing roofing assembly to be replaced or recovered...|$|R

40|$|Susceptors are {{an example}} of one of the many new {{products}} being introduced into food packaging. They are used to achieve local areas of high temperature; this has the effect of browning the food during microwave cooking. Previous work by Begley et al. had suggested that one particular <b>cold</b> cure <b>adhesive</b> component, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), might be present in some susceptor products but gave little indication as to the retail use of these products. As a result an investigation of UK retail samples was carried out in January 1992. Most of the susceptors tested contained no detectable BADGE (< 0. 1 mg/kg), however, two brands of pizza were found to be packaged with susceptors containing BADGE at between 700 and 800 mg/kg (1. 8 - 2. 0 mg/dm 2). Migration of BADGE into the pizzas in question was 01 - 0. 7 mg/kg when they were cooked in their packaging according to on-pack instructions. Further tests undertaken in June 1992 confirmed earlier findings when from a total of 54 samples purchased covering seven manufacturers, nine samples of susceptors used in one brand contained BADGE at concentrations between 1900 and 3200 mg/kg. The manufacturer of this brand has stopped supplying further products to the retail market using this particular type of susceptor. A third set of tests was undertaken in November 1992 to ensure that these products were no longer on sale in the UK. Of 44 susceptors analysed, only one contained BADGE above 0. 1 mg/kg; this appeared to be old stock pre-dating the manufacturers’ action. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is {{a massive}} {{engineered}} wood product made of orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber, and is intended for roof, floor, or wall applications. Although it was developed in Europe in the early 90 s, CLT is relatively new to North America. CLT products must be certified for structural use. First North American product standard stipulating test methods and qualification criteria for benchmark structural properties and adhesive bond integrity in structural CLT is ANSI/APA PRG 320 - 2012. These methods and criteria have been adapted from existing laminated timber products (glulam), sometimes disregarding substantial differences between parallel laminates and CLT, in which layers are perpendicular to each other. From {{the point of view}} of long term sustainability of the CLT industry in North America, the critical questions are: 1. Is it possible to use low-grade timber harvested in the Pacific Northwest region in CLT products without compromising critical engineering parameters? Utilization of low- grade lumber, which is typically under-valued, in value-added engineered products should reduce the pressure on the high end structural lumber supply and may also provide a substantial outlet for lower-grade lumber timber species, including beetle-killed pine (BKP) harvested in the affected areas. 2. Can alternative adhesive systems, currently used in related engineered wood products and manufactured by domestic industry, be successfully used in CLT production? This is an important question, and is related to the fact that polyurethane (PUR) is the primary adhesive currently used by CLT manufacturing industry, and is supplied worldwide by a single Europe-based company. This adhesive is optimized for the species commonly used in CLT products to-date. ANSI/APA PRG 320 - 2012 standard allows alternative adhesive types (PRF and EPI are specifically named), but to-date, only one alternative (MUF) has been used in commercial products. The objective of this project is to determine effective adhesive systems and bonding pressures for the hybrid cross-laminated timber (CLT) combinations. A secondary objective is to evaluate the testing methods prescribed in PRG 320 - 2012 for cross-laminated bond integrity. Integrity of hybrid CLT layups was evaluated on small specimens derived from CLT billets fabricated in-house using test procedures and qualification criteria specified in ANSI/APA PRG 320 - 2012 section 8. 2. 3. Test results were compared to prescribed qualification criteria. The Hybrid CLT combinations for this study include both structural grade lumber and low-grade lumber. For a reference species, lodgepole pine was selected, since it is a member of the US-SPF group closely related to the European species commonly used for CLT construction. The structural-grade, local species will be represented by Douglas-fir, while the low-grade species will be represented by low-grade lodgepole Pine, Douglas-fir, and Western Hemlock. The two adhesive systems investigated were 1) polyurethane-based PUR (currently the most common adhesive used by the CLT industry), which will serve as a reference system, and 2) phenol-resorcinol formaldehyde (PRF), which will represent a potential domestic alternative. PRF was chosen because it is a <b>cold</b> setting <b>adhesive</b> commonly used by the engineered wood products industry in North America; however, no CLT manufacturers utilize this adhesive system. The variables included species combinations (6), adhesive types (2), and clamping pressures (3), with repetition of 9 specimens per combination coming from at least three different CLT billets. The specimen’s bond integrity was assessed by the qualification panel requirements in PRG 320 - 2012 section 8. 2. The qualification tests are block shear and cyclic delamination. A combination must pass both of the test requirements to qualify. The results of the study show that, of the 36 combinations, six failed the block shear test requirements and twenty-five failed the delamination test requirements. The 10 variable combinations that passed both requirements were DDL 10 F, DDL 40 F, DPL 40 F, PPH 10 F, PPH 69 F, PPH 10 U, PPH 40 U, PPL 10 U, PPL 69 U, and PHL 69 U. Initial inspection of test results show that no single variable that seems to make a significant impact on the bond integrity. It did reveal that no combinations with the use of Douglas-fir as a face material and PUR as an adhesive met the requirement, and only one combination with western hemlock as a core material met the requirements. It is evident that the delamination test was the major restriction on whether or not a combination passes the bond qualification. We believe that the adaption of a delamination test standard designed for layers with parallel grains makes the passing requirement too strict for an orthogonally bonded product. In conclusion, there were 10 combinations that passed both bond integrity test requirements. It was unclear whether the species and/or grade combination, adhesive system, or clamping pressure made the biggest impact on the bond integrity. Relative to the reference adhesive (PUR), and species combination (lodgepole pine), the hybrid panels performed similarly and showed that certain species and/or grade combinations could pass the qualification requirements for specific requirements. The knowledge gained by this screening study will allow further qualification testing of the passing combinations per PRG 320 - 2012. This also has the potential to supply the CLT manufacturing community with greater flexibility of manufacturing techniques and materials, as well as offer value to underutilized lumber...|$|R
