25|$|Regarding {{the issue}} of whether the breadth of infant {{attachment}} functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, {{it should be noted that}} continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports. The original Richter's et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases. Readers further interested in the categorical versus <b>continuous</b> <b>nature</b> of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters & T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.|$|E

40|$|Speech rhythm in the {{different}} Arabic dialects investigated has been consistently described as stress-timed. At the same time, there is preliminary evidence from perceptual experiments that listeners use speech rhythm cues to distinguish speakers from North Africa {{from those of the}} Middle East. In an attempt to elucidate the apparent contradiction, an acoustic investigation of the proportion of vocalic intervals and the standard deviation of consonantal intervals in six dialects (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and Jordan) was carried out using procedures put forth by Ramus & al [1]. The results show that complex syllable and reduced vowels in the Western dialects, and longer vowels in the Eastern dialects seem to be the main factors responsible for differences in rhythmic structures. The paper also raises questions about the discrete or <b>continuous</b> <b>natures</b> of rhythm types...|$|R

2500|$|Modern shanties {{were used}} to {{accompany}} work at the patent windlass, {{which was designed to}} raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of pumping hand brakes. The up and down motion of the brake levers lent the action a binary form that was well-suited by many of the same songs used as halyard shanties. And yet, the <b>continuous</b> <b>nature</b> of the task also meant grand choruses were possible. So while halyard shanties and capstan shanties tended to be exclusive of one another, windlass shanties sometimes shared repertoire with each of those other types.

2500|$|Broadly speaking, the {{categories}} for shanties {{can be understood}} in terms of whether the task(s) for which they were used was/were related to hauling or heaving. [...] "Hauling" [...] (pulling) actions were intermittent in nature. They required a coordinated show of focused exertion, not sustained, but rather at specific moments. Shanties for hauling tasks thus coordinated the timing of those exertions, the [...] "pulls." [...] "Heaving" [...] (pushing) actions were of a <b>continuous</b> <b>nature.</b> In these, coordination was of minor importance as compared to pacing. Rather than rhythmically timing the labor, shanties for heaving were more intended to set an appropriate, manageable pace and to occupy or inspire workers throughout the duration of what could often be long tasks.|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} {{discussion}} {{it can be}} inferred that many a times in real world the original variables may be <b>continuous</b> in <b>nature</b> but discrete by observation and hence it is reasonable and convenient to model the situation by an appropriate discrete distribution generated from the underlying continuous models preserving one or more important traits of the continuous distribution.|$|R

40|$|Patterns in {{morphological}} variability {{have been}} the main basis for conventional genetic improvement program, particularly in selective breeding. Proper understanding on these patterns hence, is of crucial prerequisite before any scheme of breeding program is undertaken. This study was aimed to explore those morphological variations with emphasis on the assessment of among-population and among-trait variations and assessment of predictive traits that may serve for inter-population differentiation.  A total 281 individuals representing four natural populations (Asahan, Ogan, Barito, and Ciasem) and one domesticated stock (GIMacro) were sampled and analyzed for variability in thirteen morphological traits. While descriptive analyses were applied to analyze both among-stock and among-trait variations, discriminant function analysis was used {{to search for the}} best traits for interpopulation differentiation. The relative variability, expressed in the coefficient of variation (CV), was used to compare the amount and patterns of morphometric variability both among traits and between stocks. Results showed that total body weight was the most variable trait while the length and meristic traits were of lower level. Discriminant analysis found that rostrum length and abdoment length to be the best morphological discriminators among intraspecific populations. However, the <b>continuous</b> <b>natures</b> of these traits make them have limited applicability for intraspecific population differentiation...|$|R
