50|$|In 1987, in {{an effort}} to shift the burden of {{financial}} responsibility from ranchers to the proponents of wolf reintroduction, Defenders of Wildlife set up a “wolf compensation fund” that would use donations to pay ranchers market value for any stock that was lost to wolf depredation. That same year, a final recovery plan was released. Following a long period of research, public education, and public commenting, a draft EIS was released for public review in 1993 and it received over 150,000 <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties.</b> It was finalized in May 1994, and included a clause that specified that all wolves reintroduced to the recovery zones would be classified under the “experimental, non-essential” provision of the ESA. Though the original plan called for three recovery zones - one in Idaho, another in Montana, and a final one in the Greater Yellowstone Area - the Montana recovery zone was eliminated from the final EIS after it had been proven that a small, but breeding population had already established itself in the northwestern part of the state. The plan stipulated that each of the three recovery areas must have ten breeding pairs of wolves successfully rearing two or more pups for three consecutive years before the minimum recovery goals would be reached.|$|E

40|$|To solicit Commission {{direction}} {{regarding the}} alternative to be pursued in regulating the safety of fuel cycle facilities. SUMMARY: In the staff requirements memorandum (SRM) dated January 15, 1993, the Commission directed the staff to upgrade and more clearly define the regulatory base for major fuel cycle licensees. In March 1995 the Commission directed the staff to reconsider the plan to modify 10 CFR Part 70, "Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material, " and to discuss with major fuel cycle licensees the draft proposed rule that was being developed. Workshops were conducted in May and November 1995 to solicit <b>comments</b> and information <b>from</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties.</b> Based on this input, six alternatives for Commission consideration have been developed. Commission direction on how staff should proceed is requested. BACKGROUND: After the potential criticality incident that occurred at the General Electric (GE) Nuclear Fuel an...|$|R
40|$|Harmonization of {{accounting}} financial reporting standards {{is defined as}} a way of decreasing the diversity between local accounting standards that facilitate cross-national capital flows and stimulate economic growth. Investigation into the accounting standard-setting strategies can be related practically to the study of harmonization, since the ability to dominate the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) can create an obstacle in harmonization {{of accounting}} standards and subsequently the flow of capital worldwide. The study aims to reveal that a valid and effective accounting standard, which formerly issued, may reflect the needs and expectation of few interested powerful bodies due to the neutral comments and dearth of lobbyists in the process of setting the standard. Therefore the research investigates the working of the IASB, by exploring the standard setting process specifically in relation to the standard on business combinations which has been on the agenda {{over an extended period of}} time. The written submissions in response to 14 issues, proposed in Exposure Draft 61 (1997), to revise IAS 22 “Business Combination ” are analyzed to understand whether various <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> different <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> deliberately affect IASB’s decision. The situations in which any of the lobbyists (e. g. Anglo-American bodies) may exert influence are discussed. The results confirm an overall support to th...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is {{responsible}} for estimating the portion of Federal highway funds attributable to each State. The process involves use of State-reported data (gallons) {{and a set of}} estimation models when accurate State data is unavailable. To ensure that the distribution of funds is equitable, FHWA periodically reviews the estimation models. Estimation of the use of gasohol is difficult because of State differences in the definition of gasohol, inability of many States to separate and report gasohol usage from other fuel types, changes in fuel composition in nonattainment areas to address concerns over the use of certain fuel additives, and the lack of a valid State-level surrogate data set for gasohol use. Under the sponsorship of FHWA, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) reviewed the regression-based gasohol estimation model that has been in use for several years. Based on an analytical assessment of that model and an extensive review of potential data sets, ORNL developed an improved rule-based model. The new model uses data from Internal Revenue Service, Energy Information Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, ORNL, and FHWA sources. The model basically consists of three parts: (1) development of a controlled total of national gasohol usage, (2) determination of reliable State gasohol consumption data, and (3) estimation of gasohol usage for all other States. The new model will be employed for the 2004 attribution process. FHWA is currently soliciting <b>comments</b> and inputs <b>from</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties.</b> Relevant data, as identified, will be pursued and refinements will be made by the research team if warranted...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper (Policy Research Working Paper 1546), the authors {{described}} a pioneer initiative of Sao Paulo's municipal and state governments, {{to give the}} private sector a concession on building and operating a number of"trunk"busways. At the time, the Sao Paulo Municipal Government had already awarded a number of busway corridors to private consortia, although the consortia had yet to get the financing needed to implement the investment plan. On the other hand, the state had not yet awarded its first corridor and was still adjusting the bidding documents based on <b>comments</b> received <b>from</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties.</b> In this paper, the authors describe what happened since then and draw lessons for the future. After a long, successful bidding process, this imaginative and pioneering program launched by the municipality failed to materialize because of problems in getting financing. Possibly the market felt that the risks involved in building and operating system outweighed the benefits and that the Sao Paulo and Brazilian market was not yet prepared to accept such a challenge without better partial risk guarantees. The state learned from {{the mistakes of the}} municipality and was successful in the concession of the Sao Mateus-Jabaquara corridor. Among the lessons learned from this project: 1) Private bus operators in Brazil are generally traditional entrepreneurs. They must be taught how to prepare financing plans or at least to get the best advice about putting together a project's financial engineering design. In this case, all consortia turned to BNDES (Brazilian National Social Development Bank) for financing, probably because their loan interests rates were lower than those of commercial banks but also because the concession was with the government. They did not consider other options such as the International Finance Corporation or other private-sector-related development institutions. 2) The Sao Paulo municipality should also have undertaken detailed economic evaluation of the projects, {{from the standpoint of the}} region as a whole, including the impact on other modes of transportation and on systems integration. Such analysis is required by all bilateral and multilateral development institutions, including BNDES. 3) When private operators are paid for vehicle-kilometer supplied and when the state collects all revenues and then pays the operators, concession contracts or operating revenues cannot be easily used as guarantees. Before defining tariff mechanism, governments should think through the impacts they might have on financing, since the revenues collected are often the best guarantee that can be offered.

40|$|Congress enacts, on {{a nearly}} {{continuous}} basis, {{a variety of}} laws that affect scientific research and progress. Some of these laws have an unquestionably positive effect. For instance, Congress 2 ̆ 7 s creation of the National Institutes of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and NASA; its various appropriations to fund ground-breaking research; and a multitude of other laws have incalculably advanced human knowledge, {{and it is to}} Congress 2 ̆ 7 s great credit that these laws have been and are continuing to be enacted. However, not all laws that affect the progress of sciences are an unalloyed good. Quite the opposite, often the laws aim to, and in fact do, retard the progress of scientific research. The question is then whether the benefit from those laws outweighs the costs imposed on scientific progress. Congress, however, often does not fully consider the costs that the legislation imposes on science, either for lack of information or as a result of conscious disregard for the views of a politically insignificant group. The public is not able to hold Congress accountable because it lacks an ability to participate in the process and lacks an objective basis against which to measure congressional action. The problem is not congressional malfeasance or ignorance but rather the structure of the legislative process itself The general public is often taught and told that lawmaking is a process that begins in a committee where the proposal is carefully studied, debated, amended, and voted on. The reality, of course, is much different. First, bills often skip the committee process, and amendments are often added last minute without a chance for a meaningful debate. But even where the process is followed, it is often hard to portray the committee hearings as a true deliberative process. Instead, they are often described as a Kabuki theater, where the Chair and the Ranking Member designate the witnesses they wish to call to support the preformulated position. Interested parties cannot provide testimony unless asked to do so by the relevant committee. Thus, oftentimes the people with the deepest knowledge, but low political skills, are cut out of the process. The end result is that Congress votes on legislation without fully understanding the implication thereof The voters also are injured in {{that it is hard to}} hold Congress accountable if one cannot point out that it ignored the views of the scientific communities. This Article proposes a solution to the problem. Bills that affect the progress of science ought to be evaluated by an independent body similar to the Congressional Budget Office. Like the CBO, this body would not have any authority to block a bill, but it would be able to 2 ̆ 2 score 2 ̆ 2 it (i. e., provide information on the effect the bill will have on research). In order to accomplish its task, this newly created body would be required to provide notice of pending legislation and then seek <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> the <b>interested</b> <b>parties,</b> much like what is done in the administrative rulemaking process. The comments then would be collected and analyzed, and the final report would be presented to Congress before it votes. Congress would continue to be able to vote as it pleases, but with this process in place, it would be forced to do so with its eyes wide open. By understanding the full scope and the implication for the scientific progress of the bills it wishes to enact, Congress would produce better legislation, which would be less detrimental to the scientific progres...|$|R
