25|$|Dr. Lawrence {{requested}} {{schools to}} launch “Operation clean-up” November 1979. The scheme took the practical form of <b>cleaning</b> <b>doors</b> and windows, removing dirt, dust and cobwebs, whitewashing, painting, and simple repairs. The science laboratory, library, storerooms, playground and classrooms {{were to be}} cleaned and made presentable. This was work experience, self-help, social training and practical work for students.|$|R
50|$|In this Leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member chose a chimney sweep {{instructor}} {{and then put}} on the traditional chimney sweep uniform. They {{then went to the}} roof of the building and used a weight with wire mesh on a rope to clean one of the chimneys three times. Once complete, they went to the basement and opened up one of the chimney <b>cleaning</b> <b>doors</b> that held their next clue.|$|R
50|$|In an {{experiment}} {{to test the}} vocalizations of grey parrots, four bred in captivity were placed in an aviary. Throughout the day they spent time {{in a room with}} toys and came into fairly regular contact with the humans taking care of them. The noises that these parrots could hear consisted of the calls of canaries in the laboratory, people <b>cleaning,</b> <b>doors</b> squeaking, etc. In the next 3 years, the parrots made over 50,000 vocalisations. What was interesting was that, although they were bred in captivity, the sounds they made were not only ones of their immediate surroundings. They also made calls similar to those of other captive grey parrots in different locations and even wild grey parrots.|$|R

25|$|Having left Chapman, Cradock {{began the}} next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling <b>cleaning</b> {{products}} <b>door</b> to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop. Things finally picked up for her when she began to work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of Auguste Escoffier, which proved influential. She later wrote passionately about the change from service à la française to service à la russe and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Tino, a 450-pound male western lowland gorilla, {{attacked}} and bit Robert Pratt, the zoo's team leader for primates. Tino {{gained access to}} a room which Pratt was <b>cleaning</b> after a <b>door</b> was left open. Pratt was knocked down by the gorilla and suffered some bite wounds. Pratt was ok and returned to work soon after the incident.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, The Boston Stump Restoration Trust and Development Appeal was {{launched}} {{to provide the}} means {{to carry out the}} restoration and development of St. Botolph's Church, Boston. The process of restoring this ancient landmark is underway and to date (2013) has included cleaning and conservation of the tower and West <b>Door,</b> <b>cleaning</b> and restoration of the chancel and Cotton Chapel, and the building of new visitor facilities which were officially opened by HRH Princess Royal in July 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever Hunter {{visits the}} site, {{the men are}} terrified he will find some excuse to sack them. This time, he gets Crass to suggest who to sack {{to make room for}} Easton. Crass {{mentions}} Owen, [...] "wi' his far-fetched ideas", and also [...] "them old men, sir. It’s them what’s holdin’ us back… Allers trying to do it proper.“ Hunter shouts at a terrified Linden - the oldest of the men - for taking too long <b>cleaning</b> down a <b>door</b> before painting. Later, he catches Linden smoking on the job and sacks him on the spot.|$|R
50|$|Between 1965 and 1966, {{the support}} walls, churchyard spaces and {{staircase}} were defined and expanded, {{which included the}} reinforcement of the northern, southern and western limits with cap-stone and erecting an eastern fence. The project also involved the cleaning and repair of the staircase access to the main chapel and removal of rubble from the doorway and cracks in the walls, doors, window frames and spaces. These improvements lead to the installation of exterior illumination in 1967 to attract tourism. Reconstruction of the support wall, the roofing, construction of interior doorways and painting of the exterior doors were completed {{at the beginning of}} 1970. Similar <b>cleaning</b> and lateral <b>door</b> replacement occurred by the end of 1979.|$|R
5000|$|The {{end of the}} 19th century saw the {{introduction}} of powered cleaners, although early types used some variation of blowing air to clean instead of suction. One appeared in 1898 when John S. Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri submitted a patent (US No. 634,042) for a [...] "pneumatic carpet renovator" [...] which blew dust into a receptacle. Thurman's system, powered by an internal combustion engine, traveled to the customers residence on a horse-drawn wagon {{as part of a}} <b>door</b> to <b>door</b> <b>cleaning</b> service. Corrine Dufour of Savannah, Georgia received two patents in 1899 and 1900 for another blown air system that seems to have featured the first use of an electric motor.|$|R
50|$|On May 4, 2009 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{confirmed}} that a 14-year-old student, Jesse, had H1N1 virus, {{also known as}} swine flu. This was the first reported case of H1N1 of a Georgia resident. The school was forced to close for fourteen days according to federal guidelines. All school events - athletic, educational, and fine arts - were canceled until further notice. The CDC changed its policy on school closures on May 5, and ELCA began to prepare to reopen on May 7. On May 6, the school had its second case of swine flu.In response to the infestation, the school entered a cleaning effort. School administrator Chuck Gilliam stated:"We are <b>cleaning</b> light switches, <b>door</b> handles, and other places students come in contact with..."On May 7, the school reopened. The students returned to class as normal, but new safety regulations {{were put in place}} to prevent transmission of swine flu by student to student contact. The school's reaction to the outbreak was viewed by parents and students as an example for future administrations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Studies have implicated Staphylococcus aureus as {{the leading}} cause of septicemia in the Tamale {{metropolis}} of Ghana. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus and Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the environments of three hospitals in Ghana. Methods A total of 120 swab samples were taken from door handles, stair railings and other points of contact at Tamale Teaching Hospital, Tamale Central Hospital and Tamale West Hospital. The swab samples were directly plated on Mannitol Salt and Baird Parker agar plates and incubated at 37  °C (± 2) for 18 – 24  h. An antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute’s guidelines. Isolates resistant to both cefoxitin and oxacillin were considered to be MRSA. Results A total of 47 (39 %) positive S. aureus samples were isolated from all three hospitals, of which, eight (17 %) were putative MRSA isolates. One MRSA isolate was resistant to all the antibiotics used (cefoxitin, oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim). Five of the MRSA isolates were multi-drug resistant, whilst the other three were resistant to only two antibiotics. All the multi-drug resistant MRSA isolates were resistant to at least four antibiotics. The percentage of isolates resistant to oxacillin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were 17, 13, 9, 28, 89, 13 and 11 % respectively. Conclusion The high multi-drug resistance of MRSA in hospital environments in Ghana reinforces the need for the effective and routine <b>cleaning</b> of <b>door</b> handles in hospitals. Further investigation is required to understand whether S. aureus from door handles could be the possible causes of nosocomial diseases in the hospitals...|$|R
50|$|In 1873 due to {{requests}} from his clients and dissatisfaction {{with his own}} imported range in his home Shacklock designed and built a prototype cast iron coal range. Shacklock built a ‘self setting’ stove with specially designed grates and flues that worked using lignite coal unlike the British and American kitset imports which were designed to run on bituminous coal. This design was a continually improved and modified product that warmed kitchens, heated water, baked scones and cooked porridge throughout thousands of New Zealand homes. Shacklock named his design the ‘Orion’ due to his interest in astronomy. Before he patented the range in 1882 he introduced many features {{to appeal to the}} potential customer. The curves and angles were designed for aesthetics as well as strength. The fire doors would stay open by themselves horizontally, the chimney and flue damper could be removed for <b>cleaning</b> and the <b>door</b> was also made with varying thicknesses to distribute the heat evenly. By the late 1880s, the Orion range grew to include many different models including double ovens and featuring a ‘destructor’ firebox that was advertised as a safe and hygienic way of disposing of kitchen waste.|$|R
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor <b>doors,</b> <b>cleaning</b> and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|R
40|$|A {{compliant}} force/torque sensor for robot {{force control}} has been developed. This thesis presents methods of designing, testing, and implementing the sensor on a robotic system. The sensor uses an orthoplanar spring equipped with Hall-effect sensors to measure {{one component of}} force and two moment components. Its unique design allows for simple and cost effective manufacturing, high reliability, and compactness. The device {{may be used in}} applications where a robot must control contact forces with its environment, such as in surface <b>cleaning</b> tasks, manipulating <b>doors,</b> and removing threaded fasteners. The compliant design of the sensor improves force control performance and reduces impact forces. Sensor design considerations are discussed, followed by a discussion of the proposed design concept. Theoretical compliance and stress analysis of the orthoplanar spring is presented that allows for rapid design calculations; these calculations are validated via finite element analysis. A mechanical design method is given which uses the results of the compliance and stress analysis. Transducer design is then addressed by developing a model of the sensor. The design methods are used to design a prototype sensor which is tested to determine its instrument uncertainty. Finally, the sensor is implemented on a robotic platform to test its performance in force control...|$|R
