30|$|In the laboratory, we {{observed}} transitions between bubbling (9 (c)) {{and an open}} <b>conduit</b> (9 (<b>d)),</b> which is a feature of gas transport through such visco-elastic shear-thinning fluid with appropriate combinations of viscosity and gas flux (Divoux et al., 2009, 2011). In the bubbling regime, only pressure sensors beneath the fluid detect pressure perturbations generated by the valve, while acoustic waves in the air are impulsive. The regularity of the valve oscillation is disturbed by pressure fluctuations associated with bubble growth and release from the tube (9 (c)). HT generated by the valve oscillation is transmitted to the air when a conduit is established through the fluid (9 (d)), which only occurred with high fluid viscosity, resulting in clear and more stable harmonics. When we use water instead of the visco-elastic fluid (9 (b)), the pressure fluctuation generated by bubbles is too large to establish regular oscillation of the valve and no HT is generated.|$|R
40|$|In alpine regions, {{elevational}} gradients {{in environmental}} parameters are reflected by structural and functional changes in plant traits. Elevational changes in plant water relations {{have also been}} demonstrated, but comparable information on root hydraulics is generally lacking. We analyzed the hydraulic efficiency (specific hydraulic conductivity ks, entire root system conductance KR) and vulnerability to drought-induced embolism (water potential at 50 % loss of conductivity Ψ 50) of the roots of Pinus cembra trees growing along an elevational transect of 600 m. Hydraulic parameters of the roots were {{compared with those of}} the stem and related to anatomical traits {mean <b>conduit</b> diameter (<b>d),</b> wall reinforcement [(t/b) 2]}. We hypothesized that temperature-related restrictions in root function would cause a progressive limitation of hydraulic efficiency and safety with increasing elevation. We found that both root ks and KR decreased from low (1600 m a. s. l. : ks 5. 6 ± 0. 7 kg m− 1 s− 1 MPa− 1, KR 0. 049 ± 0. 005 kg m− 2 s − 1 MPa− 1) to high elevation (2100 m a. s. l. : ks 4. 2 ± 0. 6 kg m− 1 s− 1 MPa− 1, KR 0. 035 ± 0. 006 kg m− 2 s− 1 MPa− 1), with small trees showing higher KR than large trees. ks was higher in roots than in stems (0. 5 ± 0. 05 kg m− 1 s− 1 MPa− 1). Ψ 50 values were similar across elevations and overall less negative in roots (Ψ 50 − 3. 6 ± 0. 1 MPa) than in stems (Ψ 50 − 3. 9 ± 0. 1 MPa). In roots, large-diameter tracheids were lacking at high elevation and (t/b) 2 increased, while d did not change. The elevational decrease in root hydraulic efficiency reflects a limitation in timberline tree hydraulics. In contrast, hydraulic safety was similar across elevations, indicating that avoidance of hydraulic failure is important for timberline trees. As hydraulic patterns can only partly be explained by the anatomical parameters studied, limitations and/or adaptations at the pit level are likely...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a quantitative model of CO 2 and H 2 O isotopic mixing between magmatic and hydrothermal gases for the fumarolic emissions of the La Fossa crater (Vulcano Island, Italy). On the basis of isotope balance equations, the model {{takes into account the}} isotope equilibrium between H 2 O and CO 2 and extends the recent model of chemical and energy two-end-member mixing by Nuccio et al. (1999). As a result,the H 2 O and CO 2 content and the dD, d 18 O, and d 13 C isotope compositions for both magmatic and hydrothermal end-members have been assessed. Low contributions of meteoric steam, added at a shallow depth, have been also recognized and quantified in the fumaroles throughout the period from 1988 to 1998. Nonequilibrium oxygen isotope exchange also seems to be occurring between ascending gases and wall rocks along some fumarolic <b>conduits.</b> The <b>d</b> 13 CCO 2 of the magmatic gases varies around - 3 to 1 ‰ vs. Peedee belemnite (PDB), following a perfect synchronism with the variations of the CO 2 concentration in the magmatic gases. This suggests a process of isotope fractionation because of vapor exsolution caused by magma depressurization. The hydrogen isotopes in the magmatic gases (- 1 to - 35 ‰ vs. standard mean ocean water [SMOW]), as well as the above d 13 CCO 2 value, are coherent with a convergent tectonic setting of magma generation, where the local mantle is widely contaminated by fluids released from the subducted slab. Magma contamination in the crust probably amplifies this effect. The computed isotope composition of carbon and hydrogen in the hydrothermal vapors has been used to calculate the dD and d 13 C of the entire hydrothermal system, including mixed H 2 O-CO 2 vapor, liquid water, and dissolved carbon. We have computed values of about 10 ‰ vs. SMOW for water and - 2 to - 6. 5 ‰ vs. PDB for CO 2. On these grounds, we think that Mediterranean marine water (dDH 2 O 10 ‰) feeds the hydrothermal system. It infiltrates at depth throughout the local rocks, reaching oxygen isotope equilibrium at high temperatures. Interaction processes between magmatic gases and the evolving seawater also seem to occur, causing the dissolution of isotopically fractionated aqueous CO 2 and providing the source for hydrothermal carbon. These results have important implications concerning fluid circulation beneath Vulcano and address the more convenient routine of geochemical surveillance...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} benthic foraminifera {{as a means to}} document ancient methane release, we determined the stable isotopic composition of tests of live (Rose Bengal stained) and dead specimens of epibenthic Fontbotia wuellerstorfi, preferentially used in paleoceanographic reconstructions, and of endobenthic high-latitude Cassidulina neoteretis and Cassidulina reniforme from a cold methane-venting seep off northern Norway. We collected foraminiferal tests from three push cores and nine multiple cores obtained with a remotely operated vehicle and a video-guided multiple corer, respectively. All sampled sites except one control site are situated at the Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) on the Barents Sea continental slope in 1250 m water depth. At the HMMV in areas densely populated by pogonophoran tube worms, d 13 C values of cytoplasm-containing epibenthic F. wuellerstorfi are by up to 4. 4 per mil lower than at control site, thus representing the lowest values hitherto reported for this species. Live C. neoteretis and C. reniforme reach d 13 C values of - 7. 5 and - 5. 5 per mil Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB), respectively, whereas d 13 C values of their empty tests are higher by 4 per mil and 3 per mil. However, d 13 C values of empty tests are never lower than those of stained specimens, although they are still lower than empty tests from the control site. This indicates that authigenic calcite precipitates at or below the sediment surface are not significantly influencing the stable isotopic composition of foraminiferal shells. The comparatively high d 13 C results rather from upward convection of pore water and fluid mud during active methane venting phases at these sites. These processes mingle tests just recently calcified with older ones secreted at intermittent times of less or no methane discharge. Since cytoplasm-containing specimens of suspension feeder F. wuellerstorfi are almost exclusively found attached to pogonophores, which protrude up to 3 cm above the sediment, and d 13 C values of bottom-water-dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are not significantly depleted, we conclude that low test d 13 C values of F. wuellerstorfi are the result of incorporation of heavily 13 C-depleted methanotrophic biomass that these specimens feed on rather than because of low bottom water d 13 CDIC. Alternatively, the pogonophores, which are rooted at depth in the upper sediment column, may serve as a <b>conduit</b> for depleted <b>d</b> 13 CDIC that ultimately influences the calcification process of F. wuellerstorfi attached to the pogonophoran tube well above the sediment/water interface. The lowest d 13 C of live specimens of the endobenthic C. neoteretis and C. reniforme are within the range of pore water d 13 CDIC values, which exceed those that could be due to organic matter decomposition, and thus, in fact, document active methane release in the sediment...|$|R
