2500|$|The agnathans {{as a whole}} are paraphyletic, {{because most}} extinct agnathans belong to the stem group of gnathostomes. Recent {{molecular}} data, both from rRNA and from mtDNA strongly supports the theory that living agnathans, known as <b>cyclostomes,</b> are monophyletic. In phylogenetic taxonomy, the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks, but illustrated as a nested [...] "family tree" [...] known as a cladogram. Phylogenetic groups are given definitions based on their relationship to one another, rather than purely on physical traits such {{as the presence of}} a backbone. This nesting pattern is often combined with traditional taxonomy, in a practice known as evolutionary taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>cyclostomes</b> {{have been}} {{divided into two}} groups {{according}} to skeletal organization. In free-walled (or double-walled) <b>cyclostomes,</b> the exterior frontal walls of the zooids are uncalcified; autozooids have either a polygonal aperture bounded by vertical interior walls, or alternatively a subcircular aperture in species with kenozooids filling the spaces between the autozooids. By contrast, fixed-walled (or single-walled) <b>cyclostomes</b> have much of the exterior frontal wall calcified; autozooids normally have a subcircular aperture located at or close to the frontal wall.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the present}} day {{cyclostome}} bryozoans are exclusively marine and , with most species living subtidally on the continental shelf. Relative to cheilostomes, {{they appear to be}} less numerous and diverse in low latitudes - temperate and arctic environments host almost all of the large species. Although some <b>cyclostomes</b> encrust fleshy algae, the majority colonize hard substrates. Encrusting species can be especially numerous in cryptic habitats, for example, the concave interiors of bivalve shells. <b>Cyclostomes</b> are comparatively poor competitors for living space - they are routinely overgrown by larger animals such as sponges and ascidians, and also lose the majority of competitive encounters for space with cheilostome bryozoans. Tentacle size and number tend to be smaller in species of <b>cyclostomes</b> than cheilostomes. As a result, <b>cyclostomes</b> create less powerful feeding currents. Colony size is small in many encrusting species, suggesting a [...] "weedy", opportunistic life-style. These small encrusting colonies probably live for less than a year, whereas some of the larger encrusting and erect colonies are undoubtedly perennials. However, scant data exists on growth rates in <b>cyclostomes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dumeril (1806) grouped hagfishes and {{lampreys}} in the taxon Cyclostomi, {{characterized by}} horny teeth borne on a tongue-like apparatus, a large notochord as adults, and pouch-shaped gills (Marspibranchii). <b>Cyclostomes</b> {{were regarded as}} either degenerate cartilaginous fishes or primitive vertebrates. Cope (1889) coined the name Agnatha ("jawless") for a group that included the <b>cyclostomes</b> {{and a number of}} fossil groups in which jaws could not be observed. Vertebrates were subsequently divided into two major sister-groups: the Agnatha and the Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates). Stensiö (1927) suggested that the two groups of living agnathans (i.e. the <b>cyclostomes)</b> arose independently from different groups of fossil agnathans.|$|E

50|$|As clearly {{seen in the}} lamprey, <b>Cyclostome</b> {{also has}} a pair of {{cartilaginous}} rods in the embryonic head {{which is similar to}} the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.However, in 1916, Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, Alf Johnels reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates. Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm. Today, the “trabecular cartilages” in the <b>Cyclostome</b> is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.|$|R

50|$|Polymorphism of zooids is less {{conspicuous}} than in cheilostomes. However, {{almost all}} cyclostome species have enlarged zooids - gonozooids - for brooding larvae, and some species also possess non-feeding zooids - kenozooids - with space-filling and structural roles. Modern <b>cyclostomes</b> exhibit polyembryony: fertilised ova divide to produce multiple, genetically identical larvae which {{are housed in}} the spacious gonozooid before being released, swimming {{for a short period}} before settling and undergoing metamorphosis to establish new clonal colonies. Gonozooids are also very important in the taxonomy of <b>cyclostomes,</b> particularly in the largest suborder the Tubuliporina.
