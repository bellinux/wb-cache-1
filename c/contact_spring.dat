However, the global stiffness matrix is determined by summing up the stiffness matrices of individual pairs of springs around each element.

5000|$|The tip of an épée {{comprises}} several parts including: the mushroom-shaped movable tip; its housing or [...] "barrel", {{which is}} threaded to the blade; a contact spring; {{and a return}} spring. The tips are generally {{held in place by}} two small grub screws, which thread into the sides of the tip through elongated openings {{on either side of the}} barrel. The screws hold the tip within the barrel but are allowed to travel freely in the openings. While this is the most common system, screwless variations do exist. The return spring must allow the tip to support a force of 750 g-f N without registering a touch. Finally, an épée tip must allow a shim of 1.5 mm to be inserted between the tip and the barrel, and when a 0.5 mm shim is inserted and the tip depressed, it should not register a touch. The <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> is threaded in or out of the tip to adjust for this distance. These specifications are tested at the start of each bout during competitions. During competitions, fencers are required to have a minimum of two weapons and two body wires in case of failure or breakage.|$|E

The IPC grasping controller introduced in [2], gives a physi-cally based methodology to implement an Intrinsically Passive Control (IPC) strategy {{in order to}} grasp with either a multi finger hand or manipulation with multiple arms.

This virtual object is by itself connected to a new spring which can be used to move the all ensemble around. The goal of the virtual object is to create damping injection in the system in order to achieve a proper be-haviour.

Specific locations of studied wells, boreholes and <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> were taken with the help of GARMIN GPSmap 76 CSx. The water samples were collected into 1  L polyethylene bottles which were pre-cleaned with concentrated hydrochloric acid and distilled water. pH and temperature of the water samples were measured on-site with a Thermo electron Corporation Orion 3 Star pH Benchtop. This was also done to avoid unpredictable changes in characteristics as per the standard procedure (APHA 1995). Sampling protocols according to Classen (1982) and Barcelona et al. (1985) were adopted. Total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) or specific conductance and resistivity of collected water samples were measured using Delta Ohm HD 2306.0 conductivity meter. Water samples were collected with well purging because wells had not been recently drilled and purged. All the water samples were preserved in a refrigerator to exclude microbial activity and unwanted chemical reaction until analysis was completed within 2  days. The determinations of the other physico-chemical properties of the water samples were performed within 2  days of sampling.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental and theoretical analysis {{has been carried out}} into normal force reduction in electronic contact springs. This is a phenomenon whereby the force produced by the <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> reduces with time. A series of ten elevated temperature heat age tests were carried out for time periods of up to three months. Over 6, 500 normal force reduction measurements have been made. Examination of the data revealed a high correlation for the normal force to exhibit a logarithmic relationship with time. Theoretical analysis showed that this could be explained by assuming that the phenomenon of normal force reduction is thermally activated with an activation energy that is variable and related to the amount of stored energy in the <b>contact</b> <b>spring.</b> A theoretical model for the process has been proposed, and the values of the parameters calculated for the ten temperatures for which data has been collected. This model can be used to predict end of life normal forces for electrical contacts, provided that the model parameters are determined experimentally at the required temperature. In addition, it is also possible to obtain confidence levels associated with these predictions...|$|E

40|$|Tyre/road {{simulation}} {{tools that}} can capture tyre vibrations, rolling resistance and noise generation {{are useful for}} understanding the complex processes that are involved and thereby promoting further development and optimisation. The most detailed tyre/road contact models use a spatial discretisation of the contact and assume an interfacial stiffness {{to account for the}} small-scale roughness within the elements. This interfacial stiffness has been found to {{have a significant impact on}} the simulated noise emissions but no thorough investigations of this sensitivity have been conducted. Three mechanisms are thought to be involved: The horn effect, the modal composition of the vibrational field of the tyre and the contact forces exciting the tyre vibrations. This study used a numerical tyre/road noise simulation tool based on physical relations to investigate these aspects. The model includes a detailed time-domain contact model with linear or non-linear contact springs that accounts for the effect of local tread deformation on smaller length scales. Results confirm that an increase in <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness causes a significant increase of the simulated tyre/road noise. This is primarily caused by a corresponding increase in the contact forces, resulting in larger vibrational amplitudes. The horn effect and the modal composition are relatively unaffected and have minor effects on the radiated noise. A more detailed non-linear <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> formulation with lower stiffness at small indentations results in a reduced high-frequency content in the contact forces and the simulated noise...|$|E

40|$|In a {{companion}} paper, a theory was presented {{which allows the}} study of the linear stability of a class of systems consisting of two subsystems coupled through a frictional contact point. A stability criterion in terms of transfer functions was derived and used to simulate the behaviour of generic systems. In the present paper, this approach was pursued and generalized by relaxing in turn certain of the assumptions made earlier. By doing this, it is possible to catalogue systematically all the routes to instability conceivable within the scope of linearity for the class of systems considered. The additional routes to instability identified are as follows. First, the contact point was made compliant by adding a linear <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> at the interface between the two subsystems. This feature proved to have a significant influence on stability when the <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness takes values of the same order of magnitude or lower than that of the average structural stiffness of the system. Second, a route to instability is possible if the system structural damping possesses a slight non-proportional component. The last and most elaborate extension consisted in allowing the coefficient of friction to vary linearly with the sliding speed. Simulation results suggest that a coefficient falling with increasing sliding speed can destabilize an otherwise stable system or can make it even more unstable. In accordance with previous results, a coefficient of friction rising with the sliding speed tends to make a system more stable, although this is not systematic. The theory presented here allows these possible routes to instability to be combined, so that data from vibration measurements or modelling and from frictional measurements can be used directly to predict the region of instability in parameter space. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We use an original non-linear formula for the elastic forces, especially devised to prevent elements from collapsing to zero or negative volume.

40|$|Tools for {{simulating}} tyre/road noise {{are highly}} valuable in {{the efforts to}} limit {{the negative consequences of}} road traffic noise. A numerical tyre/road noise simulation tool was in this study used to investigate how the contact stiffness parameter affects the predicted tyre/road noise. It includes a contact model with contact springs that accounts for the effect of local small-scale tread deformation. Results showed that simulated noise was sensitive to the value of the spring stiffness, primarily as it affected the total contact force. A non-linear <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> formulation resulted in a reduction of the high-frequency content in the contact forces and simulated noise. Aspects of small-scale tread dynamics were evaluated by simulating the detailed contact between an elastic layer and a rough road surface using a numerical time domain contact model including non-linear contact springs to account for small-scale roughness. Contact stiffness increased as the number of contact points grew as well as the deformation of their non-linear contact springs. The results imply that dynamic properties of the local tread deformation may be of importance when simulating contact details during normal tyre/road interaction conditions, but that effects of damping could, as a first approximation, be included as an increased stiffness in a quasi-static tread model. The speed dependency of measured and simulated tyre/road noise was analysed. A large part of the noise had a high speed exponent, traditionally connected with air-pumping. However, the results showed that tyre vibrations can generate noise with a speed exponent that verges on what is expected from air-pumping. Due to the overlap in the speed exponents of the main generation mechanisms, they cannot be distinguished through a speed exponent analysis. The most important contribution of this work is an increased understanding of how the <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> formulation affects the simulated noise. The work has also provided insights into the speed dependency of tyre/road noise generation mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} study, both experimentally and analytically, {{is conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of using appropriate shock table tests to mimic the drop impact environment for components and systems adopted in portable electronics. Firstly, experiments are carried out to observe the dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact. Then a series of shock table tests with different constraint conditions are designed to mimic the real-life impact state. By comparing the typical results from shock table tests and those from drop tests, the correlation of shock table test parameters and drop tests conditions is investigated. The results reveal that the conventional fully constrained shock table test cannot mimic the real-life drop impact conditions, while an appropriate shock table test method should allow the sample to rotate freely. Theoretical analysis is developed to explain {{the mechanics of the}} impact scenarios. It is found that due to Hertz <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> effect and the rotational acceleration during the impact, the acceleration of the centroid sample is significantly different to that of the table. In addition, acceleration estimated by traditional force-divided-by-mass method may underestimate the real acceleration of components inside the products...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on Biot’s fully dynamic poroelastic theory, {{the dynamic}} {{responses}} of the poroelastic half-space soil medium due to quasi-static and dynamic loads from a moving train are investigated semi-analytically. The dynamic loads {{are assumed to be}} generated from the rail surface irregularities. The vehicle dynamics model is used to simulate the axle loads (quasi-static loads) and the dynamic loads from a moving train. The compatibility of the displacements at wheel–rail contact points couple the vehicle and the track–ground subsystem, and yield equations for the dynamic wheel–rail loads. A linearized Hertzian <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> between the wheel and rail is introduced to calculate the dynamic loads. Using the Fourier transform, the governing equations for the poroelastic half-space are then solved in the frequency–wavenumber domain. The time domain responses are evaluated by the fast inverse Fourier transform. Numerical results show that the dynamic loads can make important contribution to dynamic response of the poroelastic half-space for different train speed, and the dynamically induced responses lie in a higher frequency range. The ground vibrations caused by the moving train can be intensified as the primary suspension stiffness of the vehicle increases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vibration or {{bouncing}} {{of electrical}} contacts at closure {{is a reason}} of failure occurring in relays, contactors, circuit breakers and other electrical equipment due to arc erosion and welding. Experimentally observed bouncing of electrical contacts in vacuum circuit breakers cannot be satisfactorily explained by elastic restitution force or electrodynamic repulsion. This paper attempts to estimate the influence of metallic vapour pressure generated by arc in the contact gap on contact motion. The mathematical model describing these phenomena includes a non-linear differential motion equation for a movable contact piece, heat equations for anode and cathode (Axisymmetric Stefan’s problem with two free boundaries for melting and evaporation), a differential equation for the arc column, and non-linear algebraic equations for near-electrode regions. The special method of majorant functions is applied for the solution of this problem. It is found theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the vapour force at contact bouncing is sometimes comparable and may be greater than the <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> force even in vacuum.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model is developed {{to predict the}} wheel/rail dynamic interaction occurring due to excitation by wheel flats. A relative displacement excitation is introduced between the wheel and rail that differs from the geometric form of the wheel flat due to the finite curvature of the wheel. To allow for the non-linearity of the <b>contact</b> <b>spring</b> {{and the possibility of}} loss of contact between the wheel and the rail, a time-domain model is used to calculate the interaction force. This includes simplified dynamic models of the wheel and the track. In order to predict the consequent noise radiation, the wheel/rail interaction force is transformed into the frequency domain and then converted back to an equivalent roughness spectrum. This spectrum is used as the input to a linear, frequency-domain model of wheel/rail interaction to predict the noise. The noise level due to wheel flat excitation is found to increase with the train speed V {{at a rate of about}} 20 log 0 V whereas rolling noise due to roughness excitation generally increases at about 30 log 0 V. For all speeds up to at least 200 km/h the noise from typical flats exceeds that due to normal levels of roughness. When the wheel load is doubled the predicted impact noise increases by about 3 dB...|$|E

40|$|With the {{transient}} {{frequency of}} available CMOS technologies exceeding hundreds of gigahertz {{and the increasing}} complexity of Integrated Circuit (IC) designs, it is now apparent that the architecture of current testers needs to be greatly improved {{to keep up with}} the formidable challenges ahead. Test requirements for modern integrated circuits are becoming more stringent, complex and costly. These requirements include an increasing number of test channels, higher test-speeds and enhanced measurement accuracy and resolution. In a conventional test configuration, the signal path from Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) to the Device-Under-Test (DUT) includes long traces of wires. At frequencies above a few gigahertz, testing integrated circuits becomes a challenging task. The effects on transmission lines become critical requiring impedance matching to minimize signal reflection. AC resistance due to the skin effect and electromagnetic coupling caused by radiation can also become important factors affecting the test results. In the design of a Device Interface Board (DIB), the greater the physical separation of the DUT and the ATE pin electronics, the greater the distortion and signal degradation. In this work, a new Test Interface Module (TIM) based on MEMS technology is proposed to reduce the distance between the tester and device-under-test by orders of magnitude. The proposed solution increases the bandwidth of test channels and reduces the undesired effects of transmission lines on the test results.
