50|$|The ECB {{publishes a}} Convergence Report {{at least every}} two years to check how well the EU members {{aspiring}} for euro adoption <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria.</b> The first full convergence report was published in November 1996, and concluded that only 3 out of 15 EU member states (Denmark, Luxembourg and Ireland) were completely compliant with the criteria {{at that point in}} time. As a majority of states were not in compliance, the Council decided to delay the introduction of the euro by two years to 1 January 1999. In March 1998 a more positive second convergence report concluded that 11 out of 12 applying countries were prepared for the electronic introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, with only Greece failing to qualify by the deadline. Subsequent convergence reports have so far resulted in an additional 8 EU member states complying with all criteria and adopting the euro (Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The latest convergence report was published in June 2014, and checked for compliance in the reference year from May 2012 - April 2014, where Lithuania managed to fully comply - thus becoming the next 19th eurozone member. As the reference values for HICP inflation and long-term interest rates change on a monthly basis, any member state with a euro derogation has the right to ask the ECB for an updated compliance check, whenever they believe they have met all both economic and legal convergence criteria. For example, Latvia asked for such an extraordinary compliance check in March 2013 (outside the regular 2-year interval for automatic assessments).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is {{essentially}} to demonstrate that the delayed stagings of American 'committed' plays, written in the thirties and produced in Slovene theatres immediately after World War Two in the late forties and fifties, were often miscontextualized and partly misinterpreted by the literary critics of the period. This was only in the early post-war years largely due to the need to serve the then ruling ideology and to <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> of Marxist aesthetisc, especially that of a radical social criticism. However, the later stagings particularly of Arthur Miller's and also Tennessee Williams's plays, did not see the same phenomenon, for it was they that assured the popularity of the American post-war drama on Slovene stages and, even more importantly, helped Slovene theatre to come off age in the sixties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} (PJS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} hereditary disease characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation and gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis. The germline mutations in the serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK 11) gene {{have been shown}} to be associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disease. Individuals <b>with</b> PJS are at increased risk for development of various neoplasms. The aim of the present study was to characterize the genotype and phenotype of Czech patients with PJS. Methods We examined genomic DNA of 8 individuals from five Czech families by sequencing analysis of STK 11 gene, covering its promotor region, the entire coding region and the splice-site boundaries, and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay designed for the identification of large exonic deletions or duplications of STK 11 gene. Results We found pathogenic mutations in STK 11 gene in two families fulfilling <b>the</b> diagnostic <b>criteria</b> of PJS and in one of three sporadic cases not <b>complying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>criteria.</b> <b>The</b> patient <b>with</b> <b>the</b> frameshift mutation in STK 11 gene developed aggressive gastric cancer. No other studied proband has developed a carcinoma so far.

This study was investigated into three different proportions of dredged sediments with rice husks ranging from 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent (by weight of rice husks or rice straws) as raw materials in producing bricks.
