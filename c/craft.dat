5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their <b>craft</b> with weapons. Each <b>craft</b> has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other <b>craft</b> or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the <b>craft</b> blows up. The <b>craft</b> also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E

An Australian {{version of the}} Landing <b>Craft</b> Mechanized, the ALCM, was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong. Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing <b>craft,</b> so the ALCV III, an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity, was produced. The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs, a type of similar capacity to an American Landing <b>Craft</b> Tank, with five Ford V8 engines.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} the definition, dimensional structure, and nomological network of job <b>crafting,</b> {{in addition to}} the ability profiles of job crafters. Job <b>crafting</b> is defined as the physical, cognitive, social, technological, and procedural changes to a job that a worker makes with the intention of improving the job for themselves. Two general categories of job <b>crafting</b> are proposed: an active and goal directed efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> and a less active withdrawal oriented form of job <b>crafting.</b> Study one is a qualitative inquiry into the dimensional structure of job <b>crafting,</b> with analyses suggesting seven dimensions. Categories of efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> include: work role expansion; implementing work organization; metacognition; adoption of knowledge and technology; and social expansion and facilitation. Withdrawal oriented job <b>crafting</b> includes categories of withdrawal and work role reduction. Study two is an examination of the descriptive characteristics and employees 2 ̆ 7 perceived outcomes of each type of job <b>crafting.</b> Results support the presence of general efficiency/effectiveness and withdrawal oriented categories of job <b>crafting.</b> They also show that elements of efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> are perceived as requiring more effort, being engaged more frequently, and being more effective than some elements of withdrawal oriented job <b>crafting.</b> Study three is a quantitative examination of the antecedents and consequences of both types of job <b>crafting.</b> Results suggest that efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> is predicted by contextual characteristics supporting job crafting; personal characteristics; and personal work objectives. Efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> subsequently predicts outcomes of performance, development, and work experience. Withdrawal oriented job <b>crafting</b> is predicted by personal characteristics and contextual characteristics supporting job <b>crafting.</b> Study four is a quantitative examination of the structure and outcomes of individuals 2 ̆ 7 job <b>crafting</b> ability profiles. Results suggest the presence of five distinct clusters of job crafters. High ability crafters tend to have higher rankings of performance and development than low ability job crafters and some intermediate ability job crafters. However, intermediate and low ability job crafters tend to experience less strain than high ability job crafters.

The game initially restricts the player to a particular <b>craft</b> for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available <b>craft.</b> Levels set on non-atmospheric moons expose the player's <b>craft</b> to space; thus disallowing the Speeder and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being used; but as on other levels, the <b>craft</b> is vertically confined.

The majority of the fleet was supplied by the UK, which provided 892 warships and 3,261 landing <b>craft.</b> There were 195,700 naval personnel involved. The invasion fleet was split into the Western Naval Task Force (under Admiral Alan G Kirk) supporting the American sectors and the Eastern Naval Task Force (under Admiral Sir Philip Vian) in the British and Canadian sectors. Available to the fleet were five battleships, 20 cruisers, 65 destroyers, and two monitors. German ships in the area on D-Day included three torpedo boats, 29 fast attack <b>craft,</b> 36 R boats, and 36 minesweepers and patrol boats.

Moreover, we hypothesized that this indirect effect would be stronger for older workers compared with younger workers. Results of an experimental field study indicated that participating in the job <b>crafting</b> intervention leads to strengths <b>crafting,</b> but only among older workers. Strengths <b>crafting</b> was, in turn, positively associated with demands-abilities and needs-supplies fit. Unexpectedly, participating in the job <b>crafting</b> intervention did not influence job <b>crafting</b> toward interests and had a negative effect on <b>crafting</b> toward strengths among younger workers.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Job <b>Crafting</b> was {{developed}} by Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane E. Dutton in 2001. It describes job alterations initiated by employees that can occur in three different ways: Task <b>crafting,</b> relational <b>crafting</b> and cognitive <b>crafting.</b> The aim of Job <b>Crafting</b> is the better alignment of employee needs and preferences to the job demands and rewards. In this bachelor thesis, the concept of Job <b>Crafting</b> will be explained and will be put into the context of similar concepts. Both, positive and negative outcomes of Job <b>Crafting</b> behaviour will be explained and opposed. The outcomes can have the form of increased motivation, performance and person-job fit which are intended by the Job <b>Crafting</b> behaviour. But misalignments of Job <b>Crafting</b> with organisational goals and negative impacts on colleagues {{on the negative side}} can also occur and need to be considered. The bachelor thesis also illustrates important motivators for Job <b>Crafting</b> and the most important aspects that play a role in Job <b>Crafting</b> behaviour. In the end, the thesis provides an outlook of Job <b>Crafting</b> based on the information that was evaluated. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to provide an insight into the concept of Job <b>Crafting</b> and to inform about the recent state of research on the topic. Job <b>Crafting</b> {{is considered to be a}} rather positive employee behaviour that mostly results in better outcomes for employees than before Job <b>Crafting</b> actions. As organisation in the current economic state need to be adaptive in order to stay competitive, Job <b>Crafting</b> offers a solution for organisations to provide their employees with enough freedom to stay flexible. Job <b>Crafting</b> is not to be considered as a substitute for common Job design but rather as a complement to it that can be used by employees to further enhance their behaviour and performance. Managers should be aware of its existence and even foster it into a direction that benefits the organisation...|$|R
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure <b>craft,</b> and many other types of small <b>craft.</b> The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard.
