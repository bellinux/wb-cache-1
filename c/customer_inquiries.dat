2500|$|The {{release of}} Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft in 2004 and its {{subsequent}} huge success {{across the globe}} has forced both MMORPGs and their secondary markets into mainstream consciousness, and many new market places have opened up during this time. A search for WoW Gold on Google will show a multitude of sites (more than 90 sponsored results [...] ) from which Gold can be purchased. Real money commerce in a virtual market has grown to become a multibillion-dollar industry. In 2001, EverQuest players Brock Pierce and Alan Debonneville founded Internet Gaming Entertainment Ltd (IGE), a company that offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service. [...] IGE had a trained staff that would handle financial issues, <b>customer</b> <b>inquiries</b> and technical support to ensure that gamers are satisfied with each real money purchase. It also {{took advantage of the}} global reach of synthetic worlds by setting up a shop in Hong Kong where a small army of technically savvy but low wage workers could field orders, load up avatars, retrieve store goods and deliver them wherever necessary. This lucrative market has opened a whole new type of economy where the border between the real and the virtual is obscure.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} PC industry, declines in prices along with {{commensurate}} increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities {{to engage in}} upselling. As a result, the company was selling {{a greater proportion of}} inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs. Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting [...] "got in the way," [...] aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer <b>customer</b> <b>inquiries</b> more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional [...] "bloatware" [...] on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the [...] "Dell Hell" [...] prominent on Internet search engines.|$|E

40|$|The {{customers}} of today have high desires and requirements on products and they select which products to purchase {{based on a}} large awareness of the market. Therefore, the key to all business success is to fully understand what gives the customers the largest possible usefulness and satisfaction out of the products. The next step is then to create a manufacturing process that is in statistical control, has small variations and that {{to a great extent}} meets the specified desired output. This master’s thesis focuses in different ways on the perception of different hues of the colour white and on surface deviations on varnished surfaces. To understand which hues of white that are perceived as attractive and which surface defects that are noticed and how they are perceived, an extensive <b>customer</b> <b>inquiry</b> has been performed. To better understand the market situation a smaller survey of the competitor’s colours has also been made. A challenge with the current varnishing process at Asko Appliances AB has been to develop more detailed knowledge about how the output and perceived quality can be controlled by small changes of input parameters. Therefore, an extensive statistical analysis based on data collected from differently designed experiments has been performed. The possibility of using measurements of surface waviness to judge surfaces with orange peel structure has also been investigated. The <b>customer</b> <b>inquiry</b> elucidated that white hues that contain small amounts of blue or only negligible amounts of yellow most often are found as attractive and that some defects are considered to be more critical than others. Another important conclusion is that the results of such an experiment are highly depending on the context and environment where it is performed. Several interesting observations were made during the analysis of the varnishing process and {{it was found that the}} process is somewhat more complex than expected. However, the effects of some controlling factors such as temperature, time and position on the hanger during curing were found to affect the hue more than others...|$|R

The aim {{is to improve the}} way of responding to <b>customer’s</b> <b>inquiry</b> and emergency cases and estimate the solid waste amount without any involvement of the truck driver. The proposed system consists of RFID tag mounted on the bin, RFID reader as in truck, GPRS/GSM as web-server, GIS as map server, database server and control server. The tracking devices mounted in the trucks collect location information in real-time via the GPS. This information is transferred continuously through GPRS to a central database. The users are able to view the current location of each truck in the collection stage via a web-based application, and thereby manage the fleet. The trucks positions and trash bin information are displayed on a digital map, which is made available by a map server. Thus, the solid waste of the bin and the truck are being monitored using the developed system. Index Terms — Solid waste monitoring and management...|$|R
