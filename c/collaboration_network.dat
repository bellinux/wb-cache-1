40|$|This {{research}} aims at clarifying whether network emergence mechanisms {{common in}} social networks are {{also involved in}} structuring Internet-based <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks.</b> We compare the observed values of reciprocity and transitivity in 95 Internet-based <b>collaborations</b> <b>networks</b> and 40 social networks with predictions of Random Graph models. All the tested networks exhibit reciprocities that significantly deviate from the predictions. All the Internet-based <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> {{and some of the}} social networks – not all- exhibit transitivity compatible with the predictions. We conclude that exchange mechanisms, responsible for reciprocity, are at work in all networks. Cognition balance mechanisms, responsible for transitivity, are at work in many but not all social networks, but there is no evidence for it in any of the tested Internet-based <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks.</b> the explanations for these behaviours are based on the broadcast nature of the Internet-based <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks.</b> We briefly discuss the practical implications for Internet-based collaborative learning...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} body {{of literature}} has recently been concerned with the structure and dynamics of the <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> that underlie the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Despite the growing interest in these networks, relatively little emphasis {{has been placed on}} two broad areas of investigation: on the one hand, the interplay of the growth mechanisms underpinning the evolution of collaborative arrangements; on the other, the implications that the structure and multiplexity of these arrangements have on knowledge creation and diffusion.

This Introduction offers a theoretical and methodological framework for the articles here included. It begins by discussing problems of measurement of scientific collaboration, and goes on to examine the role that growth mechanisms, structural variety and multiplexity play in shaping the genesis and functioning of <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks.</b> In reviewing current and emerging research themes, the discussion will also identify promising research directions that will stimulate future work on <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> in science and technology...|$|R
40|$|Although in {{the past}} decennium much {{research}} has been conducted in the field of software ecosystems, still little is known about how such ecosystems evolve. In existing literature, software ecosystems are often analyzed from a single point of time, without regard for their dynamic history. We study an aspect of the evolution of open source software ecosystems: collaboration. In this thesis, we present a method to identify and analyze <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> in software ecosystems, based on historical data from the online source code hosting service GitHub. We apply this method to analyze the evolution of collaboration within the well-established open source ecosystem around the Ruby programming language. Our method can be used to identify and visualize <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> around a given actor or software component over the course of time. This is done using statistical analysis techniques, without requiring subjective input. Our study analyzes over 200 <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> to identify typical life cycle shapes and gives insight in the evolution an open source software ecosystem. Awareness of such <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> and how they evolve is beneficial for actors in software ecosystems and for external stakeholders...|$|R
50|$|Scientific <b>collaboration</b> <b>network</b> is {{a social}} network where nodes are {{scientists}} and links are co-authorships as the latter {{is one of the}} most well documented forms of scientific collaboration. It is an undirected, scale-free network where the degree distribution follows a power law with an exponential cutoff - most authors are sparsely connected while a few authors are intensively connected. The network has an assortative nature - hubs tend to link to other hubs and low-degree nodes tend to link to low-degree nodes. Assortativity is not structural, meaning that it is not a consequence of the degree distribution, but it is generated by some process that governs the network’s evolution.|$|E
50|$|Barabasi et al. {{studied the}} {{collaboration}} networks {{in mathematics and}} neuro-science of an 8-year period (1991-1998) to understand the topological and dynamical laws governing complex networks. They viewed the <b>collaboration</b> <b>network</b> as a prototype of evolving networks, as it expands {{by the addition of}} new nodes (authors) and new links (papers co-authored). The results obtained indicated that the network is scale-free and that its evolution is governed by preferential attachment. Moreover, authors concluded that most quantities used to characterize the network are time dependent. For example, the average degree (network’s interconnectedness) increases in time. Furthermore, the study showed that the node separation decreases over time, however this trend is believed to be offered by incomplete database and it can be opposite in the full system.|$|E

Understanding patterns of scientific collaboration and their {{impacts on the}} productivity and evolution of disciplines is crucial to understand scientific processes. Electronic bibliography offers {{a unique opportunity to}} map and investigate the nature of scientific collaboration. Recent work have demonstrated a counter-intuitive organizational pattern of scientific collaboration networks: densely interconnected local clusters consist of weak ties, whereas strong ties play the role of connecting different clusters. This pattern contrasts itself from many other types of networks where strong ties form communities while weak ties connect different communities. Although there are many models for <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks,</b> no model reproduces this pattern.

40|$|A {{study on}} the network {{characteristics}} of two <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks</b> constructed from the ACM and DBLP digital libraries is presented. Different types of generic network models and several examples are reviewed and experimented on re-generating the <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks.</b> The results reveal that while these models can generate the power-law degree distribution sufficiently well, they {{are not able to}} capture the other two important dynamic metrics: average distance and clustering coefficient. While all current models result in small average distances, none shows the same tendency as the real networks do. Furthermore all models seem blind to generating large clustering coefficients. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a new model with promising results. We get closer values for the dynamic measures while having the degree distribution still power-law by having link addition probabilities change over time, and link attachment happen within local neighborhood only or globally, as seen in the two <b>collaboration</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
