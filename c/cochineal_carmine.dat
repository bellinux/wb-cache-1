5000|$|Carmine ( [...] or [...] ), {{also called}} {{cochineal}}, cochineal extract, crimson lake or carmine lake, natural red 4, C.I. 75470, or E120, is a pigment of a bright-red color {{obtained from the}} aluminium salt of carminic acid; {{it is also a}} general term for a particularly deep-red color. The pigment is produced from some scale insects such as the cochineal scale and certain Porphyrophora species (Armenian cochineal and Polish <b>cochineal).</b> <b>Carmine</b> is used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, crimson ink, rouge and other cosmetics, and some medications. It is routinely added to food products such as yogurt, candy and certain brands of juice, the most notable ones being those of the ruby-red variety.|$|E
5000|$|Alchermes (from the Arabic [...] al-qirmiz, meaning cochineal, from Persian [...] kirmist: bloody, red, <b>cochineal,</b> <b>carmine)</b> {{is a type}} of Italian liqueur (especially in Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna and Sicily) {{prepared}} by infusing neutral spirits with sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and vanilla, and other herbs and flavoring agents. Its most striking characteristic is its scarlet color, obtained by the addition of Kermes, a small parasitic insect from which the drink derives its name. The drink fell out of favor {{around the turn of the}} 20th century because people discovered that its colour came from insects. Several proprietary variants are commercially available, with alcoholic contents ranging from 21 to 32%. Its chief use is in coloring pastry, although a quick dessert is sometimes made by adding it to mascarpone and sugar. In the Italian pudding Zuppa Inglese, sponge cake or ladyfingers soaked in this liqueur are a major ingredient.|$|E
30|$|In {{the next}} {{critical}} transition, when imported <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine</b> replaced safflower red in 1869, this new colorant was also routinely mixed with vermilion.

50|$|Strong red {{colors for}} eye {{products}} {{have been produced}} using the dye carmine, made from carminic acid extracted from the crushed bodies of the <b>cochineal</b> insect. <b>Carmine</b> was once the only bright red color permitted by the FDA for use around the eye.|$|R
25|$|The insect {{produces}} {{carminic acid}} that deters predation by other insects. Carminic acid, typically 17-24% of dried insects' weight, can be {{extracted from the}} body and eggs, then mixed with aluminium or calcium salts to make carmine dye, also known as <b>cochineal.</b> Today, <b>carmine</b> is primarily used as a colorant in food and in lipstick.|$|R

30|$|The sudden {{replacement}} of safflower by <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine</b> in 1869 can probably be explained as {{the intersection of}} two trends, {{on the one hand}} the decline of safflower production in Japan, {{and at the same time}} the availability of carmine on the world market at increasingly lower prices.|$|E
30|$|The next {{synthetic}} dye after magenta in 1864 was methyl violet in 1875, creating without mixture an assertive purple that became widely used (possibly substituted by the similar crystal violet from 1883), {{and the first}} aniline dye to add a distinctly new color to nishiki-e. Next came eosin in early 1877, used alone for its distinctive bright pink hue (perfect for cherry blossoms) and as an additive to <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine,</b> perhaps to render it more bluish.|$|E
30|$|We {{discovered}} {{that in the}} year 1869, however, safflower was completely replaced by imported <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine.</b> This change had been hypothesized by Yamato [10], but {{we were able to}} make a positive confirmation of carmine as the dominant red in Japanese prints from early 1869, used continuously thereafter until 1891. In addition, carmine has been detected in two prints of 1864, proving that the colorant was available in Japan at that time, although it was not found in any other print before 1869.|$|E

We evaluated 22 genotypes of cactus pear (Opuntia spp. and Nopalea spp.). Of each genotype were selected five cladodes, standardized in relation to the physiological state (age of the cladodes). They were divided into four quadrants, where one in every five of them were applied “toothpicks” infested with the insect colonies, a total of 20 colonies/cladodes. Weekly cladodes of the infested genotypes were inspected to evaluate the growth of old colonies and the emergence of new colonies. This procedure took 60 days.

30|$|Two red insect dyes {{were known}} in the late Edo period, the more common and widely used of which was lac, {{produced}} in India and Southeast Asia, and known and used in China since ancient times. It was imported to Japan in considerable quantity in the late Edo period for textile dyeing and has also been confirmed {{in a number of}} ukiyo-e paintings [20], but it has yet to be found in woodblock prints. Meanwhile <b>carmine</b> (<b>cochineal</b> or <b>carmine</b> <b>cochineal,</b> natural red 4) is a red dye extracted from the female of the cochineal scale insect (Dactylopius coccus L. Costa) native to Central and South America. It was introduced in Europe in 1518 and it became common by 1549 [21]. It was shipped by the Spanish from Acapulco to Manila, and on to China by early seventeenth century, and could have easily found its way to Japan [22]. The best-documented use of cochineal in Japan, however, was not as a dye but in the form of cochineal-dyed woolen cloth, which was much prized by samurai for making into garments [23, 24]. The rarity of the use of cochineal was probably due to its higher cost than the more easily available lac.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, by far {{the most}} {{striking}} import of a foreign colorant was not a modern chemical product, but rather the well-established and prestigious red insect dye from the cochineal insect of Mesoamerica, introduced to Europe in the early sixteenth century and widely used for dyeing both silk and wool, and in the form of carmine lake for oil paintings.

This study aimed to evaluate the infestation and dispersal speed of D. opuntiae at the field conditions, to establish a level of pest control. The research was performed in a field of giant cactus pear with twelve months cropped, artificially infested with the <b>carmine</b> <b>cochineal</b> in Lagoa Seca Experimental Station, Paraíba. The trial used was the completely randomized design (CRD) consisting of ten treatments (giant cactus pear plants) and ten repetitions (infested cladodes).

After 60 days the infestation and spread of colonies reached average value 171 colonies per plant. The dispersal of migrants nymphs are carried by wind from the cladodes to cladodes and plant to plant. From these results we can establish that the control level to <b>carmine</b> <b>cochineal</b> is less than 10 colonies/plant and the combat should be started immediately after detection of the first colonies of the pest in cactus pear crop...|$|R
30|$|In broader {{historical}} perspective, {{the changes}} in nishiki-e colorants in the Meiji period appear considerably less dramatic than usually assumed. A broad shift to more light-fast and saturated colorants was already underway from the 1820 s, given a sudden boost with the introduction high-quality low-cost Chinese-produced Prussian blue in quantity after 1829 that really did constitute a color “revolution” in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige [42]. The sudden availability of similarly high-quality low-cost <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine</b> on the global market from 1869 was also dramatic, but less of {{a revolution in the}} quality of the red than in the abandon with which it could be printed. Our results have shown that perhaps the single greatest color change in Meiji was rather for purple, always a challenge before synthetic dyes became available.|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} time, world {{production}} of cochineal was rapidly {{growing in the}} 1860 s, both in Guatemala, which had been the major Central American source for export to Europe since the 1840 s [26], {{but also in the}} Canary Islands, where cultivation of the cochineal insect and the opuntia cactus on which it feeds had become a boom by the late 1860 s (and soon after a bust) [27]. The exact trade route of cochineal to Japan is not yet known, but in all likelihood it was processed in Europe, most likely in England or France, into the laked form of <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine</b> ready to use as a pigment, and then shipped to Yokohama. The primary reasons for the immediate success of carmine were probably both lower cost and greatly enhanced ease of printing, but also perhaps the appeal {{of the quality of the}} rich red colour that it yielded.|$|E

30|$|A {{widespread}} belief among {{scholars and}} connoisseurs of the Japanese color woodblock print (nishiki-e) holds that synthetic dyes were {{imported from the}} West in the 1860 s, and soon came {{to be used for}} all nishiki-e colorants during the Meiji period. These “cheap imported aniline dyes” are widely described as “gaudy”, “garish”, and “strident”, and thought to stand in sharp contrast to more muted “natural” colorants that preceded them. This study calls this narrative into question through an analysis of the colorants of nishiki-e from 1860 until 1900, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with micro-Raman, XRF and fiber optic reflectance spectroscopies. The results show that the introduction of synthetic dyes was gradual and selective, and that most of the customary colorants of the late Edo period continued in use. The results revealed a series of key turning points after 1860 : (1) In 1864, the purple dye rosaniline became the first synthetic dye to be used in nishiki-e, at first in combination with Prussian blue for a more bluish color. From 1875, it was usually mixed or replaced with methyl violet for a stronger purple. (2) In early 1869, a dramatic and until recently unrecognized transition took place, from the longstanding use of safflower as the dominant red, to its total replacement by imported <b>cochineal</b> <b>carmine.</b> Carmine remained the primary red for the next two decades, often combined with vermillion. (3) In 1877, eosine appeared as the first synthetic red dye in nishiki-e, used alone for pink, and in mixture with carmine for red. (4) Finally, from 1889, a succession of red naphthol dyes of more striking color appeared. Just about this time, however, a tendency to more restrained use of color and more painterly effects began to emerge in nishiki-e, and {{with the exception of a}} burst of dynamic color in prints depicting the Sino–Japanese War (1894 – 95), the uses of strong colors in Meiji prints receded. A final key finding is that colorants were often combined, either through mixture in a bowl or on the printing block, or by two-step overprinting.|$|E

L- 1) 0. 33 culture, 120 sucrose, 1. 5 dye, 0. 4 aroma and 100 fructo-oligosaccharide syrup. The increase in concentration of the prebiotics positively influenced product preference, with acceptance rates of 88 % and increased microbiological counts of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium at 1. 7 × 10 (7) and 4. 8 × 10 (6) CFU. mL- 1 for 100 g.

The scale insect Dactylopius coccus produces the brilliant red-coloured carminic acid to deter predators. Up to 100,000 scale insects need to be collected and processed to make a kilogram (2.2 lbs) of cochineal dye. A similar number of lac bugs are needed to make a kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|R
30|$|From an {{historical}} {{point of view}} considering insects as food is not something new in Western societies. Greeks and Romans were consuming several kinds of insects (like grasshoppers and beetle larvae) which they considered delicacies (DeFoliart 1999). Nowadays consumers eat ingredients derived from insects mainly as additives or accidentally through the food processing. For example, an additive called <b>carmine</b> or <b>cochineal</b> is commonly used to add a red/pink colour to many food products such as yogurts, candies and drinks (Greenhawt and Baldwin 2008). This ingredient is a pigment of a bright-red colour obtained from specific insects (cochinidae), and it is coded as E 120 in the food labelling process. A couple of years ago, the US Food and Drug Administration set up a rule requiring food companies to list <b>cochineal</b> extract and <b>carmine</b> on their labels when they are used in food products or cosmetics, {{but it does not}} require companies to indicate that these ingredients are derived from insects (van Huis 2013).|$|R

Their uses aremore and more questioned {{with regard to}} the culture constraints or health problems. New resourcesfor the production of natural red colorants are therefore under focus [1, 2]. Marine-derived fungiare at the forefront in the search of new compounds of interest that could be produced throughbiotechnology [3]. In the field of colors, the marine-derived microfungi are able to synthesize awide diversity of pigments/ hues, amongst which red anthraquinones are well represented. Some oftheir main advantages are they are considered as natural, and their productions are « upscalable » inan industrial point of view. This work highlights the anthraquinoid red pigments known, up to date,from marine-derived fungi. We summarize about thirty compounds produced from about 25 strainsthat have been discovered in the former years. Beside the widespread Aspergillus, Alternaria,Eurotium, Fusarium or Penicillium, some original genera as Halorosellinia, Nigrospora,Stemphylium or Xylaria were identified as red anthraquinoid molecules’s producers. Well knownsubstances such as austrocortinin, catenarin, erythroglaucin or bostrycin were characterized in thefungal productions, as well as several new compounds, never mentioned, up to now, from otherorganisms. They could interestingly be further studied as potential sources of red colors to beoperated in food, cosmetic or dyeing industries. Beside their coloring properties, these compoundssometimes exhibit diverse biological activities such as antimicrobial or anticancer effects, sparselymentioned in the literature. This aspect, when available, is also documented, in order to examinethe potential use of these compounds and to help broadening the horizon of colors with innovativenatural substances.
