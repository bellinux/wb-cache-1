50|$|The manuals for the Monotype <b>composition</b> <b>caster</b> (1952 {{and later}} editions) mention {{at least five}} {{different}} alloys {{to be used for}} casting, depending the purpose of the type and the work to be done with it.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{different}} approaches to mechanising typesetting were independently developed in the late 19th century. One, known as the Monotype <b>composition</b> <b>caster</b> system, produced texts {{with the aid of}} perforated paper-ribbons, all characters are cast separate. These machines could produce texts also in [...] "large-composition" [...] up to 24 point.|$|E
50|$|Although {{care was}} taken to avoid mixing {{different}} types of type metal in shops with different type casting systems, in actual practice this often occurred. Since a Monotype <b>composition</b> <b>caster</b> can cope {{with a variety of}} different metal alloys, occasional mixing of Linotype alloy with discarded typefounders alloy has proven its usefulness.|$|E
50|$|This font was {{the last}} design of Giovanni Mardersteig. Charles Malin, the {{engraver}} producing the punches for Mardesteig died in 1955. After this event Mardersteig did not want any more new designs. In his opinion punches made with a pantograph were inferior. The character was later adapted for <b>composition</b> <b>casters</b> by Monotype and released in 1957.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving {{this far}} too lovely maiden, I {{went up the}} steps only a few yards, and, turning me round, looked upon a view of water, island, broad river, fair grazing ground, and belted wood that made me rejoice that I was alive. The {{hillside}} below me and above me was ablaze with pagodas--from a gorgeous golden and vermilion beauty to a delicate grey stone one just completed in honour of an eminent priest lately deceased at Mandalay. Far above my head there was a faint tinkle, as of golden bells, and a talking of the breezes in {{the tops of the}} toddy-palms. Wherefore I climbed higher and higher up the steps till I reached a place of great peace, dotted with Burmese images, spotlessly clean. Here women now and again paid reverence. They bowed their heads and their lips moved, because they were praying. I had an umbrella--a black one--in my hand, deck-shoes upon my feet, and a helmet upon my head. I did not pray--I swore at myself for being a Globe-trotter, and wished that I had enough Burmese to explain to these ladies that I was sorry and would have taken off my hat but for the sun. A Globe-trotter is a brute. I had the grace to blush as I tramped round the pagoda. That will be remembered to me for righteousness. But I stared horribly--at a gold and red side-temple with a beautifully gilt image of Buddha in it--at the grim figures in the niches {{at the base of the}} main pagoda--at the little palms that grew out of the cracks in the tiled paving of the court--at the big palms above, and at the low hung bronze bells that stood at each corner for the women to smite with stag-horns. Upon one bell rang this amazing triplet in English, evidently the <b>composition</b> of the <b>caster,</b> who completed his work--and now, let us hope, has reached Nibban--thirty-five years ago:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Fairbank also {{designed}} one upright italic typeface for Monotype. It was named [...] "Bembo Condensed Italic", Monotype series 294 {{as part of}} their Bembo family, a name which irritated Fairbank who thought it should have been kept as an independent design. This face was for the <b>composition</b> <b>caster</b> in metal type only available in 4 sizes: 10, 12, 13 and 16pt. The last size was made for large composition. It was digitised in 2004 as [...] "Fairbank".|$|E
50|$|In 1880s, Tolbert Lanston {{invented the}} Monotype System, which {{consisted}} of a keyboard (typesetting machine) and a <b>composition</b> <b>caster.</b> The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in 0, {{one or more of}} 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.|$|E
50|$|The Monotype System took a {{different}} direction in hot metal typesetting, with {{the ability of the}} <b>Composition</b> <b>Caster</b> to cast loose type using a paper tape operated automatic casting machine. The paper tape would be first generated on a keyboard and then used to cast the type, the tape could be stored for future casting for subsequent editions. This was a popular system for book work. Text was produced completely aligned, with all spaces in each line exactly the same width. Corrections and complex work could be done on the text by hand after the bulk of the text had been set by machine. The Super Caster and Orphan Annie were used to cast fonts of loose type for hand setting as well as spacing material and patterned rules.|$|E
