5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the displacement of <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes by other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.|$|E

50|$|Developed {{from the}} earlier Geissler tube, the Crookes tube {{consists}} of a partially evacuated glass bulb of various shapes, with two metal electrodes, the cathode and the anode, one at either end. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> (electrons) are projected in straight lines from the cathode. It was used by Crookes, Johann Hittorf, Julius Plücker, Eugen Goldstein, Heinrich Hertz, Philipp Lenard and others to discover the properties of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays,</b> culminating in J.J. Thomson's 1897 identification of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> as negatively charged particles, which were later named electrons. Crookes tubes are now used only for demonstrating <b>cathode</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jean-Baptiste Perrin {{wanted to}} {{determine}} whether the <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> actually carried negative charge, or whether they just accompanied the charge carriers, as the Germans thought. In 1895 he constructed a tube with a 'catcher', a closed aluminum cylinder with a small hole in the end facing the cathode, to collect the <b>cathode</b> <b>rays.</b> The catcher was attached to an electroscope to measure its charge. The electroscope showed a negative charge, proving that <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> really carry negative electricity.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1870s Goldstein {{undertook}} his own {{investigations of}} discharge tubes, and named the light emissions studied by others Kathodenstrahlen, or <b>cathode</b> <b>rays.</b> [...] He discovered several important properties of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays,</b> which {{contributed to their}} later identification as the first subatomic particle, the electron. He found that <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> were emitted perpendicularly from a metal surface, and carried energy. He attempted to measure their velocity by the Doppler shift of spectral lines in the glow emitted by Crookes tubes.|$|R
5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 {{were used to}} hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Gravity, <b>cathode</b> <b>rays,</b> {{and bolts}} of {{lightning}} share one important feature in common. They are all manifestations of aether flow. Gravity is a tension associated with aether that is flowing into a sink, and since it acts equally on all particles within a body, the acceleration due to gravity {{does not depend on}} the inertial mass of the body that is undergoing the acceleration. <b>Cathode</b> <b>rays</b> on the other hand can heat a body, charge a body, and cause a body to accelerate. In the latter case, the inertial mass of the body is a relevant factor in deciding the acceleration that will be induced in that body by the incident <b>cathode</b> <b>rays.</b> It will be concluded that <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> are a pressurized flow of aether and that inertial mass is a capacity to absorb aether pressure...|$|R
5000|$|Crookes tubes were {{unreliable}} and temperamental. Both {{the energy}} and the quantity of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> produced depended on the pressure of residual gas in the tube. Over time the gas was absorbed by {{the walls of the}} tube, reducing the pressure. This reduced the amount of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> produced and caused the voltage across the tube to increase, creating 'harder' more energetic <b>cathode</b> <b>rays.</b> Soon the pressure got so low the tube stopped working entirely. To prevent this, in heavily used tubes such as x-ray tubes various [...] "softener" [...] devices were incorporated that released a small amount of gas, restoring the tube's function.|$|R
5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Thomson's {{illustration}} of the Crookes tube by which he observed the deflection of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> by an electric field (and later measured their mass to charge ratio). <b>Cathode</b> <b>rays</b> were emitted from the cathode C, passed through slits A (the anode) and B (grounded), then through the electric field generated between plates D and E, finally impacting the surface at the far end.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cathode</b> <b>rays</b> {{themselves}} are invisible, but this accidental fluorescence allowed researchers {{to notice that}} objects in the tube {{in front of the}} cathode, such as the anode, cast sharp-edged shadows on the glowing back wall. In 1869, German physicist Johann Hittorf was first to realize that something must be traveling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadows. Eugen Goldstein named them <b>cathode</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird {{was able}} to {{demonstrate}} the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the Nipkow disk and thus {{became known as the}} mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning 30 September 1929. However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.|$|E

5000|$|Philipp Lenard {{wanted to}} see if <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. He built a tube with a [...] "window" [...] in the glass {{envelope}} made of aluminum foil just thick enough to hold the atmospheric pressure out (later called a [...] "Lenard window") facing the cathode so the <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> would hit it. He found that something did come through. Holding a fluorescent screen up to the window caused it to fluoresce, even though no light reached it. A photographic plate held up to it would be darkened, even though it was not exposed to light. The effect had a very short range of about 2.5 cm. He measured the ability of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> to penetrate sheets of material, and found they could penetrate much farther than moving atoms could. Since atoms were the smallest particles known at the time, this was first taken as evidence that <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> were waves. Later it was realized that electrons were much smaller than atoms, accounting for their greater penetration ability. Lenard was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for his work.|$|R
5|$|The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) {{mainframe}} computer {{was built in}} the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory between 1946 and 6 May 1949, when it ran its first program, and remained in use until 11 July 1958. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes (CRTs) to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human-computer interaction, Alexander S. Douglas, a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} with two aims: {{to prove the}} {{practicality}} of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on standard <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes (CRTs); and to construct a machine {{that could be used}} to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems. The first of the series, the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), ran its first program on 21 June 1948. As the world's first stored-program computer, the SSEM, and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it, quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government, who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version. The resulting machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, was the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E
5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cathode</b> <b>rays</b> were {{discovered}} by Johann Hittorf in 1869 in primitive Crookes tubes. He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (Negative electrode) which could cast {{shadows on the}} glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, Arthur Schuster demonstrated <b>cathode</b> <b>rays</b> could be deflected by electric fields, and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, J. J. Thomson succeeded in measuring the mass of <b>cathode</b> <b>rays,</b> showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first [...] "subatomic particles", which were later named electrons. The earliest version of the CRT {{was known as the}} [...] "Braun tube", invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen.|$|R

5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E
