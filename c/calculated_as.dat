5|$|The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally {{that has}} been <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. Radiocarbon dating has pushed back the {{calculations}} of the K'iche' conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their conquest of the Mam kingdoms may have taken place {{as early as the}} 12th century. The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E

If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as L + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E

Total world production, for comparison purposes expressed as HCl, is estimated at 20Mt/year, with 3Mt/year from direct synthesis, and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses. By far, most hydrochloric acid is consumed captively by the producer. The open world market size is estimated at 5Mt/year.|$|E
5|$|The Kragujevac {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} murder of between 2,778 and 2,794mostly Serb {{men and boys}} in Kragujevac by German soldiers on 21October 1941. It occurred in the German-occupied territory of Serbia during World War II, and came in reprisal for insurgent attacks in the Gornji Milanovac district {{that resulted in the}} deaths of 10German soldiers and the wounding of 26others. The number of hostages to be shot was <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> a ratio of 100hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50hostages executed for every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by Adolf Hitler with the intent of suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} probability of Hale-Bopp's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10−9 per orbit. However, {{given that the}} comet nucleus is around 60km in diameter, the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic. Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×1019 g. At a probable impact velocity of 52.5km/s, impact energy can be <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> 1.9×1032 ergs, or 4.4×109 megatons, about 44 times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnitude}} of diffusion damping is <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> a damping factor or suppression factor, {{represented by the}} symbol , which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). What affect the diffusion length are primarily {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be <b>calculated</b> <b>as</b> approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
