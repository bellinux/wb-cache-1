50|$|The {{simplicity}} and robustness of the Cre-loxP systems has enabled scientists {{to exploit the}} <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> in order to manipulate DNA both in vivo and in vitro. See Cre-Lox Recombination for more details. The <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> can be expressed in many different organisms such as plants, bacteria, mammals, yeast. In 1992 Cre was expressed and found to be functional in a mouse host. Promoter regions can be manipulated to allow precise temporal control of <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> expression (E.g. RU486-sensitive chimeric regulator GLVP). As the enzyme has a specific 34bp DNA substrate the genome of the organism {{would have to be}} 1018 bp in length for there to be a likely occurrence of a loxP site. As mammalian genomes are on average in the region of 3 bp there is a very low chance of finding an endogenous loxP site. For Cre to be functional in a foreign host, exogenous loxP sites must be engineered. This allows precise control over the activity of the <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> in test organisms.|$|E
50|$|The system {{consists}} of a single enzyme, Cre recombinase, that recombines a pair of short target sequences called the Lox sequences. This system can be implemented without inserting any extra supporting proteins or sequences. The <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> and the original Lox site called the LoxP sequence are derived from bacteriophage P1.|$|E
50|$|Placing Lox {{sequences}} appropriately allows {{genes to}} be activated, repressed, or exchanged for other genes. At a DNA level {{many types of}} manipulations can be carried out.

50|$|P1 phage {{had been}} {{discovered}} in 1951, but was little understood when Sternberg began to research the virus. He discovered the Cre-lox site-specific recombination system, in which the <b>Cre</b> recombinase <b>enzyme</b> acts at the lox recombination site to allow P1's double-stranded DNA genome to circularise after infection. Sternberg, Brian Sauer and others in his group subsequently showed that Cre-lox is a flexible recombination system which also functions in eukaryotic cells, {{and it is now}} widely used in genetic engineering. Sternberg elucidated multiple other features of the phage and its life cycle, including lytic and lysogenic replication cyles, DNA methylation and viral packaging, as well as immunity to the phage. He and his coworkers also developed P1-derived cloning vectors, enabling the cloning of very long stretches of DNA, which have been used in mapping the human genome.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{method has}} been {{established}} to sequentially delete combinations of genes from the ASFV genome to test the effect on virus replication and host responses to infection. Initially the ASFV genes MGF 505 2 R and MGF 505 3 R and a truncated MGF 360 9 L gene were deleted from the genome of the tissue-culture adapted ASFV strain BA 71 V and replaced with bacteriophage loxP sequences flanking the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene to create recombinant virus VΔMGF-GUS. Subsequently the GUS gene was removed by site-specific recombination between the two loxP sites involving expression of the bacteriophage <b>Cre</b> recombinase <b>enzyme</b> to create recombinant virus VΔMGFΔGUS. The EP 402 R and EP 153 R genes were subsequently deleted from the genome of VΔMGFΔGUS, using the same GUS marker gene, to construct virus VΔMGFΔCD 2 -Lectin-GUS. These sequential deletions of ASFV genes were shown not to alter virus replication significantly...|$|R
50|$|The phage {{particle}} adsorbs {{onto the}} surface of the bacterium using the tail fibers for specificity. The tail sheath contracts and the DNA of the phage is injected into the host cell. The host DNA recombination machinery or the <b>cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> translated from the viral DNA recombine the terminally redundant ends and circularize the genome. Depending on various physiological cues, the phage may immediately proceed to the lytic phase or it may enter a lysogenic state.|$|E
50|$|The P1 phage DNA when {{released}} into the host from the virion {{is in the form}} of a linear double stranded DNA molecule. The <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> targets loxP sites at the ends of this molecule and cyclises the genome. This can also take place in the absence of the Cre lox system with the help of other bacterial and viral proteins. The P1 plasmid is relatively large (~90Kbp) and hence exists in a low copy number - usually one per cell. If the two daughter plasmids get interlinked one of the daughter cells of the host will lose the plasmid. The Cre-lox recombination system prevents these situations by unlinking the rings of DNA by carrying out two recombination events (linked rings -> single fused ring -> two unlinked rings). It is also proposed that rolling circle replication followed by recombination will allow the plasmid to increase its copy number when certain regulators (repA) are limiting.|$|E
50|$|The {{active site}} of the <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{consists}} of the conserved catalytic triad residues Arg 173, His 289, Arg 292 {{as well as the}} conserved nucleophilic residues Tyr 324 and Trp 315. Unlike some recombinase enzymes such as Flp recombinase, Cre does not form a shared active site between separate subunits and all the residues that contribute to the active site are found on a single subunit. Consequently when two Cre molecules bind at a single loxP site two active sites are present. Cre mediated recombination requires the formation of a synapse in which two Cre-LoxP complexes associate to form {{what is known as the}} synapse tetramer in which 4 distinct active sites are present. Tyr 324 acts as a nucleophile to form a covalent 3’-phosphotyrosine linkage to the DNA substrate. The scissile phosphate (phosphate targeted for nucleophilic attack at the cleavage site) is coordinated by the side chains of the 3 amino acid residues of the catalytic triad (Arg 173, His 289 & Trp 315). The indole nitrogen of tryptophan 315 also forms a hydrogen bond to this scissile phosphate. (n.b A Histidine occupies this site in other tyrosine recombinase family members and performs the same function). This reaction cleaves the DNA and frees a 5’ hydroxyl group. This process occurs in the active site of two out of the four recombinase subunits present at the synapse tetramer. If the 5’ hydroxyl groups attack the 3’-phosphotyrosine linkage one pair of the DNA strands will exchange to form a Holliday Junction intermediate.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used technique is the Cre-lox recombination system. The <b>Cre</b> recombinase <b>enzyme</b> specifically recognizes two lox (loci of recombination) sites within DNA and causes recombination between them. During recombination two strands of DNA exchange information. This recombination will cause a deletion or inversion of the genes between the two lox sites, depending on their orientation. An entire gene can be removed to inactivate it. This whole system is inducible so a chemical {{can be added to}} knock genes out at a specific time. Two of the {{most commonly}} used chemicals are tetracycline, which activates transcription of the Cre recombinase gene and tamoxifen, which activates transport of the Cre recombinase protein to the nucleus. Only a few cell types express Cre recombinase and no mammalian cells express it so there is no risk of accidental activation of lox sites when using conditional gene knockout in mammals. Figuring out how to express Cre-recombinase in an organism tends to be {{the most difficult part of}} this technique.|$|R
40|$|In mice {{transgenesis}} through oocyte injection or DNA recombination in embryonal stem (ES) cells allows mutations to {{be introduced}} into the germline. However, the earliest phenotype of the introduced mutation can eclipse later effects. We show in mice that site-specific genomic recombination can be induced in a selected cell type, B lymphocytes, at a chosen time. This precision of somatic mutagenesis was accomplished by limiting expression of a Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion protein to B lymphocytes by use of tissue-specific elements in the promoter of the transgene employed. The expressed fusion protein remained inactive until derepressed by systemic administration of an exogenous ligand for the estrogen receptor, 4 -OH-tamoxifen. Upon derepression the <b>Cre</b> recombinase <b>enzyme</b> deleted specific DNA segments, flanked by loxP sites, in B lymphocytes only. The efficiency of recombination in cells expressing the fusion protein could be varied from low levels to > 80 %, depending on the dose of ligand administered. Our work presents a paradigm applicable to other uses of site-specific recombination in somatic mutagenesis where both temporal and spatial regulation are desired...|$|R
40|$|Cre {{recombinase}} is extensively used {{to engineer}} the genome of experimental animals. However, its use-fulness is still {{limited by the}} lack of an ef®cient tem-poral control over its activity. To overcome this, we have developed DiCre, a regulatable fragment complementation system for <b>Cre.</b> The <b>enzyme</b> was split into two moieties that were fused to FKBP 12 (FK 506 -binding protein) and FRB (binding domain of the FKBP 12 ±rapamycin-associated protein), respectively. These can be ef®ciently hetero-dimerized by rapamycin. Several variants, based on splitting Cre at different sites and using different linker peptides, were tested in an indicator cell line. The fusion proteins, taken separately, had no recombinase activity. Stable transformants, co-expressing complementing fragments based on splitting Cre between Asn 59 and Asn 60, displayed low background activity affecting 0. 05 ± 0. 4 % of the cells. Rapamycin induced a rapid recombination, reaching 100 % by 48 ± 72 h, with an EC 50 of 0. 02 nM. Thus, ligand-induced dimerization can ef®ciently regulate Cre, and should be useful to achieve a tight temporal control of its activity, such {{as in the case of}} the creation of conditional knock-out animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{site-specific}} recombination mediated by Cre recombinase has been utilized extensively in genetic engineering and gene function studies. Efficient {{delivery of a}} <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> with enzymatic activity {{and the ability to}} monitor the enzyme expression are required in applications, and lentiviral constructs with a fluorescent protein (FP) to report the Cre expression are suitable for most studies. However, the current lentiviral vector systems have some deficiencies in precise reporting the Cre expression through fluorescence. To solve the problem, we generated a lentiviral system with Cre and RFP or EGFP bridged by an FMDV 2 A sequence in an open reading frame expressed by a CMV promoter. We then examined the capabilities of the constructs to package with VSVG into infectious virus and to mediate expression of the <b>Cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> and fluorescent reporter. Furthermore, we monitored the bioactivities of the expressed products. We demonstrated the coordinate expression of the enzyme and the reporter. The expressed Cre was efficient at removing LoxP-flanked fragments in cells and did not show obvious cellular toxicity, and the expressed FPs allowed direct observation under fluorescent microscope. Therefore, the conjugation of CMV-Cre- 2 A-FP represents a significant improvement to the current lentiviral Cre delivery systems for obtaining a required Cre activity while accurately monitoring its presence. Our study also provides information concerning application of the established vector system. J. Cell. Biochem. 113 : 29092919, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To overcome this obstacle, we have generated mice homozygous for a floxed Pthrp allele, i. e. two loxP sites flanking exon 4 of the Pthrp gene, which encodes most of the protein, with the aim of accomplishing cell type-and tissue-specific deletion of the gene.

40|$|Optogenetic {{actuators}} such as Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) are seven-transmembrane {{proteins that}} function as light-gated ion channels. These naturally occurring proteins {{are found in}} green algae and serve as sensory photoreceptors controlling phototaxis. Operationally, they contain the light-isomerizable chromophore all-trans-retinal that, upon absorption of a photon at or around 473 nm, a conformational change to 13 -cis-retinal is induced. This change opens the channel allowing cations to flow through. In the absence of light, the 13 -cis-retinal relaxes back to the resting all-trans-retinal conformation and the channel closes.

40|$|Heterospecific lox {{sites are}} mutated lox sites {{that in the}} {{presence}} of Cre recombinase recombine with themselves but not or much less with wildtype loxP.

In such a palindromic DNA configuration, also the occurrence of other DNA repeat-mediated recombination events is somewhat increased in the presence of Cre. The results indicate that in recombinase mediated cassette exchange or other double lox applications based on the exclusivity of heterospecific lox sites, or in research combining Cre-lox approaches with hairpin RNA for gene silencing, the presence of duplicated DNA around lox sites has to be taken into account.

40|$|The site-directed {{recombinase}} Cre can {{be employed}} to delete or express genes in cell lines or animals. Clearly, {{the ability to control}} remotely the activity of this enzyme would be highly desirable. To this end we have constructed expression vectors for fusion proteins consisting of the Cre recombinase and a mutated hormone-binding domain of the murine oestrogen receptor. The latter still binds the anti-oestrogen drug tamoxifen but no longer 17 beta-oestradiol. We show here that in embryonic stem cells expressing such fusion proteins, tamoxifen can efficiently induce Cre-mediated recombination, thereby activating a stably integrated LacZ reporter gene. In the presence of either 10 microM tamoxifen or 800 nM 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen, recombination of the LacZ gene is complete within 3 - 4 days. By placing a tamoxifen-binding domain on both ends of the Cre protein, the enzymatic activity of Cre can be even more tightly controlled.

40|$|ATP-dependent {{chromatin}} remodeling <b>enzymes</b> (<b>CRE)</b> are bio-molecular motors in eukaryotic cells. These {{are driven}} by a chemical fuel, namely, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CREs actively participate in many cellular processes that require accessibility of specific segments of DNA which are packaged as chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is a nucleosome where 146 bp ∼ 50 nm of a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) is wrapped around a spool formed by histone proteins. The helical path of histone-DNA contact on a nucleosome is also called "footprint". We investigate the mechanism of footprint traversal by a CRE that translocates along the dsDNA. Our two-state model of a CRE captures effectively two distinct chemical (or conformational) states in the mechano-chemical cycle of each ATP-dependent CRE. We calculate the mean time of traversal.

Such a "police virus" could attack and remove the integrated provirus which is not possible using contemporary strategies. The hypothesis was tested by developing a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of virus-host cell interaction {{and the consequences of}} introducing the "police virus".

In this study, we evaluated these in four common Cre transgenic strains with thymus-initiated promoters (Lck, Cd 2, or Cd 4). We found that while all of them eventually labeled nearly all thymocytes, their kinetics were dramatically different, and other than Cd 4 [Cre], did not faithfully recapitulate the expression pattern of the corresponding endogenous gene. Perhaps even more importantly, while thymuses from some strains compared favorably to thymuses from control (Cre-negative) mice, we found that Cre expression {{could also result in}} off-target effects, including moderate to severe decreases in thymic cellularity. These effects occurred in the absence of loxP-flanked DNA target genes, and were dose and copy number dependent. Loss of cellularity was attributable to a specific decrease in CD 4 (+) 8 (+) immature cells, and corresponds to an increased rate of programmed cell death. In addition to a comprehensive analysis of activation kinetics in thymus-initiated Cre transgenes, our data show that Cre is toxic to CD 4 (+) 8 (+) cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and emphasize that the choice of thymus-initiated Cre strain is critically important for minimizing off-target effects of Cre...|$|R

In the resulting mutants, the target gene is replaced by a lox 66 -P 32 -cat-lox 71 cassette, where lox 66 and lox 71 are mutant variants of loxP and P 32 -cat is a chloramphenicol resistance cassette.

Thus, transient Cre recombinase expression in double-crossover mutants leads to recombination of the lox 66 -P 32 -cat-lox 71 cassette into a double-mutant loxP site, called lox 72, which displays strongly reduced recognition by Cre. The effectiveness of the Cre-lox-based strategy for multiple gene deletions was demonstrated by construction of both single and double gene deletions at the melA and bsh 1 loci on the chromosome of the gram-positive model organism Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS 1. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Cre-lox-based system in multiple gene replacements was determined by successive mutagenesis of the genetically closely linked loci melA and lacS 2 in L. plantarum WCFS 1. The fact that 99. 4 % of the clones that were analyzed had undergone correct Cre-lox resolution emphasizes the suitability of the system described here for multiple gene replacement and deletion strategies in a single genetic background...|$|E
40|$|Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) is an {{essential}} co-factor for NO production from NOS enzymes. When BH 4 levels become limiting these enzymes can become 'un-coupled', leading to superoxide production. GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), encoded by GCH 1, is {{an essential}} enzyme in the biosynthesis of BH 4. BH 4 deficiency has been been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction and to exacerbate atherosclerosis in experimental models. However, the role of BH 4 in regulating iNOS activity in leukocytes, and {{the potential impact of}} this on atherosclerosis is less clear. We have utilised a novel transgenic mouse to address the role of BH 4 and iNOS in macrophage biology. We designed mice harbouring a 'floxed' portion of the GCH 1 locus within the active site of the enzyme (GCHfl/fl mice). We crossed these with mice expressing the <b>cre</b> <b>enzyme</b> under control of the Tie 2 promoter (GCHfl/fl Tie 2 cre). Cre expression causes efficient excision of the floxed allele in all leukocytes and endothelial cells, as detected by PCR for the floxed or knockout allele. To examine the effects of BH 4 deficiency on macrophage biology and iNOS activity we utilised bone marrow derived macrophage cultures and compared un-activated macrophages with iNOS-expressing inflammatory macrophages. Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages cultured from GCHfl/fl mice show GTPCH protein expression and BH 4 production, but have no iNOS expression. Stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide and Interferon-γ increases BH 4 production and also induces iNOS protein expression and NO-derived nitrite accumulation. GCHfl/fl Tie 2 cre cells show no GTPCH protein expression and barely detectable levels of BH 4 and, despite normal iNOS protein levels following stimulation, exhibit no nitrite accumulation. Furthermore GCHfl/fl Tie 2 cre BMDM show enhanced ROS production, as measured by DHE-HPLC. Intracellular BH 4 levels can be rescued by treatment with the precursor sepiapterin, which also restores iNOS-mediated nitrite production and reduces ROS production by the macrophages. Gene array analysis of GCHfl/fl Tie 2 cre vs wildtype macrophages demonstrated only minimal genotype associated changes. However macrophages treated with LPS and Interferon-γ showed significant changes in 74 genes (passing FDR < 5 %) as a result of genotype. Pathway analysis of these genes revealed decreased upstream activation of nrf 2. Decreased expression of nrf 2 dependent genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{transduction}} technique {{enables the}} direct delivery of biologically active material into mammalian cells [for review see 1, 2]. For this {{one can make}} use of the translocating ability of so-called cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), also designated as protein transduction domains (PTDs). The TAT-CPP derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Tat (trans-activator of transcription) protein has been widely used. The positively charged TAT promotes cell permeability thereby overcoming the barriers of the cellular membrane by endocytosis or/ and direct membrane penetration 2. In combination with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) fusion proteins are able to enter the nucleus exhibiting functionality. Our video presentation demonstrates, as an exemplification for the engineering of cell-permeable proteins, the construction, production and application of a cell-permeable version of the DNA-modifying <b>enzyme</b> <b>Cre.</b> Cre is a site-specific recombinase that is able to recognize and recombine 34 base pair loxP sites in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore the Cre/loxP system is widely used to conditionally induce mutations in the genome of living cells 3, 4. The delivery of active Cre recombinase to cells, however, represents a limitation. We describe the pSESAME vector system, which allows a direct insertion of the gene-of-interest and provides a platform to rapidly clone different domains and tags used within the vector in a convenient and standardized manner. Rearranging of the different tags has been shown to modif...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in the agronomy of genetically engineered (GE) crops is to prevent gene flow to non-GE crops to wild relatives. 1 GE material should not enter the food production chain or the environment when and where this is not desired and/or not sufficiently controlled. This challenge requires the design of GE crop management protocols that generate added value to agriculture, while coexistence of organic, non-GE and GE crops satisfies the desire of consumers and/or markets. A major route for unwanted mixing of GE crops and non-GE plants is gene flow by pollen. Together with Dr. A. J. (Tony) Conner, Crop & Food Research Institute, New Zealand, we have demonstrated that gene flow by pollen can be effectively eliminated in a new approach that incorporates transgene removal into the biology of pollen formation. 2 Pollen without transgenes from plants with transgenes The new approach to remove transgenes from pollen makes novel use of existing methods using recombination for gene removal. Previously, such recombination-mediated approaches were largely aimed at removing undesired selectable marker genes from incoming DNA. 3 The gene for the necessary recombinase enzyme, often, but not limited to, the <b>enzyme</b> <b>Cre,</b> {{as well as its}} characteristic recombination sites (loxP), are added to the incoming DNA {{in such a way that}} the selectable marker gene along with the Cre gene is removed in a process known as auto-excision. This way, all incoming DNA can be removed, except for a single loxP site. Although it may sound silly to transform plants with transgenes with the aim to remove all incoming DNA, the crucial issue is where in the life cycle of the crop the transgenes are removed...|$|R
40|$|Regulatable {{control of}} gene {{expression}} in the mammalian brain is of tremendous importance in understanding the role of neural circuits in the processing, storage and retrieval of information. To understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, there {{is the need to}} develop diverse molecular genetic tools that allow for conditional gene regulation in the central nervous system. To address this issue, we have developed recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) equipped with tetracycline (Tet) -controlled genetic switches to inducibly and reversibly manipulate neural circuits, in the mammalian brain. The present work focused on three objectives: In the first part, long-term, Tet-controlled gene regulation in neurons was investigated. In this part, the rAAV system was used to study the kinetics of Tet-controlled gene regulation in vitro and in vivo using the firefly luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, repeated cycles of gene activation and inactivation in vivo were also demonstrated. In the second part, inducible, subregion- and cell type-restricted gene recombination and gene knockout in the mouse brain was investigated by employing the rAAV system expressing the site-specific <b>Cre</b> recombinase <b>enzyme</b> and a red fluorescent marker protein under Tet control. Conditional and region-specific gene recombination in transgenic reporter mice was carried out by either targeting the viruses to the hippocampus, cortex or both. Gene recombination occurred in these regions only upon Doxycycline (Tet derivative) injection. With the rAAV and Tet-controlled inducible gene expression systems, the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were knocked out in the barrel field. We clearly demonstrated by electrophysiology that loss of NMDA receptors took place after one week of Dox treatment. With the inducible knockout approach, we are currently investigating the function of NMDA receptors in acquisition and maintenance of associative learning and memory. In the last part, inducible and reversible silencing of synaptic transmission was investigated with the use of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC). By reversible silencing of synaptic transmission with TeTxLC, the role of neurons from different brain regions in memory consolidation processes and behavior will be investigated. With this approach, we have demonstrated that TeTxLC expression results in silencing of synaptic transmission. Moreover, by expressing the TeTxLC in the striatum of the mouse brain, a behavioral phenotype was produced, which was reversed by Dox administration. The original TeTxLC has a long half-life thus, very slow off rate. To reduce the half-life of the TeTxLC, new variants of TeTxLC were generated, named fast one (F 1 -TeTxLC) and fast two (F 2 -TeTxLC). With these new variants of TeTxLC, we observed that reversible silencing of synaptic transmission took place within 3 weeks with F 1 -TeTxLC and less than two weeks with F 2 -TeTxLC in vivo. We also demonstrated synaptic silencing in organotypic brain slices 24 - 48 hours after Dox treatment in vitro. A combination of these newly developed genetic tools will be of great advantage to investigate the role of neural circuits in learning, memory consolidation and behavior...|$|R
