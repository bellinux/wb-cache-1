In this study, {{a series of}} {{mechanically}} interlocked molecules like polypseudorotaxanes, rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes have been synthesized via CB 6 catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition using diazide and dialkyne monomers, which contain long dodecyl and short propyl aliphatic spacers. To reach these novel interlocked molecules, first appropriate monomeric units were designed and synthesized. These monomeric units were diazido and dialkyne functionalized, propyl and dodecyl spacers containing, diamine salts. These monomers were fully characterized by spectroscopic techniques like 1 H, 13 C-NMR and FT-IR and elemental analysis. After {{the preparation of the}} monomers, polypseudorotaxanes were synthesized via CB 6 catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition. The polymer formation proceeded through step-growth polymerization in the presence of CB 6. The reaction was followed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy easily, because the appearance of a diagnostic peak at 6. 5 ppm indicated the formation of triazole ring, which joins the monomers. The polypseudorotaxane was also characterized by spectroscopic techniques like 1 H, 13 C-NMR and FT-IR and matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). It produced a maximum mass at around 15600 Da which corresponds to about six repeating units that is basically 12 CB 6 <b>s</b> <b>threaded</b> triazoles. The experimental results reveal that this polypseudorotaxane behaves as a pH-driven polymeric switch. Thus, when amine groups are protonated at an appropriate pH, CB 6 s are located on the triazole rings due to ion–dipole interaction, whereas at high pH they move onto the hydrophobic aliphatic spacer rather than slipping off the polypseudorotaxane. After the synthesis of the polypseudorotaxanes, a series of rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes have also been synthesized using the already prepared dialkyne and diazide monomers. Rotaxanation was also carried out via a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction catalyzed by CB 6. Among them, a bistable CB 6 -based [3]rotaxane synthesized through CB 6 catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition contains two recognition sites and behaves as a reversible molecular switch.

40|$|O objetivo desse trabalho é pensar os problemas de representação acerca do tema do Touro, das Touradas e do Minotauro em três momentos específicos. O primeiro momento é o movimento vanguardista do início do século XX, o Surrealismo. O Touro e o Minotauro são revisitados e tomados como objetos de representações por diferentes artistas, produzindo experiências e percepções diferentes sobre o mesmo tema. Ainda no Surrealismo temos o segundo momento: as escritas pessoais e violentas de Michel Leiris e Georges Bataille. Os dois autores escrevem sobre as interseções entre o homem e o touro e seus resultados viscerais. Em Espelho da Tauromaquia, de Michel Leiris, e História do Olho, de Georges Bataille, o Touro aparece como um lugar de tensões e afetividades deslocadas. O terceiro momento se dá na Argentina da década de 50, quando os contemporâneos Julio Cortázar e Jorge Luis Borges se voltam para o mito do Minotauro como uma espécie de fio de Ariadne para suas escritas. Os dois autores tratam o Labirinto e o Minotauro como lugares de experimentações do fantástico. É também objetivo desse trabalho pensar o Minotauro como um monstro paradoxal que administra dois corpos ao mesmo tempo, tendo como baliza os textos de Gilles Deleuze sobre Lewis Carroll. Esses textos e autores formam um escopo {{substancial}} para pensar a Literatura como lugar de elaboração e tensões acerca da representação e produção de alteridade através de dualismos como Homem e Animal, Possível e Impossível, Real e Ficção. The {{objective of}} this essay is to analyse the representation issues surrounding the themes of the Bull, Bullfighting and the Minotaur in three specific instances. The first instance is in Surrealism, the early 20 th century avant-garde art movement. The Bull and the Minotaur are revisited and taken as object of representation by different painters during this movement. These artists, with personal perceptions, produce singular depictions of these figures. Within the Surrealist movement, emerges the second instance of interest for this work: the violent and personal writings of Michel Leiris and Georges Bataille. Both authors write about the intersections where human and bull meet and their visceral results. In the books Mirror of Tauromaquia by Michel Leiris and Story of the Eye by Bataille, the Bull emerges {{as a place of}} tensions and dislocated affectivities. The third instance takes place in 1950 s Argentina where the contemporary authors Julio Cortázar and Jorge Luis Borges turn to the myth of the Minotaur as a kind of Ariadne <b>s</b> <b>thread</b> device in their writings. Both authors write about the Labyrinth and the Minotaur as symbols of experimentation of the fantastic. It is also a matter of interest of this essay to think of the Minotaur as a paradoxical monster presiding over two bodies in one, based on texts of Gilles Deleuze on Lewis Carroll for this argument. These authors and their writings represent a substantial scope to support the idea of Literature as a means of elaboration and tension in the representation and production of Other through movements of dualisms such as Man and Animal, Possible and Impossible, Real and Fiction...|$|R

This phenomenon has created a new landscape in which the demand for trained professionals in computer security is extremely high. Colleges and universities are still adapting to this reality and different approaches to computer security instruction are being used throughout the world. Our main contributions in this paper are the identification and the analyses of three main categories of approaches to instruction in computer security: single-course, track, and thread. The single-course approach, which is highly popular, is one in which the student is offered a survey of several different topics in computer security in one course in the curriculum, often an elective. Although it provides considerable breadth of topics, it cannot provide depth since it is only introductory by design. In the track, concentration, or program approach the student takes a sequence of courses specialized in security and information assurance. The resources required to implement this approach are numerous and therefore it is not applicable {{to a wide variety of}} schools and departments. To illustrate the discussion of these first two approaches, we present an informal survey of courses and programs in computer security throughout the U. <b>S.</b> The <b>thread</b> approach is seldom advertised or implemented and is a compromise which bridges the gap between the single-course and the track approaches.

As a result, little progress appears to have been made in terms of changing things for the better for the majority of girls. Purpose: We offer an activist approach to work with girls in physical education as one possible means of breaking the reproductive cycle of research and media reporting that we suggest has worked against improving the situation for girls. We take a pragmatist stance to ask ‘can we make the situation for girls better than it is currently?’ and ‘how might we go about this task?’ We propose an activist approach not as ‘the solution’ to the ‘problem’ of girls in physical education, but as one worthy of testing in practice. Process: We begin by outlining the broad features of an activist approach to working with girls in physical education. We then overview the findings of a growing body of activist studies in physical education and identify four critical elements that we believe need to be present in order to assist girls to identify, name and negotiate barriers to their engagements with physical education and their participation in physically active lifestyles. We highlight one example of an activist study that shows how the four critical elements interact in their work with girls. Discussion: We argue for the need for a consensus around improving the current situation of girls in physical education, for a scaling up of this activist work as it is tested in practice, and for the coincidental development of a pedagogical model for working with girls in physical education...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to power}} constraints, {{computer}} architects will exploit TLP instead of ILP for future performance gains. Today, 4 – 8 state-of-the-art cores or 10 s of smaller cores can fit {{on a single}} die. For the foreseeable future, the number of cores will likely double with each successive processor generation. Hence, CMPs with 100 s of cores–so-called large-scale chip multiprocessors (LCMPs) –will become a reality after only 2 or 3 generations. Unfortunately, simply scaling the number of on-chip cores alone will not guarantee improved performance. In addition, effectively utilizing all of the cores is also necessary. Perhaps {{the greatest threat to}} processor utilization will be the overhead incurred waiting on the memory system, especially as on-chip concurrency scales to 100 <b>s</b> of <b>threads.</b> In particular, remote cache bank access and off-chip bandwidth contention are likely to be the most significant obstacles to scaling memory performance. This paper conducts an in-depth study of CMP scalability for parallel programs. We assume a tiled CMP in which tiles contain a simple core along with a private L 1 cache and a local slice of a shared L 2 cache. Our study considers scaling from 1 – 256 cores and 4 – 128 MB of total L 2 cache, and addresses several issues related to the impact of scaling on off-chip bandwidth and on-chip 1 communication. In particular, we find off-chip bandwidth increases linearly with core count, but the rate of increase reduces dramatically once enough L 2 cache is provided to capture inter-thread sharing. Our results also show for the range 1 – 256 cores, there should be ample on-chip bandwidth to support the communication requirements of our benchmarks. Finally, we find that applications become off-chip limited when their L 2 cache miss rates exceed some minimum threshold. Moreover, we expect off-chip overheads to dominate on-chip overheads for memory intensive programs and LCMPs with aggressive cores. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} {{with regular}} parallelism {{have been shown}} to benefit from using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However, employing GPUs for applications with irregular parallelism tends to be a risky process, involving significant effort from the program-mer. One major, non-trivial effort/risk is to expose the available parallelism in the application as 1000 <b>s</b> of concurrent <b>threads</b> with-out introducing data races or deadlocks via fine-grained data syn-chronization. To reduce this effort, prior work has proposed sup-porting transactional memory on GPU architectures. One hardware proposal, Kilo TM, can scale to 1000 s of concurrent transaction. However, performance and energy overhead of Kilo TM may deter GPU vendors from incorporating it into future designs. In this paper, we analyze the performance and energy efficiency of Kilo TM and propose two enhancements: (1) Warp-level transac-tion management allows transactions within a warp to be managed as a group. This aggregates protocol messages to reduce communi-cation overhead and captures spatial locality from multiple transac-tions to increase memory subsystem utility. (2) Temporal conflict detection uses globally synchronized timers to detect conflicts in read-only transactions with low overhead. Our evaluation shows that combining the two enhancements in combination can improve the overall performance and energy efficiency of Kilo TM by 65 % and 34 % respectively. Kilo TM with the above two enhancements achieves 66 % of the performance of fine-grained locking with 34 % energy overhead...|$|R

This thesis focuses on simple and flexible mechanisms that are used to improve the programmability of shared-memory multiprocessors. This thesis makes two main contributions. The first contribution is efficient coarse- grain operation of multiprocessors. This allows groups of dynamic instructions to behave as a unit in a multiprocessor system.

We also suggest other possible uses of bulk operations to illustrate its versatility. The second contribution of this thesis is architecture support and programming model for a data-centric approach to thread synchronization. In Data- Centric Synchronization (DCS), the programmer uses local reasoning to assign synchronization constraints to data.

The main types of planform (single, braided and wandering) of 227 channel segments were shown in the spatiotemporal matrix. Prevailing occurrence of a channel planform types in an individual CHS within seven time spans more than 4 times served as minimum for the discrimination of the trend of planform evolution during last sixty years. Seven evolutionary trends (B – braided, W – wandering, <b>S</b> – single <b>thread,</b> S-W – single-wandering, W-S – wandering-single, B-W – braided-wandering, W-B – wandering-braided) of planform were identified.

The stabilization of in-channel landforms and channel narrowing between years 1973 and 1992 reflect the prevailing of wandering channel planform. Situation has been changed in 2003 where the number of channel segments with braided channel planform increased.

This report describes an early divergence in global plant gene expression responses caused by a rhizobial defect in succinoglycan production, rather than in Nod factor production.

The Tethyan black shale records have become essential in studies of the transfer of organic carbon into the sediment record and for astronomical tuning and geological time scales. These records have been central in understanding climate control on ocean dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. The Mesozoic black shales were deposited within well-defined time envelopes of around 0. 5 to 1 Myr. These black shales, which were confined to certain chronostratigraphic intervals in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, were recognized as expressions of global Oceanic Anoxic Events in the mid- 1970 s and subsequently named after prominent researchers (Bonarelli, Selli, Goguel). The black shale episodes were dated by biostratigraphic methods and by high-resolution chemostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy. Mesozoic black shales are now interpreted as the oceanographic expression of major perturbations of the global carbon cycle and climate. Research into younger (Pliocene to Pleistocene) sedimentary cycles (including black shales, termed sapropels) exposed in land sections, or found in pelagic and hemipelagic marine sediment cores of Late Quaternary age, started in the 1950 <b>s.</b> Main <b>threads</b> pursued from this end of the record were the climatic control of oceanic processes that permitted the development of highly detailed and precise time scales tuned to the astronomical clock of insolation changes, palaeoclimate evolution of the circum-Mediterranean area and biogeochemical dynamics in anoxic basins. After 50 years of intensive research, the Tethyan and Mediterranean black shales remain subjects of fascination in Earth Science. Tracing the origins and building upon recent progress, the current hypotheses on their formation are reviewed here. It is a panorama of complex interplays between global and regional tectonics, climate dynamics during both Ice House and Greenhouse states of global and regional climate, oceanographic responses to these climate changes, and biogeochemical adaptations that were all needed to shape an extraordinary archive of global change in the absence of human activity...|$|R
40|$|Graphics {{processor}} units (GPUs) {{are designed}} to efficiently exploit thread level parallelism (TLP), multiplexing execution of 1000 <b>s</b> of concurrent <b>threads</b> on a relatively smaller set of single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) cores to hide various long latency opera-tions. While threads within a CUDA block/OpenCL workgroup can communicate efficiently through an intra-core scratchpad memory, threads in different blocks can only communicate via global mem-ory accesses. Programmers wishing to exploit such communication have to consider data-races that may occur when multiple threads modify the same memory location. Recent GPUs provide a form of inter-block communication through atomic operations for sin-gle 32 -bit/ 64 -bit words. Although fine-grained locks can be con-structed from these atomic operations, synchronization using locks is prone to deadlock. In this paper, we propose to solve these prob-lems by extending GPUs to support transactional memory (TM). Major challenges include supporting 1000 s of concurrent transac-tions and committing non-conflicting transactions in parallel. We propose KILO TM, a novel hardware TM design for GPUs that scales to 1000 s of concurrent transactions. Without cache coherency hardware to depend on, it uses word-level, value-based conflict detection to avoid broadcast communication and reduce on-chip storage overhead. It employs speculative validation using a novel bloom filter organization to increase transaction commit parallelism. For a set of TM-enhanced GPU applications, KILO TM captures 59 % {{of the performance of}} fine-grained locking, and is on average 128 × faster than executing all transactions serially, for an estimated hardware area overhead of 0. 5 % of a commercial GPU...|$|R
40|$|Some predators sidestep {{environments that}} render them {{conspicuous}} to the sensory systems of prey. However, these challenging environments are unavoidable for certain predators. Stenolemus giraffa is an assassin bug that feeds on web-building spiders; the web is {{the environment in}} which this predator finds its prey, but it also forms part of its preys’ sophisticated sensory apparatus, blurring the distinction between environment and sensory systems. Stenolemus giraffa needs to break threads in the web that obstruct its path to the spiders, and such vibrations can alert the spiders. Using laser vibrometry, this study demonstrates how S. giraffa avoids alerting the spiders during its approach. When breaking <b>threads,</b> <b>S.</b> giraffa attenuates the vibrations produced by holding on to the loose ends of the broken thread and causing them to sag prior to release. In addition, S. giraffa releases the loose ends of a broken thread one at a time (after several seconds or minutes) and in this way spaces out the production of vibrations in time. Furthermore, S. giraffa was found to maximally reduce the amplitude of vibrations when breaking threads that are prone to produce louder vibrations. Finally, S. giraffa preferred to break threads in the presence of wind, suggesting that this araneophagic insect exploits environmental noise that temporarily impairs the spiders’ ability to detect vibrations. The predatory behaviour of S. giraffa seems to be adaptated in intricate manner for bypassing the sophisticated sensory systems of web-building spiders. These findings illustrate how the physical characteristics of the environment, along with the sensory systems of prey can shape the predatory strategies of animals. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Haskell Silk Company founder, James Haskell, was {{a native}} of the Cape Anne, area of Massachusetts. In this locale his early career {{included}} service in numerous public and business capacities, not least as agent for The Rockport Steam Cotton Company, and as a State Senator. He was a man experienced in politics, finance and textile production. He moved to Maine in 1858 when he acquired the cotton mill at Saccarappa Falls, Westbrook. Under his management the mill, renamed The Westbrook Manufacturing Company, flourished and expanded. In 1874, his elder son, Frank Haskell, assumed the role of agent. At the same time James took advantage of, by now, well developed machine twist-making technology and launched into the youngest branch of the textile industry [...] silk. The Haskell Silk Company was established as a twist maker in 1874 and incorporated in 1876. Family money financed the venture forming a closely held corporation, more like a family partnership. This undoubtedly contributed to the Haskell Silk Company 2 ̆ 7 s long term stability [...] something unusual in the volatile silk industry. In business for more than 50 years (1874 - 1930) Haskell {{is one of the few}} U. S. silk companies with a history spanning the rise and demise of industrial silk manufacture in America. Of many small New England silk twist mills established at this time Haskell, in Maine, was the most northerly situated. Nevertheless, the Westbrook silk mill was one of the most successful. In competition with much larger twist makers, Haskell held its own in the market place.

This layer also provides TCP/IP interprocess communication among the Linux cluster’s 1 Gb LAN. We use the Yarp software package developed by Metta and Fitzpatrick [91]. We implemented a custom python-Yarp interface, allowing us to dynamically define and transmit data structures between processes at rates up to 100 hz. Additionally, two FireWire framegrabbers provide synchronized image pairs to the cluster. Finally, all image and sensory data are timestamped using the hardware clock from the CANbus PCI card. This ensures synchronization of the data up to the transmit time of the 1 Gb LAN. 4. 7. 4 Behavior Layer The behavior layer implements the robot’s visual processing, learning, and task behaviors. These algorithms are run within our behavior-based architecture named Slate. 4. 8 Slate: A Behavior Based Architecture We have developed a behavior based architecture named Slate. What is meant by a robot architecture? According to Mataric [90], An architecture provides a principled way of organizing a control system. However, {{in addition to providing}} structure, it imposes constraints on the way the control problem can be solved. Following Mataric, Arkin [4] notes the common aspects of behavior-based architectures: • emphasis on the importance of coupling sensing and action tightly • avoidance of representational symbolic knowledge • decomposition into contextually meaningful units Roboticists have developed many flavors of behavior based architectures. We refer to Arkin for a review [4]. Loosely stated, Slate is a lightweight architecture for organizing perception and control. It is implemented as a programming abstraction in Python that allows one to easily define many small computational threads.

This paper {{explores the}} range of values implicated by war and compares today 2 ̆ 7 s {{dominant}} values with those that prevailed during previous American wars, with a particular emphasis on the World War Two and early Cold War period. War is related to values, and as economists like to remind us, what we value becomes apparent in the movement of people and prices. Part I of this Article considers the moral, ethical and monetary values that prevailed throughout the 19402 ̆ 7 s and early 19502 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> The normative <b>threads</b> that kept the World War Two effort on track were those of mobilization and shared sacrifice. These dominant assumptions and policies represented a distinct ¿mobilization model¿ with big government serving as the central counter-force to private business interests. The mobilization model empowered {{the federal government to}} achieve its most important public policy objectives while enforcing limits on the self-interested activities of private actors. Those limits are perhaps best reflected in the neutralization of monetary policy and the application of administrative and regulatory authority to maintain price stability while channeling credit to the public sector. The Congress appropriated and the Executive spent on a massive scale. Resources - financial, human, technological and industrial - were mobilized. War today reflects far different values. Today we see the imagery and rhetoric of war, but rarely the ethic of shared sacrifice. Government power is routinely constrained by private interests. Part II contrasts the World War Two mobilization with the relative complacency of America 2 ̆ 7 s response to September 11 th and the conduct of war ever since, which is characterized by private spending, consumption and ¿business as usual. ¿ It is the failure to mobilize massive resources under conditions of shared sacrifice that has left the United States weakened at home and therefore with limited capabilities to exert its will abroad...|$|R
