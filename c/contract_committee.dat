5000|$|When Eisenhower {{was elected}} President in 1952, he {{believed}} hiring practices and anti-discrimination laws should {{be decided by}} the states, although the administration gradually continued to desegregate the Armed Forces and the federal government. The President also established the Government <b>Contract</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1953, which [...] "conducted surveys of the racial composition of federal employees and tax-supported contractors". The committee, chaired by Vice President Richard Nixon, had minimal outcomes in that they imposed the contractors with the primary responsibility of desegregation within their own companies and corporations.|$|E

If the committee feels that there is an integral component left out of the narrative and/or course list, the committee can make a stipulation (a demand of sorts) which the student must agree to before the contract is approved.|$|E
5000|$|Curaçao {{was thought}} an {{unlikely}} site for political turmoil, despite low wages, high unemployment, and economic disparities {{between blacks and}} whites. This tranquility was attributed by the island's government {{to the strength of}} family ties. In a 1965 pitch to investors, the government ascribed the absence of a communist party and labor unions' restraint to the fact that [...] "Antillean families are bound together by unusually strong ties and therefore extremist elements have little chance to interfere in labor relations." [...] Labor relations, including those between Shell and the refinery's workers, had indeed generally been fairly peaceful. After two minor strikes in the 1920s, a <b>contract</b> <b>committee</b> for Shell workers was established after a strike in 1936. Only from 1942 on did workers, though only those with Dutch nationality, have the right to elect their representatives on this committee. In 1955, the American CIO's Puerto Rican section aided the workers in launching the Petroleum Workers' Federation of Curaçao (PWFC). In 1957, the Federation reached a collective bargaining agreement.|$|E

This is helpful, as {{individuals}} like myself will no longer need to explain to our foreign students why the ‘Code’ has no actual legislative status, but only applies if adopted by the parties. The Code was originally designed to apply in the construction and engineering industries, and while it was ultimately decided that it could apply in all forms of arbitral proceedings, its origins may be detected in certain provisions. This short article does not seek to provide a comprehensive survey of the Code, but rather seeks to draw attention to noteworthy features and the questions which may be raised the...|$|E

In {{a number of recent}} decisions, such a conclusive proof provision {{has been the subject of}} judicial scrutiny, and there is now an ever-increasing doubt as to the validity of these guarantees.
