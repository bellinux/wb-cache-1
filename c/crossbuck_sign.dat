5000|$|... #Caption: The words [...] "Railroad Crossing" [...] {{normally}} {{appear on}} the <b>crossbuck</b> <b>sign</b> in the US, while in Canada, the sign is wordless and white with red trim. The road appears to make a turn so that it crosses the railroad at an angle closer to 90 degrees.|$|E
5000|$|These {{signs are}} used to warn of level {{crossings}} ahead. In most countries, a red triangle warning sign is used, with various pictograms for unguarded crossings, crossings with manual gates, and automatic level crossings. In most of Europe, an old-style gate is used for a crossing with gates, and a steam locomotive for a crossing without gates. Germany uses an electric train. Similar pictograms are also used in Ireland, albeit on an amber diamond sign. In the United States the warning {{of all types of}} railway crossings is made using a circular yellow sign. The actual crossing is also marked with crossed [...] "railroad crossing" [...] <b>crossbuck</b> <b>signs</b> (stop, look, listen) and possibly lights, bells, and barriers.|$|R
2500|$|Grade {{crossing}} protection {{practices in}} Canada are virtually {{identical to those}} in the United States (see below) using the same alternating flashing red lights and gate arms. The only significant differences are the <b>crossbuck</b> <b>signs,</b> which have no wording but are white with a red outline; the supplemental sign to indicate the number of tracks, which has an image of a track instead of the word [...] "TRACKS", and has the number and track image in either red (usually for CN rail lines) or black (for CP rail lines); and the advance-warning sign, which is a yellow diamond shape with a diagram of a track crossing a straight segment of road (similar to a crossroads sign, except that the horizontal road is replaced by a track). Before changes in regulations mandated bilingual (English and French) or no-wording <b>signs,</b> <b>crossbucks</b> were nearly identical {{to those in the}} US, except that they would either read [...] "Railway Crossing" [...] or “Traverse De Chemin De Fer” instead of [...] "Railroad Crossing." [...] The red lights also flash a little faster than in the United States.|$|R

50|$|The Kensington {{station has}} a former B&O station master's house. The {{building}} is open during the Kensington Farmers Market, which {{is held in}} the station parking lot. Inside {{there is an old}} stove, waiting area, and restrooms. Tickets can be purchased from a self-service machine. During the Kensington Labor Day Parade, CSX Transportation, which currently owns the railroad line, offers free souvenirs. There is also a small model train layout. The platform is a low level concrete platform. On the other side there is a covered waiting area and some benches. Elaborate safety measures {{can be found on the}} crosswalk between the platforms leading to the station entrance that include <b>crossbuck</b> <b>signs</b> with warning bells, highway signs, and pedestrian signals.|$|R
40|$|In 1982, Iowa's {{crossing}} warning {{identification system}} and signage at rail crossings were outdated, inconsistent and inadequate. Iowa's railroad system {{had been reduced}} and reorganized during the 1970 's {{and many of the}} surviving railroad companies were unable to install new signs or devote staff to updating information. The preliminary engineering part of this project improved the information inventory about each crossing, provided for installation of identification tags and resulted in a comprehensive list of posts and signs eligible for replacement. The sign installation portion of this project resulted in erection of nearly 10, 000 new <b>crossbuck</b> <b>signs</b> and 10, 000 advance warning signs with high intensity reflectorization. In addition, new posts and multiple track signs were replaced where appropriate. Increased visibility of crossings for the motoring public has resulted from proper sign placement and use of high intensity reflectorization. The tagging has provided a consistent correct identification of crossings for accident reporting. The computer inventory of information about the crossings is now correct and provides for informed decision making to administrators of Federal and State crossing safety funds...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the third survey (out of four surveys) that was conducted six months after the IVR system was operational. Drivers who had the IVR in the audible (visual) mode for the first three months would have switched to the visual (audible) mode for the next three months. The audible and visual groups gave similar average effectiveness ratings to all of the warning devices except the flashing lights, clanging bell, and IVR. The audible group rated these three devices higher than the visual group. The IVR average effectiveness rating from the audible group was 3. 8 using a 5. 0 scale, significantly higher than 2. 7 from the visual group. The visual warning message from the visual IVR was not as effective in attracting attention of the drivers as the beeping sound from the audible IVR. This is reflected in its effectiveness rating. The effectiveness rating for the audible mode of IVR was significantly higher than that of the advance warning and the <b>crossbuck</b> <b>signs,</b> {{similar to that of the}} train horn...|$|R
40|$|The {{drivers who}} {{received}} a combined audible and visual message (combination group) responded that the average effectiveness rating of the IVR was 3. 6 using a 5. 0 scale. This was higher than the 2. 5 rating from the drivers who received only a visual message throughout the study (visual-plus group). The combination group gave the IVR a rating that {{was similar to the}} clanging bell and the train horn, lower than the ratings for the crossing gate and flashing lights, but higher than the ratings for the advance warning and <b>crossbuck</b> <b>signs.</b> The visual-plus group gave IVR a rating that was similar to the advance warning sign, but was lower than the ratings of the other warning devices. About 61 % of the combination group trusted the IVR to give an accurate warning of a train presence compared to 33 % for the visual-plus group. For participating drivers who had experience with the audible, visual, and combination modes, the IVR had a high or very high ability {{to attract the attention of}} 71. 0 % using the audible mode, 26. 7 % usin...|$|R
50|$|A <b>crossbuck</b> is a <b>sign</b> {{composed}} of two slats of wood or metal of equal length, fastened together on a pole in a saltire formation (resembling the letter X). Crossbucks usually are a traffic sign to indicate level railway crossings, sometimes supplemented by electrical warnings of flashing lights, a bell, or a gate that descends to block the road and prevent traffic from crossing the tracks.|$|R
