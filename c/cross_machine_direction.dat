In this study, recycled materials, including recycled far-infrared polyester (FPET) fiber, three-dimensional crimped hollow flame-retarding (TPET) fiber, and low-melting-point polyester (LPET) fiber, are used to form nonwoven fabrics. The influence of different amounts of FPET fiber, 0 – 80 wt %, on the properties of nonwoven fabrics was examined. The sheath of LPET fibers can be melted as a result of hot pressing, which provides cohesion between fibers that mechanically improves the nonwoven fabrics. The tensile strength, tearing strength, air permeability, and far infrared (FIR) emissivity of the nonwoven fabrics were examined, thereby determining the optimal parameters. The test results show that the thermally treated nonwoven fabrics have better mechanical properties and FIR emissivity, compared to those of non-thermally treated nonwoven fabrics.

An experimental characterization scheme consisting of three experiments was proposed, and was shown to be sufficient to predict the creasing and folding behavior. For the whole paperboard the shear strength profiles in the through thickness direction was determined with the notched shear test. Each ply was laid free by grinding, and density measurements and in-plane tension tests were performed on the bottom, middle and top plies of each paperboard. Instead of assuming uniform properties in each ply, the shear strength profiles were used to map the measured properties in the through thickness direction. Numerical simulations were performed when the ply and interface properties of the paperboards were altered to follow different shear strength profiles. This was done in order to mimic different production strategies. It was shown that the interface strengths mainly influenced the folding behavior.

The PLA paper shall have enhanced moisture resistance and shall show less creep compared with conventional paper under a humid ambient climate. Therefore, dynamic sheets with different amounts of PLA (0 %, 5 % and 10 %) are manufactured. The sheets are made from unbleached softwood kraft pulp with two different grinding ratios and pulp from recovered paper. As well as examining the effect of PLA in paper, the influences of different grinding ratios and pulps are investigated. After testing of dynamic sheets, larger paper quantities of recovered paper with 0 %, 5 % and 10 % PLA are produced on a pilot paper machine (FEX). Afterwards those papers are pressed and heated to melt the PLA fibres in order to activate them. The results show that PLA strongly enhanced tensile strength (up to 80 %), stiffness, ductility and compression strength in dynamic sheets of unbeaten kraft and recovered paper. In beaten kraft dynamic sheets the strength improved slightly, whereas stiffness and compression strength decreased with addition of PLA. For unbeaten kraft paper mechano-sorptive creep was reduced.

The thermal deformation of calender roll under control actuators was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i. e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness.

Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize {{the magnitude of the}} response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the top roll, each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators.

40|$|Packaging {{of fresh}} fruit for export {{is a major}} use for {{corrugated}} fibreboard manufactured in New Zealand. However the cold and humid conditions used to preserve fruit quality are particularly detrimental {{to the strength of}} corrugated packaging. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a method to measure the performance of corrugated fibreboard in high and cycling relative humidity environments. This method was then used to compare the performance of three corrugated fibre-boards 1 For commercial reasons these will be referred to as 'CB 1 ', 'CB 2 'and 'CB 3 ' The creep performance of corrugated fibreboard was measured by subjecting samples to four point bending stress under controlled cyclic relative humidity conditions using a computer controlled testing apparatus. A mathematical model by Urbanik (1995) and an empirical exponential model were reviewed before selecting a three term model developed by Pecht (1985) to describe the deflection of the corrugated board. Cyclic relative humidity accelerated the rate of creep compared to a static high humidity environment. The rate of creep in the machine direction was found to be considerably lower than that in the <b>cross</b> <b>machine</b> <b>direction.</b> It was also found that increasing the peak relative humidity from 80 % to 90 % RH dramatically changed the deflection response. This provides a solution to conflicting data in the literature on relative humidity cycling effects. Isochronous deflection curves were used to compare the creep performance of the corrugated fibreboard samples in an environment cycling between 50 % and 90 % RH. Corrugated fibreboard sample CB 1 had a slightly lower creep stiffness than corrugated boards CB 2 (p= 0. 0580, n= 8) and CB 3 (p= 0. 0398, n= 8).

In this model, paperboard was modeled as a combination of an anisotropic elastic-plastic continuum model with isotropic hardening and a softening cohesive interface model. The paperboard was composed of four plies with uniform material parameters. Creasing simulations were done on both machine direction (MD) and <b>cross</b> <b>machine</b> <b>direction</b> (CD) samples to two crease depths 0. 0 mm and 0. 2 mm, respectively. The simulation results showed good agreement with experimental results.  The out-of-plane shear properties are dominating factors for creasing and folding. Therefore, a test method to determine shear properties was proposed. This {{part of the work}} is based on the most recently proposed test method, the laminated double notch shear test. To improve the technique, double notches with declined slopes, called tilted double notch shear test, were used instead of uniform depth double notches. The influence of shear zone length was also investigated. The results reveal the short shear zone lengths gave higher shear strength and more pronounced shear strength profile.  The results from the rst two analyses were utilized to study folding of paperboard. The simulation model was the same as in the creasing simulations. However, to improve the model and better account the actual micro structure of paperboard a new material mapping method was proposed. The continuum properties of the plies were assumed to vary in the thickness direction. The shear strengths of the interfaces were determined by using the tilted double notch shear test using a short shear zone length, L= 5 mm. The agreement between simulation results and experiment results was good, and most of the folding properties were captured.   QC 20110317 </p...|$|E
40|$|Linear Corrugating is {{a process}} for the {{manufacture}} of corrugated containers in which the flutes of the corrugated medium are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) of the several layers of paper used. Conversely, in the conventional corrugating process the flutes are oriented {{at right angles to}} the MD in the <b>Cross</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Direction</b> (CD). Paper is stronger in MD than in CD. Therefore, boxes made using the Linear Corrugating process are significantly stronger-in the prime strength criteria, Box Compression Test (BCT) than boxes made conventionally. This means that using Linear Corrugating boxes can be manufactured to BCT equaling conventional boxes but containing 30 % less fiber. The corrugated container industry is {{a large part of the}} U. S. economy, producing over 40 million tons annually. For such a large industry, the potential savings of Linear Corrugating are enormous. The grant for this project covered three phases in the development of the Linear Corrugating process: (1) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes on commercial equipment to verify that boxes so manufactured would have enhanced BCT as proposed in the application; (2) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes made on laboratory equipment using combined board from (1) above but having dual manufactures joints (glue joints). This box manufacturing method (Dual Joint) is proposed to overcome box perimeter limitations of the Linear Corrugating process; (3) Design, Construction, Operation and Evaluation of an engineering prototype machine to form flutes in corrugating medium in the MD of the paper.

40|$|Image {{quality and}} the {{mechanisms}} involved in digital dry toner electrophotography {{are influenced by the}} interactions between the printing machine, toner and paper in the last two steps where the paper is involved, i. e., in transferring the developed image toner to the paper, and in fusing the image to be fixed permanently on the paper surface. This study discusses the role of paper in these two steps in different technologies and its effect on the printing mechanisms and image quality. The control of optical, electrostatic and mass and heat transfer phenomena in the printing process are affected by the unevenness of the properties of paper due to its heterogeneous structure and its sensitivity to humidity conditions and printing process parameters. In this research, a set of experiments was conducted to understand the electrostatic behaviour of paper in toner transfer and thermal behaviour in toner fusing. The results show that not only image quality is affected by the variability of paper properties, but also the mechanisms of toner transfer and fusing. Accordingly, the research suggests that the paper should be included as part of the printing mechanism, performance (printability and runnability), and image quality. Consequently, if there is a change in paper properties due to a change in ambient conditions or the use of another grade for a specific application, the process parameters can be adjusted to compensate for these changes {{in order to meet the}} requirements for image quality. It was found that the variability in image quality in terms of colours (the requirement for different toner layers), grey scale (halftone structure) and the location of the image in the xy-plane is affected when rendered through the electrophotographic process. The fast mechanical speed in printing machine direction drives the toner transfer and fusing mechanisms differently from the <b>cross</b> <b>machine</b> <b>direction.</b> As a result, a certain image element such as a line will have different quality in these two printing directions, or if the line is placed in the length or width direction of the page. The conclusion was that the electrophotographic process should be designed to reduce or even to neglect the effect of paper when printing a high-quality colour image in a high-speed process. This can be achieved by eliminating the contact with paper from the image side in both transfer and fusing by adopting the technologies of toner jumping transfer and non-contact flash fusing. These technologies have special requirements for chemical and physical toner properties, such as modification for equal absorbance of the flash radiation by CMYK colours, a suitable melting viscosity and surface energy, and a small and narrow toner particle size and shape distribution to unify the charge-to-mass ratio of the toner, which is important for transfer quality and efficiency. To ensure high print quality for different applications, some of the transfer and fusing parameters need to be automatically adjusted according to substrate specific properties and levels of image coverage...|$|E
