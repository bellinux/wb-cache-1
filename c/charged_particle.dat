5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than it receives from the Sun, {{which is probably}} due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected from the planet (<5K), and <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c). When a <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> does that in a dielectric material, the electromagnetic equivalent of a shock wave, known as Cherenkov radiation, is emitted.|$|E

50|$|Electromagnetism is {{the force}} that acts between {{electrically}} <b>charged</b> <b>particles.</b> This phenomenon includes the electrostatic force acting between <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> at rest, and the combined effect of electric and magnetic forces acting between <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> moving relative to each other.|$|R
40|$|Neutrinos have no {{electric}} charge, but {{a magnetic}} field can indirectly affect neutrino properties and interactions through its effect on <b>charged</b> <b>particles.</b> After a brief field-theoretic discussion of <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> in magnetic fields, we discuss two broad kinds of magnetic field effects on neutrinos. First, effects which come through virtual <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> and alter neutrino properties. Second, effects which alter neutrino interactions through <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> in the initial or final state. We end with some discussion about possible physical implications of these effects. ...|$|R
5|$|The plasma {{approximation}}: The plasma approximation applies {{when the}} plasma parameter, Λ, representing {{the number of}} charge carriers within a sphere (called the Debye sphere whose radius is the Debye screening length) surrounding a given <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> is sufficiently high so as to shield the electrostatic influence of the particle outside of the sphere.|$|E
5|$|When {{electrons}} and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, {{giving rise to}} two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation results {{in two or three}} gamma ray photons totalling 1.022MeV. On the other hand, high-energy photons can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, but only {{in the presence of a}} nearby <b>charged</b> <b>particle,</b> such as a nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} half-integer <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> predicted by models of orbifold compactification of the E 8 × E 8 heterotic string theory. We {{find that it}} is possible for half-integer <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> to exist in our universe, and the location of half-interger <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> in a galaxy should be in the centers of the galaxy. By qualitative analysis, we find half-interger <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> may be helpful in explaining the formation of SMBH at the large redshift and solving the UHECR puzzle. ...|$|R

50|$|A common {{misunderstanding}} is that (a) the quanta of {{the fields}} act {{in the same manner}} as (b) the <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> that generate the fields. In our everyday world, <b>charged</b> <b>particles,</b> such as electrons, move slowly through matter with a drift velocity of a fraction of a centimeter (or inch) per second, but fields propagate at the speed of light - approximately 300 thousand kilometers (or 186 thousand miles) a second. The mundane speed difference between <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> and field quanta is on the order of one to a million, more or less. Maxwell's equations relate (a) the presence and movement of <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> with (b) the generation of fields. Those fields can then affect the force on, and can then move other slowly moving <b>charged</b> <b>particles.</b> <b>Charged</b> <b>particles</b> can move at relativistic speeds nearing field propagation speeds, but, as Einstein showed, this requires enormous field energies, which are not present in our everyday experiences with electricity, magnetism, matter, and time and space.|$|R
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy <b>Charged</b> <b>Particle</b> device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a <b>charged</b> <b>particle,</b> such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities {{of positive and negative}} charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
30|$|Equations (1) and (2) {{imply that}} {{understanding}} the ring current {{is equivalent to}} understand the phase space density of the <b>charged</b> <b>particles.</b> Because motion of <b>charge</b> <b>particles</b> depend on kinetic energy and pitch angle {{as well as local}} magnetic and electric fields, it is essential to track motion of <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> properly for the purpose of understanding the ring current and the magnetic storms.|$|R

Using angular momentum, energy and components of four-velocity, we explore the effect of <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> {{on the center of}} mass energy.

5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E

50|$|In {{the last}} two decades, several computer-automated {{experiments}} have been conducted to search for isolated fractionally <b>charged</b> <b>particles.</b> So far (2015), no evidence for fractional <b>charge</b> <b>particles</b> was found after measuring over 100 million drops.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the positively <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> generated during sputtering on the performances of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with Mg:Ag alloy electrodes fabricated by sputtering. The number of positively <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> increased by several orders of magnitude when the target current was increased from 0. 1 A to 2. 5 A. When a high target current was used, many positively <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> with energies higher than the bond energy of single C–C bonds, which are typically found in organic molecules, were generated. In this situation, we observed serious OLED performance degradation. On the other hand, when a low target current was used, OLED performance degradation was not observed when the number of positively <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> colliding with the organic underlayer increased. We concluded that sputtering damage caused by positively <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> can be avoided by using a low target current...|$|R
