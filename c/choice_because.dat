Franks had been a last-minute <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman had been expected to run for the Senate. The record $62million amount surpassed Michael Huffington, who spent nearly $28million in an unsuccessful 1994 Senate race.|$|E
5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered {{him to be}} an unacceptable <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> he was a Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he did not wish {{for him to be}} elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed it because of the wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn was informally {{chosen as}} the Party's First Secretary (later known as the General Secretary) by Hồ in 1959, at the January plenum of the Central Committee and {{was elected to the}} post de jure at the 3rd National Congress. Lê Duẩn was not Hồ's {{original}} choice for First Secretary according to Bùi Tín; his preferred candidate was Võ Nguyên Giáp, but since Lê Duẩn was supported by the influential Lê Đức Thọ, the Head of the Party Organisational Department, Lê Duẩn was picked for the post. Lê Duẩn was considered a safe <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of his time in prison during French rule, his thesis The Road to the South and his strong belief in Vietnamese reunification. Hoàng Văn Hoan claimed, after being sent into exile, that the 3rd National Congress also purged several party members. Indeed, three former ambassadors lost their Central Committee seats.|$|E

50|$|There is {{no single}} {{alcoholic}} drink that is always served as an apéritif. Fortified wine, liqueur, and dry champagne {{are probably the most}} common <b>choices.</b> <b>Because</b> it is served before dining, the emphasis is usually on dry rather than sweet, as a general guideline.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{consumers}} use stereotypes as {{a resource}} to help inform their <b>choices,</b> <b>because</b> stereotypes are socially shared and provide information about social groups based on easily identified qualities (e.g. race, gender), they may prove useful in inferring the preferences and anticipating the behavior of one’s consumption partner.|$|R
25|$|It is {{well known}} that the axiom of choice is {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class V (as we have done here with L) is equivalent to the axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary axiom of <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, it was {{announced}} that Josh Hartnett was cast as the husband of the married couple that serves as the town's sheriff team. Some criticized the <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> the main character (Eben Olemaun, with the last name changed to Oleson for the motion picture adaption) was originally Inuit in the comics. Melissa George joined the 30 Days of Night cast as the wife of Hartnett's character. Danny Huston joined the cast {{as the leader of the}} vampires.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{advanced}} age, Augustus {{was unable}} {{to travel to the}} east himself. There were few the Emperor trusted to settle matters in the east, but he was confident Gaius could. Gaius made a good <b>choice,</b> <b>because</b> his presence represented that of the imperial family - all orders, promises, or threats coming from him were as valid as if they came from the Emperor himself. Nonetheless, he was only eighteen, and therefore too young for the conduct of important business.|$|E

25|$|As a black artist, Edmonia Lewis {{had to be}} {{conscious}} of her stylistic <b>choices</b> <b>because</b> her largely white audience often gravely misread her work as self-portraiture.

25|$|That is, {{the authors}} {{describe}} a two-stage sequential game (diagrammed below) {{in which the}} rich first decide on the taxation rate {{and the level of}} redistribution and then the poor decide whether revolution is the optimal <b>choice.</b> <b>Because</b> of the potential loss of economic benefits by revolution, knowing what the poor majority would prefer, the rich have an incentive to propose a taxation rate that doesn't provoke revolution, {{while at the same time}} not costing the rich too many benefits.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} {{the autonomy of}} Arsacid rule in Armenia, Tiridates II sought friendly relations with Rome. This was an unfortunate <b>choice,</b> <b>because</b> the Sassanid king Shapur I defeated the Romans and made peace with the emperor Philip. In 252 Shapur I invaded Armenia and forced Tiridates II to flee. After the deaths of Tiridates II and his son Khosrov II, Shapur I installed his own son Hurmazd on the Armenian throne. When Shapur I died in 270, Hurmazd took the Persian throne and his brother Narseh ruled Armenia in his name.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{relative}} {{quality of the}} x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of its lack of hardware registers compared to the PowerPC, {{and the lack of}} AltiVec (also known as Velocity Engine). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined RISC and CISC philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They also point out that improved SSE could equal AltiVec, and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the compiler does the work.|$|E

25|$|Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in {{most large}} cities of Brazil, {{might not be the}} best <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of the large car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common. Because of the {{organization}} of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighbourhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).|$|E
25|$|In the 1998 general election, the Congress won 141 {{seats in}} the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then. To boost its {{popularity}} and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume {{the leadership of the}} party. She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs, and had stayed away from politics. After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Sharad Pawar. The breakaway faction commanded strong support in the state of Maharashtra and limited support elsewhere. The remainder continued {{to be known as the}} Indian National Congress.|$|E
25|$|Cuba {{has participated}} in the {{training}} of Nicaraguan workers {{in the use of}} new machinery imported to Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan revolution caused the United States to oppose the country's government; therefore the Sandinistas would not receive any aid from the United States. The United States embargo against Nicaragua, imposed by the Reagan administration in May 1985, made it impossible for Nicaragua to receive spare parts for US-made machines, so this led Nicaragua to look to other countries for help. Cuba was the best <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of the shared language and proximity and also because it had imported similar machinery over the years. Nicaraguans went to Cuba for short periods of three to six months and this training involved close to 3,000 workers. Countries such as Canada and the UK, sent farm equipment to Nicaragua.|$|E

50|$|Sen proposes, however, that {{comparability}} {{of interpersonal}} utility {{need not be}} partial. Under Sen's theory of informational broadening, even complete interpersonal comparison of utility would lead to socially suboptimal <b>choices</b> <b>because</b> mental states are malleable.

25|$|Chambers won the {{starring}} role in film director David Cronenberg's low-budget Canadian movie Rabid, which was released in 1977. Cronenberg stated {{that he wanted to}} cast Sissy Spacek in the film lead, but the studio vetoed his <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of her accent. Spacek's film Carrie was released during this film's production and proved to be a massive hit (and a movie poster for the film appears when the main character walks by a movie theater at 59:15). The director says that the idea of casting Chambers came from producer Ivan Reitman, who had heard that Chambers was looking for a mainstream role. Reitman felt that {{it would be easier to}} market the film in different territories if the well-known porn star portrayed the main character. Cronenberg stated that Chambers put in a lot of hard work on the film and that he was impressed with her. Cronenberg further states he had not seen Behind the Green Door prior to casting her.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 1945, the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King, {{contacted}} the Commander of the North Pacific Force, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, to alert {{him that the}} United States planned to transfer approximately 250 ships and craft to the Soviet Union between April and December 1945 and that about 2,500 personnel would be present {{at any given time}} at the transfer site with a two-week cycle of personnel turnover; he also inquired as to whether Dutch Harbor could accommodate such a program. Fletcher responded on 29 January 1945 rejecting Dutch Harbor {{because of the lack of}} housing and training space there and because its harbor was too small to accommodate the expected numbers of ships and too exposed to heavy seas for safe training. He recommended Cold Bay on the Alaska Peninsula as a much better <b>choice</b> <b>because</b> of its protected harbor, shore facilities, and the complete absence of a civilian population, making security of the program much easier than at Dutch Harbor. Kodiak on Kodiak Island, which had adequate shore facilities but a harbor inadequately protected from rough seas, was Fletchers second choice, and Dutch Harbor only his third. King duly informed the U.S. Military Mission in Moscow of the choice of Cold Bay.|$|E
25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, {{with a standard deviation of}} 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer <b>choice,</b> <b>because</b> Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E

50|$|One {{idea about}} why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized, called the just-world hypothesis, is that blaming cancer on the patient's actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain {{a sense of}} control.

30|$|To conclude, in our benchmarking, {{the fastest}} {{software}} packages were Ripser, Gudhi, and DIPHA.

30|$|Employed and {{unemployed}} individuals might differ {{not only}} in access to job offers but also in their consideration of income and other job characteristics when determining whether to accept available offers.
