40|$|This Minor Field Study {{was carried}} out in Thailand and Burma during June, July and August 2011. The aims of this study were to {{investigate}} the role and function of <b>choir</b> <b>singing</b> among the Karen people, an ethnic minority group mainly living in Northern Thailand and Burma. <b>Choir</b> <b>singing</b> in four-part harmony (i. e. soprano, alto, tenor and bass) is primarily done by Christian Karens. The research material consists of 123 questionnaires, 25 semi-structured interviews and numerous unstructured observations, participant and non-participant. The informants have in this ethnography been asked about their background in <b>choir</b> <b>singing</b> and why they consider or do not consider it meaningful {{to be a part of}} a choir. The questionnaires were handed out by students at three Theological Seminaries: one in Rangoon, Burma, one in Chiang Mai, Thailand and one in Mae La Refugee Camp, Thailand. The interviews were predominantly made with choir leaders and teachers active within The Karen Baptist Convention in Thailand and Burma where most of the observations were made. The results clearly show that the vast majority of informants find <b>choir</b> <b>singing</b> very meaningful for both individual and collective reasons. Religious and identity strengthening aspects of <b>choir</b> <b>singing</b> are evident in the results together with musical, social, educational and language strengthening factors...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} {{as part of a}} panel titled 'Singing from the same hymn sheet? The role of <b>choirs,</b> <b>collective</b> <b>singing</b> and affective belonging' organized by Rebecca Bramall and Emily Falconer (LSBU). In the popular BBC television show The Choir: Sing While You Work (2012, 2013) choirmaster Gareth Malone initiates ensemble singing in diverse workplaces. During the course of the show’s two series, the value and benefits of singing are confidently articulated. The Choir reflects and perpetuates the ‘rise of the choir’ in the context of economic austerity, a discourse in which choral singing has been celebrated as an activity that enables the ‘time-strapped’ and ‘stress-ridden’ to ‘pull back some balance into their lives’ (Stylist, 2013). In this paper I draw on theories of affective labour, and of the relationship between music and capitalism, to explore the relationship between the popularity of choral singing and new economic contexts, specifically of employment and work. Commentators on the ‘rise of the choir’ have tended to focus their critical attentions on debating the transformative effects of ensemble singing. I suggest that in The Choir and the wider discursive context, the pleasures and imputed benefits of choral singing simultaneously illuminate and neutralize a critique of the negative effects of the neoliberal workplace. <b>Choirs</b> and <b>singing</b> are identified as that which the workplace lacks, yet once these ensembles and practices are established their benefits are shown to enhance neoliberal logics of efficiency and competitiveness. In conclusion, I consider the opportunities that this national-popular interest in ensemble singing might nonetheless afford for developing a more radical critique of the neoliberal workplace, focusing on the collectivities that workplace choirs originate...|$|R
