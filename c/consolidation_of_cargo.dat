40|$|Accessibility of main sea ports by road {{has become}} {{increasingly}} difficult due to rapid growth in container throughput. To deal with this challenge, new ways for handling containers and distribution of cargo flows are needed to define and implement. One possibility is going beyond container transportation and considering cargos inside the containers {{in the design and}} operation of transportation networks. Consequently, by <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> flows, the utilization of container capacity can be improved and the number of transportation fleet will be reduced. This idea is further discussed in this paper and a mathematical model for the operation of such a consolidation center is presented. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Container {{transport}} {{is currently}} growing fast {{and will continue}} to develop in the near future. However, some problems such as the road congestion, and negative environmental impacts due to container trucking, and the low utilization of container capacity are making the container transport less efficient. To deal with these problems, several new concepts regarding hinterland transport operations are presented and implemented by many seaports. The majority of these concepts aim to reduce the transport by roads and shift the cargo flows away from the congested roads to other transport modes including the waterways and railways. One promising new concept for improving hinterland accessibility is cargo-driven intermodal transport, which focuses on the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> flows. This concept may contribute to aforementioned problems by, e. g. improving the container weight capacity utilization and reducing the semi-loaded containers going the hinterland from the sea port. Applying cargo consolidation in cargo-driven intermodal transport is expected to be beneficial for the society, but it remains unknown whether it will also provide benefits to the logistic service providers. In order to answer this question, an analytical optimization cost model is created to investigate the cost performance of cargo consolidation in this thesis. Further, a numerical case of container shipment between Port of Rotterdam and Tilburg is presented to experiment with the model. Based on the outcomes of the model, several conclusions are drawn in this work. As one important conclusion, applying cargo consolidation for container shipment between Port of Rotterdam and its hinterland is economically viable for a specific shipping distance. Furthermore, with a sensitivity analysis, the load factor of incoming containers and the unit truck cost are identified as most influential factors with overall largest positive impact on the total cost. Finally, with a Monte-Carlo simulation the impact of parameter variations on overall conclusions of this work have been found negligible.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{is a widely}} accepted technique for IaaS Cloud providers to reducing energy consumption and improving the utilization of their resources. This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} strategies for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user. In this paper we show an experimental analysis on the effects <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers in the QoS and EE, compared to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs. We demonstrate that the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers is indeed more optimal than the one of VMs, both in terms of QoS and EE. Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation. This work provides the necessary scientific background on <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> two widely used virtualization technologies, and we believe it is useful for future works on the optimization of resources in datacenters...|$|R
