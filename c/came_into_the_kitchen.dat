2500|$|Just after 5:00a.m. on February 11, 2011, Gelman stabbed {{and killed}} his stepfather, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn after an {{argument}} with his mother about driving Kuznetsov's vehicle. According to Gelman, he believed DEA agents were after him and planned to flee to the Dominican Republic. He claimed he woke his mother {{to find out where}} his passport was, and this developed into an argument as his mother believed he was drunk. Their argument awoke Kuznetsov, who <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> swearing at Gelman in Russian. Gelman grabbed a knife and stabbed Kuznetsov repeatedly. When the knife broke, Gelman continued the attack with a carving fork, ultimately stabbing Kuznetsov 55 times. [...] His mother was not physically hurt. Gelman then took the vehicle and sped off in it, running over a crossing guard and breaking her leg.|$|E
