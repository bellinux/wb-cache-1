Nine source profiles and average mass concentration of the following chemical parameters: elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), <b>chlorine</b> (Cl-), <b>nitrate</b> (NO 3 -), sulfate (SO 42 -), sodium (Na+), ammonium (NH 4 +), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg 2 +), calcium (Ca 2 +), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) were used to run the CMB model.

Sea salt particles containing NaCl as the main constituent are believed to be the major source of reactive tropospheric <b>chlorine</b> and <b>nitrate</b> fallouts. At an RH of 0 %, the reaction of dry NO 2 generates surface conversion to NaNO 3 monolayer capping the NaCl(100) surface and releases NOCl. The subsequent exposure of this NaNO 3 layer to RH below 45 % induces the formation of rare NaNO 3 tetrahedral crystals less than 0. 5 µm in size. The crystallization occurs through two-dimensional NO 3 - migration under the H 2 O monolayer regime. After another subsequent exposure to RH above 45 % and below 75 %, supermicrometric NaNO 3 rhombohedral plates were obtained under the H 2 O multilayer regime. On the other hand, the simultaneous exposure of NaCl(100) to NO 2 and H 2 O below 45 % RH rapidly generates numerous submicrometric NaNO 3 tetrahedra on the NaCl(100) surface. The dramatic increase of NaNO 3 production in the presence of water vapour is explained by the formation of HNO 3 and its easy reaction with the NaCl(100) surface. For RH above 45 % and below 75 %, the tetrahedra evolve to rhombohedral plates of supermicrometric size.

Stocking density significantly affected P. monodon survival, body-size and dry-weights over a 4 -week experimental period. At high densities of 50 and 100 shrimps/l, strong negative effects traveled into stage 2. Hence, physical interference stress and cannibalism could be excluded as causal factors meaning that the negative impact of crowding (at 50 and 100 shrimps/l) on shrimp growth and survival was due to some chemical compounds or other water quality variable.
