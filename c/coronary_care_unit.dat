25|$|Two studies {{claimed that}} {{patients}} who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened. One such study, with a double-blind design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> population. Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study. Another such study was reported by Harris et al. Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, {{and that in the}} Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began, although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Frank Pantridge {{turned his}} {{attention}} to this vexing problem of heart attacks and sudden cardiac death. His sensitivity to the problem came from two sources. First, personnel in the emergency department of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast frequently commented on the number of patients coming in dead on arrival (DOA). Second, Pantridge had recently read a telling study in a medical journal that indicated that among middle-aged or younger men with acute myocardial infarction (MI), more than 60% died within 1hour of the onset of symptoms. Thus the problem of death from acute MI had to be solved outside the hospital, not in the emergency room or the <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit.</b> [...] "The majority of deaths from coronary attacks were occurring", he wrote, [...] "outside the hospital, and nothing whatever was being done about them. It became very clear to me that a <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> confined to the hospital would have a minimal impact on mortality." [...] He wanted his coronary-care unit in the community.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{cardiology}} experts {{doubted the}} AICD's potential for clinical success.

2500|$|Into the 1970s {{there was}} {{considerable}} development of local training amongst ambulance services over-and-above the basic DOH/ATAB requirement; this training particularly focussed on defibrillation to treat cardiac arrest and was most notable in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland; with Auckland introducing the first Mobile Intensive Care (Life Support Unit) on the North Shore in 1970 however other subjects covered included the administration of entonox (nitrous oxide) for pain relief and the taking of a patients blood pressure.

40|$|We {{explore the}} use of patient outcome {{criteria}} in planning the locations of critical care health services. Two attributes of the regional distribution of health services which influence health outcomes are: (1) the geographical accessibility of services and (2) {{the number of patients}} served by each facility (the patient volume). A model incorporating both factors is developed to determine the number, sizes, and locations of <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> services in a region in order to maximize patient outcomes. We examine the implications and use of the model in an investigation of the location of <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> in rural upstate New York.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the investigation of cardiovascular disease in women, although African-American women have received little attention. This study compares characteristics and outcomes in women admitted to <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> for suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI). Between January 1988 and December 1991, a total of 554 (5 %) African-American and 9738 (95 %) white women with suspected acute MI were admitted to <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> in metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Relevant demographic socioeconomic, clinical, and outcome data were abstracted from the medical record and entered in the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention registry. African-American women were younger, more often single and unemployed, and were less likely to have health insurance than their white counterparts. In addition, a higher proportion of African-American women reported a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. After adjustment for age, African-American women were equally as likely to develop acute MI and were more likely to die in the hospital. In addition, a higher proportion of African-American women were readmitted to <b>coronary</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> for suspected MI. Compared with their white counterparts, African-American women with suspected acute MI were considerably worse off from both socioeconomic and clinical standpoints, and their relative disadvantage was apparent in poor outcomes...|$|R

We look into issues related to the integration process management, from the view of the object and the subject as well. In addition, we pay attention to clinical practice tutors, their education and their roles - to teach, to convey and to assist. As regards the practical part of the Thesis, we have applied a quantitative research methodology.

40|$|One hundred {{patients}} who were convalescing from a definite or probable acute myocardial infarction had a 6 -hour ECG rhythm tape recording made just before contemplated discharge from the hospital. All ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) were identified on each patient's tape record and categorized by frequency, prematurity, aberrancy, and pattern. Seventy-two {{percent of the patients}} had one or more VPCs identified on the 6 -hour tape recording, 20 % had multifocal VPCs, 18 % had ventricular bigeminy or paired VPCs, and 4 % had one or more transient runs of ventricular tachycardia.
