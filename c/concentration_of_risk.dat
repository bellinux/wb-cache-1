Banking risks are those risks that banks face in implementing current operations and not only specific risks of traditional banking. Bank risk is the degree of loss suffered by a bank where the counterparty (the client) bankrupts without being able to pay its obligations to the bank. Given the experience, banks agree that the most important cause of losses was the excessive <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> on a customer, industry or economic sector, a country.

40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of regulatory arbitrage. The work seeks to identify opportunities for regulatory arbitrage under Basel I and Basel II accords.

The thesis identifies that the main problem of banking regulation is the change in incentives of players in the financial markets leading to regulatory arbitrage, and consequently to a greater <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> in financial markets.

40|$|Historically, much of {{the banking}} {{regulation}} that {{was put in place}} was designed to reduce systemic risk. In many countries capital regulation {{in the form of the}} Basel agreements is currently one of the most important measures to reduce systemic risk.

In particular there is evidence that risk has been transfered from the banking sector to the insurance sector. One argument is that this is desirable and simply re‡ects diversi…cation opportunities. Another is that it represents regulatory arbitrage and the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> that may result from this could increase systemic risk.

In this model: i) outside investor wealth drives the demand for riskless debt and indirectly for securitization, ii) intermediary assets and leverage move together as in Adrian and Shin (2010), and iii) intermediaries increase their exposure to systematic risk as they reduce their idiosyncratic risk through diversification, as in Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez (2010).
