In particular, EN 15316 and its sub-sections, determine the system energy requirements and the system efficiencies of space heating system. This paper focuses on the estimation of efficiencies for emission of hydronic radiators. The assessment of efficiencies for emission occurs by evaluating the amount of heat emitted  from the heat emitter and the extra thermal losses towards building envelope. The heat emitted from radiators varies during the heating up/cooling down phases. A factor that influences the heat emitted during these phases is the location of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> of the radiator. <b>Connection</b> <b>pipes</b> can be located on opposite side or at {{the same side of}} the radiator. To better estimate the heat emitted from radiators a transient model with multiple storage elements is used in a building simulation model.

The final outcome of this paper is a practical support where the designer can easily assess the efficiencies for emission of hydronic radiators  for Swedish buildings. As main result, (i) the efficiency for control of space heating system is higher in Northern climates than in Southern climates, (ii) heavy active thermal masses allow higher efficiencies for emission than light active thermal masses, (iii) <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> located on {{the same side of the}} radiator enable higher efficiencies for emission than pipes located on opposite side...|$|E

The probability of severe slugging is studied for numerous flow conditions and geometric conditions which are close to the operation conditions and the piping system at the DISS test facility at the Plataforma Solar de Almería, Spain. Basically, larger vertical and downwards inclined pipe sections increase the probability of severe slugging. Severe slugging can be strongly suppressed by a high pressure operation. In a pipe geometry that shows easily severe slugging a pressure of P⩾ 60 P⩾ 60 bar prevents severe slugging.

40|$|Biofilm formation, loose deposit {{accumulation}} {{and water}} quality deterioration in drinking water distribution systems have been widely reported. However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration {{and the development of}} proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e. g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16 s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromonas spp. (2 – 23 %), Nitrosipra spp. (1 – 47 %), Flavobacterium spp. (1 – 36 %), and Flavobacterium spp. (5 – 67 %). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches—for example, iron-arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20 % loose deposits, 20 % PVC-U biofilm and 10 % HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background and Scope The {{scope of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the thermal behaviour of building components as hydronic radiator and multilayer walls subjected to dynamic conditions. The modelling and simulation of these building components provide information on how these components thermally interact among each other. The thermal interaction is fundamental to know how the energy is used in buildings. In particular, the thermal energy used in rooms can be expressed as the efficiencies for emission in a space heating system. This thesis analyzes the efficiencies for emission of a space heating system equipped with hydronic radiator for Swedish buildings by providing a comprehensive and detailed approach on this topic.   Methodology The methods used in this thesis are: experiment, modelling of multilayer wall and hydronic radiator, the dynamic simulation of the building and the efficiencies for emission of a space heating system. Here, the experiment, known as step response test, shows the heating up process of a hydronic radiator. The observation of the qualitative measurements suggests the most suitable technique of modelling the radiator known as transient modelling with multiple storage elements. The multilayer wall has been discretized both {{in space and time}} variable with a Finite Difference Method. Dynamic simulation of the building provides the efficiencies for emission of a space heating system.   Findings The experimental results show how the radiator performs the charging phase. The performance of the transient model is compared with lumped steady state models in terms of temperature of exhaust flow and total heat emitted. Results of the dynamic simulation show how buildings located in a Northern climate use the energy in a better way than Southern climates in Sweden. Heavy active thermal mass provides higher efficiencies for emission than light thermal mass. Radiators with <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> located on the same side react faster at the thermodynamic changing of the mass flow rate by providing higher efficiencies for emission than radiators with connection pipes located on the opposite side.   Conclusion and Outlook This thesis increases the knowledge about the modelling and simulation of hydronic radiators and multilayer walls. More research is needed on this topic to encompass modelling details of building components often ignored. The modelling and simulation of building components are the key to understand how building components thermally interact with each other. The thermal interaction among building components is a fundamental parameter for the assessment of efficiencies of emission of the space heating system. In the near future, the concept of efficiencies of emission can be implemented in National Building Code, therefore, this study provides guidelines on how to assess these efficiencies.

40|$|The {{direct steam}} {{generation}} process in parabolic trough collectors of CSP plants heats and evaporates water to obtain steam that is subsequently superheated {{to feed a}} steam turbine. Recently, this process was proven in economic and operational perspectives in the once-through mode to be a promising option for large-scale commercial plants. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps about the two-phase flow could deter the deployment {{of this type of}} power plant. The once-through mode implies temperature oscillations at the transition region from two-phase flow to superheated steam that induces thermal stresses in the receiver and could reduce the receiver's lifetime. The uncertainties complicate a reliable economic analysis. The thesis aims to enrich the existing pool of knowledge about the two-phase flow under specific conditions in state-of-the-art parabolic trough facilities with direct steam generation. The objective is to state the relevance of intermittent flows and wavy flows, severe slugging, and flow instabilities regarding the implications {{at the end of the}} two-phase flow region by means of advanced numerical and experimental tools. The numerical simulations use the capabilities of a one-dimensional two-fluid model that gives a deeper insight into the two-phase flow compared to the previously used homogeneous equilibrium models. The unique experiments are performed with a single wire-mesh sensor, which measures the local instantaneous void fraction and has been installed in the low-quality region of the DISS test facility at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Spain for the first time. It is analytically shown that the two-fluid model can identify unstable liquid-gas interfaces in certain conditions that would initiate the transition to a non-stratified flow. The numerical results of intermittent and wavy flow are validated by wire-mesh sensor experiments, suggesting that thermal oscillations at the end of the two-phase flow are linked to the transient two-phase flow pattern in the evaporator. The wire-mesh sensor measures slug flow, roll waves, wavy flow, and stratified-wavy flow in the horizontal receiver pipes within pressures of 30 to 80 bar. In the simulation, severe slugging could not be observed in the U-shaped <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> under typical operating conditions - this can mainly be ascribed to high-pressure conditions. The obtained findings enhance the understanding of the evaporation process in the receiver pipes and improve the confidence in this technology. Subsequent research should increase the number of experiments in the low-quality region and extend the measurements towards the high-quality region. These efforts will yield a full collection of reliable and reproducible data for the investigated system that is affected by many and various influencing parameters...|$|E
40|$|The Thermochemical Power Group (TPG) of the University of Genoa, Italy, has {{developed}} a new flexible laboratory to study advanced energy systems based on micro gas turbine technology. In the laboratory a general-purpose experimental rig, based on a modified commercial 100 kW recuperated micro gas turbine, was installed and fully instrumented. The main objectives of the laboratory is to perform experimental activities related to gas turbine based cycles in both steady-state and transient conditions. The rig layout was defined to include the effects of interaction between the turbomachines (especially the compressor) and further components. This approach is extremely significant for innovative cycle analyses, such as recuperated, humid air, and hybrid (with high temperature fuel cells) configurations. The facility was partially funded by two Integrated Projects of the EU VI Framework Program (Felicitas and Large-SOFC) and the Italian Government (PRIN project). It was designed with a high flexibility approach including: flow control management, co-generative applications, downstream compressor volume variation, grid-connected or stand-alone operations, recuperated or simple cycles, and room temperature control. In the new EU VII Framework (E-HUB Project), the test rig has been improved with the installation of an absorption cooler to operate the system in tri-generative configuration. The layout of the whole system, including <b>connection</b> <b>pipes,</b> valves, and instrumentation (in particular mass flow meter locations) was carefully designed to measure all the significant properties with high accuracy performance. Particular attention was devoted to component design, using CFD tools (Fluent), to perform emulation tests on high temperature fuel cell hybrid systems. For this reason, the facility was equipped with a modular cathodic vessel, an anodic recirculation loop (including a vessel and an ejector), and a steam injection system for chemical composition emulation. To compare tests affected by a significant influence of the ambient temperature variation, such as the performance tests on the machine maximum electrical power and electrical efficiency or on the recuperator effectiveness, the rig was integrated with a compressor inlet temperature control system. This equipment is composed of three air/water heat exchangers located at the air intake, controlled valves and a variable speed pump operating in a closed loop. This circuit was designed to couple the machine air inlet with the absorption cooler. The large number of experimental data available for the high flexibility test rig design {{is also used to}} validate both steady-state (design and off-design) and transient (also real-time) theoretical models. A good level of consistency can be achieved thanks to the complete knowledge of the test rig dimensions, volumes, masses, shaft inertia, thermal capacitances, and operating procedure. Such completeness is difficult to obtain in industrial plants, where details about equipment are often missing or confidential. This facility is also essential to introduce undergraduate students to micro gas turbine technology, and Ph. D. s to advanced experimental activities in the same field. With this experimental rig, in addition to learning about the thermodynamic cycles and plant layouts, students can also become familiar with their materials, piping, gaskets, technology for auxiliaries, and instrumentation...|$|E
