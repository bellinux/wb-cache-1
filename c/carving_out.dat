The former FTT's Yugoslav part was partitioned between Croatia and Slovenia, largely conforming to the area population's ethnic composition.|$|E
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, the Snake {{receives}} from the right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called the North Fork of the Snake River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain, <b>carving</b> <b>out</b> many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape. The Snake River resumes its journey westwards, then enters the Snake River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E
40|$|<b>Carve</b> <b>out</b> {{projects}} have recently become an emerging issue {{in practice and}} theory given the diversity of strategic foci of companies as well as recent merger and acquisition activities. This paper highlights the relevance of IT in such <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects. IT depicts their characteristics and specific features with regard to general IT projects as well as success factors {{for the management of}} IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs.</b> Based on a systematic literature review, we conducted 18 exploratory expert interviews with different stakeholders involved in the management of IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs.</b> We show that the perception and acknowledgement of the IT function within the overall <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> project is broadly underestimated. We elaborate on learnings for the successful management of the IT function within a <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> project: the involvement of IT executives in the early phases of contract negotiations; improved IT due diligence processes for a better anticipation of IT costs; early analysis of the target enterprise architecture. Additionally, we identified success factors of managing IT <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects. This paper is among the first to shed light into the research field of IT <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects including exploratory empirical data and gives recommendations for future research of IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} August 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was <b>carving</b> <b>out</b> over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on August 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2010, {{shortly before}} an {{announcement}} that Red Football's debt had increased to £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United announced {{their intention to}} refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £500million. They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with a coupon rate of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with a coupon rate of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the <b>carving</b> <b>out</b> of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the captaincies is one of {{constant}} subordination, annexation and division. New donatary captaincies were <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> of territories which were too vast and difficult to administer directly and small captaincies, nominally in private hands but often abandoned by their donataries, were annexed by larger or more successful Crown captaincies. At least fifteen donatary captaincies were granted {{through the middle of}} the 18th century, <b>carved</b> <b>out</b> of royal captaincies.

25|$|Immediately {{below the}} hard-rock formation, {{comprising}} about {{two thirds of}} the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian). This formation was composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers. It also contains ancient fossils.

This process repeated countless times, eventually <b>carving</b> <b>out</b> the falls.|$|E

40|$|Equity <b>carve</b> <b>outs,</b> {{the partial}} listing of a {{corporate}} subsidiary, appear to be transitory arrangements, usually dissolved {{within a few years}} by either a complete sale or a buy back. Why do firms perform expensive listings just to reverse them thereafter? We interpret <b>carve</b> <b>outs</b> as strategic options to attract information from the market over the relative value of a productive unit as an independent entity and thus to improve the decision process on whether to sell out or to retain control. The separate listing is costly, as it reduces coordination of production, but generates valuable information from the market over the optimal allocation of ownership. We compute the optimal timing for the final sale or buy back decisions, the value of the strategic options embedded in the <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> and the optimal shares retained. The model explains the temporary nature of <b>carve</b> <b>outs,</b> and suggests an explanation for many empirical findings. In particular, it explains why <b>carve</b> <b>outs</b> are more common in sectors with high uncertainty and in more informative markets.

He argued that haiku should be judged by the same yardstick that is used when measuring the value of other forms of literature — something that was contrary to views held by prior poets. Shiki firmly placed haiku in the category of literature, and this was unique.|$|E

25|$|The {{top-down}} approach anticipates nanodevices {{that must be}} built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes {{can be used to}} look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for <b>carving</b> <b>out</b> structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.|$|E
