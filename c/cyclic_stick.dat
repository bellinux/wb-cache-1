25|$|Construction of {{the first}} {{prototype}} was completed in 1968. A first flight on 27 June 1967 ended prematurely due to oscillations caused by control problems; one set of main wheels contacted the ground hard bursting a tyre and bending a wheel hub. The cause of the oscillations {{proved to be a}} harmonic amplification of vibrations in the cockpit floor feeding back into the control column when a roll demand was input into the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick.</b> It was widely but erroneously reported in the Western press that the aircraft had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dual {{controls}} are conventional for a helicopter and {{consist of a}} single hydraulic system boosting the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick,</b> collective lever and anti-torque pedals. The collective levers have integral throttles, although these {{are not used to}} control rotor rpm, which is automatically governed, but are used for starting and shutting down the engine. The cyclic and collective control the main rotor pitch through torque tube linkages to the swash plate, while the anti-torque pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor via a tensioned cable arrangement. Some UH-1Hs have been modified to replace the tail rotor control cables with torque tubes similar to the UH-1N Twin Huey.|$|E
25|$|Control of the V-12 {{presented}} {{several problems}} to the designers and engineers {{due to the}} sheer size {{as well as the}} rotor layout. The pilot and co-pilot sat in the lower flight deck with a wide expanse of windows to give excellent visibility. Using conventional <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick,</b> collective lever and rudder pedals the pilots input their commands in a conventional fashion. Roll control is by differential collective pitch change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in the hover or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending on direction of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin. Ascent and descent are controlled by the collective lever increasing or decreasing pitch of both rotors simultaneously. Large elevators on the tailplane control fuselage attitude and provide reaction to pitching moments from the wing and variation on rotor disc angle.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger has a tandem-seat 'glass cockpit' and is {{operated}} by a two-man crew; the pilot {{is placed in the}} forward position, with the gunner seated behind. Either of the crew members can manage the weapon systems or the primary flight controls, switching roles if necessitated; in addition to flying the aircraft, the Tiger's pilot would typically be in control of the self-defence systems and communications, as well as some secondary weapons functions. While some of the weapons use dedicated control interfaces, such as the anti-tank Trigat missile, air-to-air weapons can be managed via controls on both sets of collective and <b>cyclic</b> <b>sticks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{floor-mounted}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>sticks</b> {{between the}} pilot's knees, the R22 uses a unique teetering [...] "T-Bar" [...] control {{connected to a}} stick that emerges from the console between the seats. This {{makes it easier for}} occupants to enter and exit the cabin and reduces chances for injury {{in the event of a}} hard landing. The teetering bar has a hand grip on both sides that hangs down between the pilots' legs. Thus, if teetered to the right, the right side pilot would be flying and the left grip would be about 12 inches above the left pilot's lap. R22 flight instructors quickly learn how to fly with their hand in the air. The left part of the bar, left collective control, and left tail rotor pedals can be removed if the left seat occupant is not certified to fly the R22 or if the space is needed for technical or observer duties. A floor-mounted foot-activated push-to-talk switch facilitates intercom communications for the left seat occupant, although some later models may be equipped with a voice activated intercom system.|$|R
40|$|Pilot-vehicle {{interaction}} {{represents a}} critical aspect of aircraft design. Very low-frequency, voluntary although unintentional interaction {{has been extensively}} investigated in fixed and rotary wing aeromechanics. Higher frequency, involuntary and thus passive interaction received similar attention in fixed wing aeromechanics, {{but not as much}} for rotary wing. The results of an experimental campaign for the characterization of the passive behaviour of rotorcraft pilots' biomechanics are presented. A flight simulator has been used to excite human subjects. The accelerations of their limbs and the motion induced by the vibrations of the limbs in the control inceptors have been recorded. The vertical, longitudinal and lateral directions have been independently excited, while measuring the motion of the arm directly involved in the control inceptor mostly affected by motion in each direction, namely {{the left and the right}} arms for the collective and the <b>cyclic</b> <b>sticks,</b> respectively. The frequency domain response has been evaluated; resulting noteworthy behaviour is discussed, addressing its relevance in modelling the passive behaviour of pilots within the bioaeroservoelastic rotorcraft analysis. The measurements of human body impedance, under realistic cockpit motion, are used to identify the direct transfer functions between the motion of the seat and the controls inadvertently fed back into the rotorcraft...|$|R
50|$|The {{cyclic control}} is usually located between the pilot's legs and is {{commonly}} called the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> or just cyclic. On most helicopters, the cyclic {{is similar in}} appearance to a joystick in a conventional aircraft. But on the Robinson R22, the cyclic is a central pillar that either pilot can manipulate.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the phase lag, to turn the rotorcraft to the left or right would theoretically require a forward or backward cyclic if there was no mechanical correction. The rotor control system is mechanically shifted up to 90 degrees to compensate for phase lag and provide helicopter response that matches movement of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sikorsky's HLH {{design was}} an {{enlarged}} {{version of the}} sucsesful CH-54/S-64 with a simplified and improved single main rotor powered by three General Electric TF34-58 turboshaft engines rated at a combined [...] A crew of five would operate the aircraft from the forward cockpit with pushbuttons replacing the traditional <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> and collective lever. Behind the cockpit an aft cabin provided capacity for 12 combat troops.|$|E
50|$|A {{helicopter}} {{has four}} flight control inputs. These are the cyclic, the collective, the anti-torque pedals, and the throttle. The cyclic control is usually located between the pilot's legs and is commonly called the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> or just cyclic. On most helicopters, the cyclic {{is similar to}} a joystick. However, the Robinson R22 and Robinson R44 have a unique teetering bar cyclic control system and a few helicopters have a cyclic control that descends into the cockpit from overhead.|$|E
50|$|The model three was {{the first}} example to use control {{mechanisms}} as modern helicopters. The helicopter is based around a central shaft with counter-rotating rotors. Each rotor was doubled into a biplane arrangement with cable supports. It used a <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> for forward and lateral control with rotor warping, and wheel for yaw anti-torque control. The main rotor shaft was able to tilt slightly for forward control. The rotors were also capable of autorotation in case of engine failure.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{helicopter}} {{has three}} flight control inputsâ€”the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick,</b> the collective lever, and the anti-torque pedals. [...] Depending on {{the complexity of}} the helicopter, the cyclic and collective may be linked together by a mixing unit, a mechanical or hydraulic device that combines the inputs from both and then sends along the [...] "mixed" [...] input to the control surfaces to achieve the desired result. The manual throttle may also be considered a flight control because it is needed to maintain rotor speed on smaller helicopters without governors. The governors also help the pilot control the collective pitch on the helicopter's main rotors, to keep a stable, more accurate flight.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign focused on the characterization of the passive behavior of rotorcraft pilots â€™ biomechanics. Human subjects were subjected to excitation spectra in a flight simulator, recording the motion induced by their limbs â€™ vibrations into the controls inceptors and the limbs â€™ accelerations. Independent excitations in the vertical and lateral direction have been considered. In the first case, measures were related to the motion of the collective lever and of the left arm, while in the second case they were related to the motion of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> and of the right arm. The frequency response has been evaluated, and interesting behaviors discussed in view of their relevance in modeling the passive biomechanical behavior of pilots for coupled bio-aeroservoelastic analysis of rotorcraft...|$|E
40|$|The CH- 47 B is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} variable-stability {{helicopters}} developed and operated by NASA since 1952 to investigate helicopter and VTOL handling qualities. Recently, several new capabilities were added to this helicopter to enable it to better support new and evolving research requirements. The installation of a programmable force-feel system for the evaluation pilot's conventional <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick,</b> and a four-axis side-stick controller permit a range of in-flight investigations concerning manipulator characteristics and augmentation system features that had not been possible with earlier NASA research helicopters. A recently installed color electronic display system with a programmable symbol generator will permit the investigation of display formats for a variety of VTOL and helicopter missions. Finally, a powerful new general-purpose flight computer is now in operation. It is programmable in high-level languages and will provide more efficient support of research programs. In addition to these new hardware capabilities, flight-control software has been developed to improve the in-flight simulation capability of the aircraft. A brief description of the CH- 47 B's variable-stability research equipment is provided, recent research programs are summarized, and some remarks concerning the potential of the helicopter are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} roll/lateral rotorcraftâ€“pilot coupling, a {{phenomenon}} {{caused by the}} interaction between the pilot's involuntary biodynamic response on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> and the aeroelastic response of the helicopter. Such interaction falls under a class of events, denominated pilot augmented oscillations, that may significantly affect helicopters. This phenomenon was experienced during a piloted flight simulation campaign performed in a flight simulator. An analytical model of the coupled rotorcraftâ€“pilot problem is developed and validated. This model is used to understand the physics that govern this instability and the most influential parameters. The model is subsequently used to perform several sensitivity analyses with respect to basic helicopter design parameters. The stability of helicopters with soft in-plane hingeless main rotor design showed significant sensitivity to the amount of damping in the regressive leadâ€“lag mode. Such a mode may interact with the pilot since it can transmit lateral vibrations to the airframe {{in the vicinity of the}} pilot's fundamental biodynamic feedthrough frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that an increase in main rotor loading may reduce the stability margins. The results of the sensitivity analysis give the rotorcraft designer the capability to infer how rotor design may be prone to rotorcraftâ€“pilot coupling and what mitigation actions can be taken...|$|E
40|$|Active inceptors offer great {{potential}} for improving the handling qualities of fly-by-wire rotorcraft. In a cooperative research effort, the DLR Institute of Flight Systems in Germany and the U. S. Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD) conducted several in-flight experiments to study {{the influence of the}} dynamic characteristics (natural frequency and damping) of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stick</b> on the overall handling qualities of a rotorcraft. Experiments were performed looking at sidestick (DLR) and centerstick (AFDD) inceptors for Rate and Attitude Command response types. The results of two different experiments are presented in this paper. The first experiment evaluated the roll handling in forward flight and was only performed with a sidestick inceptor. The task used in this experiment was designed during exercises of the Empire Test Pilotsâ€™ School (ETPS) on DLRâ€™s Flying Helicopter Simulator EC 135 ACT/FHS. ETPS also contributed to the optimization of the static sidestick characteristics that were used for the testing. The second, more comprehensive experiment, evaluating ADS- 33 Hover and Slalom Mission Task Elements, was performed both with a sidestick and a centerstick allowing a direct comparison of both types of inceptors. Regression analyses are performed on the collected pilot ratings to gain a systematic insight into the preferred stick characteristics for the different inceptor and response types. The test results consistently suggest that the preferred characteristics are best described by a first-order response model...|$|E
