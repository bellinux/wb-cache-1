These walls prevent of huge movement in structure and it’s destruction through absorbing these shear forces 1. In other hand, form of standing these walls play important role in structural behavior. Except architecture limitation that shape and place of shear wall, other criteria like minimum movement or maximum energy absorbent are mentioned as important purpose to determine shape and place of shear walls. <b>Circular</b> <b>segments</b> are more resistant compared to square segments, but their performance is same at all directions, while square segments are designed for two main directions against earthquake and their performance is not clear in other directions. <b>Circular</b> <b>segments</b> have suitable tension distribution {{due to lack of}} corners compared to square segments and finally we can show that these segments are better in torsion performance.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new, robust, curvature estimator. It is based on ”fitting ” <b>circular</b> <b>segments</b> to a curve using a generalised Radon transform. The key step in the approach is that the fitting operation is not done in the original image, but in a transformed version, called Orientation Space. The original curve is transformed into another curve in Orientation Space. Apart from the original spatial dimensions, Orientation Space has one extra dimension: orientation. A given point on the curve in Orientation Space contains information both about the original position of the point, {{but also about the}} orientation of that point. This explicit representation of orientation allows us to incorporate it as a contraint in the fitting stage, where curves corresponding to <b>circular</b> <b>segments</b> in the original image are fitted to the data. The estimated curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of the best fitting segment. The method performs well on noisy (synthetic) data and should work correctly on intersecting curves as well. The performance of the estimator has not yet been compared to existing approaches in the litature. The method is a demonstration of a novel, general, approach to incorporating constraints in the Radon Transform. ...|$|R
