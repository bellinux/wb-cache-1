5|$|Originally from Ghana, Aidoo played college {{football}} for the McMaster Marauders from 1998 to 2002. Aidoo was most successful during the 2000 season, {{when he broke}} conference records for rushing yards and touchdowns. His performance earned him the Hec <b>Crighton</b> Trophy as the most outstanding university football player in Canada, and he was honored with numerous other accolades. After breaking his right leg while filming Brian's Song, Aidoo missed most of his final two seasons with the Marauders.|$|E
5|$|The Marauders {{finished}} their 2000 {{season with a}} record of 7–1 and emerged {{at the top of their}} division. Aidoo broke conference records for rushing yardage and touchdowns with 1,329 yards and 20 touchdowns, averaging over 150 yards and two touchdowns per game. He was also named a first-team Ontario University Athletics (OUA) all-star. In the postseason, the Marauders won the Yates Cup by defeating the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks, and Aidoo was named the most valuable player for the game with 168 yards and two touchdowns. McMaster lost 20–15 against the Ottawa Gee-Gees in the Churchill Bowl. They finished the season one game away from playing in the Vanier Cup. Aidoo was named the most valuable player in the OUA conference and won the Hec <b>Crighton</b> Trophy as the most outstanding university football player in the nation. Additionally, he was named CIAU Male Athlete of the Year, McMaster Male Athlete of the Year, and a finalist for the 2000 Golden Horseshoe Athlete of the Year. In April 2001, Aidoo was also one of three running backs selected for the McMaster Team of the Century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 16th century, deeming that the {{reconversion}} structure needed strengthening, the popes established a number of Scots Colleges, typically through the Jesuits. One of these was the Scots College at Douai, founded by its first Superior, Father William <b>Crighton</b> (P. Gulielmus Creighton), who held the office 1581–1597, according to the records of the college.|$|E
25|$|For {{those that}} did not leave their farms, the number of raids intensified. During the summer of 1758, there were four raids on the Lunenburg Peninsula. On 13 July 1758, one person on the LaHave River at Dayspring was killed and another seriously wounded {{by a member of}} the Labrador family. The next raid {{happened}} at Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia on 24 August 1758, when eight Mi'kmaq attacked the family homes of Lay and Brant. They killed three people in the raid, but were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, which was the common practice for payment from the French. Two days later, two soldiers were killed in a raid on the blockhouse at LaHave, Nova Scotia. On 11 September, a child was killed in a raid on the Northwest Range. Another raid happened on 27 March 1759, in which three members of the Oxner family were killed. The last raid happened on 20 April 1759 at Lunenburg, when the Mi'kmaq killed four settlers who were members of the Trippeau and <b>Crighton</b> families.|$|E

2500|$|Apparently <b>Crighton</b> {{had been}} asked by [...] "the pope": perhaps Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590) to provide Scottish {{students}} for seminary study at Rome. The Scots College at Rome did not receive its foundation bull from Clement VIII until 1600, but the request specifically for Scotsmen evidences an early interest in that direction. How <b>Crighton</b> got Dempster's name remains as unknown as why he was deported from Paris, but Thomas {{was one of four}} selected and did not enroll at Louvain, but journeyed straight to Rome. He mentions that Cardinal Aldobrandini was raising an army there and calls him also Clement VIII, perhaps in anticipation of later events. Dempster says that he was in a seminarium Romanum with [...] "the choicest nobility of Italy", which he would not have been if the Scots College had existed then.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, using earlier work at BSA, Norton {{produced}} the air-cooled twin-rotor Classic, {{followed by the}} liquid-cooled Commander and the Interpol2 (a police version). [...] Subsequent Norton Wankel bikes included the Norton F1, F1 Sports, RC588, Norton RCW588, and NRS588. Norton proposed a new 588cc twin-rotor model called the [...] "NRV588" [...] and a 700cc version called the [...] "NRV700". A former mechanic at Norton, Brian <b>Crighton,</b> started developing his own rotary engined motorcycles line named [...] "Roton", which won several Australian races.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the most}} badly {{affected}} structures in both Christchurch and the surrounding districts were old buildings, including several notable landmarks. Heritage New Zealand board member Anna <b>Crighton</b> said the earthquake had been [...] "unbelievably destructive." [...] The historic homesteads of Hororata and Homebush inland from Christchurch were both extensively damaged, as were Ohinetahi homestead and Godley House on Banks Peninsula. Homebush, located at Glentunnel only 15kilometres from the earthquake's epicentre, was the historic home of the Deans family, one of the Canterbury Region's pioneer settler families, but was so extensively damaged {{that it has been}} described as being [...] "practically in ruins".|$|E
2500|$|Chain Reaction {{produced}} by Fraser, {{was released in}} October 1990, and also debuted at No. 1 on the Australian album charts, it provided three Top Ten hit singles, [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] in August, [...] "That's Freedom" [...] in September and [...] "Burn for You" [...] in December. Unlike the previous two albums, where most songs were written by outside writers, Chain Reaction saw Farnham write nine of its twelve tracks with Fraser and keyboardist/musical director David Hirschfelder (ex-Little River Band) along with Phil Buckle (Burn For You) and Joe <b>Crighton</b> (The Time Has Come). The sound was less electronic and more acoustic, it became the biggest-selling album in Australia for 1990, and was No. 1 on the ARIA End of Year album chart. At the 1991 ARIA Awards, Farnham won 'Best Male Artist', 'Song of the Year' for [...] "Burn for You", and 'Highest Selling Album' for Chain Reaction.|$|E
2500|$|The club's {{financial}} results were {{announced at the}} start of October with an operating loss of £14m in the thirteen months to June 2013, with the revealation that the club spends more on non-playing staff than on the squad. The led to discussions between Mather and former Rangers director Dave King over the latter's potential investment in the club and Rangers manager, Ally McCoist agreeing to take a substantial pay-cut. Mathers meeting with King caused unease in the Rangers boardroom and was thought to be the reason behind his removal as chief executive on 16 October leaving only two directors on the Plc board. The lack of corporate governance was criticised by Rangers nominated adviser and led to the appointment of David Somers as non-executive director and acting chairman a few weeks later. On the same day as Sommers appointment, the date for the AGM was set for 19 December, this instigated an arms race between warring factions for control of Rangers. In the five weeks prior to the AGM, the board proceeded to appoint Norman <b>Crighton</b> as non-executive director, Graham Wallace as the new chief executive and confirmed Somers as permanent chairman, much to the bemusement of the requisitioners who questioned the appointments so close to the AGM. Around this time, going perhaps unnoticed, was the news that Police Scotland was investigating whether former owner Craig Whyte was still involved at Rangers as well as the acquisition and management of the club. Perhaps the most important machinations involved moves by the board to secure support from other shareholders and their voting rights, with the largest single shareholder Laxey Partners indicating its [...] support for the current board at the AGM. A week before the AGM {{it was clear that the}} board had amassed a sizeable proportion of voting rights, which ultimately, saw them re-elected and the requisitioners defeated.|$|E
