5000|$|In 2000 and 2001, online {{advertising}} was having running into difficulties, so <b>Clickability</b> {{decided to change}} its strategy to focus on creating software able to distribute content widely and concurrently to hundreds of websites. The company offered a content management system that allowed customers to administer the material on their websites. According to Information Today, the product had four components. First, <b>Clickability</b> acted as clients' {{infrastructure as a service}} by being their web hosting service and content repository. Second, <b>Clickability</b> helped move customers onto its platform. Third, it provided a software as a service by allowing customers to manage the content throughout its creation, review, and distribution. Fourth, it provided an online forum for clients to discuss how to make optimal use of the product. In 2004, InfoWorlds Mike Heck said that <b>Clickability</b> cmPublish Version 4 was a Java-based software that [...] "won't break your budget" [...] and has [...] "essential content creation and administration features".|$|E

40|$|In online advertising, {{pervasive}} in commercial search engines, advertisers typically bid on few terms, and {{the scarcity of}} data makes ad matching difficult. Suggesting additional bidterms can significantly improve ad <b>clickability</b> and conversion rates. In this paper, we present a large-scale bidterm suggestion system that models an advertiser’s intent and finds new bidterms consistent with that intent. Preliminary experiments show that our system significantly increases the coverage {{of a state of}} the art production system used at Yahoo while maintaining comparable precision...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of iron oxide nanoparticle dispersions of varying properties (e. g. color, crystal structure, particle size distribution) {{in a continuous}} hydrothermal pilot plant operating under near-critical and supercritical conditions {{with the aim of}} producing in situ functionalized nanoparticles suitable for secondary functionalization via click chemistry is reported. The effect of varying the mixing setup, reaction temperature and the starting material (iron salt) in the presence of different carboxylic acids on the resulting nanoparticle dispersions was investigated. The stability of the clickable ligands in the harsh hydrothermal environment was also tested and the <b>clickability</b> of the functionalized particles was demonstrated by means of XPS and fluorescence measurements after model click reactions...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing auctions for sponsored search with revenue guarantees. We first analyze two random-sampling auctions in this setting and derive high competitive ratios against the optimal revenue from two classes of omniscient auctions: single-price auctions, restricted to charging a single price per click and weighted-price auctions, restricted to charging prices inversely proportional to the advertisement’s <b>clickability.</b> Either of these benchmark revenues can be larger, and this cannot be determined without knowing the private valuations of the bidders. We combine these two asymptotically near-optimal auctions into a single auction with the following properties: the auction has a Nash equilibrium and every equilibrium has revenue at least {{the larger of the}} revenues raised by running each of the two auctions individually (assuming bidders bid truthfully when doing so is a utility maximizing strategy). Simulations indicate that our auctions outperform the VCG auction in less competitive markets...|$|E
40|$|In {{oncology}} and neurology the F- 18 -radiolabeled glucose analogue 2 -deoxy- 2 -[F- 18]fluoro-D-glucose ([F- 18]FDG) {{is by far}} {{the most}} commonly employed metabolic imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we report a novel synthetic route to beta-configured mannopyranoside precursors and a chemoselective F- 18 -fluoroglycosylation method that employ two b-configured [F- 18]FDG derivatives equipped with either a terminal azide or alkyne aglycon respectively, for use as a CuAAC clickable tool set for PET. The b-configured precursors provided the corresponding [F- 18]FDGs in a radiochemical yield of 77 - 88 %. Further, the <b>clickability</b> of these [F- 18]FDGs was investigated by click coupling to the suitably functionalized Fmoc-protected amino acids, Fmoc-N-(propargyl) -glycine and Fmoc- 3 -azido-L-alanine, which provided the F- 18 -fluoroglycosylated amino acid conjugates in radiochemical yields of 75 - 83 %. The F- 18 -fluoroglycosylated amino acids presented herein constitute a new and interesting class of metabolic PET radiotracers.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to propose a set of {{guidelines}} for designing Internet web sites usable and accessible with the Nintendo Wii console. After an accurate analysis of usability issues and of the typical Wii Internet users, twelve usability guidelines will be proposed. These guidelines are focused on visibility, understandability, <b>clickability</b> and compatibility. We then restructured a sample web site according to the guidelines. To prove their effectiveness, we performed the usability tests on a sample of forty individuals, selected among the various categories of potential users of the Nintendo Wii console, after having visited the restructured and the original web sites. The analysis of the resulting information confirmed that the restructured web site is more usable than the original and the improvement is more pronounced for weak categories (elderly and individuals with no experience with web browsing). Furthermore the adoption of the guidelines reduces the difficulties experienced by users with different expertise, in visiting a web site with the Wii console...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing auctions with worst case revenue guarantees for sponsored search. This problem differs from previous work because of ad dependent clickthrough rates which lead to two natural posted-price benchmarks. In one benchmark, the winning advertisers are charged the same price per click, and in the other, {{the product of the}} price per click and the advertiser <b>clickability</b> (which {{can be thought of as}} the probability an advertisement is clicked if it has been seen) is the same for all winning advertisers. We adapt the random sampling auction from [10] to the sponsored search setting and improve the analysis from [1], to show a high competitive ratio for two truthful auctions, each with respect to one of the two described benchmarks. However, the two posted price benchmarks (and therefore the revenue guarantees from the corresponding random sampling auctions) can each be larger than the other; further, which is the larger cannot be determined without knowing the private values of the advertisers. We design a new auction, that incorporates these two random sampling auctions, with the following property: the auction has a Nash equilibrium; and every equilibrium has revenue at least the larger of the revenues raised by running each of the two auctions individually (assuming bidders bid truthfully when doing so is a utility maximizing strategy). Finally, we perform simulations which indicate that the revenue from our auction outperforms that from the VCG auction in less competitive markets. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments allow the online collection of valuable {{information that can}} be efficiently used to optimize decisions "on the fly" and at a low cost. These advances have greatly influenced the decision-making process in various areas of operations management, including pricing, inventory, and retail management. In this thesis we study methodological as well as practical aspects arising in online sequential optimization in the presence of such real-time information streams. On the methodological front, we study aspects of sequential optimization in the presence of temporal changes, such as designing decision making policies that adopt to temporal changes in the underlying environment (that drives performance) when only partial information about this changing environment is available, and quantifying the added complexity in sequential decision making problems when temporal changes are introduced. On the applied front, we study practical aspects associated with a class of online services that focus on creating customized recommendations (e. g., Amazon, Netflix). In particular, we focus on online content recommendations, a new class of online services that allows publishers to direct readers from articles they are currently reading to other web-based content they may be interested in, by means of links attached to said article. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we consider a non-stationary variant of a sequential stochastic optimization problem, where the underlying cost functions may change along the horizon. We propose a measure, termed variation budget, that controls the extent of said change, and study how restrictions on this budget impact achievable performance. As a yardstick to quantify performance in non-stationary settings we propose a regret measure relative to a dynamic oracle benchmark. We identify sharp conditions under which it is possible to achieve long-run-average optimality and more refined performance measures such as rate optimality that fully characterize the complexity of such problems. In doing so, we also establish a strong connection between two rather disparate strands of literature: adversarial online convex optimization; and the more traditional stochastic approximation paradigm (couched in a non-stationary setting). This connection is the key to deriving well performing policies in the latter, by leveraging structure of optimal policies in the former. Finally, tight bounds on the minimax regret allow us to quantify the "price of non-stationarity," which mathematically captures the added complexity embedded in a temporally changing environment versus a stationary one. In the second part of the thesis we consider another core stochastic optimization problem couched in a multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting. We develop a MAB formulation that allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward "variation" and the minimal achievable worst-case regret, and provide an optimal policy that achieves that performance. Similarly to the first part of the thesis, our analysis draws concrete connections between two strands of literature: the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks. The third part of the thesis studies applied optimization aspects arising in online content recommendations, that allow web-based publishers to direct readers from articles they are currently reading to other web-based content. We study the content recommendation problem and its unique dynamic features from both theoretical as well as practical perspectives. Using a large data set of browsing history at major media sites, we develop a representation of content along two key dimensions: <b>clickability,</b> the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. Based on this representation, we propose a class of user path-focused heuristics, whose purpose is to simultaneously ensure a high instantaneous probability of clicking recommended articles, while also optimizing engagement along the future path. We rigorously quantify the performance of these heuristics and validate their impact through a live experiment. The third part of the thesis is based on a collaboration with a leading provider of content recommendations to online publishers...|$|E
