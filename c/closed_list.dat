5|$|South Africa has a {{parliamentary}} system of government; the National Assembly consists of 400 members elected by proportional representation with a <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> approach. Two hundred members are elected from national party lists; the other 200 are elected from provincial party lists {{in each of}} the nine provinces. The President of South Africa was chosen by the National Assembly after the election.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a <b>closed</b> <b>list,</b> and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
25|$|Party list {{proportional}} representation is an electoral {{system in which}} seats are first allocated to parties based on vote share, and then assigned to party-affiliated candidates on the parties' electoral lists. This system is used in many countries, including Finland (open list), Latvia (open list), Sweden (open list), Israel (national <b>closed</b> <b>list),</b> Brazil (open list), Nepal (<b>Closed</b> <b>list)</b> adopted in 2008 in first CA election, the Netherlands (open list), Russia (<b>closed</b> <b>list),</b> South Africa (<b>closed</b> <b>list),</b> Democratic Republic of the Congo (open list), and Ukraine (open list). For elections to the European Parliament, most member states use open lists; but most large EU countries use closed lists, so {{that the majority of}} EP seats are distributed by those. Local lists were used to elect the Italian Senate {{during the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} was conducted using the D'Hondt method with <b>closed</b> <b>lists.</b> The success of independent candidates {{in this election}} has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and use of <b>closed</b> <b>lists</b> which rendered voters unable {{to cast a vote}} for specific candidates in party lists.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on women's descriptive representation {{has looked at}} the debate on open and <b>closed</b> <b>lists</b> as a choice between electoral systems. This article instead focuses on whether voters or the parties are biased against female candidates. Using data from six Estonian elections, the article finds that voters are not consistently biased against female candidates and open lists do not necessarily decrease women's representation. However, unknown and non-incumbent female candidates fare significantly worse than similar men. The analysis also shows that parties do not place women in electable positions on <b>closed</b> <b>lists,</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>lists</b> do not improve women's representation...|$|R
50|$|Ahead of {{the polls}} CC.OO. and UGT had agreed on the {{principles}} of voluntary and secret vote. However, UGT called for the usage of <b>closed</b> <b>lists</b> whilst CC.OO. wanted to have open lists. Although the underlying motives of the choice of different approaches to the electoral system are not entirely clear, one assumption is that CC.OO. favoured open lists as they would be benefitted by their superior number of organized cadres whilst UGT would have hoped that their connection to the Socialist Party could be better utilized with <b>closed</b> <b>lists.</b> In the end the Ministry of Labour adopted a mixed system. The polls in companies with less than 250 employees were held with open lists, in other companies <b>closed</b> <b>lists</b> were used.|$|R
25|$|The {{election}} used a <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> form of proportional representation; UKIP scored 26.05 {{per cent}} {{of the vote in}} that region, just behind the Conservatives with 26.39 per cent. Kilroy-Silk was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in the second seat for his region.|$|E

25|$|A voter has {{two votes}} in the House of Representatives: one vote for a {{representative}} elected in the voter's congressional district (first-past-the-post), and one vote for a party in the party-list system (<b>closed</b> <b>list),</b> the so-called sectoral representatives; sectoral representatives shall comprise not more than 20% of the House of Representatives.|$|E

50|$|A {{localized}} list {{or local}} list {{is a technique}} used under systems of party-list proportional representation to determine which party candidates are elected from the party list. Local lists differ from open <b>lists</b> or <b>closed</b> <b>lists.</b> As with open lists, local lists allow the electorate to vote for individual candidates, but that preference is expressed through local or district level election processes. <b>Closed</b> <b>lists</b> do not allow voters to express such a preference. Voters vote only for the party.|$|R
25|$|Other {{aspects of}} PR can {{influence}} proportionality {{such as the}} size of the elected body, the choice of open or <b>closed</b> <b>lists,</b> ballot design, and vote counting methods.|$|R
25|$|The 24 {{seats in}} the Senate up for {{election}} were elected in three-seat constituencies using the <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> system. Each district is represented by three senatorial seats. Each party is allowed to register up to two candidates; one of those registered must be female. The party receiving the most votes wins two seats, and the second-placed party won one. The third senatorial seat was recently established {{in order to better}} represent the largest minority in each district.|$|E
25|$|The 135 {{members of}} the Parliament of Catalonia were elected using the D'Hondt method and a <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> {{proportional}} representation, with a threshold of 3 per 100 of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Additionally, {{the use of the}} D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, dependant on the district magnitude. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona. Each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats: 85 for Barcelona, 17 for Girona, 15 for Lleida and 18 for Tarragona.|$|E
25|$|For the Congress of Deputies, 348 {{seats were}} elected using the D'Hondt method and a <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> {{proportional}} representation, with a threshold of 3 per 100 of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency.

25|$|A new {{electoral law}} was {{established}} in 2005 by the Calderoli Law, {{and it is a}} form of semi-proportional representation. A party presents its own <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> and it can join other parties in alliances. The coalition which receives a plurality automatically wins at least 26 seats. Respecting this condition, seats are divided between coalitions, and subsequently to party lists, using the largest remainder method with a Hare quota. To receive seats, a party must overcome the barrage of 8% of the vote if it contests a single race, or of 3% of the vote if it runs in alliance. The change in the electoral law was strongly requested by the UDC, and finally agreed by Berlusconi, although criticised (including by political scientist Giovanni Sartori) for its comeback to proportionalism and its timing, less than one year before general elections.|$|E
500|$|Voting is on {{the basis}} of {{universal}} suffrage, with all nationals over eighteen and in full enjoyment of all political rights entitled to vote.

2500|$|In <b>closed</b> <b>list</b> systems, {{each party}} lists its {{candidates}} {{according to the}} party's candidate selection process. This sets the order of candidates on the list and thus, in effect, their probability of being elected. The first candidate on a list, for example, will get the first seat that party wins. Each voter casts a vote {{for a list of}} candidates. [...] Voters, therefore, do not have the option to express their preferences at the ballot as to which of a party's candidates are elected into office. A party is allocated seats in proportion to the number of votes it receives.|$|E
