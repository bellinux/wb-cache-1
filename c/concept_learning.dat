50|$|It is {{difficult}} to make any general statements about human (or animal) <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> without already assuming a particular psychological theory of <b>concept</b> <b>learning.</b> Although the classical views of concepts and <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> in philosophy speak of a process of abstraction, data compression, simplification, and summarization, currently popular psychological theories of <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> diverge on all these basic points. The history of psychology has seen {{the rise and fall}} of many theories about <b>concept</b> <b>learning.</b> Classical conditioning (as defined by Pavlov) created the earliest experimental technique. Reinforcement learning as described by Watson and elaborated by Clark Hull created a lasting paradigm in behavioral psychology. Cognitive psychology emphasized a computer and information flow metaphor for concept formation. Neural network models of concept formation and the structure of knowledge have opened powerful hierarchical models of knowledge organization such as George Miller's Wordnet. Neural networks are based on computational models of learning using factor analysis or convolution. Neural networks also are open to neuroscience and psychophysiological models of learning following Karl Lashley and Donald Hebb.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Concept</b> <b>learning,</b> {{also known}} as {{category}} learning, concept attainment, and concept formation, is largely based on {{the works of the}} cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner. Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin (1967) defined concept attainment (or <b>concept</b> <b>learning)</b> as [...] "the search for and listing of attributes {{that can be used to}} distinguish exemplars from non exemplars of various categories". More simply put, concepts are the mental categories that help us classify objects, events, or ideas, building on the understanding that each object, event, or idea has a set of common relevant features. Thus, <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> is a strategy which requires a learner to compare and contrast groups or categories that contain concept-relevant features with groups or categories that do not contain concept-relevant features.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Concept</b> <b>learning</b> must be {{distinguished}} from learning by reciting something from memory (recall) or discriminating between two things that differ (discrimination).

Similarly, while discrimination {{is not the same as}} initial <b>concept</b> <b>learning,</b> discrimination processes are involved in refining concepts by means of the repeated presentation of exemplars.|$|E

50|$|<b>Concept</b> <b>{{learning}}</b> also {{refers to}} a learning task in which a human or machine learner is trained to classify objects by being shown a set of example objects along with their class labels. The learner simplifies what has been observed by condensing it {{in the form of}} an example. This simplified version of what has been learned is then applied to future examples. <b>Concept</b> <b>learning</b> may be simple or complex because learning takes place over many areas. When a concept is difficult, it is less likely that the learner will be able to simplify, and therefore will be less likely to learn. Colloquially, the task is known as learning from examples. Most theories of <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> are based on the storage of exemplars and avoid summarization or overt abstraction of any kind.|$|E

5000|$|Exemplar {{theory is}} {{the storage of}} {{specific}} instances (exemplars), with new objects evaluated only with respect to how closely they resemble specific known members (and nonmembers) of the category. This theory hypothesizes that learners store examples verbatim. This theory views <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> as highly simplistic. Only individual properties are represented. These individual properties are not abstract {{and they do not}} create rules. An example of what exemplar theory might look like is, [...] "water is wet". It is simply known that some (or one, or all) stored examples of water have the property wet. Exemplar based theories have become more empirically popular over the years with some evidence suggesting that human learners use exemplar based strategies only in early learning, forming prototypes and generalizations later in life. An important result of exemplar models in psychology literature has been a de-emphasis of complexity in <b>concept</b> <b>learning.</b> One of the best known exemplar theories of <b>concept</b> <b>learning</b> is the Generalized Context Model (GCM).|$|E

Our experimental results contradict previous papers in statistics, which advocate the 632 bootstrap method as superior to crossvalidation. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that conclusions based on cross-validation in previous machine learning papers are unreliable. Specifically, our observations are that (i) the true error of the <b>concept</b> <b>learned</b> by FOIL from independently drawn sets of examples of the same concept varies widely, (ii) the estimate of true error provided by cross-validation has high variability but is approximately unbiased, and (iii) the 632 bootstrap estimator has lower variability than cross-validation, but is systematically biased. ...|$|R
