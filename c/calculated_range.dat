The HACS also displayed the predicted bearing and elevation of the target on indicators in the Director tower, or on later variants, the HACS could move the entire Director through Remote Power Control so that it could continue to track the target if the target became obscured.|$|E

For instance, the distance between a station near London and a target in Düsseldorf would be about 300 miles, so an arc with a 300 mile radius around the station would be drawn, passing through Düsseldorf.

The mission planners would then calculate the location along that arc where the bombs would need to be dropped to hit the target.

Genomic DNA from 50 pigs comprising of at least 10 pigs per geopolitical zone of Imo state were extracted and two highly polymorphic primers utilized to estimate variability, phylogenetic relationship among the pigs and their genetic diversity. The genetic distance and genetic identity estimated showed that genetic distances (D) <b>calculated</b> <b>ranged</b> between 0. 0300 (Songhai vs FUTO) and 0. 1497 (Mbaise vs Awo-Idemili), while the genetic identity (I) <b>calculated</b> <b>ranged</b> between 0. 8610 (Mbaise vs Awo-Idemili) and 0. 9704 (Songhai vs FUTO).

By selectively varying chemical potentials of graphene oligomer, the two innate plasmonic modes are profoundly modulated. Tuning the chemical potential of prominent graphene nanodisks in two plasmonic modes respectively has different influence on two plasmonic modes. The change of chemical potential of intersection part between the two plasmonic modes intensifies both two plasmonic resonances and leads to degeneration of plasmonic modes. In addition, the change of chemical potential of central graphene nanodisk also significantly affects the EM properties of graphene oligomer. The simulated {{results show that the}} graphene oligomer possesses high tunability and flexibility, and provides new degrees of freedom for designing plasmonic nanodevices capable of tailoring two-dimensional light confinement.|$|E
