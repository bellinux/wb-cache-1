The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E

50|$|Greek pancakes {{are called}} tiganites (τηγανίτες, {{from the ancient}} Greek τηγανίτης) and are popular across Greece and Cyprus. They are {{slightly}} thicker than crêpes and can be sweet or savoury. Their main ingredients are flour, olive oil or butter, milk and eggs. They are usually drizzled with honey and cinnamon, and sometimes topped with cheese, nuts, fruits or vegetables. Various small shops in Cyprus called creperies sell crepes, either savoury or sweet varieties. Tiganites can be served for breakfast or dessert, and in some places like Corfu, patras are customarily served in the feast days of Saint Spyridon and Saint Andrew. In Cyprus the pancake recipe is used for a similar dish such as Genoese canelloni - ground meat with tomato sauce, cheese, and sometimes bechamel sauce - instead of the traditional <b>cannelloni</b> dried pasta sold at supermarkets.|$|E
5000|$|Columbo {{was born}} and raised in New York City in a {{neighborhood}} near Chinatown. In the episode [...] "Murder Under Glass", he says that he ate more egg rolls than <b>cannelloni</b> during his childhood. He is Italian on both sides. Although never mentioned in the series, the southern-Italian surname Columbo is quite rare (unlike the more common spelling 'Colombo', a north-Italian surname), and current real-life Columbos are concentrated around Bari in Apulia, south-east Italy. Columbo confirms these southern roots in [...] "Any Old Port in a Storm", calling Milan [...] "up north". The Columbo household included his grandfather, parents, five brothers (one named George and another named Fred), and a sister, Rose. His father wore glasses and did the cooking when his mother was in the hospital having another baby. His grandfather [...] "was a tailgunner on a beer truck during Prohibition" [...] and let him stomp the grapes when they made wine in the cellar.|$|E

40|$|This {{delightful}} collection {{captures the}} flavor {{and diversity of}} the cuisine of the Lone Star State. The Texas Cookbook presents recipes ranging from down-home cooking to high-class affairs, from regional favorites to ethnic specialties. Mary Faulk Koock traveled throughout Texas gathering recipes from ranch kitchens and city hostesses. Scattered among these are the author’s anecdotes from her vast and varied encounters with the famous and influential. In Austin John Henry Faulk, the author’s brother, savors Quail Pie with J. Frank Dobie, Walter Prescott, Roy Bedichek, and Mody Boatright. Fort Worth’s Van Cliburn enjoys the hostess’ biscuits and offers his own recipe for a whole-wheat variety. Here is Lady Bird Johnson’s Peach Ice Cream (the LBJ Ranch) and some expected classics such as Lee’s Chili (Amarillo), Venison Roast (the King Ranch), and Black-eyed Peas with Okra (Austin). But you will also find the unusual in Roasted Wild Turkey (the Hill Country), Fried Apricot Pies (Fredericksburg), and Watermelon Rind Preserves (Luling). Regional contributions shine in Sauerbraten (Kerrville), Salsa Brava (Brownsville) and Crawfish Etouffee (Beaumont). At the home of friends in Dallas Koock reveals the recipe for Chicken <b>Cannelloni</b> served after an opera. We share in her delight with Persimmon Salad in San Antonio, Cold Breast of Duck with Orange Slices in Houston, and Cebollas Rellenas from the Rio Grande Valley. Where else can you learn the story behind Slumgullion, a purported concoction of Fort Worth’s Amon Carter, Sr., and friend Will Rogers, or find the recipe for Pepparkakor (Swedish Ginger Cookies) from the Austin area? Other cities with recipes featured are Tyler, Abilene, Rockdale, El Paso, Waco, Columbus, and Corpus Christi. Much more than a cookbook, this collection offers {{a look at a}} way of life and entertaining, Texas style...|$|E
