5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta.

5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> Naruto's costume.|$|E

Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, who continued playing despite breaking a bone in his neck in a collision with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{confidence}} intervals {{are used in}} Scheffé (1953) to assess any <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> several normal means. In this paper, the problem <b>of</b> assessing any <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> several simple linear regression models by using simultaneous confidence bands is considered. Using numerical integration, Spurrier (1999) constructed exact simultaneous confidence bands for all the <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> several regression lines over the whole range (??,?) of the explanatory variable when the design matrices of the regression lines are all equal. In this paper, a simulation-based method is proposed to construct simultaneous confidence bands for all the <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> the regression lines when the explanatory variable is restricted to an interval and the design matrices of the regression lines may be different. The critical value calculated by this method can be {{as close to the}} exact critical value as required if the number of replications in the simulation is chosen sufficiently large. The methodology is illustrated with a real problem in which sizes of the left atrium of infants in three diagnostic groups (severely impaired, mildly impaired and normal) are compared <br/...|$|R
40|$|Contrast {{enhancement}} is {{a technique}} which enables images to improve the <b>contrast</b> level <b>of</b> images. <b>Contrast</b> enhancement <b>of</b> images requires filtering <b>of</b> regions where <b>contrast</b> level is high or where noise level is more. The techniques such as non-dynamic based stochastic resonance are implemented but the technique provides less accuracy <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> improvement. Hence an efficient technique is implemented here by segmented the low <b>contrast</b> region <b>of</b> the image and then filtering is performed on the segmented region using transformation.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
5|$|Monet's use {{of colored}} shadows arose from color {{theories}} that were {{popular in the}} 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832) published {{one of the first}} modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (16431727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (17861889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and <b>Contrast</b> <b>of</b> Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work. Georges Seurat (18591891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (18311902).|$|E

Our findings suggest that mental <b>contrasting</b> <b>of</b> a negative future helps people reduce disproportional anxiety regarding a negative future...|$|R

5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced {{with a lack of}} suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor.

An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E
