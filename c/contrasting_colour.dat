5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E

25|$|Other {{principal}} components are the crown, band and insignia, typically a cap badge and embroidery {{in proportion to}} rank. Piping is also often found, typically {{in contrast to the}} crown colour, which is usually white for navy, blue for air force and green for army. The band is typically a dark, <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour,</b> often black, but may be patterned or striped.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{have only}} one class of pigment cell, the {{mammalian}} equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair, and eye colour. For this reason, and because the large number and <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise, melanophores {{are by far the}} most widely studied chromatophore. However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and that of melanocytes. In addition to eumelanin, melanocytes can generate a yellow/red pigment called phaeomelanin.|$|E
50|$|The truth {{effect can}} be induced by colour {{differences}} in statements as well. In a study, participants were presented with statements, {{some of which were}} true and the rest being false. Half these statements were presented in high <b>contrast</b> <b>colours</b> and the other half were presented in low <b>contrast</b> <b>colours.</b> Independent of truth, participants judged the high contrast statements as true. Participants were also quicker to make judgements about the high contrast statements compared to the low contrast statements. The contrast differences in statements increased fluency.|$|R

25|$|Abstract {{forms are}} used throughout, {{especially}} in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab {{and to a lesser}} extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour,</b> creating geometric patterns of considerable complexity. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.|$|E
500|$|... "3 Words" [...] {{was praised}} by {{contemporary}} critics {{who said it}} was [...] "a sophisticated love song" [...] and the [...] "standout track" [...] from the album. Its unconventional production abandons the use of 'verse-chorus-verse' structure instead, opting for a throbbing build up to a climax. The accompanying video, directed by Saam, features the singer in various fashion ensambles often <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> with will.i.am and, paying homage to Madonna. It also makes use of split screen cinematography and camera effects for the transition of scenes.|$|E
500|$|Wild Elixir was {{released}} as a flanker fragrance to Elixir on 25 August 2013. Categorised as a floral oriental perfume, Wild Elixir features top notes of cassis and mandarin; heart notes of honeysuckle flower, orange blossom, and peach fruit accord; the base notes consist of benzoin resin, patchouli, and sandalwood. The flacon of the perfume {{is similar to}} the original one, but instead features a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> scheme of golden and black. The packaging was again designed by Estrada and features illustrations of flowers and wild cats set on a brownish orange background and {{is similar to the}} look of the African savannah.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Cott's 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals {{introduced}} ideas such as [...] "maximum disruptive contrast". This uses {{streaks of}} boldly <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour,</b> which paradoxically make animals or military vehicles less visible by breaking up their outlines. Cott explains that in ideal conditions, background colour matching together with countershading would [...] "suffice to render an animal absolutely invisible against a plain background", but at once adds that conditions are hardly ever ideal, {{as they are}} constantly changing, as is the light. Therefore, Cott argues, camouflage has {{to break up the}} perceived continuous surfaces of an object and its outlines. In Cott's own words, [...] "for effective concealment, it is essential that the tell-tale appearance of form should be destroyed." [...] Cott draws an analogy with a pickpocket who carefully distracts your attention, arguing that: ...|$|E
500|$|The English {{zoologist}} Hugh Cott's 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals corrected Thayer's errors, sometimes sharply: [...] "Thus we find Thayer straining {{the theory}} to a fantastic extreme in an endeavour {{to make it}} cover almost every type of coloration in the animal kingdom." [...] Cott built on Thayer's discoveries, developing a comprehensive view of camouflage based on [...] "maximum disruptive contrast", countershading and hundreds of examples. The book explained how disruptive camouflage worked, using streaks of boldly <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour,</b> paradoxically making objects less visible by breaking up their outlines. While Cott was more systematic and balanced in his view than Thayer, and did include some experimental evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} camouflage, his 500-page textbook was, like Thayer's, mainly a natural history narrative which illustrated theories with examples.|$|E
500|$|In 1904 the Football Association {{dropped its}} rule that players' knickerbockers must cover their knees and teams began wearing them much shorter. They {{became known as}} [...] "knickers", and were {{referred}} to by this term until the 1960s when [...] "shorts" [...] became the preferred term. Initially, almost all teams wore knickers of a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> to their shirts. In 1909, {{in a bid to}} assist referees in identifying the goalkeeper amongst a ruck of players, the Laws of the Game were amended to state that the goalkeeper must wear a shirt of a different colour to his team-mates. Initially it was specified that goalkeepers' shirts must be either scarlet or royal blue, but when green was added as a third option in 1912 it caught on to the extent that soon almost every goalkeeper was playing in green. In this period goalkeepers generally wore a heavy woollen garment more akin to a jumper than the shirts worn by outfield players.|$|E

2500|$|Argent (Ger. Weiss) is {{similarly}} {{derived from the}} Latin argentum, [...] "silver". [...] Although sometimes depicted as metallic silver or faint grey, it is more often represented by white, {{in part because of}} the tendency for silver paint to oxidize and darken over time, and {{in part because of the}} pleasing effect of white against a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour.</b> [...] Notwithstanding the widespread use of white for argent, some heraldic authorities have suggested the existence of white as a distinct heraldic colour.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, the 86xstyle Cb {{was officially}} {{launched}} after its presentations at the 2013 and 2014 Tokyo Auto Salon. It is characterised by a drastically different front end design with revised lights and bumper bar but standard bonnet. Available in 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, it has revised interior trimmings including a red Cb logo embroidered leather steering wheel, white (instead of red) backlit instruments {{and a dark}} woodgrain-style panel across the dashboard. The most peculiar features are {{the replacement of the}} front side gills with a set of LED-illuminated fins and optional <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> for the carâs upper body section. Another option is different alloy wheels than those fitted as standard on the GT86. On sale from April, this Japan-only model is listed for , which is a [...] premium over the regular 86 GT on which this variant is based.|$|E
2500|$|Power-assisted front {{disc brakes}} were now {{standard}} across the Falcon range. The GT {{variant of the}} XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland [...] V8 known as the 'big port' engine, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with 'small port' heads. A notable difference in performance is seen between these engines, and also in resale value, as the early US-powered GTs are rarer, so more collectable. The twin driving lights remained, as did the bonnet locks. The bonnet scoops of the GT were now integrated into the [...] "power bulge" [...] on the bonnet, the bumpers were now body-coloured, and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and valances were painted in a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).|$|E

2500|$|In {{practice}} traditionally {{there is}} no specific uniform required {{in the practice of}} tÃ ijÃ­quÃ¡n. Modern day practitioners usually wear comfortable, loose T-shirts and trousers made from breathable natural fabrics, that allow for free movement during practice. Despite this, tâai-chi châÃ¼an has become synonymous with [...] "tâai-chi uniforms" [...] or [...] "kung fu uniforms" [...] that usually consist of loose-fitting traditional Chinese styled trousers and a long or short-sleeved shirt, with a Mandarin collar and buttoned with Chinese frog buttons. The long-sleeved variants are referred to as Northern-style uniforms, whilst the short-sleeved, Southern-style uniforms. The colour of this clothing is usually, all white, all black, black and white, or any other colour, mostly being either all a single solid colour or a combination of 2 colours: one colour being the actual clothing and the binding being a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour.</b> They are normally made from natural fabrics such as cotton or silk. These uniforms are not a requirement, but rather are usually worn by masters & professional practitioners during demonstrations, tournaments and other public exhibitions.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoscorpions {{are small}} {{arthropods}} with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that {{resemble those of}} scorpions. They range from [...] long. The opisthosoma {{is made up of}} twelve segments, each guarded by plate-like tergites above and sternites below. The abdomen is short and rounded at the rear, rather than extending into a segmented tail and stinger like true scorpions. The colour of the body can be yellowish-tan to dark-brown, with the paired claws often a <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour.</b> They may have two, four or no eyes. They have two very long pedipalps with palpal chelae (pincers) that strongly resemble the pincers found on a scorpion. The pedipalps generally consist of an immobile [...] "hand" [...] and [...] "finger", with a separate movable finger controlled by an adductor muscle. A venom gland and duct are usually located in the mobile finger; the poison is used to capture and immobilise the pseudoscorpion's prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions pour a mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains. Pseudoscorpions spin silk from a gland in their jaws to make disk-shaped cocoons for mating, molting, or waiting out cold weather. Another trait they share with their closest relatives, the spiders, is breathing through spiracles. Most spiders have one pair of spiracles, and one of book lungs, but pseudoscorpions do not have book lungs.|$|E

The Clerk of the Crown, in black gown and yellow hose, had been busy some time conversing with his secondary. Next to the judges sat several gentlemen of the Queen's household, their silken {{doublets}} of rich though sombre hues adding a crisp note of <b>contrasting</b> <b>colour</b> to the harmonies in scarlet and dull oak, which filled in the background of the picture.|$|E
