The number of <b>circulating</b> PCs per 50 000 mononuclear cells was reported. In 80 (27 %) patients, no <b>circulating</b> PC were seen; 106 (35 %) patients had 1 to 10 and 115 (38 %) patients {{had more than}} 10 <b>circulating</b> PCs. Median overall survival for the 302 patients was 47 months. Patients with 10 or fewer <b>circulating</b> PCs had a median survival of 58. 7 months, whereas patients with more than 10 <b>circulating</b> PCs had a median survival of 37. 3 months (P =. 001). On multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of <b>circulating</b> PCs was independent of Î² 2 -microglobulin, albumin, and C-reactive protein. There was only a weak correlation between tumor mass and <b>circulating</b> PCs, suggesting that the appearance of <b>circulating</b> PCs may be a reflection of tumor biology.

30|$|The {{equivalent}} output impedances of {{the parallel}} inverters {{are different from}} each other at PCC [59] in an AC or hybrid microgrid since the control strategies, filter parameters and length of transmission lines [60], are not the same. Consequently, it will cause the fundamental and harmonic <b>circulating</b> currents, and also the fluctuations of the amplitude and frequency of the PCC voltage of the islanded microgrid [61, 62]. There have three types of <b>circulating</b> currents in the islanded mode, i.e., active <b>circulating</b> current, reactive <b>circulating</b> current and harmonic <b>circulating</b> current. The active <b>circulating</b> current is caused by the frequency and phase deviations of inverter output voltages. The reactive <b>circulating</b> current results from the magnitude deviations of inverter output voltages. The harmonic <b>circulating</b> current is the result of harmonic components of inverter output voltages. The slight deviations of the frequency, phase and magnitude of the inverter output voltages will lead to large fundamental or harmonic <b>circulating</b> currents [63]. Moreover, the <b>circulating</b> currents will reduce the output capacities of the DG units, and increase the line losses, also endanger the safe operation of the microgrid [64, 65].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: <b>Circulating</b> {{tumor cells}} are {{malignant}} cells in peripheral blood that originate from primary tumors or metastatic sites. The heterogeneous {{natural history and}} propensity for recurrence in prostate, bladder and kidney cancers are well suited for improved individualization of care using <b>circulating</b> tumor cells. The potential clinical applications of <b>circulating</b> tumor cells include early diagnosis, disease prediction and prognosis, and selection of appropriate therapies. Materials and Methods: The PubMed (R) and Web of Science (R) databases were searched using the key words <b>circulating</b> tumor cells, CTC, prostate, kidney, bladder, renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. Relevant articles and references from 1994 to 2011 were reviewed for data on the detection and significance of <b>circulating</b> tumor cells in genitourinary cancer. Results: Technical challenges have previously limited the widespread introduction of <b>circulating</b> tumor cell detection in routine clinical care. Recently novel platforms were introduced to detect these cells that offer the promise of overcoming these limitations. We reviewed {{the current state of}} <b>circulating</b> tumor cell capture technologies and their clinical applications for genitourinary cancers. Conclusions: In genitourinary cancer <b>circulating</b> tumor cell enumeration has been useful for prognosis in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer. Soon characterizing individual <b>circulating</b> tumor cells in blood will serve as a noninvasive real-time liquid biopsy to monitor molecular changes in cancer, allowing clinicians to custom tailor treatment strategies. <b>Circulating</b> tumor cells will serve as a treatment response biomarker.

40|$|The IGF-binding {{proteins}} (IGFBPs) are {{a family}} of at least six structurally related proteins, which bind the IGFs and modulate their actions, including the regulation of pre- and postnatal growth. In this study we have {{examined the relationship between}} <b>circulating</b> and tissue mRNA levels of IGFBPs and related this to <b>circulating</b> IGFs in the fetal sheep over the gestational period when rapid growth and development occurs. <b>Circulating</b> IGFBP- 2, as measured by Western ligand blot (WLB), increases between early and mid gestation, remains high, then declines throughout late gestation (P = 0. 0002). <b>Circulating</b> IGFBP- 3 increases throughout gestation, as measured by WLB or RIA (P = 0. 04 and P = 0. 0001 respectively), as does <b>circulating</b> IGFBP- 4 (P = 0. 004). These ontogenic changes in <b>circulating</b> IGFBPs- 2 and - 4 are paralleled by changes in liver mRNA for these proteins and, for IGFBP- 2, by those in kidney IGFBP- 2 mRNA also. This suggests that liver and kidney may be the primary contributors to <b>circulating</b> IGFBP- 2 and the liver to <b>circulating</b> IGFBP- 4, IGFBP- 2 mRNA is present in the heart and lung in early gestation but barely detectable in these tissues after approximately 60 days gestation. IGFBP- 4 mRNA is also present in the heart in early but not late gestation, but is abundant in the lung throughout gestation. These results demonstrate tissue specific and developmental regulation of IGFBPs- 2 and - 4 at the mRNA level. To assess any role the <b>circulating</b> IGFs may play in mediating these changes in IGFBPs, or vice versa, both plasma IGF-I and IGF-II were measured by RIA. <b>Circulating</b> IGF-I increases as gestation progresses (P = 0. 0001), while <b>circulating</b> IGF-II increases between early and mid gestation, remains high (P = 0. 01), then declines. <b>Circulating</b> IGF-I is positively correlated with fetal weight (r = 0. 66, P = 0. 03), <b>circulating</b> IGFBP- 3 (r = 0. 54, P = 0. 01) and IGFBP- 4 (r = 0. 52, P = 0. 01). <b>Circulating</b> IGF-II positively correlates with <b>circulating</b> IGFBP- 2 (r = 0. 48, P = 0. 02) throughout gestation and at 1 day postnatally. These relationships are consistent with <b>circulating</b> IGF-I influencing IGFBPs- 3 and - 4, and similarly, IGF-II determining IGFBP- 2, or vice versa. Alternatively, these correlations may reflect coordinate regulation of IGF and IGFBP by a common factor...|$|R
