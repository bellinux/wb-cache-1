SiGe HBTs on SOI are attractive for mixed signal radio frequency (RF) applications {{and have been}} of increasing research interest due to their compatibility with SOI CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) technology. In bipolar technology, the use of SOI substrate eliminates parasitic substrate transistors and associated latch-up, and {{has the ability to}} reduce crosstalk, particularly when combined with buried groundplanes (GP). Various technological SOI bipolar concepts are reviewed with special emphasis on the state-of-the-art SOI SiGe HBT devices in vertical and lateral design. More in depth results are shown from a UK consortium advanced RF platform technology, which includes SOI SiGe HBTs. Bonded wafer technology was developed to allow incorporation of buried silicide layers both above and below the buried oxide. New electrical and noise characterisation results pointed to reduced 1 /f noise in these devices compared to bulk counterparts. The lower noise is purported to arise from strain relief of the device structure due to the elasticity of the buried oxide layer during the high temperature epitaxial layer growth. The novel concept of the silicide SOI (SSOI) SiGe HBT technology developed for targeting a reduction in <b>collector</b> <b>resistance,</b> as well as for suppressing the crosstalk, is outlined.

40|$|In this thesis, {{techniques}} are presented {{for determining the}} model parameter values required by compact bipolar transistor models in circuit simulators. Specifically, extraction of the Early voltages and the transistor series resistances are treated in detail. Extraction of other compact model parameters is also covered. A general technique is suggested for extracting the Early voltages of different Early effect formulations found in compact models. This technique is shown to enable extraction of all Early effect parameters from dc measurements only. Thus, ac measurements required by previous {{techniques are}} not necessary. The Early effect is also characterized using a dedicated transistor test structure. This structure allows measurement of the bias dependence of the Early voltages, which are commonly assumed to be constant. It is shown that these parameters exhibit a geometry dependence not included in most compact models in use today. The test structure used for characterizing the Early effect was originally designed for series resistance extraction. The use of the test structure considerably simplifies the extraction of these resistances {{using data from the}} transistor in normal operation. In contrast to previous methods, measurement of the bias dependent base resistance and the constant part of the <b>collector</b> <b>resistance</b> becomes a straightforward procedure. Furthermore, the valid bias range of the measured base resistance data is greatly extended by use of the test structure. Besides relying {{on the use of the}} test structure, much of the base resistance extraction procedure is based on a new model for the bias dependent base resistance. This model, which is presented in the thesis, is intended for inclusion in a compact transistor model. Both emitter current-crowding and base conductivity-modulation are accounted for in our model. By using this model in combination with the test structure, we show how to extract the zero-bias intrinsic base sheet resistance using data from the transistor in normal operation. General aspects of the design and use of test structures for parameter extraction are also discussed. It is shown that parameters extracted from test structures not necessarily translate directly into compact model parameters. In the case of the distributed base resistance, it is shown that parameters extracted using the test structure cannot directly be used in compact models. However, a simple conversion procedure for obtaining the desired compact model parameters is presented...|$|E

Two different SiGe platforms are explored in this work with one aimed at RF applications (180 GHz fmax) and the other aimed at high performance and high voltage (up to 48 V) analog applications (20 GHz fmax). To {{the best of the}} author's knowledge, this is the first look into the 300 ^∘C operation of thick-film SOI SiGe HBTs and the effect of TID on a high-voltage complementary SiGe platform. Chapter 1 presents a brief overview and summary of the SiGe technology. The effect of incorporating Ge in a Si BJT is emphasized and is quantitatively described. Chapter 2 presents the high temperature (to 300 ^∘C) DC and AC performance of a > 100 GHz fT/fmax SiGe HBTs on thick-film SOI. Metrics such as current gain (βF), BVCEO, M- 1, fT, fmax are extracted from 24 ^∘C to 300 ^∘C and compared with a bulk SiGe HBT platform. The results demonstrate that while there are degradation to key device metrics at high temperatures, the devices are still usable over a wide temperature range. Additionally, while SOI is known for its high thermal resistance, it is demonstrated that the device is constrained by electrical effects rather than thermal effects at higher temperatures, which should therefore yield acceptable reliability.

Complete process sequences for fabrication of InP/InGaAs HBTs are developed and subsequently employed to produce the devices, which are then electrically characterized and irradiated with the different types of radiation. A comprehensive analytical HBT model is developed and radiation damage calculations are performed to model the observed radiation-induced degradation of SHBTs. The most pronounced radiation effects found in SHBTs include reduction of the common-emitter DC current gain, shift of the collector-emitter (CE) offset voltage and increase of the emitter, base and <b>collector</b> parasitic <b>resistances.</b> Quantitative analysis performed using the developed model demonstrates that increase of the neutral bulk and base-emitter (BE) space charge region (SCR) components of the base current are responsible for the observed current gain degradation. The rise of the neutral bulk recombination is attributed to decrease in a Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) carrier lifetime, while the SCR current increase is caused by rising SCR SRH recombination and activation of a tunneling-recombination mechanism. On the material level these effects are explained by displacement defects produced in a semiconductor by the incident radiation. The second primary change of the SHBT characteristics, CE offset voltage shift, is induced by degradation of the base-collector (BC) junction. The observed rise of the BC current is brought on by diffusion and recombination currents which increase as more defects are introduced in a semiconductor.

An AIGaAs base was used to eliminate the conduction band spike and measurements were carefully performed using pulse biasing to minimise device self-heating. Voltage drops across the base and <b>collector</b> series <b>resistances</b> were also taken into account. The measured room temperature saturation velocity of 5. 0 x 10 " 6 cm/s decreased rapidly to 2. 9 x 10 " 6 cm/s at 200 deg C. These results are particularly important for the prediction of frequency performance of Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 In_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P/(Al) GaAs/Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 In_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P DHBTs. Avalanche multiplication and hence impact ionisation coefficients for In_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 7 As have been determined from photomultiplication measurements over the temperature range of 20 - 400 K for a series of p-i-n/n-i-p diodes. Negative temperature dependence is observed in both the electron and hole multiplication of In_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 7 As at electric fields over 200 kV/cm, contrary to the temperature dependence of collector multiplication previously observed in InP/In_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 7 As heterojunction bipolar transistors. The results also showed that the breakdown voltage for In_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 7 As is comparable to GaAs at room temperature, and has weaker temperature dependence.

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{promising}} candidates for converting chemical energy into electrical energy. The Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) {{is a high}} temperature fuel cell that produces electrical energy {{from a variety of}} fuels containing hydrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Since the waste heat has a high temperature it can also be used leading to a high overall efficiency. Material degradation and the cost of the components are the problems for the commercialisation of MCFC. Although there are companies around the world starting to commercialise MCFC some further cost reduction is needed before MCFC can be fully introduced at the market. In this work, alternative materials for three different components of MCFC have been investigated. The alternative materials should have a lower cost compared to the state-of-the-art materials but also meet the life-time goal of MCFC, which is around 5 years. The nickel dissolution of the cathode is a problem and a cathode with lower solubility is needed. The dissolution of nickel for three alternative cathode materials was investigated, where one of the materials had a lower solubility than the state-of-the-art nickel oxide. This material was also tested in a cell and the electrochemical performance was found to be comparable with nickel oxide and is an interesting candidate. An inexpensive anode current collector material is also desired. For the anode current <b>collector,</b> the contact <b>resistance</b> should be low and it should have good corrosion properties. The two alternative materials tested had low contact resistance, but some chromium enrichment was seen at the grain boundaries. This can lead to a decreased mechanical stability of the material. In the wet-seal area, the stainless steel used as bipolar/separator plate should be coated. An alternative process to coat the stainless steel, that is less expensive, was evaluated. This process can be a suitable process, but today, when the coating process is done manually {{there seems to be a}} problem with the adherence. This work has been a part of the IRMATECH project, which was financed by the European Commission, where the partners have been universities, research institutes and companies around Europe.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of current}} collector materials in MoltenCarbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) is investigated. The essential aimsof this investigation were {{to study the}} corrosion behaviour ofdifferent materials, in varying cathode and anode MCFCenvironments, and to study the contact corrosion resistancesbetween the MCFC current collector and electrodes. For thesepurposes, pure iron, iron-chromium binary alloys and severalcommercial steels were investigated in molten carbonate meltswithin the pot-cell laboratory set-up. In addition, the contactcorrosion resistances, between an AISI 310 current collectorand two cathodes (NiO and LiCoO 2), were studied in a laboratory fuel cell. Post-tests were done to study the corrosion products formed atthe surfaces. In cathode environments, corrosion potential increased overtime as a protective corrosion layer slowly formed. Eventually,the potential reached a stable value close to the cathodeoperating potential. The main cathode reaction, as corrosionpotential increased, changed from water reduction to oxygenreduction. Corrosion rate under the operating cathode conditiondepended on the chromium content; the higher the concentrationof chromium, the lower the corrosion rate. The corrosion ratesof ferritic steels, with high chromium content, and AISI 310 were higher at the so-called outlet operating condition incomparison to the standard and so-called inlet conditions. Thecorrosion rate was higher {{at the beginning of}} the exposure,which resulted in a relatively fast corrosion layer growth thatslowed as the protective layer was formed. It was shown thatthe corrosion layers, formed on iron-chromium alloys, AISI 310 and ferritic high chromium-containing steels, consisted of twolayers. The outer layer was porous and iron rich, while theinner layer was quite compact and rich in chromium and/oraluminiumTherefore, the corrosion behaviour was dependent onthe corrosion layer structure at the metal surface. In anode environments, the beneficial behaviour of aluminiumin ferritic alloys, with high aluminium contents, was due tothe formation of aluminium oxide and/or lithium aluminium oxideat the surface. The corrosion rates at the standard and outletconditions were of the same order of magnitude, while thecorrosion rates at the inlet conditions were considerablyhigher. The lower temperatures and higher carbon dioxideconcentrations in the inlet conditions appeared to result in asurface layer deficient in aluminium. A modified theoreticalmodel was developed to evaluate the corrosion current densitiesfrom experimental polarisation curves or linear polarisationresistance measurements in anode environments. The fittingswere found to be very good. An experimental method was developed forin-situmeasurements of the contributions to the totalohmic losses at the cathode in a laboratory scale MCFC. Thecontact resistance between the cathode and current collectorcontributed quite a large value to the total cathodepolarization. The corrosion layer, formed between the LiCoO 2 cathode and AISI 310 current collector, wasiron-rich and more porous, and contained a small amount ofcobalt. This was deemed to consist of a two-phase oxide, whichresulted in a lower conductivity. The corrosion layer, formedbetween the NiO cathode and AISI 310 current collector, wasrich in nickel. The corrosion layers on the AISI 310, incontact with the cathode, had a different composition comparedto samples immersed in carbonate melts.
