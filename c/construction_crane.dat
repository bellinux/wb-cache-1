5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a <b>{{construction}}</b> <b>crane</b> crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone. Due to the fragile sandstone exterior, the damage on the rotunda was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion of the project and finished the structural reinforcement part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E
5|$|In Sarasota County, the {{flooding}} closed several roads {{and led to}} many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, {{the flooding}} persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a <b>construction</b> <b>crane</b> at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70destroyed. Twopeople were killed in Florida.|$|E
5|$|With Spider-Man cast, filming was set {{to begin}} the {{following}} November in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release a year later, but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, filming officially began on January 8, 2001 in Culver City, California. After {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, certain sequences were re-filmed, and images of the Twin Towers were digitally erased from the film. Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California. On March 6, forty-five-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a <b>construction</b> <b>crane</b> crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.|$|E

25|$|The Sound {{department}} {{spent the}} early part of the year searching for the right sounds. A Tasmanian devil was Shelob's shriek, which in turn gave inspiration for Weta's animators, while the mûmakil is the beginning and end of a lion roar. Human screams and a donkey screech were mixed into Sauron's fall and broken glass was used for the collapsing sounds. For missile trading during Minas Tirith's siege, construction workers dropped actual 2 ton stone blocks previously lifted by a <b>construction</b> <b>crane.</b> Mixing began at a new studio on 15 August, although unfinished building work caused some annoyances. The mixers finished on 15 November, after three months of non-stop work.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by {{a single}} crane can be determined from the characteristic lewis iron holes (each of which points at the use of one crane) in the lifted stone block. By dividing its weight by their number, one arrives at a maximum lifting capacity of 7.5 to 8t as exemplified by a cornice block at the Trajan's Forum and the architrave blocks of the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek. Based on a detailed Roman relief of a <b>construction</b> <b>crane,</b> the engineer O'Connor calculates a slightly less lifting capability, 6.2t, for such a type of treadwheel crane, {{on the assumption that}} it was powered by five men and using a three-pulley block.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{after the}} {{building}} had reached its full architectural height, work was halted due to the economic crisis in North Korea following {{the collapse of the}} Soviet bloc. Japanese newspapers estimated the cost of construction was $750million, consuming 2percent of North Korea’s GDP. For over a decade, the unfinished building sat vacant and without windows, fixtures, or fittings, appearing as a massive concrete shell. A rusting <b>construction</b> <b>crane</b> remained at the top, which the BBC called [...] "a reminder of the totalitarian state's thwarted ambition". According to Marcus Noland, in the late 1990s, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Korea inspected the building and concluded that the structure was irreparable. Questions were raised regarding the quality of the building's concrete and the alignment of its elevator shafts, which some sources said were [...] "crooked".|$|E
500|$|The Big Four Bridge {{had one of}} {{the biggest}} bridge {{disasters}} in the United States, occurring on December 15, 1893 when a <b>construction</b> <b>crane</b> was dislodged by a severe wind, causing the falsework support of a truss to be damaged and the truss—with forty-one workers on it—to fall into the Ohio River. Twenty of the workers survived, but twenty-one died. The accident almost cost more lives, as a ferry crossing the Ohio River just barely missed being hit by the truss. Hours later, a span next to the damaged span also fell into the river, but was unoccupied at the time, causing no injuries. As a result, falsework was longitudely reinforced to prevent further occurrences, and also to prevent strong winds from causing similar damage by using special bracing on the bottom frame of the truss. Also, a new rule was enforced: [...] "never trust a bolted joint any longer than is necessary to put a riveted one in place".|$|E

40|$|The {{conveyance}} of payloads by <b>construction</b> <b>cranes</b> generates pendulations of the payload. This research {{provides a}} critical design parameter {{for the development}} of a device that aids in reduction of these pendulations. Previous research developed a tuned mass damping system, that effectively attenuated the energy of a pendulating payload. In order to be effective the internal damping rate of the tuned mass damper must be at least twice that of the system to be damped. Prototypes of a tuned mass damping system have achieved damping rates between 6 and 12 %, making cranes with damping rates below 3 % attractive. This research indicates that the internal damping rate of <b>construction</b> <b>cranes</b> is on the order of one percent, suggesting that a tuned mass damping system could be retrofitted to today's <b>construction</b> <b>cranes.</b> This thesis is an investigation of the internal damping rates of <b>construction</b> <b>cranes.</b> Three hydraulic and two lattice boom cranes were tested. The motion of pendulating payloadswas modeled after a simple pendulum. The internal damping rate was calculated using logarithmic decrement technique. Light to medium duty cranes were tested with loads similar to those used in duty cycle operations. Damping tests were performed both perpendicular and parallel to the mast of the crane. Values were calculated from dat...|$|R

In nearby Ballygar, two barns were destroyed, one of which had debris strewn over a wide area. Hurricane-force winds battered Tuam for several hours, leaving most buildings damaged. Nearly every structure in Connemara was damaged and many homes lost their roofs. At Cork Airport, windows at the control tower were blown out and a <b>construction</b> <b>crane</b> was knocked over. Residents in Loughrea dubbed Saturday, September 16, 1961 as [...] "The Day Of The Big Wind" [...] {{in light of the}} extensive damage. Damage in Roscommon was [...] "impossible to calculate," [...] as all power and communication around the town was lost. In Limerick, 15 people were injured. Across County Cavan, thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, leaving many towns temporarily cut off as roads were blocked and communications lost. Many structures sustained damage, which ranged from broken slate roofing to flattened barns. Most towns across the county were left without power and telephone service. Residents described the storm as [...] "the worst in living memory." ...|$|E
