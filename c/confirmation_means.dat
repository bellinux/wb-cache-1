40|$|Our study {{examines}} 281 federal court decisions from April 2001 - May 2006 that ruled on challenges to labor arbitration awards. These award appeals are {{regulated by the}} Supreme Court’s Enterprise Wheel decision. District courts confirmed 77. 6 % of challenged awards, an increase of about 7 percentage points compared to our earlier studies of litigated awards from 1960 - 2001. The result was very similar for appellate cases— a confirmation rate of 76. 3 %, and nearly the same gain in percentage points. These results clearly suggest that the Supreme Court’s rebuke of lower courts in Eastern Associated Coal Corp. (2000) and Garvey (2001) have changed how judges review arbitrator rulings. But this uniformly positive development masks observable differences in the federal circuits where these cases were decided. • The Sixth Circuit routinely applies a four part essence test. This standard seems more intrusive than the simple essence test in Enterprise Wheel. The four part essence test has become so controversial among these judges that they decided en banc in May 2006 to reconsider its use. Our data shed important new light on this development: The four part essence test yields outcomes {{that are similar to}} other Enterprise Wheel tests, but it stimulates an excessive amount of federal lawsuits. • On {{the opposite end of the}} award deference spectrum, courts in the Second Circuit enforce more than 90 % of challenged awards. This trend is so clear that virtually no one there appeals a district court’s enforcement ruling. Courts in the Seventh Circuit have a similar confirmation rate, arrived at by applying Rule 11 sanctions to award challenges that are judged to be meritless. • Data show that judges in the Fifth Circuit are in an isolationist camp. At the district and appellate levels in this study, these courts confirmed awards in only 44. 4 % of the cases. This is similar to findings in our earlier studies. A correction is needed for the Fifth Circuit’s long deviation from the deferential posture that the Supreme Court has commanded. These data might enable Fifth Circuit judges to see their problem and correct it by exercising more restraint. • We found that 16 appellate decisions confirmed awards that were vacated by district courts, while 5 awards were vacated by appellate courts after these arbitrator rulings were confirmed by lower courts. This 3 : 1 ratio favoring award <b>confirmation</b> <b>means</b> that new precedents are reinforcing Enterprise Wheel messages of deference to district judges. Overall, the empirical results are healthy indicators for the national policy that favors arbitration. The Supreme Court’s on-going investment in promoting judicial deference to awards is paying dividends not only for the institution of labor arbitration, but by implication, for newer ADR applications in individual employment, commercial transactions, environmental disputes and others...|$|E

We developed a video-based assessment of motor behaviour, the Infant Motor Profile (IMP), to evaluate motor abilities, movement variability, ability to select motor strategies, movement symmetry, and fluency. The IMP consists of 80 items and is applicable in children from 3 to 18 months. The present study aimed to test intra- and interobserver reliability and concurrent validity of the IMP with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Touwen neurological examination. The study group consisted of 40 low-risk term (median gestational age [GA] 40 wks, range 38 - 42 wks) and 40 high-risk preterm infants (median GA 29. 6 wks, range 26 - 33 wks) with corrected ages 4 to 18 months (31 females, 49 males). Intra- and interobserver agreement of the IMP were satisfactory (Spearman's rho= 0. 9). Concurrent validity of IMP and AIMS was good (Spearman's rho= 0. 8, p < 0. 005).

40|$|CONTEXT: Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a higher prevalence of celiac disease (CD) among females with Turner syndrome {{when compared to the}} general population. Nevertheless, there is no record in literature concerning this investigation among Brazilian patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of CD among a group of Brazilian patients with Turner syndrome. METHODS: Fifty-six females with Turner syndrome and on gluten-containing diet were screened for CD utilizing immunoglobulin A antiendomysium (IgA-EMA) and immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG) antibody assays. Additionally, they were genotyped for CD human leukocyte antigen (CD-HLA) predisposing alleles. Patients showing positivity in serological testing were offered to perform small intestine biopsy for histological <b>confirmation.</b> RESULTS: <b>Mean</b> age at diagnosis of Turner syndrome was 5. 5 ± 4. 4 years; mean age at screening for CD was 17. 0 ± 9. 3 years (from 10 months of age to 52 years). Two girls were positive for IgA-EMA and IgA-tTG, presented predisposing HLA-DQ 2 alleles and both had the diagnosis of CD confirmed by jejunal biopsy. CONCLUSION: The 3. 6 % prevalence of biopsy-proven CD among this group of females with Turner syndrome is 10 times higher than the one among females from the general population of the same geographical area.

We also calculated the amounts of energy stored and dissipated in each preparation. These calculations indicate that cells with intact basement membranes have complex moduli significantly greater than those of cells without basement membranes, and that cells with basement membrane store significantly more elastic energy than basement membrane depleted cells. However, when subjected to identical sinusoidal strains, energy dissipation in cells with intact basement membranes is over three times greater than dissipation in cells without basement membrane. The relative magnitudes of energy losses to energy storage, called the specific loss, is nearly three times greater for intact cells than for basement membrane depleted cells.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Epidemiologists manage {{outbreak}} {{identification and}} <b>confirmation</b> by <b>means</b> of a ``situation diagnosis'', which involves validating (or invalidating) an alarm (signal identified as abnormal) as an alert (a real, characterized outbreak) and proposing the first countermeasures. This work investigates how uncertainty is materialized during this stage, and how experts develop strategies {{to address this}} uncertainty {{with the help of}} an early warning system. Methods: We built an experiment using a simulation platform with a scenario involving both a natural and an intentional outbreak. Observations of expert activities were recorded and formalised using a specific task analysis method. These formatted data were then categorized by applying RAWFS (Reduction-Assumption Weighing -Forestalling-Suppression) heuristics. Results: We quantified uncertainty and the mechanisms involved. During the situation diagnosis, two sorts of uncertainty were characterized: practice-imposed uncertainty and situation-imposed uncertainty. We did not find either weighing pros and cons or suppression strategies in this area of expertise, but highlight the predominance of coping strategies that relied on reduction (66, 4 %) and assumption-based reasoning. We observed a predominance of the phone (89 %) to cope with uncertainty and among electronic tools, the surveillance system plays a major role (69 % of cases) and is mainly used in reduction strategies. We detail tools and systems used to support experts in their coping strategy. Conclusion: We confirmed that a surveillance system must include different features that provide relevant information to help users reduce uncertainty and thus support their decision making. In that perspective, the flow diagram and proposal presented in this study can help prioritize the necessary changes to surveillance system design...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic contribution of molecular {{analysis of the}} cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in patients suspected of having mild or atypical cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving adolescents and adults aged &# 8805; 14 years. Volunteers underwent clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation, as well as spirometry, sputum microbiology, liver ultrasound, sweat tests, and molecular analysis of the CFTR gene. We then divided the patients into three groups {{by the number of}} mutations identified (none, one, and two or more) and compared those groups in terms of their characteristics. RESULTS: We evaluated 37 patients with phenotypic findings of CF, with or without sweat test <b>confirmation.</b> The <b>mean</b> age of the patients was 32. 5 ± 13. 6 years, and females predominated (75. 7 %). The molecular analysis contributed to the definitive diagnosis of CF in 3 patients (8. 1 %), all of whom had at least two mutations. There were 7 patients (18. 9 %) with only one mutation and 26 patients (70. 3 %) with no mutations. None of the clinical characteristics evaluated was found {{to be associated with the}} genetic diagnosis. The most common mutation was p. F 508 del, which was found in 5 patients. The combination of p. V 232 D and p. F 508 del was found in 2 patients. Other mutations identified were p. A 559 T, p. D 1152 H, p. T 1057 A, p. I 148 T, p. V 754 M, p. P 1290 P, p. R 1066 H, and p. T 351 S. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular analysis of the CFTR gene coding region showed a limited contribution to the diagnostic investigation of patients suspected of having mild or atypical CF. In addition, there were no associations between the clinical characteristics and the genetic diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The stratigraphic {{significance}} of Cambrian and Ordovician acritarchs in Belgium and adjacent areas is discussed. It now {{appears that the}} age of the Deville group in the Ardenne (more precisely the upper part of this group) should be broadened to include not only the middle and late Lower Cambrian, but also the early Middle Cambrian. The Revin group comprises several well dated levels between the middle late Middle Cambrian to the latest Upper Cambrian. The lower part of the Salm Group (the so-called Sm 1) comprises strata of early and late Tremadoc age. The age of the uppermost part of the Salm group (Sm 3 b) lies between the Llanvirn and the early Caradoc. Within the Brabant Massif, recent investigations of several boreholes have enabled the relative ages of the Oisquercq and the Mousty «assises» to be reconsidered, and the problem of their synchronism or diachronism to be addressed. If the fossiliferous samples prove to belong to these «assises», acritarchs would indicate a Lower or early Middle Cambrian age for the Oisquercq (comparable to {{the age of the}} Deville group) and an approximately Middle to Late Cambrian age for the Mousty (comparable to that of the Revin group). Comparison of the different areas studied shows a probable synchronism of the Deville-Revin boundary, the later possibly coincident with that between the Oisquercq and Mousty; a likely unconformity in the Revin group of the Rocroi Massif; sedimentary variations in the Cambrian (Mousty lacking in some places) and the Ordovician (Tribotte facies restricted to the Dyle area) of the Brabant Massif comparable with block faulting phenomena; existence of? eustatic late Tremadoc regression and contemporaneous unconformities; a possible <b>confirmation,</b> by <b>means</b> of bathymetric criteria, of a subdivision of Lower Palaeozoic strata into 3 megasequences, and a correlation of this cyclicity with that observed in southern Great Britain...|$|R
