40|$|Cartographic {{generalization}} {{has been}} a research topic for more than thirty years. In spite of recent advances, a complete automation of this process still faces fundamental problems. Furthermore, recent needs such as web mapping and Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) require geospatial data that are generated on-the-fly at any scale. This requires processing times and a degree of automation that today's automatic generalization algorithms cannot reach with all data types. This paper presents the concept of geometric patterns and explains {{how they can be}} built and stored in a pattern database for further use in a map generalization process. Geometric patterns are typical shapes that are representative of several occurrences of a <b>cartographic</b> <b>object</b> class.

40|$|It is {{essential}} to label roads, landmarks, and other important features on maps for mobile applications to help users to understand their location and the environment. This paper aims to examine real-time map labelling methods suitable for the small screen on mobile devices. A slider method with a continuous search space was proposed to sequentially label both line and point features. The method starts with defining a range box for possible locations of the label. Then a search is performed, and the range box is reduced, {{if there are any}} cartographic objects that overlap the range box. Finally, the label is placed, at the best possible position in the reduced range box according to normal cartographic preferences, where it does not obscure any <b>cartographic</b> <b>object.</b> We implemented this method in a Java environment using the open source library JTS Topology Suite. A case study showed sound cartographic results of the labelling and acceptable computational efficiency. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of cartographic generalisation is to simplify geographic data {{in order to}} create legible maps when scale decreases. It often requires to reason at different levels of abstraction (e. g. a building, a city). To automate this process, Multi-Agent approaches have been used since several years, by modelling map objects (e. g. buildings) as autonomous entities trying to solve constraints through appropriate transformations. Yet, those approaches are not able to deal with all situations that appear between <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects</b> in a map. Indeed, though a map intrinsically involves objects that belong to several description, scale or organisation levels, there is no explicit multi-level representation in agent-based cartographic models. Thus we assume that the use of a multi-level multi-agent model would improve the automated generalisation process. Especially, the PADAWAN model is a multi-agent model offering multi-level capabilities which match quite well the requirements for the multi-level organisation of <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects.</b> In this paper, we expose how we use this model on the one hand, to reify multi-level relations between cartographic agents, and on the other hand, to represent the constraints and the actions proposed to solve them, as interactions between the agents...|$|R

40|$|At {{present a}} lot of methods and {{programs}} for automatic text recognition exist. However there are no effective text recognition systems for graphic documents. Graphic documents usually contain a great variety of textual information. As a rule the text appears in arbitrary spatial positions, in different fonts, sizes and colors. The text can touch and overlap graphic symbols. The text meaning is semantically much more ambiguous in comparison with standard text. To recognize a text of graphical documents, it is necessary first to separate it from linear objects, solids, and symbols and to define its orientation. Even so, the recognition programs nearly always produce errors. In the context of raster-to-vector conversion of graphical documents, the problem of text recognition is of special interest, because textual information can be used for verification of vectorization results (post-processing). In this work, we propose a method that combines OCRbased text recognition in raster-scanned maps with heuristics specially adapted for cartographic data to resolve the recognition ambiguities using, among other information sources, the spatial object relationships.

The tests differ {{in the type of}} regions (sub-urban versus rural) and in the panchromatic image resolution (5 m versus 2, 5 m).

The resulting shapes were analyzed and compared with the current database. Two methods were used for this comparison. It appears that the visibility is highly dependent on the experience of the photo-interpreter. The expert reaches a rate of approximately 85 % of road detection in all regions, more than 85 % of the built-up area in the sub-urban regions, and approximately 75 % in the rural ones.

40|$|A {{nautical}} chart {{is a kind}} of map used to describe the seafloor morphology and shoreline of adjacent lands. One of its main purposes is to guarantee safety of navigation. As a consequence, the construction of a {{nautical chart}} follows very specific rules. The cartographer has to select and highlight undersea features according to their relevance to navigation. In an automated process, the system must be able to identify and classify these features from the terrain model. This paper aims therefore to define ontologies of the submarine relief and nautical chart that will be at the root of a model-oriented generalization process. To the best of our knowledge, no ontology has been defined to formalize the geographical and <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects</b> for nautical chart representation. Thus, a bottom-up approach was developed to extract and model knowledge derived from standards established by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and cartographers’ expertise. The submarine relief ontology formalizes undersea features describing the submarine relief. Four concepts (composition, morphometric class, shape value and depth value) are introduced to describe properties and relationships between undersea features. The cartographic representation ontology of nautical charts will define several concepts (chart, features, isobathymetric lines and soundings) for the representation of undersea features on the chart.

40|$|Nowadays <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects</b> of {{different}} resolutions are hold in different coexisting databases.

One way to reduce this {{is to build a}} multi-resolution database which holds and links different representations of the real-world objects and allows to automatically pass updates to all linked representations (requiring algorithms for propagation of updates). In order to ensure the autonomy of applications on the local databases, we propose the architecture of a federated database for such a multi-resolution database. A main requirement for setting up a multi-resolution database is to "identify " the different representations of real-world objects. Therefore we propose a multistage procedure as follows:- Semantic classification: Identify the sets of objects to compare with one another- Compute geometrically possible matchings within these classes- Postprocessing: Automatically select correct matchings from the set of possible matchings by applying prepared rules- Manual select correct matchings for the remaining possible matchings, which were not automatically detected as correct or incorrect We present a framework for the needed semantic classification, a concept for rule-based selection as well as an algorithm to compute possible matchings.

Methods for assessing the quality of systems for communicating digital geographical information are frequently described in the literature, but few methods have been empirically evaluated. The quality of cartographic products is especially important for resources management and environmental planning, although it may be important in all application areas where spatial information is used. When designing digital communicative systems, it is crucially important to base system development on empirical interactions with potential users. In this thesis, empirical methods were used to develop a geographic information system (GIS) for environmental research and monitoring in the Arctic – the Abisko GIS.

This allowed the qualities of alternative cartographic solutions to be evaluated and the optimal combination of <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects</b> to be implemented in Abisko GIS.

This paper starts with a description of the most challenging specific requirements of an application schema and produc-tion system supporting the production of ENC cells and printed charts from one common database. The paper outlines possibilities to expand the S- 57 object catalogue by adding cartographic features and attributes which would enable presentation of the data according to the presentation requirements of printed charts.

40|$|On coastal areas, recent {{increase}} in production of open-access high-quality data over large areas reflects high interests in modeling and geovisualization, especially for applications of sea level rise prediction, ship traffic security and ecological protection. Research interests are due to tricky challenges from the intrinsic nature of the coastal area, which is composed of complex geographical objects of which spatial extents vary in time, especially in the intertidal zone (tides, sands, etc.). Another interest is the complex modeling of this area based on imprecise <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects</b> (coastline, highest/lowest water level, etc.). The challenge of visualizing such specific area comes thus from 3 D+t information, i. e. spatio-temporal data, and their visual integration. In this paper, we present a methodology for geovisualization issues over coastal areas. The first challenge consists in integrating multi-source heterogeneous data, i. e. raster and vector, terrestrial and hydrographic data often coming from various ‘paradigms’, while providing a homogeneous geovisualization of the coastal area {{and in particular the}} phenomenon of the water depth. The second challenge consists in finding various possibilities to geovisualize this dynamic geographical phenomenon in controlling the level of photorealism in hybrid visualizations. Our approach is based on the use of a high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) coming from high resolution LiDAR data point cloud, tidal and topographic data.

Following this line of research, the recent availability of Ikonos images at 1 meter's resolution leads researchers to put forward and experiment procedures to extract cartographic features in order to update Gis.

Prominent applications are location based services in general, and car and pedestrian navigation in particular. In {{order to be able to}} offer both detail and overview of a spatial situation, the devices have to provide flexible zooming in and out in real-time. The presentation of spatial data sets in different zoom levels or resolutions is usually achieved using generalization operations. When larger scale steps have to be overcome, the shape of individual objects typically changes dramatically, also objects may disappear or merge with others to form new objects. As theses steps typically are discrete in nature, this leads to “popping effects ” when going from one level of detail to the other. In this paper, we will describe an approach to decompose generalization methods into elementary operations that can then be implemented in a continuous way. For example in the case of displacement, an object will not simply jump from one position to the other, but slowly shifted from its original position to the new one. In the case of simplification of building ground plans, the elementary operations e. g. care for removing extrusions or intrusions of buildings, as well as offsets. In the paper we will identify elementary generalization operations and also present their implementation as a continuous operations. We will apply these concepts for line generalization, the generalization of building ground plans and for displacement. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{pictorial}} {{style is}} {{considered as a}} transfer function between the properties of a scene and the attributes of the representation (Willats & Durand 2003). We consider that a style is thus the rendering parametrization for a specific purpose. In the context of cartography, assigning visual variables to <b>cartographic</b> <b>objects</b> is also a parametrization of the final rendering, the map. Topography has been (carto) graphically depicted in many ways through centuries. Therefore a topographic style is mainly considered as something more complex integrating both depicted and experienced geographical space and related cartographic practices (See Kent & Vujakovic 2009, Christophe 2012, amongst others). Having analyzed contemporary topographic styles (Ory et al. 2013), we have focused on a particular old one, whom design choices have not been clearly specified {{because they were not}} the purpose of these maps: the maps of the Cassini family. Those maps are well-known, very attractive for general public and very useful for historical purposes. Our issue is the following: is it possible to consider representative visual characteristics of Cassini maps, that could be reproduced automatically in order to make Cassini-like maps and thus being able to manage a Cassini style? And while acquiring knowledge about Cassini maps rendering, are we able to acquire knowledge about the cartographic practices, the perception and experience of space at the time? Our approach is based on a cartographic study of Cassini maps, to identify representative visual characteristics that could be reproduced and reused on cartographical data: this preliminary work provides cartographic knowledge about Cassini choices of representation difficult to compile. A challenging aspect is to manage the imprecision on the Cassini renderings due to artistic choices or to geographical phenomenon more ‚experienced‘, than real (e. g. relief). Based on this study, our proposition is a combination of extensions of the OGC Styled Layer Descriptor and Symbology Encoding norms, as new classes of styles related to sophisticated rendering methods to expressively render geodata in a Cassini style. This research work highlights first how combining knowledge about style and stylization from GIsciences and Computer Graphics is an opportunity to improve tools for map design.

The focus however {{is not on}} traditional paper maps, but on screen maps that are automatically generated from a geographical database. Object oriented modelling is used to design screen maps that are equipped with methods that automatically extracts information from a geographical database, generalises the information and displays it on a screen. The thesis consists of three parts: a theoretical background, an object oriented model that incorporates automatic generalisation of geographic information and a case study where parts of the model have been implemented. An object oriented model is an abstraction of reality for a certain purpose. The theoretical background describes different aspects that have impact on how an object oriented model shall be designed for automatic generalisation. The following topics are described: category theory, the human ability to recognise visual patterns, previous work in automatic <b>cartographic</b> generalisation, and <b>object</b> oriented modelling. A view is here defined to consist of several static levels, or maps, defined at different resolutions. As the user zooms the level that is appropriate for the particular resolution is shown. An object class belongs to one and only one level and has a certain symbolisation. The automatic creation of new objects in a level is discussed {{as well as the}} relation between objects in different levels. To preserve topological relations between objects in a level a network structure is formed between all linear objects in a level and objects that might cause conflicts are modelled using dependencies. The model is designed for a set of typical geographical object classes such as road, railroad, lake, river, stream, building, built-up area etc. The model is designed to handle information in a scale-range from 1 : 10 000 to 1 : 100 000. The model has been implemented for a subset of these classes and tested for an area covering approximatley 60 km 2. NR 20140805 </p...|$|R
