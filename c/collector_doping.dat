For PD B a larger field is induced in the absorber layer at high photocurrent levels. Also the higher n-doping in the collector layer is adequate for providing charge compensation. For PD B, there is an enhancement in the RF response as the photocurrent level is increased. At a frequency of 1 GHz, the saturation current for PD A is around 65 mA and that for PD B is around 63 mA.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted towards the {{development}} and analysis of high-frequency, high-voltage silicon devices. A systematic study of physics, technology and device performance has been presented with extensive numerical results of both Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) and lateral MOSFETs. In the case of BJTs, the potential of bipolar devices for high-voltage high-frequency applications has been explored. The Kirk effect and the physical limit of BV_c_e_o*f_T are discussed in detail. For the first time, the equivalent critical electric field for open-base breakdown voltage has been obtained based on numerical simulations. This leads to the re-evaluation of the traditional Johnson limit. It is also demonstrated that the Kirk effect can be significantly suppressed by incorporating the Reduced Surface Field (Resurf) effect and a gradually <b>doped</b> <b>collector</b> region in the lateral bipolar transistors (LBTs) on thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI). A new technique is proposed to achieve the gradual doping profile. The proposed 40 -V Resurfed SOI LBT has a cut-off frequency of 8. 75 GHz, in comparison to 2. 6 GHz for the conventional non-Resurfed device. This corresponds to a record BV_C_E_O*f_T, compared to either experiment or simulation results in the literature. For the RF lateral power MOSFETs, an insight into the device performance is presented using the results by both traditional theory for the MOSFET and 2 -D numerical simulations. For the first time, it is identified that the intrinsic MOSFET is the dominant component in the RF LDMOSFET, which ensures the saturation property in forward I-V characteristics. Detailed results are presented on the transconductance performance of the device. It is clarified that the fall-off of transconductance of a RF LDMOSFET is caused jointly by the high resistance of this region and the reduction in channel resistance at a high gate voltage. Because of these two factors, most of the potential is dropped across the drift region at a high gate bias. As a result, the intrinsic MOSFET is forced into its linear region of operation, which results in a fall-off of the transconductance. To increase the range of gate voltages for a constant transconductance, higher drift doping concentration is preferred. This {{can be achieved by}} incorporating a grounded field plate without causing degradation of breakdown voltage. Extensive results are presented to analyse the influence of drift design, field plate, epi-layer doping and thickness, channel length, gate oxide and the main thermal process steps on the device performance. For the first time, a relationship is established between the device performance and the process and structural parameters. To achieve higher output power, structures and performance of a 48 -V RF LDMOSFET are presented. Effort is devoted to reducing the resistance of p"+ sinker and maintaining good process compatibility with 26 -V devices. Since the breakdown voltage can be increased by optimising the drift and epi-layer design, higher power can be delivered without increasing the input capacitance and feedback capacitance.

40|$|With {{a crystal}} {{orientation}} {{dependent on the}} etch rate of Si in KOH-based solution, a base-emitter self-aligned large-area multi-linger configuration power SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) device (with an emitter area of about 880 mu m(2)) is fabricated with 2 mu m double-mesa technology. The maximum dc current gain is 226. 1. The collector-emitter junction breakdown voltage BVCEO is 10 V and the collector-base junction breakdown voltage BVCBO is 16 V with <b>collector</b> <b>doping</b> concentration of 1 x 10 (17) cm(- 3) and thickness of 400 nm. The device exhibited a maximum oscillation frequency f(max) of 35. 5 GHz and a cut-off frequency f(T) of 24. 9 GHz at a dc bias point of I-C = 70 mA and the voltage between collector and emitter is V-CE = 3 V. Load pull measurements in class-A operation of the SiGe HBT are performed at 1. 9 GHz with input power ranging from 0 dBm to 21 dBm. A {{maximum output power of}} 29. 9 dBm (about 977 mW) is obtained at an input power of 18. 5 dBm with a gain of 11. 47 dB. Compared to a non-self-aligned SiGe HBT with the same heterostructure and process, f(max) and f(T) are improved by about 83. 9 % and 38. 3 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The first {{prototype}} of a self-adjusting Si/SiGe heterobipolar transistor (HBT) suited for integrated circuits was developed {{within the framework}} of this joint project. The HBT is characterized by implanted contacts and by an exalted spacer oxide on the emitter mesa edges. Guides are connected by means of a well-planarizing auxiliary polyimide layer. The entire chip is covered with passivating SiO_ 2. Two-layer metallization can be applied due to low-stepped individual sections. The relatively great base-collector capacity at the present stage of development is due to the existing simple mask technique as well as to preliminary base contacting in an additional contact zone. The low <b>collector</b> <b>doping</b> of 3 x 10 " 1 " 6 /cm" 3 which is selected for integrated circuits reduces the critical frequency of the individual transistor and adds to problems which result from e. g. line and valence band offsets. The maximum HBT transit frequency has been amounting to 40 GHz. Sputtered WSi_ 2 films on SiO_ 2 are used for implementation of integrated-circuit resistances. After circuit simulations of a multiplexer IC, an MUX layout was developed, and the first process steps were made. (orig.)
