Generally, {{the mature}} fields {{have a good}} portion of the {{remaining}} reserves still trapped due to inefficient drainage, pressure decline, inerease in water <b>cut,</b> <b>sand</b> production and aging of the existing system. This paper addresses a methodology applied on the historical produetion behavior to identify techniques and initiatives to optimize the recovery factor based on redevelopment plans in a mature field. For Laslau Mare field in particular, there have been identified and implemented opportunities such as: infill drilling, work over optimization, dynamie underbalance perforation (DUP), acidizing, kick off with N 2, propellant stimulation, snubbing, soaping, sand management, Wavefront Technology stimulation and wellhead and/or group compressor installation.

50|$|Rustication of {{a wooden}} {{exterior}} consists of three basic steps. First, the wood is <b>cut,</b> <b>sanded</b> and prepared with beveled grooves that make each plank appear {{as if it were}} a series of stone blocks. Second, the wood is painted with a thick coat of paint. Third, while the paint is still wet, sand is thrown or air blasted onto the planks until no more sand will stick. After the paint dries the plank is ready for use.|$|R

The artist selects, <b>cuts,</b> <b>sands</b> and polishes each shell before painstakingly hand assembling {{each of them}} into dynamic patterns. [...] Mersh associates the process of assembling the shells to drawing. He respects the natural shape of the material - the curvature of each shells informs {{the position of the}} following one and the construction process ends in self-informed brush strokes.|$|R

50|$|For {{the paper}} strips method, {{the paper is}} cut or torn into strips, and soaked in the paste until {{saturated}}. The saturated pieces are then placed onto the surface and allowed to dry slowly. The strips may be placed on an armature, or skeleton, often of wire mesh over a structural frame, or they can be placed on an object to create a cast. Oil or grease {{can be used as}} a release agent if needed. Once dried, the resulting material can be <b>cut,</b> <b>sanded</b> and/or painted, and waterproofed by painting with a suitable water-repelling paint. Before painting any product of papier-mâché, the glue must be fully dried, otherwise mold will form and the product will rot from the inside out.|$|R

50|$|Channelization of {{a stream}} may be {{undertaken}} for several reasons. One {{is to make a}} stream more suitable for navigation or for navigation by larger vessels with deep draughts. Another is to restrict water to a certain area {{of a stream}}'s natural bottom lands so that the bulk of such lands can be made available for agriculture. A third reason is flood control, with the idea of giving a stream a sufficiently large and deep channel so that flooding beyond those limits will be minimal or nonexistent, at least on a routine basis. One major reason is to reduce natural erosion; as a natural waterway curves back and forth, it usually deposits sand and gravel {{on the inside of the}} corners where the water flows slowly, and <b>cuts</b> <b>sand,</b> gravel, subsoil, and precious topsoil from the outside corners where it flows rapidly due to a change in direction. Unlike sand and gravel, the topsoil that is eroded does not get deposited on the inside of the next corner of the river. It simply washes away.|$|R

40|$|In South Central <b>Cut</b> Bank <b>Sand</b> Unit (SCCBSU) of Cut Bank field, primary {{production}} and waterflood projects {{have resulted in}} recovery of only 29 % of the original oil in place from heterogeneous, fluvial sandstone deposits. Using highresolution sequence stratigraphy and geostatistical analysis, I developed a geologic model that may improve the ultimate recovery of oil from this field. In this study, I assessed sequence stratigraphic concepts for continental settings and extended the techniques to analyze low-accommodation alluvial systems of the Cut Bank and Sunburst members of the lower Kootenai formation (Cretaceous) in Cut Bank field. Identification and delineation of five sequences and their bounding surfaces led {{to a better understanding}} of the reservoir distribution and variability. Recognition of stacking patterns allowed for the prediction of reservoir rock quality. Within each systems tract, the best quality reservoir rocks are strongly concentrated in the lowstand systems tract. Erosional events associated with falling baselevel resulted in stacked, communicated (multistory) reservoirs. The lowermost Cut Bank sandstone has the highest reservoir quality and is a braided stream parasequence. Average net-to-gross ratio value (0. 6) is greater than in other reservoir intervals. Little additional stratigraphically untapped oil is expected in the lowermost Cut Bank sandstone. Over most of the SCCBSU, the Sunburst and the upper Cut Bank strata are valley-fill complexes with interfluves that may laterally compartmentalize reservoir sands. Basal Sunburst sand (Sunburst 1, average net-to-gross ratio ~ 0. 3) has better reservoir quality than other Sunburst or upper <b>Cut</b> Bank <b>sands,</b> but its reservoir quality is significantly less than that of lower <b>Cut</b> Bank <b>sand.</b> Geostatistical analysis provided equiprobable representations of the heterogeneity of reservoirs. Simulated reservoir geometries resulted in an improved description of reservoir distribution and connectivity, as well as occurrences of flow barriers. The models resulting from this study can be used to improve reservoir management and well placement and to predict reservoir performance in Cut Bank field. The technical approaches and tools from this study can be used to improve descriptions of other oil and gas reservoirs in similar depositional systems...|$|R

Surftech boards are now manufactured in Thailand and shipped throughout the world. As of 2015, Surftech is owned by Triple D, a Thailand-based investment company.|$|R

Once the piece was perfectly <b>cut</b> and <b>sanded,</b> an artisan covered the wood with several layers of gesso with glue. Each layer was highly polished to achieve a perfectly smooth finish. Next, color was applied in various transparent layers, allowing an optical mix of overlapping colors. This began with the colors of shadows (blue, green, ocher), then light colors were applied (white, pink, yellow). and finally highlight colors were added (orange and red to cheeks, knees, and elbows of children; and dark blue, green, and violet for wounds and bruises of Christ or for stubble on a beardless figure).|$|R

5000|$|The Israeli FAL {{first saw}} action in {{relatively}} small quantities during the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Six-Day War in June 1967, the War of Attrition of 1967 until 1970, {{it was the}} standard Israeli rifle. During the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 {{it was still in}} front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon. Israeli forces were primarily mechanized in nature; the long, heavy FAL slowed deployment drills, and proved exceedingly difficult to maneuver within the confines of a vehicle. [...] Additionally, Israeli forces experienced repeated jamming of the FAL due to heavy sand and dust ingress endemic to Middle Eastern desert warfare, requiring repeated field-stripping and cleaning of the rifle, sometimes while under fire. During the later stages of the Yom Kippur War, it was noted that some Israeli soldiers had informally exchanged their FALs for the far more reliable Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifles taken from dead and captured Arab soldiers. Though the IDF evaluated a few modified FAL rifles with 'sand clearance' slots in the bolt carrier and receiver (which were already part of the Commonwealth L1A1/C1A1 design), malfunction rates did not significantly improve. It {{should be noted that the}} <b>sand</b> <b>cuts</b> for the Israeli FAL models were inferior to the effective Commonwealth L1A1 <b>sand</b> <b>cuts.</b> [...] The Israeli FAL was eventually replaced by the M16 and the Galil (a weapon using the Soviet Kalashnikov operating system, and chambered in either 5.56×45 or 7.62 NATO), though the FAL remained in production in Israel until the 1980s.|$|R
