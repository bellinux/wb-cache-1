5000|$|Chemical tankers {{often have}} a system for tank heating in order to {{maintain}} the viscosity of certain cargoes, typically by passing pressurized steam through stainless steel 'heating coils' in the cargo tanks, transferring heat into the cargo which circulates in the tank by convection. All modern chemical tankers feature double hull construction and most have one hydraulically driven, submerged cargo pump for each tank with independent piping, which means that each tank can load a separate cargo without any mixing. Consequently, many oceangoing chemical tankers may carry numerous different grades of cargo on the same voyage, often loading and discharging these [...] "parcels" [...] at different ports or terminals. This means that the scheduling, stowage planning and operation of such ships requires a high level of coordination and specialist knowledge, both at sea and on shore. Tank cleaning after discharging cargo is a very important aspect of chemical tanker operations, because tanks which are not properly cleaned of all <b>cargo</b> <b>residue</b> can adversely affect the purity of the next cargo loaded. Before tanks are cleaned, they must be properly ventilated and checked to be free of potentially explosive gases. Chemical tankers usually have transverse stiffeners on deck rather than inside the cargo tanks, in order to make the tank walls smooth and thus easier to clean using permanently fitted tank cleaning machines.|$|E
25|$|Discharge of <b>cargo</b> <b>residues</b> from bulk {{carriers}} can pollute ports, waterways, and oceans. In many instances vessels intentionally discharge illegal wastes despite {{foreign and domestic}} regulation prohibiting such actions. It {{has been estimated that}} container ships lose over 10,000 containers at sea each year (usually during storms). Ships also create noise pollution that disturbs natural wildlife, and water from ballast tanks can spread harmful algae and other invasive species.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Waste {{management}} plans usually address {{all types of}} ship-generated waste and <b>cargo</b> <b>residues</b> originating from ships calling at ports. Well developed waste management plan is a serious step towards reduction of {{the environmental impact of}} ship-generated waste. Such important {{and at the same time}} complex considerations can be supported by application of modern mathematical theories. Evaluation of waste {{management plans}} based on application of grey theory is presented in this work. Keywords—Waste management, grey theory, assessments I...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the charging systems for the use of port reception facilities for waste oil, and to examine the potential impact of the charging elements of the new (late 2000) EU Directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and <b>cargo</b> <b>residues.</b> Experience to date with alternative models for charging is considered. Conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the EU Directive as a means of controlling pollution in the North Sea and producing a `level playing field' between ports...|$|R
50|$|The Port of Montreal is a {{founding}} member of Green Marine, a voluntary environmental program for the maritime industry in Canada and the United States. Green Marine addresses environmental issues such as greenhouse gases, <b>cargo</b> <b>residues,</b> conflict of use (noise, dust, odours, luminous pollution), water and soil pollution prevention, and environmental leadership. In Green Marine’s most recent progress report, on a scale of 1 to 5, where Level 5 corresponds to the highest performance rating possible, the Port of Montreal scored Level 4 for its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and Level 5 for its efforts to reduce conflict of use and for its environmental leadership.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the new (summer 2000) EU Directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and <b>cargo</b> <b>residues.</b> Five key elements of this Directive are considered with respect both to their potential effectiveness relative to existing practices, and to suggested weaknesses. The elements are: the mandatory provision of reception facilities in all ports; the mandatory use of such facilities by all ships; notification requirements on all ships; a mandatory common charging system; and compliance provisions. On the basis of this analysis, conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the new EU Directive as an instrument for preventing marine pollution. Additional recommendations are made in light of weaknesses that are identified...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{pollution}} from ocean-going ships {{is an international}} issue regulated by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes. Recent changes to MARPOL Annex V (garbage from ships) include management of <b>cargo</b> <b>residues</b> of solid bulk cargoes and as a result, coal is currently being considered as an Environmentally Hazardous Substance (EHS) by the IMO. In this study, EHS testing was undertaken on 56 Australian coal types using protocols contained in the United Nations Globally Harmonised System for Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN GHS Annex 10 in [1]). The major and minor trace elements of concern found in coal that could potentially be leached into seawater and impact upon marine environments included As, B, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Se, Ni, Mo, V and Zn. Results from the EHS tests were compared to the Queensland Water Quality Guidelines which indicated that leached trace elements from the tested coal types pose negligible or no threat to marine systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the need for the new (summer 2000) EU Directive on Port Reception Facilities for Ship-Generated Waste and <b>Cargo</b> <b>Residues.</b> A core issue is the extent to which the new Directive duplicates provisions already in place (the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, and the Bonn Agreement) through which all EU member states make available port reception facilities for the disposal of all types of waste from ships in ports, and undertake inspection and monitoring. This includes provision of facilities for timely reception of residues and oily wastes at oil loading terminals, repair ports and other ports in which there is demand; a system of port inspections; and a system of wider monitoring and surveillance. The paper accordingly presents an analysis and critical evaluation of the provisions of the new Directive in comparison with what is already in place under existing agreements. Conclusions are drawn about the extent to which the new Directive duplicates existing provisions, and the extent to which it represents a progressive departure from what is currently there...|$|R
40|$|Kinesin- 1 {{transports}} various cargos {{along the}} axon by {{interacting with the}} cargos through its light chain subunit. Kinesin light chains (KLC) utilize its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain to interact with over 10 different cargos. Despite a high sequence identity between their TPR domains (87 %), KLC 1 and KLC 2 isoforms exhibit differential binding properties towards some cargos. We determined the structures of human KLC 1 and KLC 2 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains using X-ray crystallography and investigated the different mechanisms by which KLCs interact with their cargos. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we attributed the specific interaction between KLC 1 and JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP 1) <b>cargo</b> to <b>residue</b> N 343 in the fourth TRP repeat. Structurally, the N 343 residue is adjacent to other asparagines and lysines, creating a positively charged polar patch within the groove of the TPR domain. Whereas, KLC 2 with the corresponding residue S 328 did not interact with JIP 1. Based on these finding, we propose that N 343 of KLC 1 can form "a carboxylate clamp" with its neighboring asparagine to interact with JIP 1, {{similar to that of}} HSP 70 /HSP 90 organizing protein- 1 's (HOP 1) interaction with heat shock proteins. For the binding of cargos shared by KLC 1 and KLC 2, we propose a different site located within the groove but not involving N 343. We further propose a third binding site on KLC 1 which involves a stretch of polar residues along the inter-TPR loops that may form a network of hydrogen bonds to JIP 3 and JIP 4. Together, these results provide structural insights into possible mechanisms of interaction between KLC TPR domains and various cargo proteins...|$|R
40|$|Delivering {{apoptosis}} inducing peptides to {{cells is}} an emerging area in cancer and molecular therapeutics. Here, {{we have identified}} an alternative mechanism of action for the proapoptotic chimeric peptide D-NuBCP- 9 -r 8. Integral to D-NuBCP- 9 -r 8 is the Nur- 77 -derived D-isoform sequence fsrslhsll that targets Bcl- 2, and the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) octaarginine (r 8) that is required for intracellular delivery. We find that the N-terminal phenylalanine of fsrslhsll acts in synergy with the cell-penetrating moiety to enhance peptide uptake at low nontoxic levels and cause rapid membrane blebbing and cell necrosis at higher (IC 50) concentrations. These effects were not observed when a single phenylalanine–alanine mutation was introduced at the N-terminus of D-NuBCP- 9 -r 8. Using primary samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and cancer cell lines, we show that NuBCP- 9 -r 8 induced toxicity, via membrane disruption, is independent of Bcl- 2 expression. Overall, this study demonstrates a new mechanism of action for this peptide and cautions its use as a highly specific entity for targeting Bcl- 2. For delivery of therapeutic peptides the work emphasizes that key amino acids in <b>cargo,</b> located several <b>residues</b> away from the cell-penetrating sequence, can significantly influence their cellular uptake and mode of action...|$|R
