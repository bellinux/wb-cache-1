50|$|A tangent {{galvanometer}} {{consists of}} a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a <b>circular</b> <b>scale.</b> It {{consists of a}} tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at {{the centre of the}} coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0° to 90°. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax, a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.|$|E

50|$|However, in 1906, {{indirect}} fire goniometric sights were adopted; these consisted of an alidade {{mounted on a}} <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> graduated in degrees that was mounted on the shield. In 1910, the Number 3 Dial Sight, a refined version with a telescope and compass, replaced the goniometer. The rocking bar and telescope were retained for direct fire, as was the range scale on the right {{in spite of a}} clinometer being part of the Dial Sight mount.|$|E
50|$|This is a scale insect, a tiny insect {{which is}} most easily {{identified}} by the female, which attaches itself to a host plant, loses its legs, and remains stationary covered by a somewhat rounded scale-like shield of wax. In this species, the female forms a flat, <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> which is white, brown, or yellow in color. It is up to 2.6 millimeters long.

50|$|Cells {{belonging}} to the genera Aplanochytrium have an average length of 2.4-5 γm. The cell wall surrounding each cell is c formed by multiple layers of <b>circular</b> <b>scales</b> mostly composed of fructose, similar to the Labyrinthula.

50|$|Measuring {{the angle}} around {{the face of}} the display {{revealed}} the difference in the signal's time of arrival compared to that of the direct signal, as an elapsed time. There are an infinite number of locations that correspond to any measured time difference, and when plotted, they produce an ellipse with the CH station at one foci and the KH receiver at the other. Each set of ten numbers on the <b>circular</b> <b>scale,</b> say 100 to 110, was assigned to a pre-calculated ellipse, in this case ellipse 10.

50|$|In 1851 Gilbert {{patented}} {{actions for}} {{horizontal and vertical}} pianos where escapement was operated by a lower extension of the hammer butt instead of by a fixed button {{in order to reduce}} the number of parts to allow a lighter touch, and with an additional projection to limit the motion of the jack to improve repetition. They granted their New York and general agencies to Horace Waters the same year, and Waters advertised their iron frame squares with the <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> as well as upright grands and boudoir pianos. Gilbert & Co. received honorable mention for a square piano with the Aeolian attachment at the 1851 London Exhibition, a silver medal for the second best piano at the 1851 American Institute fair, a diploma for an aelioan attachment at the 1852 American Institute fair and a bronze medal for the third best square at the 1853 Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{complete}} description of this theodolite in the final report of the Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790). The instrument was large, 36 inches (914 mm) across and it was normally mounted on a stand which placed the sighting telescope between 5 and 6 ft. high. It weighed about 200 lb (90 kg) and the accessories and cases weighed as much again. It travelled around Britain for over sixty years, in its own sprung carriage, to locations where it was hauled up mountains, church towers and even scaffolded steeples. The horizontal <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> was divided very accurately with divisions at 15 minute (of arc) intervals using one of Ramden's own dividing engines; the marks on the 36 inch diameter scale would be about 1/6 inch (4 mm) apart. The position of the telescope could therefore be read to the nearest quarter of a degree by eye but the exact position between the divisions was read {{with the aid of}} micrometer microscopes fitted with adjustable cross wires in the focal plane, as shown. The threads of the screws were such that fifteen full turns moved from one scale mark to the next, i.e. 15 minutes, and since the scale on the adjusting knob allowed one sixtieth of a turn to be measured the resulting accuracy was within one arc second.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{development}} and implementation of computerised control of measurements and the simulation and calculation of measurement of raster scales and transducers are discussed. The number of strokes in <b>circular</b> raster <b>scales</b> exceeds hundreds or thousands, so it is impossible to calibrate the scales and calculate the results using conventional methods without computer interaction. An example of the new approach to computer simulation of the <b>circular</b> <b>scales</b> calibration process with the reference measure is given, creating the model of measurement and simulating the instrumental steps performed on the object, the comparison with reference measure and the evaluation of systematic error, uncertainty, numerical and graphical presentation of the results...|$|R

50|$|Working: In {{order to}} {{understand}} the need of a half-shade device, let us suppose that half-shade device is not present. The position of the analyzer is so adjusted that the field of view is dark when tube is empty. The position of the analyzer is noted on <b>circular</b> <b>scale.</b> Now the tube is filled with optically active solution and it is set in its proper position. The optically active solution rotates the plane of polarization of the light emerging out of the polariser P by some angle. So the light is transmitted by analyzer A and the field of view of telescope becomes bright. Now the analyzer is rotated by a finite angle so that the field of view of telescope again become dark. This will happen only when the analyzer is rotated by the same angle by which plane of polarization of light is rotated by optically active solution. The position of analyzer is again noted. The difference of the two readings will give you angle of rotation of plane of polarization (8). A difficulty is faced in the above procedure that when analyzer is rotated for the total darkness, then it is attained gradually and hence it is difficult to find the exact position correctly for which complete darkness is obtained. To overcome above difficulty half-shade device is introduced between polariser P andglass tube T.Half Shade DeviceIt consist of two semicircular plates ACB and ADC. One half ACB is made of glass while other half is made of quartz.|$|E
40|$|The paper applies a {{one-to-one}} correspondence which {{exists between}} individual Schrödinger perturbation terms and the diagrams obtained on a <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> {{of time to}} whole sets of the Schrödinger terms belonging to a definite perturbation order. In effect the diagram properties allowed us to derive the recurrence formulae giving the number of higher perturbative terms {{from the number of}} lower order terms. This recurrence formalism is based on a complementary property that any perturbation order N can be composed of two positive integer components Na, Nb combined into N in all possible ways. Another result concerns the degeneracy of the perturbative terms. This degeneracy is shown to be only twofold and the terms having it are easily detectable {{on the basis of a}} <b>circular</b> <b>scale.</b> An analysis of this type demonstrates that the degeneracy of the perturbative terms does not exist for very low perturbative orders. But when the perturbative order exceeds five, the number of degenerate terms predominates heavily over that of nondegenerate terms...|$|E

40|$|A home-made micro balance simmply {{designed}} is described; {{to weigh}} that range covers from one gram to on milligram is avaiable for only few minutes. This micro balance is very {{useful for the}} various laboratory uses, for instance such as a thermo-magnetic analyzer and so on. However an automatic micro balance has been greatly developed recently in the commercial products, these commercial ones are not so cheap even in the present day. And also {{it is not so}} easy toreconstruct for the various purpose in the laboratory use. The present author has built a micro balance by himself, of which the whole system is made of the fused quartz using a glass blowing tecunique. As shown in figure 1, the main system is constructed by four parts which are as follow: A; a spiral made fof the fused quartz beam which diameter is about 1 mm. B; the center of the spira. l A which is to be supported by a shaft of a certain rotary device with a revolving dial. C; a quartz stem with some knots, k_ 1, k_ 2, k_ 3 [...] , for a weighing basket (sample holder). D; a pointer, the sharp end of C, against a mirror attached on the wall of a box in which the whole system of the micro balance is fixed. A, B, C, and D are all in the same vertical plane.

40|$|The {{items of}} the Interpersonal Checklist (ICL) were scaled to a {{circular}} model by two different procedures: (1) the items were sorted by two different samples into categories corresponding to the labels of the eight ICL octants and (2) each item was scaled twice by a third sample, first on the 9 -point bipolar scale Hate-Love, and second on the 9 -point bipolar scale Dominance-Submissiveness. The two sets of ratings were found to correlate -. 09, indicating that the two postulated dimensions presumed to underly the circular order are orthogonal. The items were then plotted into the plane formed by using the two scales as axes. The <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> values calculated for the two sorting procedures correlated. 95. The scale values obtained from the sorting procedure and those from the two-dimensional procedure correlated. 89. In general, the plotted items followed a circular order from close synonymity to antonymity and back. Several gaps on the circle were found, indicating an inadequate sampling of items. Scale values were calculated {{for each of the}} eight ICL scales using the <b>circular</b> <b>scale</b> values as item weights. When these values were plotted and compared with a factor plot of the eight ICL scales, the plots were remarkably similar. Many items were found to be displaced by the scaling procedures from the placements given by the authors of the ICL. Most of these displacements were found to be related to an intensity dimension postulated by the authors of the ICL. In general, the mild/moderate items were scaled toward the Love and Dominance poles, and the strong/extreme items were scaled toward the Hate and Submissive poles, thus pulling the items away from the scales they were intended to represent. Some of the major implications of the use of these procedures in the construction of personality instruments are discussed...|$|E
