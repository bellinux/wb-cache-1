5|$|In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform, {{the purpose}} of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the {{international}} <b>communist</b> movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of <b>communist</b> parties in the Eastern Bloc.

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>communist</b> groups existed in Sarawak, {{the first of}} which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951. Another group, the North Kalimantan <b>Communist</b> Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine <b>Communist</b> Organisation (CCO) by {{government}} sources) was formally set up in 1970. Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok {{were two of the}} more notable <b>communist</b> leaders involved in the insurgency. As the political scene changed, it grew progressively more difficult for the communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, pushed for a continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak government.|$|E
5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began to assert their authority more strongly {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian <b>communist</b> President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the <b>communist</b> Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended <b>communist</b> rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E

5|$|After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin {{believed}} that the breakout of European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of Béla Kun's <b>communist</b> government in Hungary in March 1919, followed by the <b>communist</b> government in Bavaria and various revolutionary socialist uprisings {{in other parts of}} Germany, including that of the Spartacus League. During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, all of which were officially independent of Russia, while further east it {{led to the creation of}} <b>communist</b> governments in Georgia, and then in Outer Mongolia. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new <b>Communist</b> Party administrations were under the de facto authority of Sovnarkom.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Kuomintang at {{mainland}} China in 1949, Sibu <b>communist</b> members started to establish themselves in Sarawak in the early 1950s. Huang Sheng Zi (黄声梓) from Bintangor became the president of Borneo <b>Communist</b> Party (BCP). BCP activities mostly concentrated in Sibu, Sarikei, and Bintangor. His brother, Huang Zeng Ting (黄增霆), {{who was also a}} <b>communist,</b> {{played an important role in}} the formation of first political party in Sarawak, Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) and became the party's first executive secretary.

50|$|Left {{communism}} {{breaks from}} Leninist ideas, believing that <b>communists</b> should {{not participate in}} capitalist parliaments or participate in conservative trade unions.

5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic <b>communist</b> propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to <b>communist</b> Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the <b>communist</b> propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} <b>communist</b> propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War era, {{research}} on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish <b>communist</b> officials, who instead emphasized the role that <b>communist</b> partisans played in the anti-Nazi resistance.

5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} <b>Communist</b> Party in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the <b>Communist</b> Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the <b>Communist</b> Party should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the <b>Communist</b> Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|A problem {{developed}} {{when the}} Yugoslav <b>Communists</b> {{disagreed with the}} goal of a Greater Albania and asked the <b>Communists</b> in Albania to withdraw their agreement. According to Hoxha, Josip Broz Tito had agreed that [...] "Kosovo was Albanian" [...] but that Serbian opposition made transfer an unwise option. After the Albanian <b>Communists</b> repudiated the Greater Albania agreement, the Balli Kombëtar condemned the <b>Communists,</b> who in turn accused the Balli Kombëtar of siding with the Italians. The Balli Kombëtar, however, lacked support from the people. After judging the <b>Communists</b> as an immediate threat, the Balli Kombëtar sided with Nazi Germany, fatally damaging its image among those fighting the Fascists. The <b>Communists</b> quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Kombëtar and took center stage in the fight for liberation.|$|R

His orders were to eliminate local groups of <b>communist</b> guerrillas who had fled to the area following the Shanghai massacre of 1927.
