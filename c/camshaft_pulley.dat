5000|$|Power was {{delivered}} by the F4R730 engine, a 2.0-litre 16-valve Inline 4 engine with a Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system via a dephaser on the intake <b>camshaft</b> <b>pulley.</b> The engine was {{a modified version of}} the F4R used in models such as the Laguna and Espace and was modified by mecachrome to deliver a power output of [...] Power {{was delivered}} to the wheels via a JC5-089 five-speed manual gearbox.|$|E
50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences. The engine mounts are one example along with the oil filter mounting, power steering pump, ECU, timing belt cover and probably the gearbox setup. The <b>camshaft</b> <b>pulleys</b> were inverted by Renault making the Volvo timing marks redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist alignment tool to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|R
25|$|On current Ducati motors, {{except for}} the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are {{actuated}} by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a timing belt driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the <b>camshaft</b> drive <b>pulleys</b> indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older single-cylinder motorcycles â€” the shaft tube is visible {{on the outside of}} the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Volkswagen use a {{variator}} {{system with}} two variators, {{one for each}} camshaft. Like the Alfa Romeo system, these are electrically-controlled hydraulic units, mounted in the <b>camshaft's</b> timing belt <b>pulley.</b> These systems are fitted to the Volkswagen VR5 and VR6 engines, and also to the W8 and W12 engines. The multiple-bank W engines have four variators in total, one for each camshaft.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mechanical {{behaviour}} {{of power}} transmission systems {{have to be}} defined during preliminary design. Numerical simulations such as Finite Elements Analysis is the method used to design transmission components. This method aims to replace classical tests after experimental validation of computer software results. Sintered <b>camshaft</b> <b>pulleys</b> are designed using the same way. Design of this component can be optimised by simulating the quasi-static response of timing belt camshaft layout on a pulley under loading. The quasi-static belt response {{is related to the}} local behaviour of the transmission system while dynamic response of the whole camshaft layout is related to global behaviour. Because of the complex phenomena involved in such system and due to practical requirements of design office in terms of computer time, local and global analyses are performed separately, however, results from local analysis is used as input data for the second one. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the quasi-static behaviour of a timing belt setting on a pulley subjected to a torque. In order to take the environmental effects into account, the interaction between the belt and pulley is analysed with and without clearance. The analysis is performed using Abaqus Standard. The Finite Elements results show a significant influence of clearance on stresses distribution throughout the belt. When the belt is set up on pulley with clearance, reverse bending stresses are observed between the groove and teeth pulley, creating a polygonal effect. This effect generates a transmission error which may cause vibrations and then alter the behaviour of the belt during engine working. Without clearance between the two components, polygonal effect and transmission error are insignificant, and therefore dynamic excitations are smaller. Clearance is probably one of the major parameters governing the fatigue life of timing belt. Polygonal effect and quasi-static transmission error then constitute one of the input data for global dynamic simulations using a specific in-house...|$|R
500|$|... "Cog" [...] {{opens with}} a {{close-up}} on a transmission bearing rolling down a board into a synchro hub. The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog, which falls off the board and into a <b>camshaft</b> and <b>pulley</b> wheel. The camera tracks slowly from left to right, following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space. The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses, growing from simple collisions to ziplines made from a bonnet release cable, scales and see-saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts, and a swinging mobile of suspended glass windows. Later sequences begin {{to make use of}} the Accord's electronic systems; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor, and a side door with a door-mirror indicator lowers the automated window to let a part pass through.|$|R
50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, <b>pulleys,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|R
