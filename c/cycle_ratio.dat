Working in a geochronological system aids in the understanding of the physical properties of rocks and to do very precise correlations between wells. To transform the present coordinates a high resolution tool is necessary : the FMI® (Fullbore Formation MicroImager, Schlumberger). First, well log correlations are established between seven wells at different scales. Relative variations of sedimentation rate are observed locally. Second, FMI® images analysis are used to reveal clear carbonate - clay interbedding which display cycles. Third, to study these cycles, geostatistical tools are used. The variographic analysis of conventional log data shows cycles of one meter. With FMI® data, smaller cyles can be detected. Variogram modelling and factorial kriging analysis suggest that three spatial periods exist. They vary vertically and laterally in wells but <b>cycle</b> <b>ratios</b> are stable and similar to orbital <b>cycle</b> (Milankovitch <b>cycle)</b> <b>ratios.</b> The three periods correspond to eccentricity, obliquity and precession.

40|$|Abstract—Thermal {{problems}} {{are important for}} integrated circuits with high power densities. Three-dimensional stacked-wafer integrated circuit technology reduces interconnect lengths and improves performance compared to two-dimensional integration. However, it intensifies thermal problems. One remedy is to redistribute white space during floorplanning. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm to redistribute white space. In the first phase, the lateral heat flow white space redistribution problem is formulated as a minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>ratio</b> problem, in which the maximum power density is minimized. Since this phase only considers lateral heat flow, it also works for traditional two-dimensional integrated circuits. In the second phase, to consider inter-layer heat flow in three-dimensional integrated circuits, we discretize the chip into an array of tiles and use a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the maximum stacked tile power consumption. We compared our algorithms with a previously proposed technique based on mathematical program-ming. Our iterative minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>ratio</b> algorithm achieves 35 % more reduction in peak temperature. Our two-phase algorithm achieves 4. 21 × reduction in peak temperature for three-dimensional integrated circuits compared to applying the first phase, alone. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Bias {{temperature}} instability, hot-carrier injection, and gate-oxide wearout {{will cause}} severe lifetime degradation {{in the performance}} and the reliability of future CMOS devices. The design guardband to counter these negative effects will be too expensive, {{largely due to the}} worst-case behavior induced by the uneven utilization of devices on the chip. To mitigate these effects over a chip’s lifetime, this paper proposes Colt, a simple yet holistic scheme to balance the utilization of devices in a processor by equalizing the duty <b>cycle</b> <b>ratio</b> of circuits’ internal nodes and the usage frequency of devices. Colt relies on alternating true- and complement-mode operations to equalize the duty <b>cycle</b> <b>ratio</b> of signals (thus the utilization of devices) in most data path and storage devices. Colt also employs a pseudorandom indexing scheme to balance the usage of entries in storage structures that often exhibit highly uneven utilization of entries. Finally, an operand-swapping scheme equalizes utilization of the left and right operand data paths. The proposed mechanisms impose trivial overhead in area, complexity, power, and performance, while recapturing 27 % of aging-induced performance degradation and improving mean time to failure by an estimated 40 %.

Recent hydrocarbon exploration indicates that the basin is extremely rich in hydrocarbon resources. However, stratigraphic correlation of the subsurface successions has long been disputed due to absence of their counterparts at outcrop exposures. To improve the stratigraphic resolution for hydrocarbon prospecting and exploration in the basin, this study attempts to undertake detailed cyclostratigraphical analysis of the lower Miocene succession, including: 1) to determine the dominant frequencies of high-frequency cycles based on gamma-ray well-logging data, 2) to test whether Milankovitch orbital signals are registered in the rhythmic succession, 3) to estimate the duration and the net accumulation rate of sequences, 4) to identify and characterize the depositional responses to global and local sea-level changes in a mixed carbonate and siliciclastic setting.

The latter point is particularly important because a continuous time recording is often assumed in geological modelling. Andra (National Radioactive Waste Management Agency) has conducted studies in its Meuse/Haute-Marne Underground Research Laboratory located at a depth of about 490 m in a 155 -million-year-old argillaceous rock: the Callovo-Oxfordian argillite. The study of the variations of that clay layer can be conducted by the analysis of logs and particularly high-resolution logs. Working in a geochronological system helps to understand the physical properties of rocks and to make very precise well-to-well correlations. To transform the present coordinates, a high-resolution tool is necessary: the FMI® (Fullbore Formation MicroImager, Schlumberger). First, well-to-well correlations are established between seven wells at different scales. Relative variations of the sedimentation rate are observed locally.

Main tasks of the first tests were to perform operating parameters measurements when feeding furnace with average moisture content fuel and dry fuel, to calculate boiler efficiency and to analyze boiler behavior combusting various moisture content fuel. Different grate movements <b>cycles</b> <b>ratio</b> values was noticed. This ration influence in fuel layer thickness on grate, and the higher the ratio, the thicker fuel layer is. Primary air pressure dependence on fuel layer thickness confirms this statement. Different movement of first and second grate part causes fuel layer to fracture. As fuel moisture increases, grate movements <b>cycles</b> <b>ratio</b> should be increased as well. Biomass combustion from bottom to top was noticed. Thin hot coal layer covers the grate and primary air works as catalyst. Hot flue gas dries wet fuel as it flows thru it. Possibilities to improve combustion process were determined. Increasing primary air amount would speed up fuel drying process. Combustion air-preheating acts as catalyst not only for drying, but also for ignition and intensification of combustion process. Recirculation flue gas flow will dry fuel more quickly if it will not be mixed with primary air. Mixing hot flue gas with cold air, mixture temperature drops below water vapor saturation temperature and excess moisture condensates. Increasing grate movements <b>cycle’s</b> <b>ratio</b> improves combustion of wet fuel, however primary air flows has to be redistributed as well. There was no need to change any settings to combust biomass with 54 % moisture content, existing regime card was enough. Feeding wet fuel causes boiler water outlet temperature to decrease, i. e. boiler load decreases. In order to increase boiler load, fuel feeding was increased manually. After increasing fuel amount, secondary and tertiary air fans speed increased automatically, causing higher air excess ratio. Tertiary air set value was decreased manually to maintain lower air excess ratio. Combustion process has stabilized after increasing primary air first and second fan load and decreasing third primary air fan load. Wet fuel contained high amount of conifers spikes, which has ~ 1, 8 % fuel nitrogen content, therefore higher nitrogen oxides emissions were measured. Fuel moisture content has a highest influence for thermal capacity of flue gas condensing economizer, moreover the higher moisture content is the more significant effect on economizer capacity it has. Flue gas temperature after economizer and air excess ratio also has significant effect. To increase flue gas condensing economizer efficiency, air excess ratio must be kept as low as possible. Continuously CO measurement would help to decrease air excess ratio. Flue gas inlet temperature has low effect to the thermal capacity of condensing economizer...|$|R
