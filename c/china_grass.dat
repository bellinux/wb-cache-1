40|$|Background: E. arundinaceus (Retz.) Jeswiet is a warm-season, tall-growing {{perennial}} species {{native to}} much southern portion in <b>China.</b> The <b>grass</b> {{has been extensively}} used in sugarcane breeding and is recently targeted as a bioenergy feedstock crop. However, information on the genetic structure of the Chinese wild germplasm is limited. Knowledge of genetic variation within and among populations is essential for breeding new cultivars in the species. The major objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the magnitude of genetic variation among and within natural populations in China. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this experiment, we analyzed genetic variation of 164 individuals of 18 populations collected from natural habitats in six Chinese provinces using 20 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) primer pairs generating 277 polymorphic bands. Among and within the populations, the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 80. 00 % and 27. 07 %, genetic diversity (HE) was 0. 245 and 0. 099, effective number of alleles (NE) was 1. 350 and 1. 170, and Shannon’s information index (I) was 0. 340 and 0. 147, respectively. The populations were clustered into six groups exhibiting a high level of genetic differentiation, which was highly associated with geographic origins of respective germplasm populations, but was not significantly associated with geographic distances between the populations. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first report indicating that large genetic variation exists in the Chinese E. arundinaceus germplasm based on the SRAP molecular marker analysis of native populations.

To investigate biological functions and possible signal transduction pathways that address muscle firmness increase of crisp grass carp, microarray analysis of 14, 900 transcripts was performed. Compared with grass carp, 127 genes were upregulated and 114 genes were downregulated in crisp grass carp. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed 30 GOs of differentially expressed genes in crisp grass carp. And strong correlation with muscle firmness increase of crisp grass carp was found for these genes from differentiation of muscle fibers and deposition of ECM, and also glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and calcium metabolism may contribute to muscle firmness increase. In addition, a number of genes with unknown functions may be related to muscle firmness, and these genes are still further explored. Overall, these results had been demonstrated to play important roles in clarifying the molecular mechanism of muscle firmness increase in crisp grass carp...|$|R

If steam, water or other mechanical power is used in aid of the manufacturing process, the workplace is a factory; if not, it is a workshop. There is, however, a list of eighteen classes of works (brought under the factory law for reasons of safety, etc., before workshops generally were regulated) which are defined as factories whether power is used in them or not.

In this study, carried out primarily in the 1980 s, we examined various aspects of life history for the nearshore rockfishes and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod off central California. The following species of rockfishes were those primarily considered within this study: black, black-and-yellow, blue, canary, <b>China,</b> copper, gopher, <b>grass,</b> green spotted, kelp, olive, rosy, starry, vermilion, yelloweye, and yellow-tail. During the study, 21 species of rockfish and 8 additional species of fish, including cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod, were tagged and released to study patterns of movement. Of 7332 tagged fish, 197 (3 %) representing 15 species, were recaptured. Of these, only three species (canary and yellowtail rockfishes and lingcod) manifested substantial movement. Most nearshore rockfishes appear to be highly residential. Age and growth parameters were determined for 15 species of rockfish. Whole otoliths were the primary structure utilized for ageing. Most nearshore rockfishes examined appear to have lifespans of moderate longevity, with maximum ages between 20 and 30 years. Weight-length relationships were calculated for 16 species of rockfish and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod. Reproductive patterns were determined for 18 species of rockfish and size at sexual maturation for 17 of these species. The majority of nearshore rockfishes appear to release larvae during the winter-spring period. However, timing of larval extrusion is species specific and must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General food habits were described for 11 species of rockfish. An Appendix, summarizing life-history characteristics for the 17 most commonly encountered species in this study, is included.

30|$|Ramie, {{known as}} <b>China</b> <b>grass</b> (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaudich., Urticaceae), is an industrially {{important}} crop which is cultivated in China, Brazil, South Korea, Lao PDR, Philippines, India, and Thailand (Zhu et al. 2014). China is the world’s largest producer of ramie. In China, more than 1, 000, 000 ton of ramie residue such as ramie stalk is produced as textile industry byproduct in 2013  year which {{have very little}} or no economic value (Zhou et al. 2015). The ramie stalk is predominately composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Many edible white rot fungi can utilize a variety of lignocellulosic residues by producing several extracellular secreted enzymes including cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinase and ligninase (Isikhuemhen et al. 2012; Levin et al. 2012; Varnai et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2013).

40|$|Ramie (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud), {{commonly}} known as <b>China</b> <b>grass,</b> is a perennial bast fiber plant of the Urticaceae. In China, ramie farming, industry, and trade provide income for about five million people. Drought stress severely affects ramie stem growth and causes a dramatic decrease in ramie fiber production. There {{is a need to}} enhance ramie’s tolerance to drought stress. However, the drought stress regulatory mechanism in ramie remains unknown. Water stress imposed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common and convenient method to evaluate plant drought tolerance. In this study, transcriptome analysis of cDNA collections from ramie subjected to PEG treatment was conducted using Illumina paired-end sequencing, which generated 170 million raw sequence reads. Between leaves and roots subjected to 24 (L 2 and R 2) and 72 (L 3 and R 3) h of PEG treatment, 16, 798 genes were differentially expressed (9281 in leaves and 8627 in roots).

40|$|A biome {{classification}} for China {{was established}} based on plant functional types (PFTs) using the BIOME 3 model to include 16 biomes. In {{the eastern part}} of China, the PFTs of trees determine mostly the physiognomy of landscape. Biomes range from boreal deciduous coniferous forest/woodland, boreal mixed forest/woodland, temperate mixed forest, temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest, warm-temperate broad-leaved evergreen/mixed forest, warm-temperate/cool-temperate evergreen coniferous forest, xeric woodland/scrub, to tropical seasonal and rain forest, and tropical deciduous forest from north to south. In the northern and western part of <b>China,</b> <b>grass</b> is the dominant PFT. From northeast to west and southwest the biomes range from moist savannas, tall grassland, short grassland, dry savannas, arid shrubland/steppe, desert, to alpine tundra/ice/polar desert. Comparisons between the classification introduced here and the four classifications which were established over the past two decades, i. e. the vegetation classification, the vegetation division, the physical ecoregion, and the initial biome classification have showed that the different aims of biome classifications have resulted in different biome schemes each with its own unique characteristics and disadvantages for global change study. The new biome classification relies not only on climatic variables, but also on soil factor, vegetation functional variables, ecophysiological parameters and competition among the PFTs. It is a comprehensive classification that using multivariables better expresses the vegetation distribution and can be compared with world biome classifications. It can be easily used in the response study of Chinese biomes to global change, regionally and globally. [References: 36...|$|E
