De Kerckhove (1997, 2001), in particular, defines <b>connective</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{as a form of}} collaboration and cooperation between different subjects (individuals or groups), obtained by sharing and dialogue, which generates learning or innovation, improving skills and performance at an individual and systemic level, and differs from “collective” intelligence because each subject keeps his own identity during the sharing and dialogue, albeit within the sphere of a very articulate, extended framework of connections. 1 This kind of knowledge is the typical outcome of an interdisciplinary planning or design process.|$|E

Informational and ecological paradigms of contemporary urban landscape collect them in an ideal type called, in many scientific and policy perspectives, Smart City. To be economically competitive, socially developed and culturally modern, cities have to face sustainability and digital innovation challenges. This involves implementing new technologies and organizational architectures in both sectors: recycle, zero energy buildings, car sharing as well as broadband, cloud computing services, and accessibility. Often these elements are not isolated: ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) research is increasingly focused on the improvement of environmental outputs. The convergence between technologies is directly linked with {{the emergence of new}} social practices and cultural acquisitions. Digital innovation, ecological issues and integrated solutions populate the policy agenda of many European cities, often overcoming political belongings, generating new life styles. You can project zero energy buildings because you have 3 D Digital Software, but you use it to save energy because we are aware of environmental risks. The key topic of this paper is communication understood as collective and <b>connective</b> <b>intelligence</b> able to solve problems, an immaterial infrastructure linked with material and human capitals able to change the network of power between sub social systems. To be still functional, sub social systems should increase interoperability and decrease auto-reference. In essence it means creating a platform where citizen, firms, and public administrations share data, opinions and information. It requires expanding the opportunity for everyone to be connected, to widen participation, to increase openness and interoperability. What is the shape of this platform? What consequences would produce her implementation in the organization of power? To what extent is the Smart City Model politically naive...|$|E

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to be {{an author}} as the {{practices}} associated with <b>connective</b> and/or collective <b>intelligence</b> continue spreading through the world of the mass-media? More specifically, how are authors, and publishers as well, already undergoing important transformations as new information and communication technologies allow the capitalization of knowledge? The diverse philosophical and sociological implications of this question are explored below in contexts ranging from industrialorganizational knowledge work, to the creation and marketing of popular literary fiction. At both of these extremes, however, the central thesis is “depersonalization. ” That is, it will be argued that the effect of the new information/communication systems is to dilute, conceal, or entirely eliminate identification of the single mind or minds that have been absorbed into the systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} a {{collection}} of 19 chapters on intelligent engineering systems written by respectable experts of the fields. The book consists of three parts. The first part is devoted to the foundational aspects of computational intelligence. It consists of 8 chapters that include studies in genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic <b>connectives,</b> enhanced <b>intelligence</b> in product models, nature-inspired optimization technologies, particle swarm optimization, evolution algorithms, model complexity of neural networks, and fitness landscape analysis. The second part contains contributions to intelligent computation in networks, presented in 5 chapters. The covered subjects include the application of self-organizing maps for early detection of denial of service attacks, combating security threats via immunity and adaptability in cognitive radio networks, novel modifications in WSN network design for improved SNR and reliability, a conceptual framework for the design of audio based cognitive infocommunication channels, and a case study on the advantages of fuzzy and anytime signal- and image processing techniques. Computational intelligence represents a widely spread interdisciplinary research area with many applications in various disciplines including engineering, medicine, technology, environment, among others. Therefore, third part of this book consists of 6 chapters on applications. This is {{a very important part of}} the volume because the reader can find in it a wide range of fields where computational intelligence plays a significant role. ...|$|R
