50|$|In some European {{countries}} in which private insurance and universal health care coexist, such as Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the problem of adverse selection is overcome by using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus, a fund with a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receive funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price, {{and there is no}} advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but they compete mainly on price and service.

50|$|The CI Act of 1959 {{enabled the}} federal {{government}} to assist provinces in making CI available to producers at a 60% <b>coverage</b> <b>level.</b> Originally {{the federal government}}'s share of total premiums was 20%, with a 50% share of administrative expenses. In 1964, the Act was amended to incorporate general provisions for a reinsurance agreement between the provinces and the federal government. Further amendments were made in 1966 and 1970 concerning coverage levels and the federal government contribution to total premiums. The next amendment to the Act, in 1973, provided two options for the federal-provincial-producer cost-sharing arrangements. In one option, the federal and provincial governments each contributed 25% of total premiums and 50% of administrative costs. In the other option, the federal government contributed a total of 50% of premiums and the provinces paid all administrative costs. In the 1990 amendment, the maximum coverage was increased to 90% for low risk crops. Furthermore, the single cost-sharing formula was adopted, where the federal government and provinces each pay 25% of total premiums and 50% of administration costs. Other changes included waterfowl crop damage compensation, and regulations concerning self-sustainability and actuarial soundness requirements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background While many Complementary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) {{practitioners}} do {{not object}} to immunization, some discourage or even actively oppose vaccination among their patients. However, previous studies in this area have focused on childhood immunizations, and it is unknown whether {{and to what extent}} CAM practitioners may influence the vaccination behavior of their adult patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe vaccination <b>coverage</b> <b>levels</b> of adults aged ≥ 18 years according to their CAM use status and determine if there is an association between CAM use and adult vaccination coverage. Methods Data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey, limited to 30, 617 adults that provided at least one valid answer to the CAM supplement, were analyzed. Receipt of influenza vaccine during the past 12 months, pneumococcal vaccine (ever), and ≥ 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine was self-reported. <b>Coverage</b> <b>levels</b> for each vaccine by CAM use status were determined for adults who were considered high priority for vaccination because of the presence of a high risk condition and for non-priority adults. Multivariable analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between CAM users and vaccination status, adjusting for demographic and healthcare utilization characteristics. Results Overall, 36 % were recent CAM users. Among priority adults, adjusted vaccination <b>coverage</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly different between recent and non-CAM users for influenza (44 % vs 38 %; p-value Conclusion Vaccination <b>coverage</b> <b>levels</b> among recent CAM users were found to be higher than non-CAM users. Because CAM use has been increasing over time in the U. S., it is important to continue monitoring CAM use and its possible influence on receipt of immunizations among adults. Since adult vaccination <b>coverage</b> <b>levels</b> remain below Healthy People 2010 goals, it may be beneficial to work with CAM practitioners to promote adult vaccines as preventive services in keeping with their commitment to maintaining good health. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, Title I, {{modified}} the federal crop insurance program, {{beginning with the}} 1995 crops. It authorized a new catastrophic (CAT) <b>coverage</b> <b>level</b> available to farmers. The premium on this level of coverage (crop losses in excess of 50% receiving a payment of 60% (now, 55%) of the market price of the insured crop) is 100% subsidized by the government, but requires a farmer to pay a $50 per crop per county administrative fee (since raised to $100 per crop). The Act allows farmers to purchase additional insurance coverage providing higher yield or price protection levels, with the premium on this buy-up coverage partially subsidized by the government. The Act also created the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP), a permanent disaster payments program for crops not covered by crop insurance. The 1994 Act amended {{and in many cases}} suppressed major portions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-365) which serves as the authorizing statute for the federal crop insurance program. The 1980 Act expanded the scope of the crop insurance program and permitted USDA to subsidize farmer premium payments. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-224) made subsequent enhancements and reforms to the crop insurance program.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Prediction {{intervals}} can {{be calculated}} for predicting cancer incidence {{on the basis of}} a statistical model. These intervals include the uncertainty of the parameter estimates and variations in future rates but do not include the uncertainty of assumptions, such as continuation of current trends. In this study we evaluated whether prediction intervals are useful in practice. Methods Rates for the period 1993 – 97 were predicted from cancer incidence rates in the five Nordic countries for the period 1958 – 87. In a Poisson regression model, 95 % prediction intervals were constructed for 200 combinations of 20 cancer types for males and females in the five countries. The <b>coverage</b> <b>level</b> was calculated as the proportion of the prediction intervals that covered the observed number of cases in 1993 – 97. Results Overall, 52 % (104 / 200) of the prediction intervals covered the observed numbers. When the prediction intervals were divided into quartiles according to the number of cases in the last observed period, the <b>coverage</b> <b>level</b> was inversely proportional to the frequency (84 %, 52 %, 46 % and 26 %). The <b>coverage</b> <b>level</b> varied widely among the five countries, but the difference declined after adjustment for the number of cases in each country. Conclusion The <b>coverage</b> <b>level</b> of prediction intervals strongly depended on the number of cases on which the predictions were based. As the sample size increased, uncertainty about the adequacy of the model dominated, and the <b>coverage</b> <b>level</b> fell far below 95 %.
