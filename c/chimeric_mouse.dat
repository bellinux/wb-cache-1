Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. [...] ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of homologous recombination, thus allowing gene targeting. [...] Since this discovery occurred in 1999, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Rejection of transplanted tumors by {{the immune}} system is a rare event in syngeneic hosts, and is {{considered}} to be dependent on the local interaction of defensive immune reactions and tumor tolerance mechanisms. Here, we have enlisted the aid of a unique set of embryo-aggregated lineage <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> derived from C 57 /BL 6 and FVB donors to study the interplay between local and systemic tumor immunity and tolerance in rejection of mouse B 16 melanoma cells, syngeneic to the C 57 /BL 6 donor strain. Methods Two variants of embryo-aggregated <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> with either variable or no contribution of C 57 -derived cells to their skin were generated by the fusion of different ratios of morula stage blastomers. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> were analyzed for s. c. growth of B 16 tumors in comparison to their respective donor strains as well as normal F 1 hybrids, and the relative frequencies of cellular components of {{the immune system}} by FACS analysis of peripheral blood or lymph node cells. Results B 16 tumors grew significantly faster in mice with full chimerism in their skin as compared to syngeneic C 57 or semi-syngeneic C 57 Ã FVB F 1 hosts. In contrast, s. c. tumor growth was either absent or significantly reduced in <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> lacking C 57 -derived cells in their skin, but tolerant to C 57 tissue in other organs. Comparison of the relative frequencies of various immune cells in the periphery via FACS-analysis did not reveal any {{significant differences between the two}} types of <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> with respect to their donor strains. Conclusion Our data suggest a complex interplay between mechanisms of local peripheral tolerance and innate antitumor mechanisms possibly involving NK cell allorecognition as a basis for the differential growth or rejection of B 16 tumors in these unique <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice,</b> which we suggest to constitute a valuable new model system for the study of immune-mediated tumor rejection. </p...|$|R

The result is a <b>chimeric</b> <b>mouse,</b> which develops with a portion of its cells containing the ES cell genome.

However, uPA/SCID mice show four disadvantages: the human hepatocytes (h-heps) replacement index in mouse liver is decreased due to deletion of uPA transgene by homologous recombination, kidney disorders {{are likely to}} develop, body size is small, and hemizygotes cannot be used as hosts as more frequent homologous recombination than homozygotes. To solve these disadvantages, we have established a novel host strain that has a transgene containing albumin promoter/enhancer and urokinase-type plasminogen activator cDNA and has a SCID background (cDNA-uPA/SCID). We applied the embryonic stem cell technique to simultaneously generate a number of transgenic lines, and found the line with the most appropriate levels of uPA expression-not detrimental but with a sufficiently damaged liver. We transplanted h-heps into homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice via the spleen, and monitored their human albumin (h-alb) levels and body weight. Blood h-alb levels and body weight gradually increased in the hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice and were maintained until they were approximately 30 weeks old. By contrast, blood h-alb levels and body weight in uPA/SCID <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> decreased from 16 weeks of age onwards. A similar decrease in body weight was observed in the homozygous cDNA-uPA/SCID genotype, but h-alb levels were maintained until they were approximately 30 weeks old.

In this study, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) method based on a precursor ion scan with a uPA-SCID mouse with humanized liver (a <b>chimeric</b> <b>mouse)</b> was explored for the detection of steroid metabolism. Methandienone was used as a model compound. The application of the precursor ion scan method in positive human samples and chimeric mice samples after methandienone administration allowed the detection of most steroid metabolites without any structural restriction. Three hitherto unreported metabolites were found using this approach. These metabolites were characterized using LC-MS/MS and feasible structures were proposed. The structure of one of them, 6 -ene-epimethandienone, was confirmed by the synthesis of the reference compound.

In vitro experiments revealed that host splenic T cells of <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice,</b> while unable to generate anti-donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes, secreted significant amounts of IL 4 when stimulated in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) with donor alloantigens.

No significant increase in Ia antigen expression was found on syngeneic BALB/c B cells co-cultured with T cells from <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> unless A/J B cells were added to the cultures.

Although closely related, neither methasterone nor its metabolites were detected after administration of isolated methylstenbolone. Administration of the steroid product resulted mainly in the detection of methasterone metabolites, which were similar to those already described in the literature. Methylstenbolone metabolites previously described were not detected. A GC-MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring method was developed to detect methylstenbolone misuse. In one out of three samples, previously tested positive for methasterone, methylstenbolone and U 13 were additionally detected, indicating the applicability of the method...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{recently}} described method for efficiently deriving homozygous targeted alleles in {{embryonic stem cells}}, we produced <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> whose tissues were derived partially from embryonic stem cells bearing homozygous deletion of the mouse immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining (JH) region. Characterization of these <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> indicated that homozygous JH deletion leads to arrest of B-cell development at an early stage, {{resulting in a total}} lack of peripheral B cells and serum IgM. These results were confirmed in mice containing the homozygous JH deletion in their germ line. This novel B-cell-deficient mouse strain provides a tool for studying the recombination and expression of exogenous immunoglobulin genes introduced into the mouse germ line...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{described a}} new adhesion pathway in lymphocytes that {{is dependent on}} Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 activity and mediates lymphocyte interactions with endothelial matrix. We showed that Cdk 4 â/â mice had impaired recruitment of lymphocytes following bleomycin model of acute lung injury. In this study, we characterized the development and function of hematopoietic cells in Cdk 4 â/â mice and assessed the response of Cdk 4 â/â mice to allergen challenge. Cdk 4 â/â mice had hypoplastic thymuses with decreased total thymocyte cell numbers and increased CD 4 /CD 8 double negative cells. Cdk 4 â/â bone marrow (BM) <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> showed similar findings. Thymocytes from either Cdk 4 â/â or Cdk 4 â/â BM <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> proliferated equally well as wild type controls in response to IL- 2 activation. However Cdk 4 â/â thymocytes had decreased adhesion to both endothelial cell matrix and fibronectin compared to wild-type (WT) controls, whereas Cdk 4 â/â and WT splenocytes had similar adhesion. When Cdk 4 â/â BM <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> and wild type BM <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> were sensitized and challenged by intranasal administration of ovalbumin, we found no differences in allergic responses in the lung and airways between the two groups, as measured by inflammatory cell infiltrate, airway hyperreactivity, IgE levels and cytokine levels. In summary, we show that Cdk 4 plays a previously unrecognized role in thymocyte maturation and adhesion, but is not required for thymocyte proliferation. In addition, Cdk 4 is not required for lymphocyte trafficking to the lung following allergen sensitization and challenge...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate {{skeletogenesis}} {{requires a}} well-coordinated transition from chondrogenesis to osteogenesis. Hypertrophic chondrocytes {{in the growth}} plate play {{a pivotal role in}} this transition. Parathyroid hormoneârelated peptide (PTHrP), synthesized in the periarticular growth plate, regulates the site at which hypertrophy occurs. By comparing PTH/PTHrP receptorâ/â/wild-type (PPRâ/â/wild-type) <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> with Ihhâ/â;PPRâ/â/wild-type <b>chimeric</b> and Ihhâ/â/wild-type <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice,</b> we provide in vivo evidence that Indian hedgehog (Ihh), synthesized by prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, regulates the site of hypertrophic differentiation by signaling to the periarticular growth plate and also determines the site of bone collar formation in the adjacent perichondrium. By providing crucial local signals from prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes to both chondrocytes and preosteoblasts, Ihh couples chondrogenesis to osteogenesis in endochondral bone development...|$|R
40|$|The liver, {{the organ}} that metabolizes food and {{chemicals}} and delivers nutrients to body tissues, {{is essential to}} vertebrate life. The architecture of the liver is adequately designed such that its activity is precisely aligned with individual body requirements, neither over- nor underperforming. Thus, liver weight (Wliver) is correlated with body weight (Wbody). In any vertebrate species, the ratio (RL/B) of Wliver to Wbody is relatively constant among adults with fully functional mature livers. Recently, we created a mouse (<b>chimeric</b> <b>mouse)</b> with a liver com-posed of xenogenic hepatocytes and showed that the mouse {{can be used as}} a novel experimental animal model to study the mechanism of RL/B optimization. Liver tissue is generated via two different processes, embryonic liver organogenesis and liver regeneration in adults, and RL/B is optimized in the course of these biological phe-nomena. Although liver organogenesis and regeneration have been abundantly studied and mice with chimeric liver have been characterized intensively, very few studies have investigated these biological processes in the mouse model with such chimerism in relation to the regulation of RL/B. In this article, we review these previous studies on liver embryogenesis, regeneration and liver-chimeric mice from a viewpoint of RL/B regulation to make it appeal that the <b>chimeric</b> <b>mouse</b> is a novel and useful animal model to investigate the RL/B optimization at the cellular and molecular levels...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA non-obese {{diabetic}} (NOD) mouse-derived embryonic stem (ES) cell {{line has been}} stably maintained in an undifferentiated state with a characteristic ES cell-like morphology, expressing the stem cell marker alkaline phosphatase, and displaying a normal diploid karyotype. After injecting the NOD-ES cells into blastocysts, chimeric mice were obtained. Small but significant numbers of lymphocytes expressed the NOD-derived MHC allele. When a <b>chimeric</b> <b>mouse</b> was mated with C 57 BL/ 6 mice, an agouti mouse was obtained, having the NOD-derived H- 2 I-AÎ²g 7 haplotype. Thus, an NOD-ES cell line which can differentiate into lymphocytes with potential for germ line transmission was successfully established...|$|E
40|$|Leukemia {{inhibitory}} factor (LIF) is a cytokine {{active in}} vitro on different target cells. It is detected in vivo during mouse gestation in both extraembryonic membranes and maternal tissues. Two isoforms {{have been described}} maintaining embryonic stem cells in culture in a pluripotent state. However, overexpression of their cDNAs in <b>chimeric</b> <b>mouse</b> embryos observed between 6. 5 and 9. 5 days postcoitus gave strikingly different phenotypes. Embryos overexpressing the diffusible form of LIF cDNA looked essentially normal. Chimerae expressing LIF associated with the extracellular matrix cDNA showed an abnormal proliferation of tissues {{and the absence of}} differentiated mesoderm. They have not undertaken the normal pathway of gastrulation...|$|E
40|$|P-selectin is a {{leukocyte}} adhesion receptor {{present in}} endothelial cells and platelets. We examined {{the role of}} P-selectin in the autologous phase of an accelerated model of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis using P-selectinâdeficient <b>mice</b> and <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> expressing P-selectin only in platelets or endothelial cells. P-selectinâdeficient mice exhibited more severe glomerular damage with increased interstitial mononuclear leukocytic infiltrates, and had significantly increased proteinuria and mortality when compared to wild-type mice. P-selectin on the endothelium was predominantly responsible for protection from the exacerbated disease, because <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> with endothelial P-selectin, and not mice with platelet P-selectin, showed glomerular injury {{similar to that in}} wild-type animals. Levels of soluble circulating P-selectin were increased in nephritic wild-type <b>mice</b> and in <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> with endothelial P-selectin, but not platelet P-selectin. Levels of soluble P-selectin, which {{has been shown to be}} anti-inflammatory in vitro, were inversely associated with the severity of disease. P-selectin was not expressed in the endothelium of the glomerulus or interstitium. Thus, the protective effect in wild-type mice may be accounted for, in part by soluble P-selectin shed by non-renal endothelial cells, although other endothelial P-selectinâdependent mechanisms cannot be ruled out...|$|R
30|$|Genetically {{modified}} mouse {{models are}} invaluable tools in biomedicine because {{they serve as}} powerful tools to study gene function, development and human diseases (Visigalli et al., 2010; Carido et al., 2014; Kenney et al., 2016). To generate mouse models with precise genetic modification, one major approach is gene targeting in mouse ES cells (Doyle et al., 2012), which are used to produce <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice.</b> By breeding these <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice,</b> postnatal mice with desired genetic modifications can be obtained through the germline transmission of gene-targeted ES cells. Notably, recent breakthroughs in genome editing, such as CRISPR/Cas 9 technology, enable highly efficient genetic modifications in mouse ES cells (Cong et al., 2013), which further promote the applications of gene-targeted ES cells in generating mouse models.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. The {{infiltration}} of inflammatory cells into the cornea {{is a major}} determinant {{in the outcome of}} keratitis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) bone marrow <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice</b> to visualize and characterize the inflammatory cells that migrate to the corneal stroma during endotoxin-induced keratitis and to explore the mechanisms underlying this process. METHODS. Keratitis was induced by injecting endotoxin into the corneas of EGFP <b>chimeric</b> <b>mice.</b> In vivo fluorescence stereomicroscopy was used to visualize in real time the recruitment of EGFP-positive cells at different time points. Immunohistochemistry and three-dimensional (3 D) confocal analysis of wholemount corneas was used for histologic characterization. Macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2) chemokine was neutralized in vivo to determine its contribution to this process...|$|R
