40|$|International audienceVarious {{forms of}} noise {{are present in}} the brain. The role of noise in a exploration/exploitation {{trade-off}} is cast into the framework of reinforcement learning for a complex task of motor learning. A neuro-controler using a linear transformation of the input to which is added a gaussian noise is modelized as a stochastic <b>controler</b> that can be learned online in ''direct policy-gradient'' scheme. The reward signal is related to sensor information, thus no direct or indirect model of the system to control is needed. The task chosen (reaching with a multi-joint arm) is redundant and non-linear. The <b>controler</b> inputs are then projected to a feature space of higher dimension using a topographic coding based on gaussian kernels. We show that through a consistent noise level it possible to explore the environnment so as to find good control solution that can be exploited. Besides, the <b>controler</b> is able to adapt continuously to changes in the system dynamics. The general framework of this work will allow to study various noises and their effect, especially since it is quite compatible with more complexe types of stochastic neuro-controler, as demonstrated by other works on binary or spiking networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Controlled Lagrangian and {{matching}} techniques are {{developed for the}} stabilization of relative equilibria and equilibria of discrete mechanical systems with symmetry as well as broken symmetry. Interesting new phenomena arise in the controlled Lagrangian approach in the discrete context that are not present in the continuous theory. In particular, to make the discrete theory effective, one can make an appropriate selection of momentum levels or, alternatively, introduce a new parameter into the controlled Lagrangian to complete the kinetic matching procedure. Specifically, new terms in the controlled shape equation that are necessary for potential matching in the discrete setting are introduced. The theory is illustrated {{with the problem of}} stabilization of the cart-pendulum system on an incline. The paper also discusses digital and model predictive <b>controlers.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|National audienceIn {{order to}} be used in Ambiant Intelligence, {{automated}} planning has to generate highlevel action plans involving control structures for execution <b>controlers,</b> which role is to play these plans with respect to events perceived in the environment.

In this paper, we explore how to express and to generate high-level plans for deterministic planning problems by defining the operational and denotational semantics of new operators for plan composition. Our Lambda GraphPlan (LGP) planner incorporates into plans iterations representing nondeterministic choices among a set of resources subject to the same abstract treatment. LGP is a planning-graph based algorithm that extracts patterns of actions whose scheduling is indifferent with respect to goal reachability and aggregates them into iterative structures. We show that LGP can be highly efficient when the solution plans incorporate iterative structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) is {{a machine}} {{learning}} method aiming at learning an optimal control policy for a dynamic and stochastic system from a logged set of observed {{interactions between the}} system and one or several non-optimal <b>controlers.</b> It defines a class of particular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms which is a general paradigm for learning such a control policy from interactions. ADP addresses the problem of systems exhibiting a state space which is too large to be enumerated {{in the memory of}} a computer. Because of this, approximation schemes are used to generalize estimates over continuous state spaces. Nevertheless, RL still suffers from a lack of scalability to multidimensional continuous state spaces. In this paper, we propose the use of the Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) method to handle this scalability problem. We prove the efficacy of our approach on two standard benchmarks modified to exhibit larger state spaces. I...|$|R

This thesis deals with applications of computational intelligence methods, {{with an emphasis on}} fuzzy techniques, to a number of current issues in measurement, analysis and control of traffic in the Internet. We design and analyze novel methods and address the hardware implementation of some of them. First, we address mining of network traffic time series and traffic flow measurements. We develop a method for time series prediction by means of interpretable self-tuning fuzzy inference systems combined with a nonparametric residual variance estimation technique. The advantages of this method are illustrated through a number of time series benchmarks as well as a comprehensive set of traffic time series. Also, a method for the analysis and summarization of network traffic flow measurements by means of fuzzy linguistic summaries is developed. The method is shown to be fast and provide insightful and concise summaries. Then, we focus on Internet traffic control. Methods for both end-to-end congestion control and traffic control at the IP layer are developed. As for end-to-end control, an extended TCP-like window based congestion control scheme with fuzzy inference is proposed and evaluated on realistic simulated scenarios as well as emulated and production networks. Its advantages are illustrated by comparison against traditional alternatives. As for IP layer control, fuzzy <b>controlers</b> are designed for active queue management and an in depth evaluation is performed on realistic simulation and emulation scenarios. These <b>controlers</b> are compared against traditional alternatives and their advantages are shown. Finally, the hardware implementation of some of the methods developed in this thesis is studied. We propose an open FPGA-based platform and a companion methodology for developing fuzzy components for complex digital systems, specially in modern router architectures. The hardware implementation of fuzzy inference systems analyzed are shown to satisfy operational requirements of current and foreseeable future high-end routing hardware in terms of both inference speed and resource consumption...|$|R

As the container is {{under the influence of}} wind, it is likely that it starts to turn in a torsional pendulum. This report handles how the torsional pendulum of a {{container crane}} can be damped. A number of different models have been developed to analyze how different placement of the actuators affects the system. Two differens types of controllers, LQG and MPC, have been developed and applied to these models.

Moreover {{in order to make the}} simulations more realistic, a wind model has been developed and applied. The models and controllers have been analyzed with bodediagrams and sensitivity functions. The analyses shows clearly that the best placement of the actuators for control of the torsional pendulum on an STS-crane is in the trolly, pulling and relaxing the wires. This control is best handled by a state feedback control (LQG).

40|$|Because {{in modern}} copiers image quality {{is a very}} {{important}} issue, a lot of research is done in design of controllers that can optirnise it. The main idea with the OCE copier, which is the object of research, is that most processes involved in the image transport inside the copier are cyclic. There is, thus, reason to believe that errors will also have a cyclic behaviour. This knowledge can be used in the form of implementing repetitive <b>contro!lers.</b> Before research on these controllers can be done, the copier has got to be operational. The image transport system consists mainly of three units. The Organic Photo Conductor (OPC) unit, the Toner Transfer Fusion (TTF) unit and the paper feed. The main parts of the units are the belts on which the image is passed on. In this report is explained how the OPC unit is brought operational and what problems will arise when designing repetitive controllers for the image transportation system. The OPC belt will move axially from its centre due to several disturbances. This axial displacement can be corrected by making use of sensors and actuators. A controller has been designed that corrects this displacement. It is stable is test runs, but stabilit...|$|R

Between January 2006 and February 2007 (except April, July and August), population densities and mean test diameter of Diadema mexicanum were determined at Isla Montosa, La Entrega, Isla Cacaluta and San Agustín, Bahías de Huatulco, Mexico. Mean density of the sea urchins was relatively constant through time at all localities: lowest at San Agustín (0. 26 ± 0. 13 ind. m- 2) and highest at La Entrega (4. 17 ± 1. 4 ind. m- 2). There were significant differences between La Entrega and other localities. Mean test diameter ranged between 4. 41 ± 0. 88 cm (Isla Cacaluta) and 4. 72 ± 0. 27 (San Agustin), and did no vary significantly between localities, but there were monthly variations.
