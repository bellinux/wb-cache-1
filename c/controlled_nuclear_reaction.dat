50|$|Rutherford's research, {{and work}} done under him as {{laboratory}} director, established the nuclear {{structure of the}} atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. Rutherford's team, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated induced nuclear transmutation, and later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated artificially-induced <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> and transmutation.

50|$|That {{water flowing}} through the steam {{generator}} boils water on the shell side (which is kept at a lower pressure than the primary side) to produce steam. This {{is referred to as}} the secondary loop. The secondary-side steam is delivered to the turbines to make electricity. The steam is subsequently condensed via cooled water from a tertiary loop and returned to the steam generator to be heated once again. The tertiary cooling water may be recirculated to cooling towers where it sheds waste heat before returning to condense more steam. Once-through tertiary cooling may otherwise be provided by a river, lake, or ocean. This primary, secondary, tertiary cooling scheme is the basis of the pressurized water reactor, which is the most common way to extract usable energy from a <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

Dr. Spedding won the Langmuir Award in 1933, Only Oscar K. Rice and Linus Pauling preceded him in this achievement. The award is now called the Award in Pure Chemistry of the American Chemical Society. He is the first to bear the title Distinguished Professor of Sciences and Humanities at Iowa State (1957). Further awards include: William H. Nichols Award of the New York section of the American Chemical Society (1952); the James Douglas Gold Medal from the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (1961) for achievements in nonferrous metallurgy; and the Francis J.

Thus, it was unveiled at precisely 3:36 p.m. on December 2, 1967. The site of the first nuclear reaction received designation as a National Historic Landmark on February 18, 1965 and was added to the newly created National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on October 15, 1966 as one of the original designated historic places. [...] Chicago Pile-1 is one of four Chicago NRHPs on the original list. The site was named a Chicago Landmark on October 27, 1971. [...] Four plaques are placed on a nearby granite wall marking the site.

50|$|Cowan {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1941, {{at the age of}} twenty one, after graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in chemistry, he worked on the {{cyclotron}} project at Princeton University with the intention of taking graduate courses in physics. He worked there with future Nobel Prize Laureate Eugene Wigner, who would design the first uranium chain reactor. In 1941, George participated in taking measurements essential to determining whether the chain reaction in uranium could be achieved. His knowledge of chemistry and nuclear physics experience provided expertise on a number of things necessary to the Manhattan Project. In 1942, Wigner, Cowan, and several others transferred to the Metallurgy Lab at the University of Chicago where the first atomic pile was being developed under Enrico Fermi. Starting as a junior member, Cowan became a jack-of-all-trades, capable of such skills as machining graphite blocks used for control of the pile's reaction rate and in casting uranium metal. In 1942, the Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1) generated the first <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b> This controlled release of energy from the nucleus of the atom enabled development of a method to obtain nuclear fuel for the first atomic weapons. His experience {{made him one of the}} experts on the chemistry of radioactive elements in the field of applied nuclear fission. Since he was single and in possession of high expertise, project managers transferred him around the nation to help resolve bottlenecks. He was one of the select group with knowledge of the separate components of the project, kept separate for security reasons. He received a draft deferment from the president of the United States for possessing skills uniquely useful to the war effort.|$|E
50|$|A Fermi is an {{extremely}} small unit of length equal to one quadrillionth of a meter. It is named after Enrico Fermi, the Nobel Prize winner and physicist who produced the first <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction.</b> Lyons uses this name because they seek to use small, incremental changes to create a series of large changes in how the church views its mission.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} start up a {{controllable}} fission reaction, the assembly must be delayed-critical. In other words, k must be greater than 1 (supercritical) without crossing the prompt-critical threshold. In nuclear reactors this is possible due to delayed neutrons. Because it takes some time before these neutrons are emitted following a fission event, {{it is possible to}} <b>control</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> using <b>control</b> rods.|$|R

25|$|A {{stellarator}} is {{a device}} used to confine a hot plasma with magnetic fields {{in order to}} sustain a <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> fusion <b>reaction.</b> It is the earliest controlled fusion device. In 1951, American astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer recommended that the United States Atomic Energy Commission commence containing and harnessing nuclear fusion of hydrogen at temperatures exceeding those at the Sun's surface. To do this, Spitzer invented a plasma confinement configuration device called the stellarator.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{target of the}} concept “sustainability” is to achieve fairness between generations. Its expanding interpolation leads to achieve fairness within a generation. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} discuss the role of nuclear power from the viewpoint of this definition. The history of nuclear power has been the <b>control</b> of the <b>nuclear</b> fission <b>reaction.</b> Once this is obtained, then the economy of the system is required. On the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the internalization of the external diseconomy to avoid damage to human society caused by the economic activity itself, due to its limited capacity. An extreme example is waste. Thus, reducing radioactive waste resulting from nuclear power is essential. Nuclear non-proliferation must be guaranteed. Moreover, the FUKUSHIMA accident revealed that it is still not enough that human beings <b>control</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b> Further, the most essential issue for sustaining use of one technology is human resources in manufacturing, operation, policy-making and education. Nuclear power will be able to satisfy the requirements of sustainability only when these subjects are addressed. The author will review recent activities of a thorium molten-salt reactor (MSR) as a cornerstone for a sustainable society and describe its objectives and forecasts...|$|R

40|$|We {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that all atomic models based on either the Newton equation and the Kepler laws, or the Maxwell equations, or the Schrodinger and Dirac equations are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. We can only suspect that these equations are grounded on the same fundamental principle(s) which is (are) not known or these equations can be transformed into each other. We proposed a new mechanism of LENR: cooperative processes in the whole system - nuclei+atoms+condensed matter - <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> in plasma - can occur at smaller threshold energies than the corresponding ones on free constituents. We were able to quantize phenomenologically the first time the differences between atomic and nuclear rest masses by the formula (in MeV/c^ 2) Δ M=n_ 1 /n_ 2 * 0. 0076294, n_i= 1, 2, 3, [...] . Note that this quantization rule is justified for atoms and nuclei with different A, N and Z and the nuclei and atoms represent a coherent synchronized systems - a complex of coupled oscillators (resonators).

25|$|Although uranium-238 {{cannot be}} used for the initial stage of an atomic bomb, when it absorbs a neutron, it becomes uranium-239 which decays into neptunium-239, and finally the {{relatively}} stable plutonium-239, an element that does not exist naturally on Earth, but is fissile like uranium-235. After Fermi achieved the world's first sustained and <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction</b> with the creation of the first atomic pile, massive reactors were secretly constructed at what is now known as Hanford Site to transform uranium-238 into plutonium for a bomb.|$|R
30|$|Boric acid (“Boric acid {{that appears}} in the {{following}} text refers to 10 B boric acid.”) is widely used in nuclear power plant as coolant (moderator) for reactor to <b>control</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> rate (Zhang et al. 2014, 2015). The important role of boric acid in nuclear power plant is to <b>control</b> <b>nuclear</b> fission rate and to influence the power generation of nuclear power plant (Odar 2007). Generally speaking, the rate of <b>nuclear</b> fission is <b>controlled</b> by neutron flux, which is released by that process, and boron is an atom that absorbs neutrons with perfect effect. 10 B (one of B isotope) has very strong absorption ability, whose neutron absorption cross section of thermal neutron is five times more than boron with natural abundance, 20 times than graphite, and 500 times than traditional protective material of concrete. For that reason, the rate of nuclear fission can be controlled by injecting boric acid into a nuclear power furnace with 10 B. Boric acid is prepared in a system consisting of boron and water supply, and enters into chemical volume control system by boron adding loop. The chemical volume control system controls the reactivity of the reactor by controlling boric acid concentration of the loop, and then further controls the power and safety of the reactor (Wootten et al. 1985; Mark 1989; Song and Lee 2003; Staudt et al. 2002).|$|R
50|$|The {{process to}} produce large {{quantities}} of high-purity uranium metal {{became known as the}} Ames process.

The Ames project received the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award for Excellence in Production on October 12, 1945, signifying two-and-one-half years of excellence in industrial production of metallic uranium as a vital war material. Iowa State is unique among educational institutions to have received this award for outstanding service, an honor normally given to industry.|$|R
500|$|During the Manhattan Project, Wigner led a {{team that}} {{included}} Alvin M. Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz.

[...] At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. Wigner was present at a converted rackets court under the stands at the University of Chicago's abandoned Stagg Field on December 2, 1942, when the world's first atomic reactor, Chicago Pile One (CP-1) achieved a <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> chain <b>reaction.</b>|$|R
