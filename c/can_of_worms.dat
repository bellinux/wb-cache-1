5|$|By 1964, {{construction}} was underway {{on a new}} expressway leading south from I-490 at the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> to Elmwood Avenue east of Twelve Corners. The highway was completed , at which time NY47 was realigned to follow the Sea Breeze Expressway and the new expressway south through the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> to its end at a partial interchange with Elmwood Avenue (now I-590 exit3). It continued west on Elmwood Avenue to Twelve Corners, where it reconnected to its old alignment at Winton Road.|$|E
5|$|On March18, 1980, the NY47 {{designation}} {{was eliminated}} and split into four other routes. From NY104 in Greece to I-490, NY47 became NY390. The section from I-490 south to NY383 was designated {{as part of}} I-390; however, it would not connect to the existing portion of I-390 south of Rochester until 1981, when the interchange between I-390 and I-590 was completed. The segment of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue north to the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> became part of I-590, which continued southwest along the freeway to Winton Road. From the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> to Lake Ontario, NY47 was redesignated NY590.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E

50|$|Nominal {{cases in}} Tlingit are {{designated}} by postpositions {{as with most}} SOV languages, however they usually behave morphologically like suffixes. Case in Tlingit is a somewhat problematic feature because the cases semantically function as do case suffixes in other languages, but can be expanded to whole noun phrases like phrasal postpositions rather than being restricted to individual nouns as with typical case suffixes. They thus fall somewhere in between suffixes and enclitics. This problem can be crudely accounted for by treating noun phrases as discrete nouns if they are syntactically closed, but this solution itself opens up another <b>can</b> <b>of</b> theoretical <b>worms.</b> Therefore, {{in the interests of}} simplicity and readability the terms “postposition”, “suffix”, and “case” are used interchangeably in this article without any particular theoretical implications.|$|R
5|$|The four-lane I-590 becomes NY590 upon passing under I-490 at the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> on {{the eastern}} edge of Rochester. It heads {{northeast}} into Brighton and through the remainder of the interchange, passing under the ramp connecting I-490 west to I-590 south, the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision, and the ramps from NY590 south to I-490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with Blossom Road, once designated as NY286A. Between Blossom Road and NY286 (Browncroft Boulevard), NY590 slowly turns to the northwest, passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to the Rochester–Brighton boundary. It reaches the city line and reenters Rochester upon meeting NY286.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY590 between the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> and NY104 {{is part of}} the northeastern {{quadrant}} of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY104 through Irondequoit. The Sea Breeze Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester – Sea Breeze highway was designated as part of NY47. It was redesignated as NY590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea Breeze Drive, and NY590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The freeway travels due north {{along this}} stretch, flanked {{on both sides}} by {{residential}} neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far {{to the north of}} the intersection with NY31 is exit3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit4—making the two connections that exit3 omits—before I-590 enters the <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms,</b> a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY96 as it becomes NY590, which continues onward toward Sea Breeze.|$|E

The junction was built during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Rochester Outer Loop's construction, and rebuilt in the late 1980s to eliminate weaving caused by the interchange's original design.

40|$|There are the {{two common}} means for {{propagating}} worms: scanning vulnerable computers in the network and spreading through topological neighbors. Modeling the propagation <b>of</b> <b>worms</b> <b>can</b> help us understand how worms spread and devise effective defense strategies.

South of exit25, I-490 traverses the southeastern suburbs of Rochester, passing close to East Rochester, Pittsford and Bushnell's Basin and closely paralleling NY96 on its way toward the Ontario County line. The freeway meets NY96 twice in Perinton and a third time in the Ontario County town of Victor, where I-490 passes along the western fringe of Eastview Mall. I-490 ends a short distance southeast of the third NY96 interchange at Thruway exit45.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> at ICI was the {{headline}} in Business & Finance magazine on 8 November 1984.

When {{it was discovered}} in November 1984 that ICI was operating below the statutory reserve ratio, a request for further capital was made to AIB— ICI had returned a profit of more than £80 million the previous year. This collapse occurred {{at a time of}} deep economic recession in Ireland. The level of Government debt at that time was 116% of GDP. But the Irish taxpayer bailed ICI out of its difficulties. The Irish Government did so to ensure a continuation of the insurance business and to protect policyholders. AIB claimed that it could not resolve the problems of ICI without putting its core banking business in jeopardy. The investment of £85 million by AIB in ICI was written off and the cost to the Irish taxpayer was £400 million.|$|E
