5|$|Kirsten Klein (born 1945) studied {{portrait}} {{and museum}} photography before specializing in landscapes. Her black-and-white photographs often {{make use of}} older techniques such as <b>cyanotype</b> and platinum printing. Concentrating on landscapes, she conveys a sensitive, poetic and often melancholic mood. Since 1976, she has lived on the Danish island of Mors where she has photographed the ever-changing countryside and coastline.|$|E

His platinum prints utilized salts of platinum instead of the silver salts used in modern platinum prints, resulting in a greater range and richness of middle tones.|$|E

2500|$|British chemist John Herschel {{made many}} {{contributions}} to the new field. He invented the <b>cyanotype</b> process, later familiar as the [...] "blueprint". He {{was the first to}} use the terms [...] "photography", [...] "negative" [...] and [...] "positive". He had discovered in 1819 that sodium thiosulphate was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to [...] "fix" [...] silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first glass negative in late 1839.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, all {{photography}} was monochrome, or black-and-white. Even after {{color film}} was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, {{due to its}} lower cost and its [...] "classic" [...] photographic look. The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography. It {{is important to note}} that monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. The <b>cyanotype</b> process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The albumen print process first used more than [...] years ago, produces brownish tones.|$|E

5000|$|Sir John Herschel, {{a friend}} of Atkins and Children, invented the <b>cyanotype</b> {{photographic}} process in 1842. Within a year, Atkins applied the process to algae (specifically, seaweed) by making <b>cyanotype</b> photograms that were contact printed [...] "by placing the unmounted dried-algae original directly on the <b>cyanotype</b> paper." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anna Atkins, a botanist, {{was also}} {{introduced}} to photography by Fox Talbot, who explained his [...] "photogenic drawing" [...] technique {{to her as}} well as his camera-based calotype process. After learning about the <b>cyanotype</b> process from its inventor, John Herschel, she was able to produce <b>cyanotype</b> photograms of dried algae. She published them in 1843 in her Photographs of British Algae: <b>Cyanotype</b> Impressions, said to be the first book with photographic illustrations.|$|E
50|$|Atkins self-published her photograms in {{the first}} {{installment}} of Photographs of British Algae: <b>Cyanotype</b> Impressions in October 1843.

50|$|Monochrome (black and white) {{photography}} {{was first}} {{exemplified by the}} daguerreotype in 1839 and later improved by other methods including: calotype, ambrotype, tintype, albumen print and gelatin silver print. The majority of photography remained monochrome until the mid-20th century, although experiments were producing colour photography as early as 1855 and some photographic processes produced images with an inherent overall colour like the blue of <b>cyanotypes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sepia {{and brown}} hued images are {{produced}} by certain photographic processes such as calotypes and albumen prints, or {{by the use of}} toning solutions which convert silver in the image to silver sulphide, imparting the brown or sepia tone. Selenium toner produces a blue-black or purple image, similarly by converting silver into more stable silver selenide. <b>Cyanotypes</b> used iron salts rather than silver salts to create blue and white hued images.|$|R
50|$|This mildly {{photosensitive}} {{solution is}} then {{applied to a}} receptive surface (such as paper or cloth) and allowed to dry in a dark place. <b>Cyanotypes</b> can be printed on any surface capable of soaking up the iron solution. Although watercolor paper is a preferred medium, cotton, wool and even gelatin sizing on nonporous surfaces have been used. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid alkaline-buffered papers, which degrade the image over time.|$|R

50|$|Gum prints {{tend to be}} multi-layered images {{sometimes}} {{combined with}} other alternative process printing methods such as <b>cyanotype</b> and platinotype. A heavy weight cotton watercolor or printmaking paper that can withstand repeated and extended soakings is best. Each layer of pigment is individually coated, registered, exposed and washed. Separation negatives of cyan, magenta, and yellow or red, green, and blue are used for a full-color image. Some photographers prefer substituting the cyan emulsion in the CMYK separations with a <b>cyanotype</b> layer. A simple duotone separation combining orange watercolor pigment and a <b>cyanotype</b> can yield surprisingly beautiful results.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds potassium ferrocyanide and the pigment Prussian blue, which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom. Prussian blue was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to blueprints, bluing, and <b>cyanotypes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The cyanogenic {{polymorphism}} in Trifolium repens {{is caused}} by the variation in two genes, the interaction of which produces four distinct <b>cyanotypes.</b> Along the Atlantic coasts of Bretagne, T. repens is sometimes found in populations mixed with the related species Trifolium occidentale, although the latter species usually occurs only in a narrow fringe along the coast, whereas T. repens is a more inland species. No plants of T. occidentale have ever been reported to have linamarase activity. Indeed, of 763 T. occidentale plants studied, none contained linamarase activity. However, the variation in the proportion of <b>cyanotypes</b> in T. repens was enormous, even between sites less than 2 km apart. Our results confirm the presumption that T. repens and T. occidentale are indeed separate species. Both the fact that T. occidentale plants never contain linamarase activity, and the difference in proportion of plants with cyanoglucosides in mixed stands show that gene flow between the species must be rare. These dissimilar distributions strongly indicate that cyanotypic frequencies in adjacent and mixed populations of the very closely related species T. occidentale and T. repens are regulated by different mechanisms.

50|$|The <b>cyanotypes</b> {{are created}} through a {{scientific}} and experimental process, by painting {{the images on}} semitransparent drafting film. Next, they are pressed on paper glazed with light-sensitive emulsion and exposed to the sun, creating a positive image. This process mimics that of the Harvard Computer’s astronomical plates, essentially creating a photographic print {{without the use of}} a camera. Stepping away from the often formulaic process of science, Halloran’s pieces do not dwell in accuracy, but instead offers an active experience, re-igniting the spirit of the universe.|$|R
