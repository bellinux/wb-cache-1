5|$|The {{procedure}} can {{be repeated}} if necessary, {{but this is}} generally taken as a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> additional treatments {{may be required to}} control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|E

25|$|Volusius Venustus {{set up a}} {{monument}} in the forum of Canosa in honour of Constantine I and his two sons (the fact that only two sons are honoured means that the monument was set up between 317 and 333, less the period between 324 and 326). This monument is a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> he was from this city in southern Italia; it also marks his office, the one of corrector Apuliae et Calabriae (governor of the region corresponding to the present-day Apulia).|$|E
25|$|The Hazard, seen {{in season}} 19, is a penalty {{applied to the}} team who came in last at the {{starting}} line task. After completing a task (in season 19 it was a Roadblock), the team was given a different <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> directed them to another location where they found the Hazard clue. The Hazard consisted of a task that {{only one of the}} team members had to perform. The Hazard did not reappear since season 20, despite the inclusion of a similar task at the starting line.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E

25|$|Unaware {{that the}} Crown Prince {{did not have}} much to do with the running of Army Group Crown Prince or the 5th Army, the Deuxième Bureau offered Zelle one million francs if she could seduce him and provide France with good {{intelligence}} about German plans. The fact that the Crown Prince had, before 1914, never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, and was now supposedly commanding both an army and an army group at the same time should have been a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> his role in German decision-making was mostly nominal. Zelle's contact with the Deuxième Bureau was Captain Georges Ladoux, who was later to emerge as one of her principal accusers.|$|E
25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn. Meyer {{decided that}} Alice would write her instruction to Bella {{on a page}} from The Merchant of Venice to give a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the final confrontation {{at the end of}} the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one {{at the end of the}} play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a page from, but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with the story, so Meyer changed it.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) because AKI can be reversible. Abdominal ultrasound, in which {{the size of the}} kidneys is measured, is commonly performed. Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (≤ 9nbsp&cm) than normal kidneys, with notable exceptions such as in early diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease. Another diagnostic <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks). If these levels are unavailable (because the patient has been well and has had no blood tests), it is occasionally necessary to treat a patient briefly as having AKI until the kidney impairment has been established to be irreversible.|$|E

25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if he could say some words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one person for a role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning the compliment, Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to make a joke on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E
500|$|Although mostly {{relegated to}} a {{background}} role, spoo was a key plot point in the season 5 episode [...] "A Tragedy of Telepaths". The fact that Narn prefer fresh spoo while the Centauri prefer it aged was the <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> G'Kar used {{to figure out that}} there was another Narn in the Centauri Royal Palace.

Lee Adama also encounters Kara Thrace, who was thought to have been killed in [...] "Maelstrom" [...] and claims to know where Earth is. The episode also deals with the aftermath of the identity of four of the five final Cylons, Samuel Anders, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, and Galen Tyrol. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,698.|$|E
500|$|According to Manolescu, Mateiu Caragiale took direct {{inspiration}} from foreign works of detective fiction when outlining his story, but also mocked their conventions by having Ruse rely on literature and even cartomancy for his crime solving techniques. Vartic drew a parallel between Caragiale's style {{and that of}} two 20th century foreign authors of crime fiction—Dashiell Hammett and Giorgio Bassani. The general intent, Manolescu notes, is not in realistically depicting police procedures, but in showing [...] "the human mystery." [...] Thus, Ion Vartic argues, Gogu Nicolau may be Caragiale's attempt to see himself from the outside, and his disappearance may be a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the writer was planning to sever links with the cultural milieu. The work's title and its generic meaning are found in Ruse's final statement: [...] "There are such things meant to always remain—since forever—under the seal of secrecy." ...|$|E
500|$|As part of Operation Collar in late November, Barham, Malaya and {{the carrier}} [...] covered the forces rendezvousing with a convoy coming from Gibraltar. En route, Eagles {{aircraft}} attacked Tripoli on 26 November. Barham became the flagship of the 1st BS in December. On 3 January 1941, the ship, together with Warspite and Valiant, bombarded Bardia {{as a prelude}} to the Battle of Bardia. On 26 March, the Italian fleet sortied in an attempt to intercept British convoys to Greece. The British had recently broken the Italian codes and sailed after dark on the 27th to intercept the Italians. The following morning, they were spotted by an aircraft from the carrier [...] and the Battle of Cape Matapan began. Multiple air strikes by Formidables Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers damaged the battleship [...] and crippled the heavy cruiser [...] later that evening. Admiral Angelo Iachino, commander of the Italian fleet, ordered the two other heavy cruisers of the 1st Division to render assistance to Pola in the darkness. The Italian ships and the British arrived almost simultaneously at Polas location, but the Italians had almost no <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the British were nearby. On the other hand, the British knew exactly where the Italians were, thanks to their radar-equipped ships. They opened fire at point-blank range, Barham crippling the destroyer [...] and then joined Warspite and Valiant in crippling [...]|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} a [...] "very, very good piece of television". He was {{particularly}} pleased with the grimness of the story; he noted that it was largely about {{the way in which}} Mulder's [...] "belief system [...] eradicated before his very eyes" [...] after the suicide of his mom. VanDerWerff was also pleased with Duchovny's performance, writing that he [...] "brings the intense mania to Mulder that has always made the character work at his best." [...] Despite this, he was slightly critical of the concept of the [...] "walk-ins", which he called [...] "patently ridiculous". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that while [...] "Chris Carter penned this episode, [...] his attempts at clarifying his own confounded mythology are often even more confusing than revelatory, 'Sein Und Zeit' is a tense installment, and leads neatly to the supposed wrap-up in the second half. [...] " [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] "'Sein Und Zeit' not only served as a reminder of Fox Mulder's ongoing pain it provided yet another <b>clue</b> <b>that,</b> although its journey is nearing its completion, The X-Files still knows how to make the ride an enjoyable one." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two called the episode [...] "a welcome return to an X-Files we haven't seen for awhile—hard, passionate, and with an urgent story to tell. From where I'm sitting, {{in the middle of a}} lacklustre season, it smells strongly of a masterpiece." ...|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{received}} a Logie Award nomination for [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] at the 51st Logie Awards for her portrayal of Ruby. She was later {{nominated for the}} [...] "Most Popular Actress" [...] Logie in 2010, with Breeds stating: [...] "To know that people like Ruby makes me think I'm doing a good job." [...] At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Breeds was nominated for [...] "Best Daytime Star". Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started talking to someone on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E
