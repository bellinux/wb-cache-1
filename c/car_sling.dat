40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to focus on the {{elevator}} <b>car</b> <b>sling</b> structure which is used to carry car death load and the weights of passengers. It consists of the crosshead, vertical uprights, bottom channel, and car platform. For a safety operation, elevators must be designed that their members can withstand the loads and the moments imposed on them under whole operational conditions. In this study stresses and displacements occurred on the <b>car</b> <b>sling</b> members have been investigated by both analytical and finite element methods. In order to compare the stress results from the analysis, an illustrative example of elevator <b>car</b> <b>sling</b> is given...|$|E
50|$|A typical {{modernization}} {{consists of}} controller equipment, electrical wiring and buttons, position indicators and direction arrows, hoist machines and motors (including door operators), and sometimes door hanger tracks. Rarely are <b>car</b> <b>slings,</b> rails, or other heavy structures changed. The {{cost of an}} elevator modernization can range greatly depending on which type of equipment is to be installed.|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a lift system is affected by dynamic phenomena and vibrations. This affects ride quality and results in {{a high level of}} dynamic stresses in the lift installation components. This paper demonstrates a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical lift installations. Subsequently, vibration modelling and simulation techniques for the prediction of their dynamic responses is discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated using the <b>car</b> – <b>sling</b> assembly as an example. Then, suitable strategies are described to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|R
50|$|As {{aircraft}} flew at {{ever increasing}} altitudes, pilots and aircrew {{were subject to}} ever lower temperatures, and Irvin designed and manufactured the classic sheepskin flying jacket to meet aviators' special requirements. Later the company also made <b>car</b> seat belts, <b>slings</b> for cargo handling, and even canning machinery. In 1970, the company finally removed the misnomic 'g' from its name, becoming Irvin Air Chute, and in 1996, changed its name again to Irvin Aerospace Inc. In addition to parachutes, the company (now Airborne Systems) specializes in a diverse range of products for global aerospace and military markets.|$|R
40|$|Background: Research has {{revealed}} many sleep environments for infants that carry {{an increased risk}} of infant injury and mortality. Sudden, unexpected infant deaths and sudden neonatal collapses have been associated with infant <b>car</b> seats, <b>slings,</b> baby hammocks, while breastfeeding, during mobile phone use, in cots, on sofas, in shared sleeping situations, and in delivery suite during kangaroo-care. No environment is risk free for a baby. Babies are obligatory nose breathers and any position which occludes a baby’s nose or promotes chin-to-chest positioning may cause positional asphyxia and slow suffocation. Babies who have impaired arousal mechanisms through exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, illicit or prescription drugs, or those who are born premature or of low birth weight, are particularly vulnerable. Health professionals are bombarded with many guidelines that they are expected to impart as part of parent education. This workshop will present a novel approach using the baby’s perspective and share a simple set of principles applicable to all environments for a baby placed to sleep. Using different kinds of evidence: Scientific evidence comes from group data. While it {{is an important part of}} the communication and prevention story, it is by no means all of it. It lacks the specificity that other types of information can add. Jeanine will lead a discussion about current communication challenges that participants’ experience in their prevention work. This will be followed by a short presentation of the different kinds of evidence needed for effective translation of science into understanding and action, using coroners’ reports and case reviews, as examples. This will be followed by the opportunity to review coroners’ reports for communication clues that can enhance programme development and the translation of evidence. Using translation tools: Effective translation requires that we know the language we are translating from and the language into which we are translating. Stephanie will present briefly on the four domains of learning (cognitive, emotional, spiritual and physical) and the power of analogies in designing effective communication experiences for rippling into communities. Participants will practise using a simple plastic tube to simulate an infant’s airway, and use it to explain how babies can suffocate and how safe sleep recommendations can protect them. Putting these together in a real communication situation: The session will end with a short demonstration of the standard safety briefing that goes with the issue of portable sleep spaces to vulnerable infants in some regions of New Zealand and Australia. It combines the art of translation with the science of prevention to enable understanding of infant vulnerability to accidental suffocation, and practical ways to set a baby up to be ‘safe to breathe’ when sleeping, wherever that may be...|$|R
