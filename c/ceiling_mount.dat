40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contemporary {{approaches}} {{to the treatment of}} children with cerebral palsy (CP) advocate a task-specific approach that emphasizes repetition and practice of specific tasks. Recent studies also suggest that children with CP may benefit from a body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) program in clinical settings. To explore the potential impact of greater opportunities for practice and repetition of walking tasks, this case series was undertaken 1) to develop an intervention and measurement protocol and 2) to execute and analyze the outcomes of a home-based BWSTT program to improve functional ambulation in 3 children with CP. CASE DESCRIPTION: Three children with CP at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III or IV participated in this case series. Examination procedures included use of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), the 10 -meter walk test, the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM- 66), the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT), and the Caregiver Priorities 2 ̆ 6 Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD). A multi-sport harness with an accompanying <b>ceiling</b> <b>mount</b> system was used to set up the body-weight support apparatus over a treadmill in participants homes. At the onset of the case, Participant 1 required physical assistance and manual cueing to take steps on the treadmill when using the harness for support. Participants 2 and 3 were able to take steps on the treadmill when using the harness. Parents received education and training regarding execution of the home-based BWSTT program. Parents carried out the intervention over an 8 - 12 week period at a frequency of 3 times week for 15 - 20 minute sessions with rest breaks as needed. Parents documented details regarding each session (time walking on the treadmill, number of breaks, etc.) OUTCOMES: All of the families and children reported enjoying the home-based activity and found the harness system easy to use. Participant 1 did not demonstrate improvements in any of the outcome measures administered. Participant 2 increased from a score of 2 to a score of 4 on the FAQ and progressed from a GMFCS level IV to a GMFCS Level III. Participant 3 did not show significant improvements in gait speed over the 10 -meter walk test but increased from a score of 6 to a score of 7 on the FAQ and was able to transition from using a walker as his primary assistive device to using bilateral walking poles. DISCUSSION: The 2 participants in this case who were able to take steps on the treadmill {{at the onset of the}} intervention period appeared to achieve functional gains following a home-based BWSTT program. In addition to functional gait and mobility outcomes, future research should explore the potential health and wellness benefits of the cardiovascular exercise provided though a home-based BWSTT program...|$|E

40|$|Object {{recognition}} and Localization {{is an important}} problem in computer vision and robotics. Advances in computer vision has resulted into many object recognition techniques {{but most of them}} are computationally very heavy and requires robot unit to have high processing systems. When it comes to small size embedded robotic systems, these techniques can not be applied because of the constraints of execution time. Here, a popular SURF based recognition technique is adopted and some of the important changes are addressed which make it possible to use it on small size robots with limited resources. A team of small robots are used which are given prior training to search for 2 D and 3 D objects of interest in the environment. For the localization of the robots and objects a new template, designed for passive markers based tracking, is introduced. These markers are placed on the top of each robot and they are tracked by the two <b>ceiling</b> <b>mounted</b> cameras. The information from <b>ceiling</b> <b>mounted</b> cameras and from the team of robots is used collectively to localize the object of interest in the environment...|$|R
