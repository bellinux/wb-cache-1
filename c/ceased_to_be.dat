40|$|In {{the context}} of rapid globalisation, skilled South African {{employees}} and professionals are often attracted overseas to take up new work opportunities in foreign countries. This may cause these individuals no longer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> “ordinarily resident” in South Africa. At the same time, changes in modes of travel, information and communication channels could result in companies and trusts no longer being considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tax resident in South Africa, if the place of effective management for these entities <b>is</b> moved <b>to</b> a foreign country and a double taxation agreement between South Africa and that foreign country deems these entities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exclusively resident in the foreign country. The objective of this thesis <b>was</b> <b>to</b> analyse the tax implications that could arise when a resident natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a resident or when a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. A {{detailed analysis of the}} “exit charge” in section 9 H of the Income Tax Act <b>was</b> undertaken <b>to</b> understand its normal tax implications when a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a resident or a CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. This included an analysis of how a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident or how a CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. It was found that certain normal tax principles consistently apply to when a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident or a CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a CFC. At the same time, certain unique normal tax implications arise for trusts and CFCs since they are impacted by the special tax rules that apply to these entities. Furthermore {{in the case of a}} trust, a judicial precedent has established that the “exit charge” remains and is taxable in the trust. For CFCs, there <b>is</b> uncertainty as <b>to</b> whether the “exit charge” could arise when a shareholder <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident, which results in residents no longer holding more than 50 % of the total participation or voting rights in that foreign company...|$|R
