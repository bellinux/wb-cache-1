50|$|One such {{feature is}} that the Patriarchate of Lisbon is the only Catholic see - besides the Holy See itself - that {{has the right to}} bear the Papal tiara in its {{achievement}} of arms. The coat of arms of the Patriarchate of Lisbon differs from that of the Holy See only in combining the tiara with a processional <b>cross</b> <b>crossed</b> with a pastoral staff, while the Holy See combines the crossed keys of Saint Peter. The Patriarchs themselves have the right to bear the Papal tiara in their personal coat of arms; however this has fallen into disuse, with the latter holders of the office (who, by tradition, are always made cardinals) preferring the use of the red ecclesiastical hat (galero) of cardinal.|$|E
