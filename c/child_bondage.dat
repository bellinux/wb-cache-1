5000|$|In {{many of the}} {{industries}} in which debt bondage is common like brick kilns or fisheries, entire families are often involved in paying of the debt of one individual, including children.

At the International Labour Organization Convention, this cycle was labeled as the [...] "Worst Forms of Child Labor." [...] Researchers like Basu and Chau link the occurrence of child labor through debt bondage with factors like labor rights and the stage of development of an economy.

60|$|The most {{effective}} chapters {{in the book}} were, in truth, eloquent sermons on these simple and pathetic texts. They brought Negroes and Indians within the relations of human brotherhood. They preached a higher morality towards these poor <b>children</b> of <b>bondage,</b> they inspired a new pity, they moved more generous sympathies, and they did this {{in such a way}} as not merely to affect men's feelings about Indians and Negroes, slave-labour, and the yet more hateful slave-trade, but at the same time to develop and strengthen a general feeling for justice, equality, and beneficence in all the arrangements and relations of the social union all over the world. The same movement which brought the suffering blacks of the new world within the sphere of moral duty, and invested them with rights, intensified the same notion of rights and duties in association with the suffering people of France.

The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work.

40|$|This {{project is}} an {{intellectual}} {{biography of the}} African-American social scientist Allison Davis (1902 - 1983). It uses his career and thought to investigate the history of twentieth-century American social thought, the history of social science, and African-American history. In particular, it shows how Davis’s lived experiences with race and class, {{as well as his}} first-rate formal education, made him a pioneering anthropologist and educator. After contributing to the New Negro Renaissance, Davis entered social science and published two classics, Deep South (1941) and <b>Children</b> of <b>Bondage</b> (1940). Both were theoretically and methodologically innovative, and both furthered the larger environmental revolution within social science that made clear the socially-constructed nature of human difference, and hence helped to displace essentialist views. His growing stature within the social-science community prompted the University of Chicago to hire him in 1942. This landmark appointment helped to racially integrate the faculties of other predominantly-white universities, and it made Davis an early civil rights pioneer. As a professor of education at Chicago, Davis had his largest social impact. He investigated the cultural differences between social classes, thus reconciling cultural and structural theories. His work pushed school districts across the country to abolish their use of culturally-biased intelligence tests, and it laid the intellectual foundations for the federal Head Start program. Understanding education as an instrument of democracy, Davis fought for far-reaching educational reforms, including the abolition of racial segregation. Among other achievements, his work here contributed to the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ...|$|R

25|$|Even though {{slavery is}} now outlawed in every country, {{the number of}} slaves today is {{estimated}} as between 12 million and 29.8 million. Several {{estimates of the number}} of slaves in the world have been provided. According to a broad definition of slavery used by Kevin Bales of Free the Slaves (FTS), an advocacy group linked with Anti-Slavery International, there were 27 million people in slavery in 1999, spread all over the world. In 2005, the International Labour Organization provided an estimate of 12.3 million forced labourers. Siddharth Kara has also provided an estimate of 28.4 million slaves at the end of 2006 divided into three categories: bonded labour/debt bondage (18.1 million), forced labour (7.6 million), and trafficked slaves (2.7 million). Kara provides a dynamic model to calculate the number of slaves in the world each year, with an estimated 29.2 million at the end of 2009.

We used an online survey to collect retrospective reports of a sample of 494 students of the University of Salamanca. Results show that 63 % of boys and 30 % of girls were exposed to online pornography during adolescence. Boys are more likely to have ever been exposed for more than 30 minutes. Boys are more likely to report deliberate consumption and sexual excitement seeking, whereas girls are more likely to report involuntary exposure. Both genders remember viewing a variety of images, including contents of <b>bondage,</b> <b>child</b> pornography and rape. One in six of exposed participants remember strong reactions.

Rwandan {{law does not}} prohibit all forms of trafficking in persons, though existing penal and labor code statutes prohibit slavery, forced labor, forced prostitution, and child prostitution, under which traffickers could be prosecuted. Law No. 58/2008 outlaws, but does not define, human trafficking for sexual exploitation and prescribes punishments of 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment. In May 2009, the government enacted the “Law Regulating Labor in Rwanda” (13/2009), which prohibits forced labor and prescribes punishment of three to five years’ imprisonment; it also prohibits subjecting children to slavery, <b>child</b> trafficking, debt <b>bondage,</b> forced labor, armed conflict, and child prostitution and prescribes punishment of six months to 20 years’ imprisonment for these offenses. Taken together, these penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses, such as rape. In December 2009, parliament’s Chamber of Deputies passed revisions to the penal code, which contain articles defining and prohibiting human trafficking; the penal code is now under consideration by the Senate. A separate draft comprehensive anti-trafficking bill remained under review.|$|R
