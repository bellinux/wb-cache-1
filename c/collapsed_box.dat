5000|$|A {{meeting at}} the manager’s office {{concerning}} the songwriting dissent {{was the last straw}} and, in September 1980, Hensley quit. Gregg Dechert, a Canadian who had worked with Sloman in Pulsar, came in and the band went on a 23-date tour of the UK. After that Sloman left, citing musical differences for a reason. He would later go on to work with UFO, Gary Moore and Robert Palmer. Hensley's acrimonious departure left the group in a state of <b>collapse.</b> <b>Box</b> and Bolder visited David Byron with attractive propositions. [...] "We couldn't believe it when he said he didn't want to know," [...] the guitarist remembered. Bolder, who by that time, [...] "...had had enough of Gerry Bron and the management," [...] decided to join Wishbone Ash. When Dechert left, Uriah Heep were down to just Mick Box with the name and contract. The Melody Maker headline [...] "Heap of Heep" [...] reflected the press's attitude towards the band's possible future.|$|R
50|$|According to {{objective}} collapse theories, {{wave function}} collapse {{occurs when a}} superposed systems reaches a certain objective threshold of size, complexity etc. Objective collapse proponentswould expect a system as macroscopic as a cat to have <b>collapsed</b> before the <b>box</b> was opened, so the question of observation-of-observers does not arise for them.|$|R

50|$|The {{race track}} made {{national}} headlines on April 11, 2009, when the concrete platform {{that supported the}} announcer's <b>box</b> <b>collapsed</b> shortly after the gate opened. One person was temporarily stuck in the rubble, and six people suffered minor injuries at the season-opening event. Local rescue workers were called to the scene and the events were canceled for the evening. Since the incident the platform has been repaired and reinforced.|$|R
6000|$|Really {{that young}} man took it very well. He shivered {{slightly}} and turned a little pale, that is all. Woodden rocked to and fro like a tree about to fall. I and my tin <b>box</b> <b>collapsed</b> together in the corner. Yes, I was so surprised that my legs seemed to give way under me. People began to talk, but above {{the hum of the}} conversation I heard young Somers say in a low voice: ...|$|R
50|$|The Panssarimiina m/44 is a Finnish {{anti-tank}} blast mine. It entered {{service in}} 1944 {{and was used}} during the Second World War and Continuation War. The mine used a wooden case, consisting of an upper box containing the main charge and a downward facing fuze, this was placed into a sturdy wooden tray, larger than the box. Enough pressure on the upper box resulting in the upper <b>box</b> <b>collapsing</b> into the lower tray triggering the detonator.|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} {{occurrence of}} musculoskeletal disorders from manually loading bundles of <b>collapsed</b> cardboard <b>boxes</b> onto a case-packing machine at Company XYZ places the organization {{at risk for}} incurring continued employee injuries, other production/quality losses, and financial loss. The results of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), and {{the past four years}} of OSHA recordable injury reports were analyzed to recognize and remediate measures for reducing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The research results indicate that awkward postures, high repetition, and small-range motions are all present at the case-packing line. The case-packing line currently has several administrative and engineering controls in place to prevent the occurrence of cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) and MSDs, but for the most part, ergonomic improvements to the line have been ignored. The primary recommendations of this research are that administrative and engineering controls need to be implemented to remove ergonomic-related risk factors while worker...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model of the <b>collapsing</b> of a <b>box</b> structure, {{which is to be}} used to protect a stunt motorcyclist who jumps over an elephant. Reasonable values of the model’s parameters cause it to predict that we should construct the structure out of fifty 6 in × 28 in × 28 in boxes, stacked five high, two wide, and five long. In general, the model predicts that we should use boxes whose height is one-quarter of the harmonic mean of their length and width. We discuss the assumptions, derivation, and limitations of this model...|$|R
50|$|During this period, two {{artists who}} {{taught at the}} {{university}} were important influences on Suga. Yoshishige Saito encouraged Suga and other students to take a deconstructive approach to modernism and Euro-American-centric art theory. Another influential teacher was the artist Jiro Takamatsu, whose illusionistic paintings and sculpture were central {{to the development of}} the Tokyo art scene at that time. Suga’s early work reflected this approach. In his first solo exhibition, at Tsubaki Kindai Gallery, Tokyo, in November 1968, Suga presented Space Transformation (1968) (転移空間), a freestanding structure of red-painted wood that gave the illusion of a stack of <b>boxes</b> <b>collapsing</b> under their own weight.|$|R
40|$|In 1964 {{the number}} of {{registered}} heroin addicts in Britain was 753. One of these was Anna Kavan, née Helen Woods. Beginning her writing career under the name Helen Ferguson, she wrote conventionally realist novels that enjoyed modest commercial success. In 1939 - 40, {{after a number of}} serious breakdowns and suicide attempts, and now calling herself Anna Kavan, Woods/Ferguson left a Swiss sanatorium, addicted to heroin that had almost certainly been therapeutically prescribed for sleeping disorders and severe depression. From then until her death in 1968, when she was found <b>collapsed</b> over a <b>box</b> of drugs, Kavan had an intermittent relationship with heroin. This essay examines the ways in which Kavan has been constructed as an ‘addict writer’, both by her biographers and critics, and how such a figuration has influenced critical readings of her work. Keywords Mid-century British women’s writing; Anna Kavan; Julia and the Bazooka; history of opium; heroin addiction...|$|R
50|$|When {{the defense}} succeeds in their goal of {{confusing}} the offensive linemen, major problems {{form for the}} quarterback. The term that is used when the defense is getting close to the quarterback is that the tackle <b>box</b> is <b>collapsing.</b> When the tackle <b>box</b> <b>collapses,</b> the quarterback is trained to do {{one of a few}} different things: to scramble out of the tackle box and look to gain yards by running, to get outside of the tackle box and throw the ball out of bounds, or - in extreme situations - to just take the sack and not lose possession of the football. While the pocket will always collapse eventually, situations where the pocket collapses faster than anticipated create a difficult conundrum for quarterbacks, as they are faced with a plethora of possible choices with virtually no time to choose between them. A quarterback who is able to effectively react to the pocket collapsing and salvage the play is said to have good pocket awareness or pocket presence.|$|R
50|$|The {{defense is}} trying {{to break down the}} tackle box as quickly as possible. They will try to send extra rushers to outnumber the blockers. Another tactic would be to send speed rushers off the edge to run around the tackles before they can set the depth of the tackle box. The {{defensive}} ends are sometimes able to run past the tackles and get to the quarterback before he can step up into the tackle box to protect himself better. Another maneuver that is used is the middle blitz where the defense sends multiple rushers up the middle of the line in order to get past the center and guards to <b>collapse</b> the tackle <b>box</b> and sack the quarterback. The offensive line cannot block up the middle when too many rushers are running at them. This rushes the quarterback and forces him {{to get rid of the}} ball before he is ready to do so. There are many different types of blitzes but their only purpose is to confuse the blockers and ruin the tackle box that is being formed.|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{started in}} 1968 and the {{junction}} was opened in May 1972 by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Peter Walker. The opening was delayed by several months because of [...] "box girder inspections". These followed the interim {{report of the}} Merrison Enquiry set up following the <b>collapse</b> of similar <b>box</b> girder bridges in Australia and Wales. [...] In an unusual meeting {{of old and new}} transport technology, the pillars supporting the flyovers over the Birmingham Canal Navigations had to be carefully placed to enable a horse-drawn canal boat to pass under the interchange without fouling the towing rope. The junction has undergone major repair work several times since, owing to the very heavy traffic through the junction, and some alleged cost-saving measures during its construction. In November 2007, a sliproad running from the Tyburn Road onto the Aston Expressway was closed to undergo urgent repair works. Upon inspection, it was found that Spaghetti Junction itself was in need of repair work because salt and grit had weakened the joints in the structure.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the difference between containerboard materials strength and stiffness properties in tension and compression, how the mechanisms behind compressive and tensile properties are affected by the relative humidity of the ambient air and how the relative humidity affects the compressive response of the fibre network. These properties are used to predict the lifetime performance of corrugated boxes and to prevent early <b>collapses</b> of the <b>boxes</b> and thereby waste or harm of the transported goods inside. The work also discusses the methods used to evaluate the different properties and how reliable the results are. The experimental part includes testing of linerboard and fluting materials from both virgin and recycled fibres, which have been conditioned at 50 % and 90 % relative humidity. The compression tests were filmed to evaluate if different compression failure modes can be related to the strength and stiffness of the material. The results indicated that the compressive strength and stiffness differ from the strength and stiffness values in tension at 90 % relative humidity. Compressive strength is lower in both 50 % and 90 % relative humidity compared with the tensile strength. However, the compression stiffness shows a higher value than the tensile stiffness at 90 % relative humidity. The study of the method for evaluating the compressive behaviour of the paper does not present a complete picture on what type of failure the paper actually experience...|$|R
50|$|Kirsty first {{appears in}} Hellraiser as the teenage {{daughter}} of Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and stepdaughter {{of his second}} wife Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins), Kirsty moves with her parents to England {{to the house of}} her uncle Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), who has disappeared sometime ago, but refuses to live with her parents, instead opting to live in a place of her own. When passing by her parents house one day, Kirsty sees Julia and a man enter the place and, believing Julia to be cheating on her father, follows the two inside and up to the attic of the house. It is there that Kirsty witnesses Julia attack the man and her uncle Frank, who is now a skinless entity needing to feast on the blood of others for nourishment, begin to eat him. When the man tries to escape, Frank chases after him and discovers Kirsty, whom he tries to attack, before stopping when she grabs the nearby Lemarchand's box. Realizing the puzzle box has some significance to Frank, Kirsty tosses it out a window, distracting him and allowing her to escape outside where she, after picking up the <b>box,</b> <b>collapses.</b> Found and taken to a hospital, Kirsty wakes up and, at first believing everything that has happened to be a dream, realizes she is wrong when a doctor hands her the box. Toying with the puzzle box, Kirsty solves and inadvertently summons the sadomasochistic demons known as the Cenobites and their leader, Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Kirsty bargains with the Cenobites, revealing to them that she knows where the escaped Frank is and offering them him instead of herself. After escaping from the hospital (presumably {{with the assistance of the}} Cenobites), she returns to her father's house and encounters Julia and her father, who claim Frank is dead and shows her his body. This turns out to be a ruse, as it is actually Larry who is dead, Frank having killed him and taken his skin to wear as a disguise. Trying to kill Kirsty when the Cenobites reappear, Frank accidentally stabs Julia to death and is in turn dismembered by the Cenobites with hooks. With Frank and Julia dealt with, the Cenobites turn their attention to Kirsty, who, while fleeing from them, stumbles upon Lemarchand's box which Julia's corpse is clutching and, using it, manages to banish the Cenobites back to their dimension. With the Cenobites gone, Kirsty attempts to destroy the puzzle box once and for all by burning it, but while in the midst of doing so, a man grabs it from the fire and transforms into a winged, skeletal creature before flying away.|$|R
