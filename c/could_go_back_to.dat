25|$|Louis Coulon de Villiers, who did {{not know}} when British {{reinforcements}} might arrive, sent an officer under a white flag to negotiate. Washington did not allow the Canadian officer into or near the fort, but sent two of his own men, including his translator Jacob Van Braam, to negotiate. As negotiations began, the Virginians, against Washington's orders, broke into the fort's liquor supply and got drunk. Coulon told Van Braam that all he wanted was the surrender of the garrison, and the Virginians <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Virginia. He warned, however, that if they did not surrender now, the Indians might storm the fort and scalp the entire garrison.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen cycling was {{reported}} at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About {{a third of the}} 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).|$|E
500|$|The game's French {{designer}} Éric Chahi {{had previously}} {{worked as a}} game programmer {{and then as a}} graphic designer for video games since 1983. It was the success of his earlier work with Paul Cuisset as a graphic designer for the adventure game Future Wars for Delphine Software and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop Another World [...] "without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure." [...] After Future Wars was released in 1989, Chahi had the choice either to work on Cuisset's next game, Operation Stealth, or create his own game. As [...] "there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the Amiga at that time," [...] Chahi felt confident that he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> programming.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{decided that}} to make [...] "time travel in an X-Files way", the best way was with [...] "a guy {{that turns out to}} be you". He {{therefore}} added the plot about a regretful scientist trying to stop developments from ever occurring. The scientist's character was inspired by a story Gordon heard about Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer berating Harry S. Truman on the 1945 atomic bombings of Japan, and the writer wondered [...] "What if Oppenheimer <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the past and 'uninvent' the bomb?". Eventually Gordon and Greenwalt found another philosophical question that becomes Jason's motivation to halt his own research—"Life itself is about the unknown and discovering what is in front of us. But if everyone, or maybe some people, knew what would happen, that would create a new set of horrors, and it would need to be stopped". The script took over a week of writing, with sessions of 15 daily hours and the contributions of John Shiban, Frank Spotnitz and Ken Horton. Gordon was still reworking the teleplay the weekend before shooting began in Vancouver, including the removal of two [...] "useless characters" [...] that included a Stephen Hawking-inspired scientist in a wheelchair. David Duchovny declared that a few scenes were created during production [...] "because no one could know if the audience understood what was happening".|$|E

2500|$|Matt Taibbi {{described}} the Greenspan put and its bad consequences saying: [...] "every time the banks blew up a speculative bubble, they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Fed and borrow money at zero or {{one or two}} percent, and then start the game all over", thereby making it [...] "almost impossible" [...] for the banks to lose money. He also called Greenspan a [...] "classic con man" [...] who, through political savvy, [...] "flattered and bullshitted {{his way up the}} Matterhorn of American power and...jacked himself off to the attention of Wall Street for 20 consecutive years".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there had}} been some missteps in Edwin Earhart's career up to that point, in 1907 his job as a claims officer for the Rock Island Railroad led to a {{transfer}} to Des Moines, Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10, Earhart saw her first aircraft at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at the rickety [...] "flivver" [...] was enough for Earhart, who promptly asked if they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the merry-go-round. She later described the biplane as [...] "a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting".|$|E
2500|$|Marc Alexander Hunter {{was born}} in Taumarunui on 7 September 1953. In the late 1950s his family {{performed}} publicly where his father, Stuart, played saxophone, his mother, Voi, on piano and his older brother, Todd Hunter (born 1951), on guitar with Marc providing drums. He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, [...] "We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. He was {{two years older than}} me and always more interested in music. I only saw it as a way of wagging school." [...] He described his home town, [...] " [...] was a great place to grow up in, and a great place to run away from, because you always knew you <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it and nothing much would have changed. It was the place where our parents always told us to 'Do what you want to do, just try and be happy doing it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lew Alcindor {{finished}} {{his career at}} UCLA in 1969 with a third consecutive national championship when the Bruins beat George King's Purdue team 92–72 in the title game. The three straight titles were matched by three consecutive MVP awards in the tournament as Alcindor established himself as college basketball's superstar during the three–peat performance. A sportswriter commented that everybody outside of UCLA would be happy that glorious day in June when Alcindor finally graduated and college basketball <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the routine method of determining a national champion. This prophecy {{would prove to be}} ludicrous over the next six years. The 1970 squad proved that nobody was indispensable {{to the success of the}} UCLA program, not even Alcindor, as Sidney Wicks, Henry Bibby, Curtis Rowe, John Vallely, and Kenny Booker carried the Bruins to their fourth consecutive NCAA title 80–69 over upstart Jacksonville, coached by Joe Williams. Wicks and Rowe double teamed 7-foot Artis Gilmore on defense and shut down the high-powered Jacksonville offense, which had been averaging 100 points per game. Gilmore and 5'10" [...] Rex Morgan had been dubbed [...] "Batman and Robin" [...] by the press.|$|E

2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
2500|$|Bianca and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) form a {{friendship}} {{and set up}} a market stall together. Liam plays truant from school and Bianca worries when the police tell her she may face prison again if Liam does not return. Bianca discovers that Liam is involved in a mugging and that he has some dubious new friends. When Liam does not come home, she goes to an estate to confront the gang and collect Liam [...] but he decides to stay with the gang and when he does come home, Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang. She seeks advice from Ava Hartman (Clare Perkins), whose son Dexter Hartman (Khali Best) used to be in a gang. Liam returns to the gang and eventually they are arrested and released on police bail. They blame Liam and he is stabbed but is not seriously injured. When Bianca lets Liam stay at home alone, Kane sneaks in and invites Liam back to the gang. Bianca finds them as Kane is attacking Liam and attacks Kane; he is arrested. Bianca allows Liam to stay with his father. When Bianca, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) break into Ian's restaurant, Shirley accidentally starts a fire. Bianca worries that she <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> prison, and tells Whitney, who has been blamed for it.
