40|$|About {{one-third of}} the general {{practices}} in the Oxfordshire Health District have access to beds in <b>community</b> <b>hospitals</b> as well as district general hospitals. Hospital Activity Analysis data were {{used to calculate the}} average number of hospital beds occupied daily by patients registered with each general practice in the district. Practices with and without access to <b>community</b> <b>hospitals</b> were compared to determine whether such access was associated with a reduction in the use of beds in general medical, geriatric, and other specialties, and an increase in overall utilisation rates. The rate of use of general medical and geriatric beds in district general hospitals by practice populations with access to <b>community</b> <b>hospitals</b> was about half that of populations without such access.

40|$|CONTEXT. Although {{hospitals}} have devoted substantial resources to critical pathways, {{it is not}} known whether they routinely evaluate the clinical or economic effects of these pathways.

Hospitals participating in consortia for improving quality of care asso-ciated with the Institute of Health Care Improvement and the VHA, Inc.

40|$|Background: While the {{majority}} of healthcare in the US is provided in <b>community</b> <b>hospitals,</b> the epidemiology and treatment of bloodstream infections in this setting is unknown. Methods and Findings: We undertook this multicenter, retrospective cohort study to 1) describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections (BSI) in a network of <b>community</b> <b>hospitals</b> and 2) determine risk factors for inappropriate therapy for bloodstream infections in <b>community</b> <b>hospitals.</b> 1, 470 patients were identified as having a BSI in 9 <b>community</b> <b>hospitals</b> in the southeastern US from 2003 through 2006. The majority of BSIs were community-onset, healthcare associated (n = 823, 56 %); 432 (29 %) patients had community-acquired BSI, and 215 (15 %) had hospital-onset, healthcare-associated BSI. BSIs due to multidrug-resistant pathogens occurred in 340 patients (23 %). Overall, the three most common pathogens were S...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{previous}} film's financial success, Boogeyman 2 was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December {{of the same year}} with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista <b>Community</b> <b>Hospital,</b> over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural entity, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E
5|$|Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine {{established}} a medical training program within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Biomedical Science in 2004. Plans originally {{called for the}} construction of a new teaching hospital in coordination with Boca Raton <b>Community</b> <b>Hospital</b> on the main campus. Following successive budgets deficits in 2007, the hospital delayed its participation indefinitely. However, Florida Atlantic later established its own College of Medicine in 2010. The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) also joined the university in 2007, creating Florida Atlantic's seventh campus. To bring HBOI into the university family the Florida Legislature allocated $44 million to Florida Atlantic to acquire the institution.|$|E

5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with <b>community,</b> <b>hospital,</b> or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate over}} the route for the {{remainder}} of the Green Line was finally resolved in December 1984. Residents and D.C. government officials asked WMATA to build stations at Congress Heights and Southern Avenue in order to promote economic development and provide service to St. Elizabeths Hospital and Greater Southeast <b>Community</b> <b>Hospital.</b> In December 1984, WMATA's Board of Directors agreed to return the Green Line to its original route, and build the Congress Heights and Southern Avenue stations. The U.S. district court approved WMATA's decision and dissolved its March 1982 injunction, which had barred construction of the $483 million southern Green Line (now estimated to cost $132 million more than the Rosecroft route).|$|E

Treloar was subsequently admitted to the Canberra <b>Community</b> <b>Hospital</b> where he died on 28January {{as a result of an}} intestinal haemorrhage.

A {{waterfront}} house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida stood in for the Castillos' home.

5|$|Boogeyman 2 {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2006 {{due to the}} financial success of its predecessor with Jeff Betancourt, film editor of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, When a Stranger Calls and The Grudge 2, making his directorial debut and Brian Sieve attached as writer. The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in Los Angeles, California. It was produced by Ghost House Pictures, a film production company created by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert which specializes in creating horror films. Betancourt stated {{that he wanted to}} avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version of the creature in the film. As a result, and due to the film's low budget, he focused especially on the atmosphere and writing. Storyboards were used extensively to plan out the film and minimize wasted effort and resources by make-up artists on unused prosthetics; the limited budget meant that most effects could only be filmed once. The former hospital Linda Vista <b>Community</b> <b>Hospital</b> served as the primary filming location for the mental institution.|$|E
