5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, {{including}} eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour. The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E
5|$|He made {{a painful}} single in 25 minutes of batting {{before it became}} too much. The {{bruising}} severely restricted his mobility and breathing, and he turned down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run. Barnes {{was taken from the}} ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days. He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell for single figures in the second innings. After the Test, Barnesstill injuredmissed the ten-wicket victory over Middlesex at Lord's. The match was Australia's only fixture between Tests.|$|E

5|$|The score had {{progressed to}} 121 when Barnes {{tried to cut}} Laker, but only edged it onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit {{the ball into the}} ground before Evans took the catch, and {{consulted}} with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side of}} the field, before ruling the batsman out. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck in Laker's next over without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which drifted away and went straight on instead of turning inwards, thereby clipping the outside edge of his bat. The ball flew to slip where Edrich completed the catch. The hard-hitting Miller had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 4, a position usually occupied by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, a more sedate batsman, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed.|$|E

All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day. Brown came in, but he looked unaccustomed to batting in the middle order. The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of the ball to attack the spinners, hitting them through the off side. Yardley took the second new ball, but this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and in the first 40 minutes after lunch, 43 runs were added. Yardley then took the second new ball. Bradman struck his first boundary in more than 80 minutes but the run rate remained low. Australia passed England's total before Yardley brought himself on to bowl and removed Brown. This ended a 64-run stand with Bradman in 58 minutes, and Hassett came in at 4/185. Following the departure of Brown, the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.|$|E

25|$|Macalester {{was largely}} carried through {{financial}} hardship {{and brought to}} prominence by Dr. James Wallace, father of DeWitt Wallace. Wallace was acting president of the college from 1894 to 1900, president from 1900 to 1906, and professor until just {{before his death in}} 1939. After World War II, the college developed a reputation for internationalism under the presidency of Charles Turck (later the namesake of Turck Hall), who recruited overseas and created a more diverse student body. Macalester's positive reputation grew during the 1960s, when it consistently drew many National Merit Scholars, enough to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> the country's top ten. During this time the college also benefitted greatly from DeWitt Wallace's success with Reader's Digest. Macalester continued to develop into the 1990s, building its endowment and adding new facilities and equipment.|$|E

He made his List A debut for {{the state in the}} 2012–13 Ryobi One-Day Cup, replacing the injured Adam Voges. In the match against Victoria at the WACA Ground, Bosisto was run out for a duck after facing five balls in Western Australia's innings, having <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> number six in the batting order. Bosisto's first-class debut came the following season, in the 2013–14 edition of the Sheffield Shield. He scored 44 runs in the second innings of his debut match, which included a 124-run partnership with Marcus North (118 not out) for the third wicket.

25|$|In 2009, Paine was {{selected}} for the national squad for the One Day International series against England, shortly after {{the conclusion of the}} Ashes Test series, when incumbent wicketkeeper Brad Haddin returned home for surgery on a broken finger. Paine made his ODI debut in a one-off match against Scotland, scoring 29 not out from 38 balls in Australia's total of 345 all out. He then took a single catch, as they were eventual victors by 189 runs. Paine made his International Twenty20 (T20) debut against England in early September at Old Trafford, ahead of the upcoming seven match ODI series between the two teams. England were in trouble at 2/4 (two wickets for four runs), in reply to Australia's 145, before rain caused the match to be abandoned. Paine was not required to bat, as he was listed to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> the traditional wicket-keepers' position of seven. The second and final T20 match of the short series was also abandoned without a ball being bowled.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with {{defending}} champions England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Sthalekar dismissed top-scorer Sarah Taylor in the 12th overs, before removing Jenny Gunn and Danielle Hazell in the 14th and 16th overs. This sparked a collapse as England lost their last seven wickets for 29 runs, including their last four without further {{addition to the}} total, as England were dismissed with 15 balls unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia had lost momentum and lost 3/3 in 16 balls before Sthalekar, who had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>at</b> No. 8, was joined at the crease by Alyssa Healy with the score on 7/63 and 42 runs needed from 34 balls. The pair put on 23 from 13 balls to help regain the initiative before Healy was out. Sthalekar was then out for 10 from 11 balls, leaving Australia at 9/97, with eight runs required from the last seven balls. Australia seven runs from the next four balls before Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
