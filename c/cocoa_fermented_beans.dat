The cocoa beans of 40 cm mass depth were kept in 53 x 40 x 50 cm rattan buckets and were fermented for 5 days. Beans stirring during fermentation was conducted either by in-place stirring andreplace-stirring to other rattan bucket. Stirring period was set for each 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours of fermentation time. Beans temperature, pH, and total sugar content for each stirring period along five days-fermentationtime were recorded. The <b>fermented</b> <b>beans</b> were sundried for moisture content of approximately 6 %. The results showed that the beans temperature during fermentation increased up to 45. 7 - 46. 6 oC on the third-day and then decreased to 37. 9 - 40. 4 oC on the fifth-day. The highest temperature (46. 6 oC) was recorded for in-place stirring with stirring period of 48 hours. The pH value of the beans decreased from 5. 6 - 5. 9 on the first-day to 3. 2 - 3. 4 on the fourth-day and then slightly increased to 3. 4 in average on the fifth-day.

40|$|Basic {{of cocoa}} bean {{preparation}} process is fermentation. Fermentation is done especially {{to improve and}} build specific chocolate flavour of cocoa bean and its products, i. e. cocoa liquor, butter, and powder; and also to decrease the disliked flavors, like bitter and acid. Research of cocoa bean fermentation was hold on in Subak Abian Pucaksari, Tabanan. This research involved 20 cooperative farmers with 0, 5 hectare farm area per each farmer. The treatment used was time of cocoa bean fermentation, i. e. without fermentation, not fully fermentation (4 days), and fully fermentation (5 days). Variables observed were dried cocoa beans physic and chemical quality, and also cocoa products chemical and organoleptic quality. Organoleptic test done to cocoa liquor and powder was descriptive and ranking test used 15 semi-trained panelists. The result showed that the fermentation process had significant influence to dried cocoa beans chemical quality and its products. Fermentation had no significant influence to dried cocoa beans physic quality. For organoleptic quality attributes, all panelists gave the highest rank for cocoa liquor and powder prepared from fully <b>fermented</b> <b>cocoa</b> <b>bean...</b>|$|R
40|$|This project {{recommends}} a {{design for a}} cocoa processing plant to produce cocoa liquor, powder, and butter from <b>fermented</b> <b>cocoa</b> <b>beans,</b> in accordance with US Patent 6, 066, 350. The recommended design minimizes the use of external utilities by optimizing various heat integration strategies. The plant has a capacity of 120, 000 tonnes/year and will be located in Tema, Ghana. The proposed design yields 25, 000 tonnes/year of alkalized cocoa liquor with 54 % fat, 52, 000 tonnes/year of cocoa butter, 36, 000 tonnes/year of 3 % fat alkalized cocoa powder, and 9, 000 tonnes/year of below 0. 5 % fat alkalized cocoa powder. The cocoa butter and powders made in this process are of Food Grade quality and are compliant with FDA regulations, and have less than 1 PPM residual solvent concentrations. A total permanent investment of $ 19 M is required. Despite this, the process has an estimated IRR of 33. 5 % and an NPV of $ 29 M. It is recommended that the company bring this plant into operation and commence additional research, with emphasis in the cocoa powder market, {{and the effectiveness of}} solvent extraction and removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{biochemical}} reactions occurring inside cocoa beans during fermentation {{are mostly}} due to penetration of lactic and acetic acids issued from microbial activities. In the present study, fresh, ripe cocoa beans {{were subjected to}} three fermentation-like incubation schemes: incubation for 2 days at pH 4 in a solution of acetic acid, lactic acid, or both, followed by a 3 -days incubation at pH 5 in acetic acid solution. After each treatment applied, the fermentation index was above 1 and a cut test revealed a brown color, characteristic of well-fermented beans. As shown by RP-HPLC-ESI(−) -MS/MS analysis, the main flavan- 3 -ols found in German Cocoa (Amelonado group) and ICS 40 (Trinitario group) ranked as follows: epicatechin > C 1 > B 2 > catechin > B 5 > dehydrodiepicatechin A. In both natural fermentations and fermentation-like incubations, these compounds showed a sharp decrease, this effect being strongest when acetic acid was present from the start. Lactic acid exhibited a somewhat polyphenol-protective effect. Two procyanidins with a molecular weight of 576, undetected before fermentation, were evidenced {{here for the first}} time in both incubated and naturally <b>fermented</b> <b>cocoa</b> <b>beans...</b>|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing of dark {{chocolate}} and other cocoa-based products {{is a complex}} multistage process beginning with spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation driven in the postharvest period by different microorganisms derived from the environment. Cocobiota defined as the association of microbial species involved in cocoa bean fermentation may have considerable impact on the medicinal properties of cocoa products via various primary and secondary metabolites, whose presence in {{dark chocolate}} and other cocoa-derived products {{has to be taken}} into consideration when analyzing medicinal effects of cocoa. Metabolites of acetic acid and lactic acid bacteria, two major cocobiota members, are recently shown to have considerable antifungal and cholesterol-lowering activities and promote the formation of short chain fatty acids and mannitol, an important prebiotic capable of modifying gut microbiota. Penicillium citrinum, a major type of fungi identifiable in <b>fermented</b> <b>cocoa</b> <b>beans,</b> produces a thermostable alkaloid, Penicitrinine A, as well as lovastatin, compounds with antineoplastic and cholesterol-lowering abilities, respectively. Moreover, recent results suggest that bacterial and fungal metabolites produced by cocobiota have a significant anti-infective potential. Therefore, various metabolites produced by cocobiota can mimic some medicinal effects of dark chocolate and other cocoa-derived products previously attributed to cocoa flavonoids and methylxanthines and need to be thoroughly investigated in in vitro and in vivo systems...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{encapsulation}} on {{the viability}} of potential probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum exposed to high acidity condition and presence of bile salts WF Tee, R Nazaruddin, YN Tan and MK Ayob This study investigated the survival of encapsulated potential probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum which isolated from <b>fermented</b> <b>cocoa</b> <b>beans.</b> k-carrageenan was used to encapsulate the probiotic. Encapsulation techniques such as emulsification, freeze-drying or extrusion were adopted to encapsulate the probiotic. Freeze-drying and extrusion methods showed higher (p< 0. 05) efficiency (89. 48 3. 21 and 92. 26 1. 45 %, respectively) in encapsulating the probiotic compared to the emulsification method (82. 190. 71 % effi-ciency). Freeze-dried encapsulated probiotic L. plantarum was selected for further survival analysis as greater amount of beads were produced compared to the extrusion method. Freeze-dried probiotic {{was found to have}} significantly (p< 0. 05) higher tolerance to acid at pH 2 with higher survival percentage compared to non-encapsulated probiotic. However, freeze-drying encapsulation was proven not to enhance the resistance of the probiotic to bile salt as evidenced by the one log colony reduction as for the non-encapsulated probiotic. Further modification of freeze-drying encapsulation technique is needed to enhance the survival of the encapsulated potential probiotic L. plantarum toward bile salt in the future...|$|R
