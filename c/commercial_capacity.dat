5|$|The {{profile of}} the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, {{with a number of}} athletes {{becoming}} household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith-Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the <b>commercial</b> <b>capacity</b> of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and prominent cases, such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.|$|E

The deposits of California and New Mexico were mined by pre-Columbian Native Americans using stone tools, some local and some {{from as far away as}} central Mexico.

2500|$|The town {{continued}} to grow, and slowly ended its isolation after the American Civil War. The war itself {{had little effect}} on Santa Barbara. One troop of cavalry organized to join the Union cause, but never saw action against Confederate forces; they served briefly and bloodlessly in Arizona versus Apache raids. [...] In 1869, the first coeducational preparatory school in southern California, Santa Barbara College, opened at State and Anapamu Streets. [...] Improvements in the harbor included the building of Stearns Wharf in 1872, which increased the <b>commercial</b> <b>capacity</b> of the port; formerly, ships had to anchor several miles offshore, and load and unload their cargoes by rowing small boats to the shore. [...] In that same year, Jose Lobero built an opera house (at the current site of the Lobero Theatre), State Street was paved, and gas lamps were lit downtown.|$|E
60|$|This {{does not}} for a moment imply that cities of the density of our {{existing}} great cities will spread to these limits. Even {{if we were to}} suppose the increase of the populations of the great cities to go on at its present rate, this enormous extension of available area would still mean a great possibility of diffusion. But though most great cities are probably still very far from their maxima, though the network of feeding railways has still to spread over Africa and China, and though huge areas are still imperfectly productive for want of a cultivating population, yet it is well to remember that for each great city, quite irrespective of its available spaces, a maximum of population is fixed. Each great city is sustained finally by the trade and production of a certain proportion of the world's surface--by the area it commands commercially. The great city cannot grow, except as a result of some quite morbid and transitory process--to be cured at last by famine and disorder--beyond the limit the <b>commercial</b> <b>capacity</b> of that commanded area prescribes. Long before the population of this city, with its inner circle a third of the area of Belgium, rose towards the old-fashioned city density, this restriction would come in. Even if we allowed for considerable increase in the production of food stuffs in the future, it still remains inevitable that the increase of each city in the world must come at last upon arrest.|$|E

Beginning in 1869 John Leamy appears in the city directory as a restauranteur in the same place, continuing until 1871; in 1876 John Ohl is listed as proprietor of a restaurant and saloon.
