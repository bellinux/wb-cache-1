40|$|Background Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the {{defining}} pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Increasing {{the quantity of}} the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) post-translational modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins slows neurodegeneration and blocks the formation of NFTs in a tauopathy mouse model. It remains unknown, however, if O-GlcNAc can influence the formation of amyloid plaques {{in the presence of}} tau pathology. Results We treated double transgenic TAPP mice, which express both mutant human tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP), with a highly selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of the enzyme responsible <b>for</b> removing O-GlcNAc (<b>OGA)</b> to increase O-GlcNAc in the brain. We find that increased O-GlcNAc levels block cognitive decline in the TAPP mice and this effect parallels decreased β-amyloid peptide levels and decreased levels of amyloid plaques. Conclusions This study indicates that increased O-GlcNAc can influence β-amyloid pathology in the presence of tau pathology. The findings provide good support <b>for</b> <b>OGA</b> as a promising therapeutic target to alter disease progression in Alzheimer disease...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper concerns the accurate On-Ground Attitude (<b>OGA)</b> reconstruction <b>for</b> the astrometry spacecraft Gaia in the presence of disturbance and control torques acting on the spacecraft. The reconstruction of the expected environmental torques which influence the spacecraft dynamics will be also investigated. The telemetry data from the spacecraft will include the on-board real time attitude which is of order of several arcsec. This raw attitude is the starting point for the further attitude reconstruction. The OGA will use the inputs from the field coordinates of known stars (attitude stars) and also the field coordinate differences of objects on the Sky Mapper (SM) and Astrometric Field (AF) payload instruments to improve this raw attitude. The on-board attitude determination uses Kalman Filter (KF) to minimize the attitude errors and produce more accurate attitude estimation than the pure star tracker measurement. Therefore the first approach <b>for</b> the <b>OGA</b> will be an adapted version of KF. Furthermore, we will design a batch least squares algorithm to investigate having more accurate OGA estimation. Finally, a comparison between these different attitude determination techniques in terms of accuracy, robustness, speed and memory required will be evaluated in order to choose the best attitude algorithm <b>for</b> the <b>OGA.</b> The expected resulting accuracy <b>for</b> the <b>OGA</b> determination will be on the order of milli-arcsec...|$|R

Additionally, we present a dictionary with coherence M and a 12 (M− 1 + 1) -sparse signal <b>for</b> which <b>OGA</b> fails to pick up any atoms from the support, showing that the above threshold is sharp. We also {{show that the}} Pure Greedy Algorithm (PGA) matches the rate of convergence of the best m-term approximation beyond the saturation limit of m− 12...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs part of {{the study}} on TiO 2 -heterogeneous {{photocatalytic}} degradation of citric acid (Cit), degradation of 3 -oxoglutaric acid (OGA, 5 mM, pH 2. 8), one of the main intermediates of Cit, was analyzed. As reactive -ketodicarboxylic acid, OGA decays rapidly in ambient dark conditions to acetoacetic acid and acetone. The photocatalytic reaction over TiO 2 underUVlight is thus affected by this thermal pathway and, in addition to the products found in dark conditions, other carboxylic acids like lactic, pyruvic, glyoxylic and acetic acid were detected and quantified. TOC decrease is proven due mostly by the thermal reaction. Kinetic parameters for both thermal and photochemical reactions were obtained from the experimental data, and mechanisms for the TiO 2 -photocatalytic degradation were proposed <b>for</b> <b>OGA</b> and its intermediates. The interplay between OGA thermal and photocatalytic decay is verified, a subject not very much described in the literature...|$|R
