40|$|A 34 -year-old {{woman who}} {{presented}} with hearing loss and tinnitus {{was found to}} have reduced vision bilaterally. Computed tomography scan revealed bilateral acoustic neuromas and bilateral optic nerve sheath meningiomas. The presence of bilateral acoustic neuromas fulfils the criteria for the diagnosis of <b>central</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (neurofibromatosis type 2). Although this is the first report of bilateral optic nerve sheath meningioma in neurofibromatosis type 2, meningiomas are commoner in this dominantly inherited disorder, than in its absence and both forms of central nervous system tumour may be caused by loss of tumour suppressor genes on chromosome 22...|$|E

40|$|Three {{patients}} with the <b>central</b> type of <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> who on CT showed multiple subependymal calcified deposits, are presented. The literature on intracranial non-tumourous calcifications in neurofibromatosis is briefly reviewed. On {{the basis of our}} findings and the literature, it is proposed that such intracranial calcified deposits may be part of the neurofibromatosis syndrome and are caused by calcium deposits in glial proliferations, analogous to the calcified deposits seen in tuberous sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis (NF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common genetic disorders. Inherited in an {{autosomal}} dominant fashion, this phacomatosis is classified into two genetically distinct subtypes characterized by multiple cutaneous lesions and tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), also referred to as Recklinghausen's disease, affects about 1 in 3500 individuals and presents with a variety of characteristic abnormalities of the skin and the peripheral nervous system. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2), previously termed <b>central</b> <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> is much more rare occurring in less than 1 in 25 000 individuals. Often first clinical signs of NF 2 become apparent in the late teens with a sudden loss of hearing due to the development of bi-or unilateral vestibular schwannomas. In addition NF 2 patients may suffer from further nervous tissue tumors such as meningiomas or gliomas. This review summarizes the characteristic features of the two forms of NF and outlines commonalities and distinctions between NF 1 and NF 2...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is {{now known}} {{to be more than}} one disease. NF 2, {{formerly}} classified as <b>central</b> <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, previously termed "acoustic neuromas", and is much less common than NF 1. Lens opacities at an early age have been described in approximately 85 % of NF 2 patients. PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of retinal abnormalities in NF 2 patients. METHODS: We prospectively examined 15 consecutive patients who met the diagnostic criteria of NF 2. RESULTS: We observed an epiretinal membrane in the macular or paramacular area in 12 of 15 patients, and a combined pigment epithelial and retinal hamartoma in the macula of one patient who also had an epiretinal membrane in the macula of the other eye. Additionally, 11 patients had central posterior cortical, subcapsular, or peripheral cortical lens opacities. CONCLUSIONS: Children or young patients with epiretinal membranes, combined pigment epithelial retinal hamartoma, and lens opacities that are not the result of other ocular disorders should have a neurologic evaluation and a careful family history for NF 2...|$|E
