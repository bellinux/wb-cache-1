40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is an integral}} concept for achieving quality of limits, interdependence, fundamentals and equity. Virtual reality means existing or resulting in essence or effect though not in actual fact, form, or name. Machine design is always interesting for most people, it is also {{becoming more and more}} popular now a days. Showing the performance of a machine design during the design phase is possible to do using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. <b>Car</b> lifting <b>equipment</b> is a device to lift a car for several workshop purposes as replace oil, fix car&# 65533;s break, overhaul engine, periodical maintenance and many others. Conventional <b>car</b> lifting <b>equipment</b> design needs a lot of cost, time, and materials because it needs doing the real test to understand the performance of the <b>car</b> lifting <b>equipment</b> design. The primary target of this research is to search and decide which mechanism is the most suitable for this machine and also the virtual reality to show its performance during the design phase. In this research, sustainable product development using virtual reality with 3 D Max and ANSYS software is used rather than conventional design. The goal of this research is to show the performance of the machine during the design phase using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. Finally, <b>car</b> lifting <b>equipment</b> has been designed in this research using 3 D Max and ANSYS software as a solution of sustainable product development. Designing <b>car</b> lifting <b>equipment</b> using 3 D Max and ANSYS virtual reality software can reduce materials, cost and time of product development. Virtual reality using 3 D Max and ANSYS software is a sustainable technology for sustainable product development in the <b>car</b> lifting <b>equipment</b> design...|$|R

40|$|Building {{interfaces}} {{where the}} user-system communication relies on speech is often {{motivated by the}} added value expected from speech: a more natural, efficient communication that also frees the hands (and the eyes) of the user. However, when developing such an interface, one has to remember that just like other systems, spoken interfaces require a proper design, implying an adequate analysis of the user's needs throughout the dialogue. The VODIS project {{has led to the}} design and development of a spoken interface for the control of <b>car</b> <b>equipment.</b> Due to the workload caused by the task of driving the vehicle, spoken communication provides a potentially safe and efficient mode of controlling the <b>car</b> <b>equipment.</b> Here we report the main characteristics of the central module of the system, the Dialogue Manager, designed and implemented by IPO, which comprises the necessary components aimed at achieving the goal of a robust and efficient dialogue system. We mainly concentrate on two important activities carried out in the project: the integration of the various modules into a task model taking into account the characteristics of a spoken command dialogue, and the necessity of customizing parts of the system to spoken communication...|$|R
