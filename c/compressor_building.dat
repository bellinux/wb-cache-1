50|$|The Jualpa Mining Camp, {{also known}} as the Last Chance Basin Camp, is a former gold mining camp, just outside the city of Juneau, Alaska. Its main {{building}} is now operated as the Last Chance Mining Museum by the Gastineau Historical Society. The camp was located on the southern banks of Gold Creek, about 1 mi north of Juneau, near what is now the end of Basin Road. The camp was the site of one of the largest gold finds in the Juneau mining district. It was established between 1910 and 1913 by the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company and operated until 1944, producing more than $80 million worth of gold. The largest surviving structure of the camp is its air <b>compressor</b> <b>building,</b> which was 84 ft long, and still houses the compressor used by the company. Also surviving are a variety of railroad-related resources, which the company used to bring or to its mill on the Gastineau channel, an electrical transformer house, powder magazine, and cable hoist.|$|E
50|$|Starting from 1996 the Dutch oil and {{gas company}} NAM {{installed}} {{over a period of}} 10 years 20 large E-motor driven (with variable speed drive) gas compressors of 23 MW fully equipped with active magnetic bearings on both the E-motor and the compressor. These compressors are used in the Groningen gas field to extract the remaining gas from this large gas field and to increase the field capacity. The motor-compressor design was done by Siemens and the active magnetic bearings were delivered by Waukesha Bearings (owned by Dover Corporation). (Originally these bearings were designed by Glacier, this company was later taken over by Federal Mogul and is now part of Waukesha Bearings.) By using active magnetic bearings and a direct drive between motor and compressor (without the gearbox in between) and applying dry gas seals, a full dry-dry (oil free) system has been installed. Applying active magnetic bearings in the driver and in the compressor (compared to the traditional configuration with a gearbox, plain bearings and a gasturbine-driver) results in a relatively simple system with a very wide operating range and high efficiencies (particularly at partial load). As done in the Groningen field, the full installation can additionally be placed outdoors without the need for a large <b>compressor</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E

40|$|This Operations, Maintenance, and Monitoring Report (OMMR) {{presents}} the findings, observations, and results from {{operation of the}} air sparging (AS) interim measure (IM) for Hot Spot (HS) Areas 1, 2, and 5 at the Converter <b>Compressor</b> <b>Building</b> (CCB) located at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. The objective of the IM at CCB HS Areas 1, 2, and 5 is to decrease concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater in the treatment zones via AS to levels that will enable a transition to a monitored natural attenuation (MNA) phase. This OMMR presents system operations and maintenance (O&M) information and performance monitoring results since full-scale O&M began in June 2014 (2 months after initial system startup in April 2014), including quarterly performance monitoring events in July and October 2014 and January and May 2015. Based on the results to date, the AS system is operating as designed and is meeting the performance criteria and IM objective. The performance monitoring network is adequately constructed for assessment of IM performance at CCB HS Areas 1, 2, and 5. At the March 2014 KSC Remediation Team (KSCRT) Meeting, team consensus was reached for the design prepared for expansion of the system to treat the HS 4 area, and at the November 2014 KSCRT Meeting, team consensus was reached that HS 3 was adequately delineated horizontally and vertically and for selection of AS for the remedial approach for HS 3. At the July 2015 KSCRT meeting, team consensus was reached to continue IM operations in all zones until HSs 3 and 4 is operational, once HS 3 and 4 zones are operational discontinue operations in HS 1, 2, and 5 zones where concentrations are less than GCTLs to observe whether rebounding conditions occur. Team consensus was also reached to continue quarterly performance monitoring to determine whether operational zones achieve GCTLs and to continue annual IGWM of CCB-MW 0012, CCBMW 0013, and CCB-MW 0056, located south of the treatment area.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} a substantial maturing of long life Stirling-cycle cryocoolers built upon the heritage of the flexure-bearing cryocoolers from Oxford University, and have seen the emergence of mature pulse tube cryocoolers competing head-to-head with the Stirling cryocoolers. Hydrogen sorption cryocoolers, Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers with rare earth regenerators, and helium Joule-Thomson cryocoolers have also made tremendous progress in opening up applications in the 4 K to 10 K temperature range. Tactical Stirling cryocoolers, now commonplace in the defense industry, are finding application {{in a number of}} cost­ constrained commercial applications and space missions, and are achieving ever longer lives as they move to linear-drive, clearance-seal <b>compressors.</b> <b>Building</b> on this expanding availability of commercially viable cryocoolers, numerous new applications are being enabled; many of these involve infrared imaging systems, and high­ temperature superconductors in the medical and communications fields. The vibration sensitivity of many of the infrared and medical imaging applications has led to the recognition that cryocooler-generated vibration and EMI is a critical performance parameter for these applications. In response, advanced closed-loop active vibration control systems have been developed and are being delivered to their first users. Application experiments, designed to explore, troubleshoot and resolve product integration issues, are occurring on an ever widening front, particularly in the fields of infrared imaging and spectroscopy, gamma-ray spectroscopy, and high-temperature superconductor applications.

The statistical verification of the function adaptation has been preceded in the article by verifying the adaptation of the linear function. The major advance on the classic approach is that the explanatory variables have been redefined. The calculation has been based upon the quarterly financial results of companies between 1994 and 1999 from the following industries: shoes, paper and cardboard, pumps and <b>compressors,</b> general <b>building</b> industry, and civil engineering. The source of the data was the „Industry Analysis” drawn up by the Polish Bank of Export Development.

40|$|Noise {{radiated}} {{from high}} speed centrifugal compressors {{is becoming a}} significant design factor. The dominant noise components of a centrifugal compressor can be identified at its blade passing frequencies (BPFs), of which each is a strong tonal noise. Popular noise control methods of a centrifugal <b>compressor</b> includes <b>building</b> of sound insulation enclosure, wrapping of noise insulation materials, mounting of vibration absorbers, and etc. These noise control methods are more effective for broadband noise reduction. Thus, they are generally ineffective to reduce a tonal noise such as the BPF components of the centrifugal compressor. In this thesis, a quarter-wavelength resonator array installed at the outlet pipe of a single-stage centrifugal compressor is studied, which is aimed to reduce the tonal noise of the compressor. In order to optimally design the quarter-wavelength resonators, numerical simulations are performed by using a commercial software package, COMSOL Multiphysics ? Acoustics Module. The optimization procedure is to optimally select geometric design parameters of the quarter-wavelength resonator array such as the diameter and depth of each resonator, and the spacing between the resonators in the axial and circumferential directions. The next procedure is to investigate the effect of four different configurations (i. e., staggered and slanted resonators and the resonators mounted on an expansion pipe and a curved pipe) on the noise reduction performance. Then, the analyses of flow effects on the noise reduction performance of the resonator array are conducted both numerically and experimentally. The high speed air flow induced by the compressor results in wavenumber shifts of noise waves, thus influencing the tonal noise reduction performance of the resonator array. The numerical flow effect analyses are conducted by using commercial software packages, ANSYS FLUENT and ACTRAN. In particular, these software package are used to conduct hybrid aeroacoustic simulations, in which fluid flow and aeroacoustic noise analyses are conducted separately, based on {{the theory of the}} Lighthill?s aeroacoustic analogy. The numerical and experimental results show that the optimally designed quarter-wavelength resonator array can be used to achieve nearly 10 dB noise reduction. From these results, it is also shown that a relation between the Mach number of the airflow and the maximum performance frequency shift is represented as a quadratic curve of ?f = 1918 M^(2) - 24. 21 M where M is the Mach number and ?f is the frequency shift...|$|R
40|$|With {{the arrival}} of plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) with significant autonomy, battery cooling becomes a necessity in driving mode to ensure their durability and ability to charge rapidly. Â For these vehicles, the refrigerating system may be composed of two evaporators (for front and rear passengers) in order to afford cooled air in the cabin and a chiller or a built-in battery evaporator to cool down the traction battery. This kind of multi-evaporator air-conditioning system {{has a number of}} technological barriers that must be undone. They are related to the components sizing in a context of cost reduction and control of such complex systems. The study therefore focuses on understanding the dynamic coupling of the several loop components such as the three evaporators having different cooling capacities. Understanding the behaviour of their respective expansion devices and the choice of these latter is also essential to control properly the transient phase and ensure an optimal operation of the air-conditioning system. In the literature, the effect of battery cooling by means of a chiller on the automotive air-conditioning loop has been already proved by simulation in the DymolaÂ® [1] environment. The simulation results for several driving cycles, refrigerants and ambient conditions emphasize the thermal discomfort caused by the use of the chiller loop. However, no global control strategy has been established. More recently, a first study of an air conditioning system model with three evaporators was carried out [2]. After the validation of their component models, a cool down test was performed to test the performance of their air conditioning system. From a control point of view, a simple PI control on the temperature of air blown at the front evaporator was used to regulate the speed of the <b>compressor.</b> In the <b>building</b> sector [3], the benefits of a supervisory controller to regulate the multi-evaporator air conditioning system was developed. Although this type of decentralized model seems to be robust and applicable to the car, it requires the use of sensors and components currently too costly and subject to a less restrictive environment than in automotive. The challenge of such a cooling loop lies in the dynamic coupling of components as well as their design. The model of a multi-evaporator automotive air conditioning system (two evaporators and a chiller) is thus produced using the 0 D AMESimÂ® software. In order to obtain more representative results in the transient state, the majority of components, including the chiller and regulators, are physical models giving a good representation of their internal geometries. These models were validated using experimental test maps. The first results highlight the importance of the regulators choice on the loop stability. A comparison of several types of expansion valves (orifice, thermostatic and electronic) will be conducted in order to select the most suitable to meet the price-performance compromise. Finally, control strategies are studied in transient state to further improve the stability and speed of convergence to the target instructions...|$|R
