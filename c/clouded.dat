5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and <b>clouded</b> leopard share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the <b>clouded</b> leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The Red panda, <b>Clouded</b> leopard, Siberian weasel, Asiatic black bear, barking deer, Himalayan tahr, goral, gaur and {{pangolin}} {{are some}} of the fauna found near Kalimpong. Avifauna of the region include the pheasants, cuckoos, minivets, flycatchers, bulbuls, orioles, owls, partridges, sunbirds, warblers, swallows, swifts and woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness to the environment, and this {{might be described as}} alert, <b>clouded,</b> drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient where he or she is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the <b>clouded</b> yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (Panthera pardus), <b>clouded</b> leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Iron Man 2, a {{conflict}} between Paramount Pictures, which had distribution rights to certain Marvel properties, and The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Entertainment's new corporate parent, <b>clouded</b> the timing and the distribution arrangement of a possible third film. On October 18, 2010, The Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3, with Disney, Marvel, and Paramount announcing a May 3, 2013 release date for the film.|$|E
5|$|It {{was about}} this time that an {{incident}} occurred that temporarily <b>clouded</b> his career. In a moment of anger he struck one of the Thalias lieutenants, Robert Forbes. He was brought to court-martial on 12 June 1798 aboard , and the offence being proved, the court {{had no choice but}} to dismiss him from the service. In view of the mitigating circumstances, the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} {{suffered by}} the two combatants are difficult to determine, due to several factors. In regard to the Germans, equipment losses were {{complicated by the fact}} that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks. For example, tanks disabled one day often appeared a day or two later repaired. German personnel losses are <b>clouded</b> by the lack of access to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war. Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made available until 1978, while others were taken by the Soviet Union, which declined to confirm their existence.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a <b>clouded</b> yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, {{assistant}} manager Matthew Gill left the club by mutual consent. Rovers defeated Bristol Rovers in the First Round of FA Cup {{thanks to a}} Max Power goal on 54th minute. Three days later Tranmere upheld their good cup form in the Football League Trophy with an away victory at Bury. After narrow defeats against Luton Town and Southend United, Tranmere finally achieved their first league victory under Micky Adams on 29 November against Portsmouth. The win was <b>clouded</b> by the serious injury of young loanee Will Aimson, who fractured both his tibia and fibula in a collision with teammate Danny Holmes. 17-year old defender Evan Gumbs made his first appearance for the senior team against Luton Town as a second-half substitute, following an injury to Josh Thompson who picked up a hamstring injury on his Tranmere debut.|$|E
5|$|After making {{landfall}} near Jacmel, Hurricane Gustav began traversing northwestward {{across the}} mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti, dumping heavy rains as it passed. With favorable atmospheric conditions the storm maintained its hurricane intensity {{for several hours}} after landfall, but the high mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation. The eye because ragged and <b>clouded</b> over as Gustav weakened to a tropical storm. A large mid- to upper-level anticyclone over the Florida Straight slowed Gustav's movement, holding it over the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Rainfall from the storm, which had been heavy since its landfall, began to accumulate as the storm's movement stalled. Although the storm's upper levels began experiencing moderate shear, and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with the mountains of southwestern Haiti, enough of Gustav's convection was over the Gulf of Gonâve that {{on the morning of}} August 27 its organization started to improve. That afternoon, as a broad ridge extended from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Gustav began to slowly pull to the west, away from the island of Hispaniola. Increased shear weakened the storm as the building ridge to the north of Gustav imparted a southerly component to the storm's motion.|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the <b>clouded</b> agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, Malmö Stad {{decided that}} a new public {{swimming}} arena is {{to be built in}} the same area as the stadium in the near future. This leaves the stadium's future <b>clouded</b> in uncertainty. Recent occurrences have indicated that Malmö Stadion might continue to be used as an athletics arena, as MAI intends to revive the MAI Gala. In November 2012, MAI lobbied to attract 100 metres Olympic champion Usain Bolt to the stadium for the proposed MAI Gala in August 2014. MAI are also working towards hosting the European Athletics Junior Championships in 2015, and have written to the European Athletic Association to express their interest. On 31 January 2015 new reports suggested that the city council had reached an agreement that Malmö Stadion is to be demolished. The decision to approve the demolition of the stadium was taken on 2 February 2015. As of February 2015 it is still unknown when the demolition process will start and what will become of the area.|$|E
5|$|In September 1792 Heywood was court-martialed {{and with}} five others {{was sentenced to}} hang. However, the court {{recommended}} mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions that gave him his first command {{at the age of}} 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been <b>clouded</b> by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is <b>clouded</b> in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} felids {{are known}} from the Oligocene of Europe, such as Proailurus, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus Pseudaelurus. The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats {{was similar to that}} of the modern <b>clouded</b> leopards (Neofelis). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, the lineages of Homotherium and Smilodon are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago. The earliest species of Smilodon is S.gracilis, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of Megantereon, from which it probably evolved. Megantereon itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with Homotherium. S.gracilis reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. The younger Smilodon species are probably derived from S.gracilis. S.fatalis existed 1.6 million–10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced S.gracilis in North America. S.populator existed 1 million–10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.|$|E

25|$|In a small {{proportion}} of females (about 5%) the golden upperside colouration is replaced by a pale cream colour. These females have been distinguished as form helice. The pale form helice {{does not seem to be}} that distinct as intermediates exist and the variation is to some extent related to humidity during development, with dryer conditions producing paler colouration. These pale forms helice can be confused with Berger's <b>clouded</b> yellow (Colias sareptensis) and the rarer Pale <b>clouded</b> yellow (Colias hyale). Even the palest C. croceus tends to have more black on the upperside however, in particular on the hindwings.|$|E
