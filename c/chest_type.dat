40|$|BACKGROUND: Ships {{should carry}} {{mandatory}} given amounts of medicinal products and basic first aid items, collectively {{known as the}} ship's medicine <b>chest.</b> <b>Type</b> and quantities of these products/items are suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and regulated by individual flag states. In countries that lack national legislation, {{it is assumed that}} ships should follow WHO indications. An objective difficulty mainly involving vessels of international long-haul routes could be to recognise medicinal compounds obtained in other countries for replacing products used or expired. Language barrier may complicate, if not make it impossible to interpret the name of the medicinal product and/or of the active principle as indicated in a box printed in a completely different language. Handling of the ship's pharmacy may be difficult in case of purchasing of drugs abroad due to language barriers. Medicinal products are identified by the international non-proprietary name of the active principle and/or by their chemical or invented (branded) names. This may make the identification of a medicinal product difficult, primarily if it is purchased abroad and the box and instructions are written {{in the language of the}} country where it is marketed. Therefore, there is a simpler classification system of the medicinal compounds the ATC (ATC: Anatomy, Therapeutic properties, Chemical, pharmacological properties). This paper has reviewed the list of medicinal products recommended by WHO and assigned to each one the ATC code as a solution to the problem of medicinal compounds organisation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two researchers independently examined the list of medicinal compounds indicated in the third edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships and attributed to each compound the ATC code according to the 2013 Guidelines for ATC classification and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) assignment. RESULTS: The ATC code was attributed to the medicinal compounds indicated in the third edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of an objective system to identify medicinal products is required for ships, which will contribute in making the identification of items purchased simpler, making it easier to understand which drug seafarers need to be administer, and consequently reduce possible therapeutic mistakes...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} chest radiographic and CT {{findings of}} right middle lobe (RML) atelectasis correlating with the clinical features. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 47 patients with RML atelectasis and classified their chest radiographic findings into four types (Type 1 - 4) {{based on the}} shape of the opacity. The degree of RML atelectasis was classified into three types according to CT findings, namely severe (> 90 %), moderate (50 - 90 %), and mild (10 - 50 %). Then we correlated them with <b>chest</b> radiographic <b>types</b> and patient's symptoms. Results: In severe atelectasis (n= 10), no definite abnormalities were detected on <b>chest</b> radiographs (<b>Type</b> 1). In moderate atelectasis (n= 24), 14 cases (58 %) showed triangular opacity (Type 2) and nine cases (38 %) showed band-like opacity (Type 3) along the right cardiac border. In mild atelectasis (n= 13), 11 cases (85 %) showed vague opacity at the right lower lung field (Type 4). In severe atelectasis, only one case (10 %) had symptoms. In contrast, 14 cases (58 %) in moderate atelectasis and six cases (46 %) in mild atelectasis had symptoms. Conclusion: Our results indicate that RML atelectasis has a very wide spectrum of imaging finding of chest radiograph and CT, and patient's symptoms are related to the degree of atelectasis...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundPulmonary {{sarcoidosis}} shows {{a remarkable}} heterogeneity of phenotypes ranging from bihilar lymphadenopathy to progressive fibrosis. Individual disease assessment is demanding and requires sensible, practical measures. We tested whether gas exchange measurements during exercise reflects disease activity and clinical course in sarcoidosis. MethodsIn 149 patients with proven pulmonary sarcoidosis the alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (P(A-a) O 2) during exercise was assessed and compared with <b>chest</b> X-ray <b>typing,</b> pulmonary function, single breath-diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), serological markers, cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and clinical course. Patients were categorized according to thresholds of P(A-a) O 2 during exercise. Measurements and Main ResultsChest X-ray typing, pulmonary function, DLCO {{and the need}} for immunosuppressive treatment differed between the disease categories based on P(A-a) O 2 during exercise (p  1 year), but not DLCO. About 50 % (n =  75) of the study population showed a normal spirometry. Even in this subgroup 23 % had an impaired gas exchange during exercise, which correlated with <b>chest</b> X-ray <b>types</b> (p <  0. 0001) {{and the need for}} immunosuppressive treatment (p <  0. 005).

In type 1 lacerations, which occur in the mid lung area, the air-filled lung bursts as a result of sudden compression of the chest. [...] Also called compression-rupture lacerations, type 1 are the most common type and usually occur in a central location of the lung. [...] They tend to be large, ranging in size from 2–8cm. [...] The shearing stress in type 2 results when the lower chest is suddenly compressed and the lower lung is suddenly moved across the vertebral bodies. [...] Type 2, also called compression-shear, tends to occur near the spine and have an elongated shape. Type 2 lacerations usually occur in younger people with more flexible <b>chests.</b> <b>Type</b> 3, which are caused by punctures from fractured ribs, occur in the area near the chest wall underlying the broken rib. Also called rib penetration lacerations, type 3 lacerations tend to be small and accompanied by pneumothorax. Commonly, more than one type 3 laceration will occur. Type 4, also called adhesion tears, occur in cases where a pleuropulmonary adhesion had formed prior to the injury, in which the chest wall is suddenly fractured or pushed inwards. [...] They occur in the subpleural area and result from shearing forces at sites of transpleural adhesion.|$|R
40|$|This {{review article}} covers the {{spectrum}} of congenital thoracic wall deformities along with their historical background. Willital&#x 2032;s classification divides these deformities into 11 <b>types</b> - funnel <b>chest</b> (4 <b>types),</b> pigeon <b>chest</b> (4 <b>types),</b> and combination of funnel and pigeon chest, chest wall aplasia and cleft sternum. Records of patients at our center comprised 90 &#x 0025; depression deformities, 6 &#x 0025; protrusion deformities, 3 &#x 0025; combined depression-protrusion deformities and 1 &#x 0025; other forms. Mild forms of abnormalities warrant the wait- and-watch approach during the first 4 - 5 years. The deformities manifest primarily during the pubertal spurt often with rapid progression with subjective complaints like dyspnea, cardiac dysthesia, limited work performance and secondary changes. Operative correction in young adults is more favorable in mild cases. The Willital technique has been the standard technique for the correction of pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum and other combined forms of deformities at our center with excellent long term results. The Nuss procedure and the Pectus Less Invasive Extrapleural Repair (PLIER) technique for pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum have also been described in this article. Surgical correction for Poland&#x 2032;s syndrome is reserved for patients with severe aplasia of the ribs with major depression deformity.

On physical examination, no jugular venous distention was noted, but breath sounds over the left lung were diminished. A bedside chest radiograph showed left tension pneumothorax, for which urgent needle decompression followed by chest thoracostomy was performed.

40|$|Background: High {{mortality}} and disability due to pneumonia occur worldwide. The {{introduction of the}} Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy in Malawi brought with it hope of an improvement {{in the outcome of}} pneumonia. However, the risk of death and treatment outcomes remain unknown in many districts. Method: The medical records of 466 consecutive patients admitted to the Mchinji District Hospital from January 2004 to January 2006 whose disease met the World Health Organization criteria for pneumonia were reviewed. Data were collected from forms that had been filled out and different treatment outcomes and determinants of death were analysed using logistic regression. Results: Of the 466 patients, 62. 7 % completed treatment, 15. 9 % had unknown outcomes, 12. 9 % died, 8. 4 % were lost to follow-up, 0. 8 % failed to improve with treatment, and 0. 4 % were transferred to other facilities. Independent predictors of death were: age less than 2 years, female sex, history of pneumonia, <b>chest</b> retractions, <b>type</b> of pneumonia, and central cyanosis. Conclusion: A high proportion of deaths and unknown outcomes occurred among participants. Young age, female sex, history of pneumonia, chest retractions and central cyanosis were associated with death.

40|$|ObjectiveMany {{patients}} have their hospital discharge delayed because their chest tube drainage is too high, {{despite the fact}} that there are no data to support the commonly used 250 mL/day threshold. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted with a prospective database and prospective algorithm from one surgeon. All patients underwent elective pulmonary resection. The last chest tube was removed if there was no air leak and nonchylous drainage of 450 mL/day or less. ResultsThe study comprised 8608 operations and 2077 patients who underwent an elective (nonpneumonectomy) pulmonary resection via thoracotomy by one general thoracic surgeon over a 10 -year period. Eighty-nine patients went home with a chest tube owing to air leak. The remaining 1988 patients were discharged without a <b>chest</b> tube. <b>Types</b> of pulmonary resection were wedge resection in 729 patients, segmentectomy in 214, lobectomy in 1104, and bilobectomy in 30. The median day of discharge was postoperative day 4. One hundred one (5 %) were readmitted to the hospital within 60 days of discharge. The most common reason for readmission was dehydration and fatigue. Only 11 (0. 55 %) had readmissions owing to recurrent symptomatic effusion and most were treated with video-assisted thoracoscopy. Follow-up was 100 % at 4  weeks and 93 % at 8 weeks. ConclusionsChest tubes can be removed with up to 450 mL/day of nonchylous drainage after pulmonary resection, and perhaps a higher volume could be accepted. Readmission owing to a recurrent effusion is exceedingly uncommon, and the practice of leaving the tube in longer for drainage less than 450 mL/day is unsupported in the literature...|$|R

For example, motion at the body–electrode interface causes variations of the coupling capacitance which, {{in the presence of}} a dc voltage across the coupling capacitor, create strong artifacts in the measurements. The origin, relevance, and reduction of this specific and important type of artifacts are studied here. An injection signal is exploited to track the variations of the coupling capacitance in real time. This information is then used by an identification scheme to estimate the artifacts and subtract them from the measurements. The method was evaluated in simulations, lab environments, and in a real-life recording on an adult's <b>chest.</b> For the <b>type</b> of artifact under study, a strong artifact reduction ranging from 40 dB for simulated data to 9 dB for a given real-life recording was achieved. The proposed method is automated, does not require any knowledge about the measurement system parameters, and provides an online estimate for the dc voltage across the coupling capacitor...|$|R
30|$|The {{finding of}} a {{statistically}} significant variability in radiation dose for contrast-enhanced CT examinations of several anatomical territories was confirmed on a single-centre basis. In this case, differences due to the CT equipment used are negated, and variation related to the usage of different image acquisition protocols for each anatomical area under investigation should be reduced as well. However, our results reveal {{that this was not}} the case, as a significant difference in radiation dose was still detected even for unenhanced CT examinations carried out by different technologists for a given reporting radiologist. To our knowledge, this is the first report of {{a statistically significant}} variation within the same diagnostic centre. Small variations could be admitted because of differences in patients’ length or (as in chest CT examinations) breath excursion, but would not likely be significant, as we found in our work. The fact that the dose varied for unenhanced CT of all <b>types</b> (<b>chest,</b> abdomen-pelvis, and whole body) among different technologists indicates that these latter did not operate uniformly. In this context, factors that contributed to increasing the radiation dose were selection of excessively high kV and/or mAs settings for the patient and/or the clinical condition under evaluation, deactivation of tube current modulation algorithms, inaccurate positioning of the patient inside the gantry, and unnecessary prolongation of CT data acquisition beyond the anatomical limits of the body area to be examined [23, 24].|$|R
30|$|Model {{constructed}} with C 4.5 for prediction of {{coronary artery disease}} with 25 features with predictor (presence and absence of coronary artery disease) reaches highest accuracy, of 97.6 as compared to other predictive models. Proposed method improves the prediction accuracy by 0.9 %, sensitivity and specificity of 0.4 and 1.7 %. Other statistical measures are also calculated such as Cohen’s Kappa, mean absolute error and root mean square error. Increase of 0.08 value of KS, reduction of 0.015 in MAE and 0.023 in RMSE for NB Tree. In case of MLP there is also improvement of 1.2 % for accuracy 0.6 % for sensitivity and 1.7 % for specificity, increment of 0.024 in KS 0.024 and reduction of 0.018 and 0.047 for MAE and RMSE. Further, to predict the severity of disease, the models were {{constructed with}} 25 features with class severity using the decision tree and MLP algorithms. Proposed method improves the prediction accuracy by 3.2 % in case of C 4.5 and 4.77, 3.56 % for NB Tree and MLP. Significant reduction of misclassification error rate, i.e., by 3.28 % in case of C 4.5 and 4.77, 3.65 % for NB Tree and MLP. Significant improvement of statistical measures such as KS, MAS and RMSE. Significant rules (Fig.  2) extracted from optimized C 4.5 show that <b>chest</b> pain <b>type</b> [43, 44] is the major predictor of CAD. Angina chest pain has the highest probability of CAD. High density lipoprotein > 48 shows the healthy attribute of the subjects [45, 46] (rules 3 – 6). In rules 1 and 2 angina chest pain, Duke score, METS are same, but weight and waist circumference can affect the probability of single vessel and multi-vessel disease, higher value of weight and higher value of WC can lead to multi-vessel disease. The rules extracted are clinically interpretable and aid in the decision-making process. The study showed that decision tree, based on intelligent diagnostic model using noninvasive and clinical features, was capable of disease diagnosis and its severity with high accuracy, with low cost. However, the rules extracted from the decision tree are crisp and its performance could be improved by fuzzy rule-based approach. The results are reproducible. Parameters used to construct models were recorded as routine clinical examination (noninvasive) of symptomatic patients. The proposed model gives the high pretest probability of CAD and its severity without using an invasive diagnosis technique.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{diagnosis}} of {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) {{is based on an}} increase in plasma troponin levels above the 99 th percentile of a healthy reference population values. On admission, over 30 % of patients with AMI do not have specific symptoms and up to 70 % of them may have normal or non-diagnostic ECG recordings. In these patient subgroups cardiac troponin assays may {{play a critical role in}} diagnosing AMI. Several diagnostic kits with enhanced analytic sensitivity (high-sensitivity kits) have been developed recently. Aim of studyTo compare diagnostic sensitivity of troponin I (cTnI) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) in the {{diagnosis of}} acute myocardial infarction in patients with <b>chest</b> pain. <b>Type</b> of studyProspective, observational. Patients and methodsWe evaluated prospectively 107 consecutive patients [median (inter-quartile range) age: 64 (55 – 75) years; 29 women] admitted to intensive cardiac care unit for chest pain, with admission cTnI levels < 0. 1 μg/l. In all patients, the parameters determined on admission included their levels of cTnI (chemiluminiscence immunoassay with microparticles, Abbott, Architect i 2000 analyzer), hs-cTnT (electrochemiluminiscence immunoassay; Roche Cobas e 411 analyzer), and myoglobin (immunoturbidimetry). The diagnosis of AMI was established by the attending cardiologist (using the “universal” definition of acute myocardial infarction). The cTnI and hs-cTnT cut-off values for AMI were 0. 033 μg/l and 14 ng/l, respectively. Troponin I levels were again determined at 6 and 12 h after admission. ResultsA total of 50 patients (46. 7 %) were diagnosed to have AMI with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), 35 patients (32. 7 %) developed AMI without STE (non-STEMI), 10 patients (9. 3 %) experienced a Type 2 AMI, four patients (3. 7 %) had unstable angina, and eight patients (7. 5 %) chest pain of non-coronary etiology (most often vertebrogenic pain). The diagnostic sensitivity of admission cTnI and hs-cTnT levels for AMI was 72 % and 78 %, respectively (p= 0. 1814). The correlation between cTnI and hs-cTnT was 0. 67 (p< 0. 001; Spearman rank correlation coefficient). The diagnostic sensitivity of admission hs-cTnT and cTnI in STEMI patients was 82 % vs. 70 %, respectively (p= 0. 0771). In non-STEMI patients, similar baseline cTnI and hs-cTnT diagnostic sensitivity was found, 74. 3 % and 71. 4 %, respectively (p= 0. 91). ConclusionPatients with STEMI showed a trend toward a baseline diagnostic sensitivity of hs-cTnT superior to that of cTnI. In non-STEMI patients, the sensitivity of admission cTnI and hs-cTnT was similar...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Postoperative {{chylothorax}} {{remains an}} uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of esophagectomy for cancer, and the ideal management is still controversial. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the outcomes of patients treated nonoperatively with those of patients promptly undergoing reoperation. Methods: From 1980 to 1998, 1787 esophagectomies for esophageal or cardia cancer were performed, and 19 (1. 1 %) patients had postoperative chylothorax. We analyzed type of operation, surgical approach, delay of diagnosis of chylothorax, daily <b>chest</b> tube output, <b>type</b> of management, major complications, death, hospital stay, and final outcome. Results: Of the 19 patients with chylothtrax, 11 were initially managed nonoperatively (group A) : 4 (36 %) patients had spontaneous resolution of chylothorax, and the other 7 required reoperation for the persistence of a high-volume output. There were three infectious complications and one postoperative death in this group. No reliable predictive criteria of successful versus unsuccessful nonoperative management could be found. The 8 most recent patients underwent early reoperation (group B). All patients recovered, and no major complications possibly related to chylothorax or hospital deaths were observed. They were discharged after a median of 22 days (range, 12 - 85 days) compared with a median of 36 days (range, 21 - 64 days) for patients of group A. Conclusions: Early thoracic duct ligation is the treatment of choice for chylothorax occurring after esophagectomy. Reoperation should be performed immediately after the diagnosis is made to avoid the complications related to nutritional and immunologic depletion caused by prolonged nonoperative treatment...|$|R
