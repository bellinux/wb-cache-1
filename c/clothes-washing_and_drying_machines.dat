40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic compressed air {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with compressed air cooling <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic compressed air cooling than those with compressed air cooling <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> <b>machining.</b> The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic compressed air cooling and a thicker chip with compressed air cooling compared to <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic compressed air compared with <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic compressed air than that with compressed air <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic compressed air on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate.

40|$|Abstract: The growing {{demands for}} high {{productivity}} of machining {{require the use}} of high cutting speeds and feed rates. Such machining inherently produces a high cutting temperature, which not only reduces tool life, but also impairs the product quality. Application of cutting fluid influences the performance of machining because of its lubrication and cooling actions but the environmental concerns call for the reduced use of cutting fluids in machining opera-tions. Near-dry machining, such as minimum quantity lubrication, is {{regarded as one of the}} solutions to this difficulty. In the current work, cutting fluid was applied as a continuous high-velocity jet at the machining zone, at an extreme low rate using a fluid application system, by electro static lubrication (ESL), during the drilling of SCM 440 (hardened) steel. In the first stage of this work, experiments were carried out to investigate the role of the ESL system on tool wear, hole diameter, thrust force, and surface finish of the product in machining of SCM 440 steel. In the second stage, a comparative performance analysis of the ESL system with minimum quantity of lubricant (MQL) <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> was conducted. Results indicate that there is a considerable improvement in the performance of machining SCM 440 steel using the ESL setup when compared with MQL <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> in terms of considered parameters...|$|R

40|$|Clean {{machining}} {{is gaining}} ground {{as one of}} the crucial issues in future manufacturing. Many machining industries are looking for alternative solutions to wet machining because of the costs of the latter, including environmental costs, as well as its impact on occupational health <b>and</b> safety. <b>Dry</b> <b>machining</b> is being proposed, but in most conditions, the cutting tool wears out quicker, leading to part quality deterioration and increased machining costs. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) machining is also proposed to maintain a reasonable tool life and limited cost, as compared to the situation with flood or wet machining. Both the MQL <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> methods, however, are susceptible to the generation of aerosols containing metallic particles that can be detrimental to occupational health and safety. Minimizing particle emissions is of prime importance since these can have serious consequences on the operator’s health. They have been seen to be at a minimum at two specific cutting ranges. In this study, investigations are done to examine the effect of lubrication (<b>dry</b> <b>and</b> MQL) during the turning of the 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy.
