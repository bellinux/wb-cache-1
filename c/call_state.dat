These functional graphs, which they <b>call</b> <b>state</b> transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to a still life pattern.|$|E

50|$|CAMEL Phase 1 defined {{only very}} basic call control services, but {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a CAMEL Basic <b>call</b> <b>state</b> model (BCSM) to the Intelligent Network (IN). Phase 1 gave the gsmSCF the ability to bar calls (release the call prior to connection), allow a call to continue unchanged, or to modify a limited number of call parameters before allowing it to continue. The gsmSCF could also monitor the status of a call for certain events (call connection and disconnection), and take appropriate action on being informed of the event. Phase 1 was defined as part of Release 96 in 1997.|$|E

5000|$|Service Switching Function (SSF) or Service Switching Point (SSP) is {{co-located}} {{with the}} telephone exchange, and {{acts as the}} trigger point for further services to be invoked during a call. The SSP implements the Basic <b>Call</b> <b>State</b> Machine (BCSM) which is a Finite state machine that represents an abstract view of a call {{from beginning to end}} (off hook, dialing, answer, no answer, busy, hang up, etc.). As each state is traversed, the exchange encounters Detection Points (DPs) at which the SSP may invoke a query to the SCP to wait for further instructions on how to proceed. This query is usually called a trigger. Trigger criteria are defined by the operator and might include the subscriber calling number or the dialed number. The SSF is responsible for controlling calls requiring value added services.|$|E

50|$|We have {{a source}} that emits {{electron}}-positron pairs, with the electron sent to destination A, {{where there is}} an observer named Alice, and the positron sent to destination B, where there is an observer named Bob. According to quantum mechanics, we can arrange our source so that each emitted pair occupies a quantum state called a spin singlet. The particles are thus said to be entangled. This {{can be viewed as}} a quantum superposition of two states, which we <b>call</b> <b>state</b> I and state II. In state I, the electron has spin pointing upward along the z-axis (+z) and the positron has spin pointing downward along the z-axis (−z). In state II, the electron has spin −z and the positron has spin +z. Because it is in a superposition of states it is impossible without measuring to know the definite state of spin of either particle in the spin singlet.|$|E
50|$|El Jefe {{was first}} sighted by cougar hunter and guide Donnie Fenn, {{along with his}} 10 year-old daughter, in the Whetstone Mountains on Saturday, 19 November 2011. His hunting dogs chased the animal until it climbed a tree, at which point he took several {{pictures}} of it and left to <b>call</b> <b>state</b> wildlife officials. In a news conference organized by the Arizona Game and Fish Department the following Tuesday, Fenn stated that the jaguar, an adult male, climbed down the tree and was chased up a second tree after it had injured some of the dogs in its retreat. The hunter pulled his dogs away, and left the scene. The pictures represent the first evidence {{of the existence of}} a wild jaguar in the United States since the death of Macho B in 2009. Several news outlets ran the photos with an article but a video, said to have been taken at the scene, is not publicly available.|$|E
40|$|Data {{throughput}} is {{an important}} metric used in the performance evaluation {{of the next generation}} cellular networks such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced. To evaluate the performance of these networks, Monte Carlo simulation schemes are usually used. Such simulations do not provide the throughput of intermediate <b>call</b> <b>state,</b> instead it gives the overall performance of the network. We propose a hybrid model consisting of both analysis and simulation. The benefit of the model is that the throughput of any possible <b>call</b> <b>state</b> in the system can be evaluated. Here, the probability of possible call distribution is first obtained by analysis, which is used as input to the event-driven based simulator to calculate the throughput of a <b>call</b> <b>state.</b> We compare the throughput obtained from our hybrid model with that obtained from event-driven based simulation. Numerical results are presented and show good agreement between both the proposed hybrid model and the simulation. The maximum difference of relative throughput between our hybrid model and the simulation is found in the interval of(0. 04 %; 1. 06 %) over a range of call arrival rates, meanholding times and number of resource blocks in the system...|$|E
