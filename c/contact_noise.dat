40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{intrinsic}} time-dependent fluctuations in the electrical resistance at the graphene-metal interface or the <b>contact</b> <b>noise,</b> {{on the performance of}} graphene field effect transistors, can be as adverse as the contact resistance itself, but remains largely unexplored. Here we have investigated the <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> in graphene field effect transistors of varying device geometry and contact configuration, with carrier mobility ranging from 5, 000 to 80, 000 $~$cm$^{ 2 }$V$^{- 1 }$s$^{- 1 }$. Our phenomenological model for <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> due to current crowding in purely two dimensional conductors, confirms that the contacts dominate the measured resistance noise in all graphene field effect transistors in the two-probe or invasive four probe configurations, and surprisingly, also in nearly noninvasive four probe (Hall bar) configuration in the high mobility devices. The microscopic origin of <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> is directly linked to the fluctuating electrostatic environment of the metal-channel interface, which could be generic to two dimensional material-based electronic devices.

30|$|The {{noise data}} {{reported}} here were {{taken with the}} contact with larger barrier height (φ 1) forward biased. The dominant contribution to the <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> {{as well as the}} contact resistance arises from this contact. On applying forward bias to this junction, the noise (as well as the contact resistance) is severely reduced. The other contact with much smaller barrier (φ 2) has much less contribution to the <b>contact</b> <b>noise.</b> Thus, even if it is reversed biased (and the depletion width increases due to the reverse bias), its contribution still remains low.|$|E
40|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) is the {{recording}} of potential fluctuations originating from electrical activity of brain. It is used in diagnosis of neurological disorders, monitoring the depth of anaesthesia and evaluation of sleep. A possible application is long-term continous monitoring of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, with the aim to detect epileptic seizure activity. Currently this is not practised due to poor usability of the available equipment. This thesis {{is part of a}} project which aims to develop a novel solution which solves the usability problem. Adding to that, the solution contains an algorithm for automatic online epileptic seizure detection, which enables immediate treatment of patients once epileptic seizures occur. This leads to an increased patient outcome at ICUs. An important factor contributing to poor usability of current EEG equipment is the electrode contact. To ensure good signal quality, skin under the electrodes needs to be prepared by abrasion for example. This is time-consuming especially when multiple electrodes are used. Adding to that, skin preparation damages skin which is undesired especially in long-term applications, as the the presence of electrode and electrolytic gel causes irritation and possibly an infection risk. The quality of the electrode contact is quantified by its electrical impedance. In this thesis the relationship of electrode contact impedance to total electrode <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> and motion artifact magnitude are studied. These both are factors contributing to biopotential signal quality. Sintered silver-silverchloride electrodes are used in the work. Contact impedance is defined as the magnitude of the impedance vector at 20 Hz. <b>Contact</b> <b>noise</b> is studied by measuring impedance-noise data pairs (n= 122) at two body sites of volunteer subjects using two different electrode gels. A univariate analysis of variance is implemented on the data pairs. Motion artifact magnitude is studied with impedanceartifact magnitude data pairs (n= 33) while producing a horizontal motion to the electrode. The behavior of the seizure detection algorithm is also studied by adding different amounts of noise to EEG signals, and assessing how its behavior changes. The results show that electrode contact impedance {{can be used as a}} rough predictor of total <b>contact</b> <b>noise.</b> With contact impedance in the range of 20 k or less, the <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> is expected to settle at RMS values less than 5 μV at a 30 Hz bandwidth. It was also found the that the type of electrolytic gel can have a significant effect on total <b>contact</b> <b>noise.</b> Motion artifact magnitude was found to decrease with decreasing contact impedance. With larger contact impedance values, the variations of motion artifact magnitudes were larger. The behavior of the seizure detection algorithm was found to change significantly with a small amount of noise added to EEG signals. By comparing that amount of noise to the measured <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> data, it can be seen that it is well within the measured values...|$|E

The resonant frequency of the noise radiating element is tuned by a plurality of force transmitting mechanisms which <b>contact</b> the <b>noise</b> radiating element. Each one of the force transmitting mechanisms includes an expandable element and a spring in <b>contact</b> with the <b>noise</b> radiating element so that excitation of the element varies the spring force applied to the noise radiating element. The elements are actuated by a controller which receives input of a signal proportional to displacement of the noise radiating element and a signal corresponding to the blade passage frequency of the engine's fan. In response, the controller determines a control signal which is sent to the elements and causes the spring force applied to the noise radiating element to be varied. The force transmitting mechanisms can be arranged to either produce bending or linear stiffness variations in the noise radiating element...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{properties}} of low-frequency <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> of multielectrode GaN nanowire (NW) devices. A two-port cross-spectrum technique is used to discriminate {{the noise of the}} ohmic contact from that of the NW section. The diameter of the GaN NW is around 100 nm. The Ti/Al electrodes of the NWs are defined by e-beam lithography. The typical resistance of a NW section with a length of 800 nm is about 5. 5 k Omega and the two-wire resistance is below 100 k Omega. The results show that the low-frequency excess noise of the GaN NW is much smaller than that of the current-flowing contact, indicating that the <b>contact</b> <b>noise</b> dominates the noise behavior in our GaN NW devices. A careful study of the noise amplitude (A) of the 1 /f noise of different types of NW and carbon nanotube devices, both in our work and in the literature, yields an empirical formula for estimating A from the two-wire resistance of the device.

The noise magnitude for spin and charge transport differs by three orders of magnitude, implying different scattering mechanisms for the 1 /f fluctuations in the charge and spin transport processes. A modulation of the spin-dependent noise magnitude by changing the spin relaxation length and time indicates that the spin-flip processes dominate the spin-dependent noise.
