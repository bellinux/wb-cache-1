The instability often {{is the result of}} <b>compounding</b> <b>acoustic</b> oscillations, usually from the propellant combustion itself. To counteract the instability the chamber geometry can be changed and/or the method of propellant injection can be altered. This experiment will alter the chamber dimensions slightly; using a cylindrical shape of constant diameter and the length will be varied from six to twelve inches in three-inch increments. The main flowfield will be the products of a high OF hydrogen/oxygen flow. The liquid fuel will be injected into this flowfield using a modulated injector. It will allow for varied droplet size, feed rate, spray pattern, and location for the mixture within the chamber. The response will be deduced from the chamber pressure oscillations...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{signals are}} an ideal source of {{diagnosis}} data {{thanks to their}} intrinsic non-directional coverage, sensitivity to incipient defects, and insensitivity to structural resonance characteristics. However this makes prevailing signal de-nosing and feature extraction methods suffer from high computational cost, {{low signal to noise}} ratio (S/N), and difficulty to extract the <b>compound</b> <b>acoustic</b> emissions for various failure types. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid signal processing technique to depict the embedded signal using generally effective features. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is adopted as the fundamental pre-processor, which is integrated with the sample entropy (SampEn), singular value decomposition (SVD), and statistic feature processing (SFP) methods. The SampEn and SVD are identified as the condition indicators for periodical and irregular signals, respectively. Moreover, such a hybrid module is self-adaptive and robust to different signals, which ensures the generality of its performance. The hybrid signal processor is further integrated with a probabilistic classifier, pairwise-coupled relevance vector machine (PCRVM), to construct a new fault diagnosis system. Experimental verifications for industrial equipment show that the proposed diagnostic system is superior to prior methods in computational efficiency and the capability of simultaneously processing non-stationary and nonlinear condition monitoring signals...|$|R
40|$|Seabed mapping has {{revealed}} {{the importance of}} submarine landslides in continental margins around the world. These areas are characterized by a large variety of terrains and the <b>compound</b> <b>acoustic</b> characteristics of the seabed often make geological interpretations a difficult task. Sonar backscatter is modulated at several spatial scales by the local slopes (surface processes), by the variable interface roughness and by the high variations in volume scattering processes. To address these problems, we are using marine geophysical data acquired in the SW Iberian Margin. The dataset includes high-resolution (3 m) TOBI sidescan sonar imagery complemented with Simrad EM- 12 S multibeam bathymetry. We focus on the recent Marques de Pombal mass-wasting complex. Our models and observations show that backscattering is heavily influenced by the geometry of insonification; for instance, seabeds rough at scales comparable to the acoustic wavelength (ca. 5 cm for TOBI) {{are more likely to}} exhibit facets scattering back to the sonar. The local distribution of backscatters creates textures, quantified with the TexAn software and associated to geological processes or terrains (e. g. landslides, background sediments).

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{can obtain}} navigation information by observing a source {{with a camera}} or an <b>acoustic</b> system <b>mounted</b> on {{the frame of the}} vehicle. This information properly fused provides navigation information that can overcome the lack of other sources of positioning. However, these systems often have a limited angular field-of-view (FOV).

Submicron particles closely follow plasma instabilities and have nonhomogeneous plasma treatment. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} arc voltage fluctuations in direct-current (dc) plasma torches, showing dominant fluctuation frequencies between 4 and 6 kHz, are linked to pressure oscillations in the cathode cavity of the plasma torch. In this study, first, a method to isolate the different oscillation modes in arc voltage and pressure signals using signal processing methods is presented. Second, correlations between the different modes of oscillations are analyzed following the plasma torch operating parameters. Lastly, it is shown that the use of an <b>acoustic</b> stub, <b>mounted</b> on the torch body, decreases the amplitude of arc voltage fluctuations and slightly increases the mean voltage...|$|R

Substrates such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, pesticides, phenols, explosives such as TNT, and esters are transformed into short-chain organic acids, CO_ 2, and inorganic ions as the final products. Time scales of treatment in simple batch reactors over the frequency range of 20 to 500 kHz are reported to range from minutes to hours for complete degradation. Ultrasonic irradiation appears to be an effective method for the rapid destruction of organic contaminants in water because of localized high concentrations of oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide in solution, high localized temperatures and pressures, and the formation of transient supercritical water. The degradation of chemical <b>compounds</b> by <b>acoustic</b> cavitation is shown to involve three distinct pathways: 1) oxidation by hydroxyl radicals, 2) pyrolytic decomposition and 3) supercritical water oxidation.

This thesis explores the Audio Source Localization problem (ASL) using only the Directions of Arrival (DOAs) estimated by <b>Acoustic</b> Sensors <b>mounted</b> on Mobile Robots connected in a Network. The use of the acoustic DOAs instead of the analysis of the whole audio signal is an innovative method thought for robotics purposes that introduces a new perspective of the audio-video synergy using video sensors for the robot localization in the environment in order to do the extrinsic audio sensor calibration. It is also proposed a new algorithm for localizing the 2 D/ 3 D position of an acoustic source using a Gaussian Probability over DOA approach (GP-DOA). Several simulation tests varying the errors over the DOA estimations and over the positions of the robots and the acoustic sources are done.
