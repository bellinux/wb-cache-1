5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> or snowball sampling.|$|E
25|$|Nonprobability {{sampling}} methods include <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling,</b> quota sampling and purposive sampling. In addition, nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if {{the characteristics of}} nonresponse are not well understood, since nonresponse effectively modifies each element's probability of being sampled.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{on a first}} date, women’s {{goals are}} related more to {{establishing}} friendships and having fun. Mongeau, in his 2004 study found that 60 percent of women go on first dates mainly to have fun and 59 percent go on dates to reduce uncertainty. (Note, however, {{that there are some}} errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> method.) Women's goals tend to be more relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex. Women are more likely to express companionship, friendship, and romantic relationship goals than men and are also more likely to consider the first date in terms of their relational implications than men.|$|E
40|$|Graduate {{students}} in applied {{areas such as}} psychology and public health often collect data for their dissertation projects and are typically faced with constraints that result in their samples being viewed as mere <b>convenience</b> <b>samples.</b> In describing their sampling plan and its limitations, students often struggle to evaluate {{the quality of their}} sampling procedures. This poster takes the view that all samples of human participants are <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> to some degree, {{if for no other reason}} than ethical considerations make participation voluntary and financial limits make pure random sampling exorbitantly expensive. According to this view, psychology and other applied fields are disciplines built on <b>convenience</b> <b>samples.</b> In spite of the use of <b>convenience</b> <b>samples,</b> applied statistics and data analysis procedures are useful in making advances in applied research. Because some <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> may be better than others, this poster session will examine factors and issues in sample selection. The aim is initiate discussion that will result in a framework that graduate students can use to address how to generalize their results...|$|R
25|$|The {{issue of}} extramarital sex has been {{examined}} {{frequently in the}} United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on <b>convenience</b> <b>samples.</b> A <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). <b>Convenience</b> <b>samples</b> do not accurately reflect {{the population of the}} United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should not be surprising, therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.|$|R
40|$|Survey {{experiments}} {{have become a}} central methodology across the social sciences. Researchers can combine experiments’ causal power with the generalizability of population-based samples. Yet, due to the expense of population-based samples, much research relies on <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> (e. g., students, online opt-in samples). The emergence of affordable, but non-representative online samples has reinvigorated debates about the external validity of experiments. We conduct two studies of how experimental treatment effects obtained from <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> compare to effects produced by population samples. In Study 1, we compare effect estimates from four different types of <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> and a population-based sample. In Study 2, we analyze treatment effects obtained from 20 experiments implemented on a population-based sample and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The results reveal considerable similarity between many treatment effects obtained from convenience and nationally representative population-based samples. While the results thus bolster confidence in the utility of <b>convenience</b> <b>samples,</b> we conclude with guidance {{for the use of}} a multitude of samples for advancing scientific knowledge...|$|R
500|$|An {{alternative}} method to standard opinion polls {{was used by}} the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino. A survey was conducted of 400 individuals, with 98 individuals positively identified as Native Americans. Surveyors verified Native American status of respondents claiming Native affiliation. Most Native American survey respondents were collected at pow-wows, a form of non-probabilistic <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling.</b> 67% of the Native Americans (n=66) polled agreed with the statement that [...] "Redskins" [...] is racial or racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.|$|E

It is also useful when researchers need to conduct pilot data collection in order to gain a quick understanding of certain trends or to develop hypotheses for future research. By rapidly gathering information, researchers and scientists can isolate growing trends, or extrapolate generalized information from local public opinion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> is {{not often}} {{recommended}} for research due {{to the possibility of}} sampling error and lack of presentation of population. But it can be handy depending on the situation. In some situations, <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling</b> is the only possible option. For example, a college student who is doing a term project and wants to know the average consumption of beer in that college town on Friday night. He will most probably call some of his friends and ask them how many cans of beer they drink or will go to a nearby party to do an easy survey. There is always a trade-off between this method of quick sampling and accuracy. Collected sample may not represent the population of interest and therefore, be a source of bias.|$|E
5000|$|Stratification {{is used in}} quota sampling, a non-random {{method in}} which the {{researcher}} identifies strata {{of the population and}} pre-determines how many participants are needed from each strata.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide information on whether results from cross-national studies which use <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> in each nation that are not representative of the nation, can provide valid cross-national comparisons. Both concurrent validity and construct validity were investigated using data from the International Dating Violence Study (IDVS). The IDVS sample consists of university students in 32 nations (n= 17, 404). Eighteen tests of concurrent validity found that nation-to-nation differences measured by the IDVS were correlated with nation-to-nation differences measured by nationally representative samples. Construct validity was examined on the basis of 41 empirical tests of relationships and was strongly supported. The concept of "national context effects " was suggested to explain how samples that are not nationally representative can provide valid nation-to-nation differences. It was concluded that <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> which are not representative of the nation, but are comparable with each can provide valid tests of theories about differences between nations.

5000|$|Convenience, {{haphazard}} or accidental sampling - {{members of}} the population are chosen based on their relative ease of access. To sample friends, co-workers, or shoppers at a single mall, are all examples of <b>convenience</b> <b>sampling.</b> Such samples are biased because researchers may unconsciously approach some kinds of respondents and avoid others (Lucas 2014a), and respondents who volunteer for a study may differ in unknown but important ways from others (Wiederman 1999).|$|E
