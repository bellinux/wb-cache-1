5000|$|Scheidt & Bachmann had {{initially}} gained {{experience in the}} design and manufacture of self-service ticket machines during the 1990s when the FAA-2000 system, popular on <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> railway <b>networks,</b> was developed. [...] By the early 2000s a refined design, marketed as FAA-2000/TS, had been launched. Its modern touch-screen technology, flexible and easily customisable interface and ability to accept cash or card payments made it a popular choice with transport operators in urban areas including Boston, New York City, Seattle, Cologne, Copenhagen and Dublin. [...] A version of this newer design with the codename FAA-2000/TS (ATOC) was put on trial in August 2003 at Twickenham, a South West Trains station. In conjunction with the redesign and rebuilding of the station forecourt area, two Ticket XPress machines—numbered 2000 and 2001—were built into a wall next to the main station entrance.|$|R

5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days longer than the British breeds, and 65 to 70 days longer than the other <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> breeds). When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> breeds).|$|R
