3000|$|However, {{research}} involving {{critically ill}} patients remains problematic {{due to the}} lack of guidance on how to protect vulnerable subjects adequately [1, 6]. For example, the U.S. <b>Common</b> Rule's <b>general</b> <b>provisions</b> merely direct Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to include [...] "additional safeguards...to protect the rights and welfare" [...] of [...] "mentally disabled persons" [...] [7]. Similar lack of guidance as well as ambiguity has been raised with the European Union Directive [8, 9]. In the absence of the specification of at least the essential safeguards, the protection of vulnerable subjects relies too heavily on the views of diverse IRBs, leading to insufficient protection of vulnerable subjects [10]. For example, in its investigation of critical care trials, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) found that most IRBs failed to require additional safeguards beyond that of requiring proxy consent [11]. In a cross-sectional survey of IRBs in U.S. institutions, investigators showed that IRBs rarely or never required procedures to determine capacity and also varied in their use of other safeguards, such as independent monitors, research proxies, and advance research directives [10].|$|R
