They also moult their fleece naturally, {{rather than having to}} be shorn annually, though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing. Fleeces are grey or creamy white on the body, though darker individuals occur whose colouring is similar to the Soay sheep. Rough in quality, the wool is mostly used in the creation of tweeds or carpet yarns. A tweed is a rough-surfaced <b>coarse</b> <b>cloth,</b> typically made in Scotland. Its colour is a mix of flecked colours. The face and legs are wool-free and black and white, with the proportions varying between individuals.|$|E
5|$|The first {{industries}} {{to develop in}} the town were coal mining and salt panning, which {{date back to the}} early sixteenth century. Early manufacturing both in Kirkcaldy and neighbouring Pathhead consisted of <b>coarse</b> <b>cloth</b> and nailmaking; the latter of which went to the Royal Master of Works for repairs at Holyrood Palace until the seventeenth century. Linen weaving, which began in 1672, became important to the town, with yarn imported from Hamburg and Bremen. The pottery industry, which was originally established in 1714 as an offshoot of the Linktown Brick and Tile Works, was centred around Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown. The Fife Pottery, built by Andrew and Archibald Grey in 1817, produced Wemyss Ware, named after the family who owned Wemyss Castle.|$|E
25|$|In his sixties, al-Jazzar was {{described}} as having a white beard and being agile and of muscular build. His native tongue was Bosnian, but he spoke Ottoman Turkish and Arabic with a distinctively Egyptian accent. Although he had previously been a frequent drinker, he quit consuming alcohol following his participation in the Hajj of 1791. Towards {{the end of his}} life, he maintained a seemingly austere lifestyle and refrained from extravagant spending, with the exception of his bribery of imperial officials and his building works in Acre. He would typically either don a standard Arab dress or a <b>coarse</b> <b>cloth</b> and turban. He would often meet guests sitting beneath a date palm or on a cushion-less board. He was an avid gardener and later took up paper artwork as a hobby with which he entertained his guests and his harem.|$|E

500|$|This system changed {{under the}} British, when tax {{payments}} {{were made in}} cash, and {{were used for the}} maintenance of the army, police and other civil and public establishments. A portion of the tax was transferred to England as the [...] "Indian tribute". Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India. After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms came into effect. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses. However, the homespun textile industry suffered during British rule, {{with the exception of the}} producers of the finest cloth and the <b>coarse</b> <b>cloth</b> which was popular with the rural masses. This was due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional handweaving industry, especially in spinning and weaving.|$|E

Pirogov went on to develop his own methods, although {{he was aware of}} Mathijsen's work. Pirogov's method involved soaking <b>coarse</b> <b>cloth</b> in a plaster of Paris mixture immediately before application to the limbs, which were protected either by stockings or cotton pads.

5000|$|The cravat {{originated}} in the 1630s; like most men's fashions between the 17th century and World War I, it was of military origin. In the reign of Louis XIII of France, Croatian mercenaries were enlisted into a regiment supporting the King and Cardinal Richelieu against the Duke of Guise and the Queen Mother, Marie de' Medici. The traditional Croat military kit aroused Parisian curiosity about the unusual, picturesque scarves distinctively knotted at the Croats' necks; the cloths that were used ranged from the <b>coarse</b> <b>cloths</b> of enlisted soldiers to the fine linens and silks of the officers. The sartorial word [...] derives from the French , a corrupt French pronunciation of Croate. Croatia celebrates Cravat Day on October 18.|$|R

60|$|On {{every part}} of the tables not {{occupied}} by the vases of wine were laid gold and jewelled ornaments which dazzled the eye by their brilliancy; while, in extraordinary contrast to the magnificence thus profusely displayed, there appeared in one of the upper corners of the hall an old wooden stand covered by a <b>coarse</b> <b>cloth,</b> on which were placed one or two common earthenware bowls, containing what my be termed a 'mash' of boiled bran and salted horseflesh. Any repulsive odour which might have arisen from this strange compound was overpowered by the various perfumes sprinkled about the room, which, mingling with the hot breezes wafted through the windows from the street, produced an atmosphere as oppressive and debilitating, in spite of its artificial allurements to the sense of smell, as the air of a dungeon or the vapours of a marsh.|$|E

We neither wake nor sleep, and passing our nights in a sorrow which is in the end a vision, what are these scenes of spring to us? This thinking in sleep of someone who has no thought of you, is it more than a dream? and yet surely it is the natural way of love. In our hearts there is much and in our bodies nothing, and we do nothing at all, and only the waters of the river of tears flow quickly.|$|E
