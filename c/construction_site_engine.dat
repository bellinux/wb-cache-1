40|$|In {{the coming}} years the {{maintenance}} costs for the German motorway network will continue to rise. The {{vast majority of the}} German motorways were opened to traffic between 1965 and 1985, which means that these sections of road are increasingly becoming in need of renovation. The simultaneous increase in traffic load and particularly the high proportion of heavy traffic are causing considerable damage to the road surface. This leads to an increased need for both short-term and long-term <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> In Germany the traffic routing forms 3 + 1 and 4 + 0 are mainly used in the area of long-term <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> These forms of traffic routing are in direct competition with each other as they can be used under very similar boundary conditions (cross-sectional widths, traffic load etc.). In the context of the scientific tests both forms of traffic routing were subjected to a safety and a traffic flow analysis. The evaluation of over 6, 500 traffic accidents in 269 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> yielded the results that 3 + 1 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> show an average of 10 % lower general accident risk than 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Furthermore in an accident with personal injury considerably more road users are injured or killed in 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Narrow inner areas of <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> may at first glance seem safer than wider 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> the effects of narrow road lanes however on the capacity and the more massive congestion situations involved are to be evaluated negatively in particular with regard to the hazard of traffic jams on road safety. Neither does the introduction of “staggered traffic” in combination with a general ban on overtaking on narrow lanes promise a long-term solution to efficiency problems. The efficiency still remains restricted in contrast to wider lanes and a significant reduction in traffic jams cannot be expected. The evaluations of the traffic flow tests in 20 empirically tested <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> reveal that the capacities in 3 + 1 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> are up to 12 % higher than the capacities of 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> In particular with heavy traffic proportions of over 15 %, 3 + 1 traffic routings show advantages with regard to efficiency.
