[...] Press reported that although the three companies had [...] "minuscule capital funds", their combined business value was estimated at between ¥96.9–124.6billion (US$1.3–1.6billion). Olympus denied that the acquisitions were unrelated to the core business.

[...] While the basic description of News Chef as a maker of cookware for microwave ovens was not changed, Olympus added that [...] "disease prevention and prognosis through foods" [...] was one of its objects.|$|E

The integrated maximum photocurrent under Air Mass 1.5 illumination, in the conventional Shockley-Quiesser limit for solar energy conversion for p-Si (1.12 eV), p-InP (1.3 eV), p-GaAs (1.4 eV), and p-GaP (2.3 eV) are 44.0 mA cm&minus;2, 37.0 mA cm&minus;2, 32.5 mA cm&minus;2 and 9.0 mA cm&minus;2, respectively. Therefore, non-aqueous media such as DMF, acetonitrile, methanol are explored as solvent for CO2 electrochemical reduction. In addition, Methanol has been industrially used as a physical absorber of CO2 in the Rectisol method. Similarly to aqueous media system, p-Si, p-InP, p-GaAs, p-GaP and p-CdTe are explored for CO2 photoelectrochemical reduction.
