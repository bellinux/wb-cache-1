40|$|Blowholes and {{blemishes}} {{were determined}} to start at two stages of manufacturing. Sperical blowholes resulted from trapped gas between the high melting temperature bond glass and the MCP wafer. During thermal processing, the trapped gas expanded and displaced the softened channel glass to form a spherical inclusion. This defect was eliminated by grinding the prefritted bond wafer and channel plate wafer to a flatness which ensured intimate contact prior to fusion. Elliptical blowholes or blemishes were introduced during the fiber draw stage. Contaminants trapped between the <b>core</b> <b>bar</b> and clad tubing volatized providing large quantities of expanding gas. These pockets of gas became elongated to an ellipsoidal shape during fiber draw.

Previous published research by the authors has shown that an electro-optic system {{can be used for}} PD measurement of oil-filled power transformers. A PD signal generated within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding and then travel along the winding to the bushing <b>core</b> <b>bar.</b> The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its earthed tap point. Therefore, an effective PD current measurement can be implemented at the bushing tap by using a radio frequency current transducer around the bushing-tap earth connection. In addition, the use of an optical transmission technique not only improves the electrical noise immunity and provides the possibility of remote measurement but also realizes electrical isolation and enhances safety for operators. However, the bushing <b>core</b> <b>bar</b> can act as an aerial and in addition noise induced by the electro-optic modulation system may influence overall measurement sensitivity. This paper reports on a machine learning technique, namely the use of a support vector machine (SVM), to improve the detection sensitivity of the system.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of the scaling relations between Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses (Mbh), and their host galaxies' K-band bulge (Lbul) and total (Ltot) luminosities. The wide-field WIRCam imager at the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT) was used to obtain the deepest and highest resolution near infrared images available for a sample of 35 galaxies with securely measured Mbh, selected irrespective of Hubble type. For each galaxy, we derive bulge and total magnitudes using a two-dimensional image decomposition code that allows us to account, if necessary, for large- and small-scale disks, <b>cores,</b> <b>bars,</b> nuclei, rings, envelopes and spiral arms. We find that the present-day Mbh-Lbul and Mbh-Ltot relations have consistent intrinsic scatter, suggesting that Mbh correlates equally well with bulge and total luminosity of the host. Our analysis provides only mild evidence of a decreased scatter if the fit is restricted to elliptical galaxies. The log-slopes of the Mbh-Lbul and Mbh-Ltot relations are 0. 75 +/- 0. 10 and 0. 92 +/- 0. 14, respectively. However, while the slope of the Mbh-Lbul relation depends on the detail of the image decomposition, the characterization of Mbh-Ltot does not. Given the difficulties and ambiguities of decomposing galaxy images into separate components, our results indicate that Ltot is more suitable as a tracer of SMBH mass than Lbul, and that the Mbh-Ltot relation should be used when studying the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{an important}} technique for assessing the health of high voltage power transformers. A partial discharge signal within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding first, then travel along the winding to the bushing <b>core</b> <b>bar.</b> The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its tap point. Previous published work [1] has shown that these high frequency components at the bushing tap point can be detected using a suitable sensor and transmitted to remote digital equipment for on-line analysis. In a high voltage substation there is often excessive electrical noise which may corrupt any measured PD signal from the bushing tap point as the bushing acts as an antenna. If signal transmission is implemented using standard coaxial cables this can result in further corruption of the PD signal. The use of optical transmission techniques therefore has clear advantages not only through improved noise immunity {{but also because it}} realises electrical isolation and improved operator safety. This paper details the application of an electrooptic modulator to generate transmission signals over polarization maintaining optical fibre from the measurement point. The feasibility of this approach has been investigated using PD signals measured at the tap point of a 60 kV bushing, two different PD sources have been used and in both cases it was possible to detect PD activity above 40 pC...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to secure, refine and {{supplement}} the relation between central Supermassive Black Hole masses (Mbh), and the bulge luminosities of their host galaxies, (Lbul), we obtained deep, high spatial resolution K-band images of 35 nearby galaxies with securely measured Mbh, using the wide-field WIRCam imager at the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT). A dedicated data reduction and sky subtraction strategy was adopted to estimate the brightness {{and structure of the}} sky, a critical step when tracing the light distribution of extended objects in the near-infrared. From the final image product, bulge and total magnitudes were extracted via two-dimensional profile fitting. As a first order approximation, all galaxies were modeled using a simple Sersic-bulge + exponential-disk decomposition. However, we found that such models did not adequately describe the structure that we observe in a large fraction of our sample galaxies which often include <b>cores,</b> <b>bars,</b> nuclei, inner disks, spiral arms, rings and envelopes. In such cases, we adopted profile modifications and/or more complex models with additional components. The derived bulge magnitudes are very sensitive to the details and number of components used in the models, although total magnitudes remain almost unaffected. Usually, but not always, the luminosities and sizes of the bulges are overestimated when a simple bulge+disk decomposition is adopted in lieu of a more complex model. Furthermore we found that some spheroids are not well fit when the ellipticity of the Sersic model is held fixed. This paper presents the details of the image processing and analysis, while in a companion paper we discuss how model-induced biases and systematics in bulge magnitudes impact the Mbh-Lbul relation.

40|$|The use of hollow <b>core</b> <b>bars</b> in micropiles {{has greatly}} {{increased}} {{over the past ten}} years. Hollow core construction, also known as “self drilled”, is becoming a popular option because it allows a faster installation processes and ground improvement at the same time. Despite the growing demand for hollow bar micropiles, little work has been devoted to evaluating the nominal bond strength between the micropile grout and the surrounding soil, especially in clayey soils. Moreover, the performance of such micropiles under different kinds of loading is still largely unknown and needs to be investigated. In this study, a research methodology encompassing two primary elements is adopted. The first element is a series of full scale field studies on hollow bar micropiles installed in cohesive soils, while the second is numerical investigations on hollow bar micropiles. To accomplish the study, four hollow core micropiles were installed using an air flushing technique employing large drilling carbide bits. Twenty-two load tests were conducted on the four hollow bar micropiles. The hollow bar micropiles were loaded in four consecutive phases, which included; five axial monotonic, five axial cyclic load tests on single micropiles, four axial monotonic tests on pairs of hollow bar micropiles, two monotonic and six cyclic lateral tests on single micropiles. The results of each set of tests were utilized to validate a numerical model. Parametric studies were conducted on the calibrated model to provide design guide lines for hollow bar micropiles under different loads. An equation is proposed to estimate the axial capacity of hollow bar micropiles in cohesive soils depending on the installation method adopted. In addition, an equation for the stiffness degradation under axial cyclic loading is proposed. It reveals that the group efficiency factor for hollow bar micropiles should be taken equal to 1, despite the spacing to diameter ratio employed. Moreover, a family of interaction factor diagrams is established to estimate the settlement of hollow bar micropiles group. Finally, the study demonstrated that hollow bar micropiles can carry moderate lateral loads with proper reinforcement configurations and pile head fixity condition...|$|R

40|$|Past {{studies on}} soil nailing {{have a common}} {{assumption}} that a soil nail could be simplified as a single material solid cylinder. However, a soil nail is a composite material and consisted of the following basic components: steel bars, cement grout, PVC centralizers, steel couplers, and a plastic hose, etc. They are combined and work together to keep the fundamental functions in soil reinforcement. Since these components are made by various constituent materials, the physical and mechanical properties of them are greatly different, making the deformations through soil nail diverse. The different deformations could be incompatible, which has significant effects on the soil nail integrity and performance due to the intrinsically existing vulnerable areas. One critical issue is the key component cement grout sleeve, functioning as the adhesive to transfer stress between the ground and steel bar, may encounter tensile failure on the out-layer surface or along the interface between steel bar and itself. The consequence would be cracking and detachment of cement grout and then malfunction of soil nails. Therefore, it is of great importance to examine the mechanical behavior of soil nails by {{taking into account the}} behavior of the different components. In this research extensive laboratory tests have been carried out to examine and quantify the mechanical properties of soil nail’s each component as well as their simple combinations. Based on this, a series of physical modeling of soil nail in tension and bending tests are designed to simulate the deformation of soil nail under loading. The characteristics of soil nail’s overall behavior and cracking initiation/propagation in cement grout are observed and interpreted. Besides, two soil nail’s component replacement trials based on the conventional design are conducted with attempt to enhance the overall soil nail strength and facilitate the installation procedure. A new concrete mix design with fine aggregates (sands) is adopted to substitute the neat cement grout for minimizing the local failure in cement column. Optimum sand ratio which is sound for postponing the cracking is evaluated as well. Another trial is the application of hollow <b>core</b> steel <b>bar</b> in place of the solid one. Compared to the traditional drill-and-grout soil nailing method, this new technology has advantages of fewer installation steps through a self-grout method.

Repeated bathymetric surveys through two monsoon flood seasons, combined with bar-top surveys during exposure of the bar at low flow, provide the most detailed chronology of braid-bar growth yet compiled for a large sand-bed river. During rising and peak flow of the 1994 monsoon flood, a 1. 5 -km-long, 0. 5 -km-wide, 12 -m-high, symmetrical mid-channel bar was deposited in the centre of a major channel downstream of a zone of flow convergence and significant bank erosion. Initial deposition and growth of the <b>bar</b> <b>core</b> were probably caused by amalgamation of dunes that are present in the Jamuna channels at all flow stages. Bar-top aggradation continued through downstream migration of an `accretionary dune front', a 3 -m-high, angle-of-repose slipface that was composed of amalgamated, 0. 5 - to 1 -m-high dunes. At waning and low flow, the mid-channel bar widened by up to 1 km through the lateral accretion of dunes onto the margins of the initial <b>bar</b> <b>core.</b> A low-velocity zone in the sheltered wake region of the bar-tail led to the accumulation of substantial volumes of silts and clays. During the rising and peak flows of the next monsoon flood, the mid-channel bar extended its bar-tail by up to 1. 5 km, as one of the anabranches became dominant, and flow was deflected across the bar-tail. Accretion at the bar-tail generated a lobate, transverse bar-front with a 10 -m-high, angle-of-repose avalanche face. Emergence of several smaller bars along this depositional front produced an overall reach morphology that more closely resembled an alternate bar rather than several mid-channel bars.

To do this, the rods are placed in the middle of tiny solenoids, which produce a linear field in one direction or the other depending on which direction the current is flowing.

40|$|This paper explores resonance-driven secular {{evolution}} {{between a}} bar and dark matter halo using N-body simulations. We make direct comparisons to our analytic theory to demonstrate the great difficulty that an N-body simulation has representing these dynamics for realistic astronomical interactions. In a dark matter halo, the bar 2 ̆ 7 s angular momentum is coupled to the central density cusp (if present) by the inner Lindblad resonance. Owing to this angular momentum transfer and self-consistent re-equilibration, strong realistic bars WILL modify the cusp profile, lowering the central densities within about 30 per cent of the bar radius in a few bar orbits. Past results to the contrary {{may be the result}} of weak bars or numerical artefacts. The magnitude of the effect depends on many factors and we illustrate the sensitivity of the response to the dark matter profile, the bar shape and mass and the galaxy 2 ̆ 7 s evolutionary history. For example, if the bar length is comparable to the size of a central dark matter <b>core,</b> the <b>bar</b> may exchange angular momentum without changing its pattern speed significantly. We emphasize that this apparently simple example of secular evolution is remarkably subtle in detail and conclude that an N-body exploration of any astronomical scenario requires a deep investigation into the underlying dynamical mechanisms for that particular problem to set the necessary requirements for the simulation parameters and method (e. g. particle number and Poisson solver). Simply put, N-body simulations do not divinely reveal truth and hence their results are not infallible.

The core and jet brightness temperatures are found through modelling the self-calibrated uv data with Gaussian components, which provide reliable {{estimates of the}} flux density {{and the size of}} the individual components. The observed high core brightness temperatures (median T-b,T- core = 4 x 10 (11) K) are consistent with Doppler-boosted emission from a relativistic jet orientated close to the line of sight. This can also explain the dramatic jet bends observed for some of our sources since small intrinsic bends can be significantly amplified due to projection effects in a highly beamed relativistic jet. We also model-fit the polarized emission and, by taking the minimum angle separation between the model-fitted polarization angles at 5 and 8. 4 GHz, we calculate the minimum inferred Faraday rotation measure (RMmin) for each component. We also calculate the minimum intrinsic RM in the rest frame of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) [RMminintr = RMmin(1 + z) (2) ], first subtracting the integrated (presumed foreground) RM in those cases where we felt we could do this reliably. The resulting mean <b>core</b> vertical <b>bar</b> RMminintr vertical bar is 5580 rad m(- 2), with a standard deviation of 3390 rad m(- 2), for four high-z quasars for which we believe we could reliably remove the foreground RM. We find relatively steep core and jet spectral index values, with a median core spectral index of - 0. 3 and a median jet spectral index of - 1. 0. Comparing our results with RM observations of more nearby AGN at similar emitted frequencies does not provide any significant evidence for dependence of the quasar nuclear environment with redshift. However, more accurate RM and spectral information for a larger sample of sources would be required before making any conclusive statements about the environment of quasar jets in the early universe...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} non-axisymmetric {{evolution}} of magnetized clouds, using a 2 D MHD code {{based on the}} physically motivated thin-disk approximation. We found that such clouds become unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations after the supercritical cores are formed due to ambipolar diffusion. We show that {{for a wide range}} of initial cloud parameters, the $m= 2 $ mode grows nonlinearly into a bar during the isothermal collapse after the supercritical core formation. The supercritical core can break up into fragments during or after the isothermal phase of cloud evolution. The outcome of fragmentation depends on the initial cloud conditions, such as the magnetic field strength, rotation rate, amount of cloud mass and mass distribution. It is classified into three different types: (1) separate <b>core</b> formation, (2) <b>bar</b> fragmentation, and (3) disk fragmentation. These three types of fragmentation loosely correspond to the empirical classification of embedded binary and multiple systems of Looney, Mundy, & Welch, based on millimeter dust continuum observations. The well-studied starless core, L 1544, appears to belong to the bar fragmentation type. We expect it to produce a highly elongated, opaque bar at the center in the future, which should break up into fragments of initial masses in the substellar regime.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{dissertation}} is the assessment of technical shear resistance (technological shear) of orthopedic screw made of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, produced using incremental technology {{in the process of}} 3 D printing process. The first part of the work presents incremental techniques in production engineering. The second part of the present work contains specification of the 3 D printing process of samples as well as the description of the used material. The fundamental part of the article is composed out of endurance tests for orthopaedic screws as well as the analysis of the obtained results and conclusions. The method of incremental production SLM using SLM 280 HL metal printer was used during the technological process. The resistance tests were performed using ZWICK/ROELL Z 150 machines. Identical endurance trials were performed for monolithic bars made of titanium alloys (of <b>bar</b> <b>core</b> size) made on a wire electric discharge machine Sodick SL 600 Q for comparative purposes. The obtained test results enabled comparative assessment of the value of shear resistance Rt in the conditions of technological shear. According to the performed tests, the shear resistance Rt of orthopaedic screws is nearly 33 % lower than of monolithic bars of the same core size...|$|R
40|$|The beam-column joints {{are very}} {{restricted}} {{areas in which}} the internal forces, generated by boundary elements, act on the concrete <b>core</b> and reinforcing <b>bars</b> with a very high gradient. They are the link between horizontal and vertical structural elements, and therefore, they are {{directly involved in the}} transfer of seismic forces. Thus, they are crucial to study the seismic behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. To fully understand the seismic performances and failure modes of beam-column joints in RC buildings, a simplified analytical model of joint behavior is proposed and theoretical simulations are performed. The aim of the model, focusing on internal perimetric joints, is to identify the strength hierarchy in terms of capacity for different failure modes (namely failure of cracked joint, bond failure of passing through bars, flexural/shear failures of columns or beams). It could represent a tool for the designers of new joints to quantify the performance of new structures, but also as a tool for the designers of external strengthening of existing joints in order to calculate the benefits of the retrofit and pushing the initial failure to a more desirable failure mode. Further, some experimental results of tests available in the scientific literature are reported, analyzed and compared...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcing bars for concrete structure has been extensively investigated {{and a number of}} FRP bars are commercially available. However, major shortcomings of the existing FRP bars are its high initial cost and low elastic modulus compared to conventional steel bars. The main objective of this study using the concept of material hybridization is to develop a viable hybrid FRP bar for concrete structures, especially for marine and waterfront concrete structures. The purposes of hybridization are to increase the elastic modulus of GFRP bar which have function of protecting corrosion and to reduce the initial cost of the FRP bar. Two types of hybrid FRP bar were considered in the development: GFRP crust with steel <b>core</b> and GFRP <b>bar</b> with steel wires dispersed over the cross-section. Using E-glass fibers and unsaturated polyester resins, the hybrid GFRP bar samples of 13 mm in diameter were pultruded and tested for tensile strength. The effect of hybridization on tensile properties of FRP bars were obtained by comparing the results of tensile test with those of non-hybrid GFRP bars. The results of this study indicated that the elastic modulus of the hybrid FRP bar was increased by up to 160 percent compare to non-hybrid GFRP bars. The results of the test program and the future recommendations are summarized in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} paper about the {{fragmentation}} and mass outflow in the molecular cloud by using three-dimensional MHD nested-grid simulations. The binary star formation process is studied paying {{particular attention to the}} fragmentation of a rotating magnetized molecular cloud. We assume an isothermal rotating and magnetized cylindrical cloud in hydrostatic balance. Non-axisymmetric as well as axisymmetric perturbations are added to the initial state and the subsequent evolutions are studied. The evolution is characterized by three parameters: the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric perturbations, the rotation speed, and the magnetic field strength. As a result, it is found that non-axisymmetry hardly evolves in the early phase, but begins to grow after the gas contracts and forms a thin disk. Disk formation is strongly promoted by the rotation speed and the magnetic field strength. There are two types of fragmentation: fragmentation from a ring and that from a <b>bar.</b> Thin adiabatic <b>cores</b> fragment if a thickness is smaller than 1 / 4 of the radius. For the fragments to survive, they should be formed in a heavily elongated <b>barred</b> <b>core</b> or a flat round disk. In the models showing fragmentation, outflows from respective fragments are found as well as those driven by the rotating bar or the disk. Comment: Accepted by MNRAS Letters, 6 pages, 2 figures.

50|$|The {{quenching}} process {{produces a}} high strength bar from inexpensive low carbon steel. The process quenches the surface {{layer of the}} bar, which pressurizes and deforms the crystal structure of intermediate layers, and simultaneously begins to temper the quenched layers using {{the heat from the}} <b>bar's</b> <b>core.</b> Steel billets 130mm² ("pencil ingots") are heated to approximately 1200°C to 1250°C in a reheat furnace. Then, they are progressively rolled to reduce the billets to the final size and shape of reinforcing bar. After the last rolling stand, the billet moves through a quench box. The quenching converts the billet's surface layer to martensite, and causes it to shrink. The shrinkage pressurizes the core, helping to form the correct crystal structures. The core remains hot, and austenitic. A microprocessor controls the water flow to the quench box, to manage the temperature difference through the cross-section of the bars. The correct temperature difference assures that all processes occur, and bars have the necessary mechanical properties. The bar leaves the quench box with a temperature gradient through its cross section. As the bar cools, heat flows from the bar's centre to its surface so that the bar's heat and pressure correctly tempers an intermediate ring of martensite and bainite. Finally, the slow cooling after quenching automatically tempers the austenitic core to ferrite and pearlite on the cooling bed.|$|R
