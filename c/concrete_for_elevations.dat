The {{estimation of the}} environmental impact of the use of machine parts that grains are freed from and contact the surface of titanium alloys by wear is buffing. Due to its catalytic action, TiO 2 is nowadays added to asphalt, <b>concrete,</b> exterior paints <b>for</b> <b>elevation,</b> self-cleaning glass and protective coatings. It is also present in clothes, food (E 171), cosmetics (CI 77891) and textiles. The research on the toxicity of titanium and its compounds points towards their neutral character, however an adverse impact is also observed in nature. TiO 2 may affect air quality. It promotes free radicals and ozone origination. The properties and direction of the use of titanium compounds and their influence on the circulation of pollutants are described below.
