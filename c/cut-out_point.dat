40|$|Abstract The cut-out of {{the sliding}} screw {{is one of}} the most common {{complications}} in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. The reasons for the cut-out are: a suboptimal position of the hip-screw in the femoral head, the type of fracture and poor bone quality. The aim of this study was to reproduce the cut-out event biomechanically and to evaluate the possible prevention of this event by the use of a biopolymer augmentation of the hip screw. Concerning the density and compression force of osteoporotic femoral bone polyurethane foam according to the terms of the Association for Standard Testing Material (ASTMF 1839 - 97) was used as test material. The polyurethane foam Lumoltan 200 with a compression force of 3. 3 Mpa and a density of 0. 192 g/cm 3 was used to reproduce the osteoporotic bone of the femoral fragment (density 12 lbm/ft 3). A cylinder of 50 mm of length and 50 mm of width was produced by a rotary splint raising procedure with planar contact. The axial load of the system was performed by a hydraulic force cylinder of a universal test machine type Zwick 1455, Ulm, Germany. The CCD-angle of the used TGN-System was preset at 130 degrees. The migration pattern of the hip screw in the polyurethane foam was measured and expressed as a curve of the distance in millimeter [mm] against the applied load in Newton [N] up to the <b>cut-out</b> <b>point.</b> During the tests the implants reached a critical changing point from stable to unstable with an increased load progression of steps of 50 Newton. This unstable point was characterized by an increased migration speed in millimeters and higher descending gradient in the migration curve. This peak of the migration curve served as an indicator for the change of the hip screw position in the simulated bone material. The applied load in the non-augmented implant showed that in this group for a density degree of 12 (0, 192 g/cm 3) the mean force at the failure point was 1431 Newton (± 52 Newton). In the augmented implant we found that the mean force at the failure point was 1987 Newton (± 84 Newton). This difference was statistically significant. In conclusion, the bone density is a significant factor for the stability of the hip screw implant. The osteosynthesis with screws in material with low density increases the chance for cut-out. A biopolymer augmented hip screw could significantly improve the stability of the fixation. The use of augmentation with a fast hardening bone replacement material containing polymer-ceramic changes the point of failure under axial load in the osteoporotic bone model and could significantly improve the failure point. Our study results indicate, that a decrease of failure in terms of cut-out can be achieved with polymer augmentation of hip screws in osteoporotic bones. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of two policy simulations for couples with and without children. The first policy involves a reduction of the highest withdrawal rate from 70 to 60 per cent. The second policy reduces all withdrawal rates of 70 and 50 per cent to 30 per cent. A comparison is made between the two policies to determine the magnitude of the impact on government expenditure and labour supply responses. Both policies have the effect of increasing the net income of those who are either partly relying on benefit payments or whose pre-reform income is just above the pre-reform <b>cut-out</b> <b>points.</b> Other people are unaffected, which means that overall government expenditure will increase. Behavioural simulations show that married men and women seem to be relatively unresponsive to the first policy. This implies that minor changes in the withdrawal rate {{do not seem to be}} effective. The second policy induces larger behavioural changes. The transition matrices suggest that married women are more responsive to a reduction in the taper rate than men. Overall, women are working less on average whereas men tend to work more on average. These results are similar to the effects found in the US and UK literature. ...|$|R
40|$|The Ritz {{approach}} {{is used in}} this thesis to study the free structural vibration problem of a wide class of plates, shallow shells and solids. The boundaries and/or internal supports of the systems considered are described by polynomials in Cartesian coordinates. The geometric boundary conditions at these boundaries or internal supports are enforced by including in a simple polynomial trial series the polynomial equation describing {{the position of the}} support raised to the appropriate power. For plates and shallow shells, in some instances, the displacement field is discretized into several domains or elements, as in the standard finite element method, and continuity conditions along the connecting boundaries are enforced by using a penalty method approach. Complicating effects such as point masses, stepped geometry, <b>cut-outs</b> and internal <b>point</b> supports are also considered, the geometric conditions at the point supports being enforced again by using a penalty method approach.;First, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a number of isotropic rectangular plates with straight or curved internal line supports are obtained. Isotropic and orthotropic plates of more general planform, including circular, elliptical and hypocycloidally shaped plates are then considered. The effect of complications such as internal point and line supports, stepped geometry, internal <b>cut-outs</b> and <b>point</b> masses is also considered in some cases.;The {{approach is}} next extended {{to the study of the}} free vibration of shallow shells and planform describable by general polynomial expressions. A number of shallow shells, many not previously considered in the literature, are then treated, including shallow shells of circular, elliptical and rectangular planform. A number of curvatures are considered, including spherical, hyperbolic and cylindrical, and complicating effects, such as stepped thickness, discontinuous curvatures and curved internal line supports, are included in the analysis.;Finally, the Ritz approach is applied to the study of the free vibration of a class of solids bounded by the x, y and z planes as well as by a fourth surface describable by a polynomial expression in the cartesian coordinates x, y and z. By exploiting symmetry a number of problems are considered these being a sphere, a circular cylinder, an elliptical cylinder, a cone and a prismatic solid of more general cross section...|$|R
