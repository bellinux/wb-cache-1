40|$|Accurate {{models of}} {{planetary}} boundary layer (PBL) processes are important for forecasting weather and climate. The present study compares seven methods of calculating PBL depth in the GEOS- 5 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) over land. These methods depend on the eddy diffusion coefficients, bulk and local Richardson numbers, and the turbulent kinetic energy. The computed PBL depths are aggregated to the Koppen <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> and some limited comparisons are made using radiosonde profiles. Most methods produce similar midday PBL depths, although in the warm, moist <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> the bulk Richardson number method gives midday results that are lower than those given by the eddy diffusion coefficient methods. Additional analysis revealed that methods sensitive to turbulence driven by radiative cooling produce greater PBL depths, this effect being most significant during the evening transition. Nocturnal PBLs based on Richardson number are generally shallower than eddy diffusion coefficient based estimates. The bulk Richardson number estimate is recommended as the PBL height to inform {{the choice of the}} turbulent length scale, based on the similarity to other methods during the day, and the improved nighttime behavior...|$|R
40|$|Access {{to natural}} {{resources}} {{is a problem}} current and future generations must overcome. To better understand potential changes in access for society due to environmental impacts, global spatio-temporal modeling is required. Spatial data for global assessments have uncertainty, and decision making can be problematic in regards to combining data. The basic problem associated with combining data for global assessments is the data’s heterogeneous nature in terms of source, type, quality, uncertainty, and accuracy. The data uncertainty must be communicated. The overarching question is: how can uncertain information be defined and modelled for global scale studies? This thesis applies geographic information systems for solving spatial questions requiring the combination of several data sets that cover large geographical areas, come from many different data providers, and have varying quality with known and unknown uncertainty. The thesis uses combined spatial data for decision-making related to petroleum exploration and climate change. The first section elucidates the spatial understanding of <b>climate</b> <b>class</b> change on ecosystem services. An ecosystem service assessment valuation composed of 19 criteria is proposed. A global, spatial valuation is calculated by combining empirical data from 23 spatial and nonspatial databases. The global value presented is less than previous studies; however, this study excludes criteria from previous publications {{and was unable to}} reliably quantify all criteria. Uncertainty in the input data are described but not quantified. Using five general circulation models and four representative concentration pathways, the Köppen-Geiger climate classification transitions were modeled from 2005 to 2099. The ecosystem service value was evaluated to quantify how much would be in a new <b>climate</b> <b>class.</b> Depending on the representative concentration pathway, between 25 - 66 % of the ecosystem service value will be affected by a <b>climate</b> <b>class</b> change. Uncertainty in the results are presented as a range of values. The second section focuses on using spatial multi-criteria evaluation and error propagation for petroleum exploration. The first part proposes a fuzzy logic multi-criteria evaluation by combining 16 criteria comprised of 26 data sets. The data sets are empirically defined and expert-based. The use of fuzzy logic is meant to mimic the traditional approach by a geologist evaluating the data but provides a framework for consistency, repeatability, and uncertainty evaluation. A case study of northern South America predicts new areas for exploration. Uncertainty is quantified {{in the second half of}} the study. After the multi-criteria evaluation is applied, the attribute classification, fuzzy logic memberships, and multi-criteria evaluation calculations are subjected to an error propagation analysis in order to quantify the uncertainty. The error propagation analysis showed that attribute classification using expert-defined uncertainty was the preferred approach over a constant defined uncertainty. Further, attribute classification uncertainty affected the results more than the fuzzy membership uncertainty, which could therefore be omitted; uncertainty related to the multi-criteria evaluation calculations heavily influenced the results and thus require care when selecting. In the concluding remarks, a data and model transparency checklist is provided based on what may be considered appropriate points in a study to quantify or describe the uncertainty in a model...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide climate peer groups that may be used in {{combination}} with any set of Section 15 indicators as a guide to understanding the impact of climate on participating transit authorities. The method of deriving these climate peer groups involves applying three climatic indicators to partition 203 transit authorities into "harsh," "intermediate," and "benign" climate peer groups. The results are mapped and are displayed in tabular form. The simple numerical procedure is checked using elementary linear algebra, and the resulting climate peer groups are again mapped and displayed in tabular form. The hypothesis that bus durability is adversely affected in harsh climates is then tested, using data from Section 15 indicators, to illustrate the method of employing these climate peer groups. Section 15 indicators on "age distribution," "distance between road calls," and "vehicle miles per maintenance dollar," partitioned by <b>climate</b> <b>class,</b> provide support for this hypothesis. Implications resulting from the testing of this hypothesis suggest which climate peer groups might benefit from additional evaluation of their maintenance strategy and which climate peer groups might serve as maintenance models for others...|$|E
40|$|The annual {{cycles of}} surface shortwave flux are {{investigated}} using the 8 -yr dataset {{of the surface}} radiation budget (SRB) components for the period July 1983 -June 1991. These components include the downward, upward, and net shortwave radiant fluxes at the earth's surface. The seasonal cycles are quantified in terms of principal components that describe the temporal variations and empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) that describe the spatial patterns. The {{major part of the}} variation is simply due to the variation of the insolation {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, especially for the first term, which describes 92. 4 % of the variance for the downward shortwave flux. However, for the second term, which describes 4. 1 % of the variance, the effect of clouds is quite important and the effect of clouds dominates the third term, which describes 2. 4 % of the variance. To a large degree the second and third terms are due to the response of clouds to the annual cycle of solar forcing. For net shortwave flux at the surface, similar variances are described by each term. The regional values of the EOFs are related to climate classes, thereby defining the range of annual cycles of shortwave radiation for each <b>climate</b> <b>class...</b>|$|E

Although several mosquito species are implicated in its transmission, the major vectors are the salt marsh mosquito Aedes vigilax (Skuse) and the freshwater species Culex annulirostris Skuse. The four areas reported here are in eastern Queensland, selected by Koeppen <b>climate</b> <b>class</b> to minimise the effects of climatic variation. The disease data were obtained from the Queensland State Health department and mosquito control information was collected from Local Government Authorities by survey, using a structured questionnaire. Mosquito control practices were categorized according to their surveillance protocols and treatment regimes, and Analysis of Variance was used to compare the mosquito control types to long-term disease incidence. The results showed that long-term RRV disease incidence was lowest in areas with programs that included routine and pre-emptive surveillance combined with extensive treatment of both saltwater and freshwater mosquito habitat. It is concluded that integrated programs that include surveillance and treat all major habitats of the vectors can {{have a significant effect on}} the incidence on mosquito borne disease, in this case RRV.

We have used tracer simulations of aerosols emitted from MPCs worldwide to assess the fractions which are deposited at various distances away from their source location. Considering only source location, prevailing meteorology, and the aerosol size and solubility, we show that fine aerosol particles have a high potential to pollute remote regions. About half of the emitted mass of aerosol tracers with an ambient diameter Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 1. 0 ÃÂ¼m is typically deposited in regions more than 1000 km away from the source. Furthermore, using the KÃÂ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification to categorize the sources into various <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> we find substantial differences in the deposition potential between these classes. Tracers originating in arid regions show the largest remote deposition potentials, with values more than doubled compared to the smallest potentials from tracers in tropical regions. Seasonal changes in atmospheric conditions lead to variations in the remote deposition potentials. On average the remote deposition potentials in summer correspond to about 70 Ã¢ÂÂ 80 % of the values in winter, with a large spread among the <b>climate</b> <b>classes.</b> For tracers from tropical regions the summer remote deposition values are only about 31 % of the winter values, while they are about 95 % for tracers from arid regions...|$|R

3000|$|Traditionally, Michigan’s grape growing {{region is}} {{classified}} as a “cool climate”. However, the average temperatures {{over the course of}} two 30 -year periods starting in the year 1950 show significant change. In southwest Michigan, GSTs from 1950 to 1979 averaged 16.50  °C. From 1980 to 2009, the growing season average temperature rose 0.55 – 17.05  °C. In northwest Michigan, a nearly identical warming trend was found. From 1950 to 1979, the average GST was 14.13  °C while from 1980 to 2009, the average temperature was 14.69  °C (increase of 0.56  °C). The average GSTs for both southwest and northwest Michigan suggest that Michigan’s grape growing regions may not necessarily need to be combined as one homogenous region and southwest Michigan is, on the long term average, approximately 2.4  °C warmer than northwest Michigan. From a temperature perspective, these two regions have two different climates. This is represented by the fact that southwest Michigan is a Dfa Köppen <b>climate</b> <b>class,</b> while northwest Michigan is a Dfb class (Köppen 1900; Geiger 1965). The second issue is that southwest Michigan’s average GSTs should be seen as too warm to be classified as a “cool climate”, at least from the perspective of growing season mean temperature. Michigan’s growing season has traditionally been too short from spring to fall, and Michigan’s winters would certainly classify the region as cool.
