In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the Sloan Great Wall. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation Eridanus. It coincides with the 'CMB cold spot', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the <b>cold</b> <b>spot,</b> but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the lack}} of optimum {{operating}} conditions, this study revealed that {{the negative effects of}} heating inconsistency were mitigated through meticulous monitoring of temperature. The methodology developed by Hoover et al. [7] proved to be sufficient in identifying inadequate treatment and explaining cases of nematode survival, provided fiber optic probes are located in optimal positions to locate <b>cold</b> <b>spots.</b> The probes were used for primary temperature observation and control because of their reliability, but this means relying on the measured temperatures of finite locations within the wood, which do not represent all points in the wood. After preliminary trials in Step 1, it was observed that <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> appeared in similar locations, so the probes were repositioned accordingly. Although the probe relocations reduced the risk of <b>cold</b> <b>spots,</b> a secondary macroscopic technique was required to determine the existence of <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> across the entire specimen. When we used IR images to measure the surface temperature of treated wood, we could detect <b>cold</b> <b>spots,</b> which explained survival of nematodes despite the fact that all of the internal fiber optic probes reached or exceeded the target temperature.|$|R
40|$|Background: Growing {{evidence}} suggests significant geographic clustering of male circumcision (MC) in Tanzania. The impact of spatial heterogeneity of MC prevalence on HIV transmission dynamics {{in this country}} is not well documented. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the spatial association between MC and HIV infection in Tanzania. Methods: Data from three Demographic and Health Survey rounds conducted in Tanzania were analyzed to identify spatial associations between MC and HIV using bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Spatial clusters with low MC prevalence (MC <b>cold</b> <b>spots)</b> were identified using scan statistics. HIV incidence rates for males and females within and outside the MC <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> were calculated. Results: LISA analysis indicated a significant association between MC and HIV in the northern and southwestern regions of Tanzania. Scan statistics identified two MC <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> in the same locations. Males located outside the MC <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> had the lowest HIV incidence rate at 0. 28 per 100 person-years at risk (pyar). HIV incidence in females located outside the MC <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> increased from 0. 40 / 100 pyar during 2004 - 08 to 0. 68 / 100 pyar in 2008 - 12. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence for a geographic association between MC and HIV in Tanzania. MC could be one of the key factors driving the geographical distribution of the HIV epidemic in the country. Furthermore, in areas where most males are circumcised, the HIV infection burden could be concentrating in the female population. Therefore, along with the voluntary medical MC program, efforts targeting the female population should also be considered...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{stability}} {{is essential for}} the survival and well-being of preterm neonates. This is achieved in neonatal incubators by raising the ambient temperature and humidity to sufficiently high levels. However, potentially pathogenic microorganisms also can thrive in such warm and humid environments. We therefore investigated whether the level of microbial contamination (i. e., the bacterial load) inside neonatal incubators can be predicted {{on the basis of their}} average temperature and relative humidity settings, paying special attention to local temperature differences. Swab samples were taken from the warmest and <b>coldest</b> <b>spots</b> found within Caleo incubators, and these were plated to determine the number of microbial CFU per location. In incubators with high average temperature (>= 34 degrees C) and relative humidity (>= 60 %) values, the level of microbial contamination was significantly higher at <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> than at hot spots. This relates to the fact that the local equilibrium relative humidity at <b>cold</b> <b>spots</b> is sufficiently high to sustain microbial growth. The abundance of staphylococci, which are the main causative agents of late-onset sepsis in preterm neonates, was found to be elevated significantly in cold areas.
