40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to ensure quality green forage and silage early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring on family farms in northern Croatia, through introducing winter cereals and Winter pea mixtures. For that purpose mixtures of Winter pea (cv. Maksimirski visoki) with triticale (cv. Clercal) were <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of May, while the mixtures of Winter pea with wheat (cv. Sana and cv. Žitarka) were <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of May at family farms: Maletić (Ferdinandovac), Mirović (Višnjevac), Bazić (M. Trojstvo), Mlinar (Kapela Podravska), Mužinić (Križevćec) i Uher (Grabovac). The mixtures were used to feed dairy cows from the beginning of flowering till the full bloom of Winterpea. The green mass yields (GMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of pea flowering varied from 24. 0 to 52. 7 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full bloom of Winter pea were from 46. 7 to 67. 5 t/ha. Average dry matter yields (DMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of flowering varied from 4. 05 to 12. 2 t/ha, while the DMY of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full bloom of Winter pea were from 8. 98 to 18. 39 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with triticale <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of flowering had drymatter content (DMC) from 19. 41 % while the DMC of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full bloom of Winter pea were from 23. 56 %. The GMY for mixtures of Winter pea with wheat <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of pea flowering varied from 23. 2 to 50. 0 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full bloom of Winter pea were from 53. 3 to 62. 5 t/ha. The DMY for mixtures of Winter pea with wheat <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of flowering varied from 4. 39 to 9. 49 t/ha, while the DMY of <b>the</b> same mixture <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full bloom were from 10. 67 to 15. 59 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with wheat <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of flowering had DMC from 17. 0 % to 20. 96 %, while the DMC of <b>the</b> same mixtures <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full bloom were from 20. 00 % to 27. 31 %...|$|R

5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with deep <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E
5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Debs {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation's first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh Government manages {{those parts}} of the British railway network within Wales. Cardiff Central is Wales' busiest railway station, with over four times as much {{passenger}} traffic as any other station in Wales. The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line. All trains in Wales are diesel-powered, since no lines have been electrified. However, the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea, is undergoing electrification.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E

5|$|The {{onset of}} the Great Depression forced Congress to make <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Army's {{personnel}} and budget. Some 53 bases were closed, but MacArthur managed to prevent attempts {{to reduce the number}} of regular officers from 12,000 to 10,000. MacArthur's main programs included the development of new mobilization plans. He grouped the nine corps areas together under four armies, which were charged with responsibility for training and frontier defense. He also negotiated the MacArthur-Pratt agreement with the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral William V. Pratt. This was the first of a series of inter-service agreements over the following decades that defined the responsibilities of the different services with respect to aviation. This agreement placed coastal air defense under the Army. In March 1935, MacArthur activated a centralized air command, General Headquarters Air Force, under Major General Frank M. Andrews.|$|E
5|$|The state {{historic}} site at the Apple River Fort Site {{was set to}} close October 1, 2008 because of <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Illinois Historic Preservation Agency's budget by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Supporters of the {{historic site}} in Elizabeth, led by the Apple River Fort Foundation, appealed in protest to legislators and the governor against the closing, lamenting the economic impact the fort's closing {{will have on the}} community. After delay, the proposal to close seven state parks and a dozen state historic sites, including Apple River Fort, went ahead on November 30, 2008. After the impeachment of Illinois Governor Blagojevich, new governor Pat Quinn reopened the closed state parks in February. In March 2009 Quinn announced he is committed to reopening the state historic sites by June 30, 2009.|$|E

In 1997 the Apple River Fort Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2001 the state of Illinois took over operations of the site and designated it the Apple River Fort State Historic Site. Apple River Fort was one of numerous Illinois historic sites slated to close October 1, 2008 due to <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Illinois budget by Governor Rod Blagojevich.
