5|$|Ramirez {{attended}} George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving {{at the age}} of 19 without graduating. During {{his time}} on the team, GWHS was seeing a large {{increase in the number of}} immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans. As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and was often very modest.|$|E
5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the details}} of Mandarin {{intonation}} are affected by various factors like {{the tone of the}} final syllable, the presence or absence <b>of</b> focus (<b>centering</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention)</b> on the final word, and the dialect of the speaker.|$|R

50|$|The film {{is famous}} partly for {{being one of}} the most {{downloaded}} documentaries to date. Part One was released through an arrangement with The Pirate Bay; the filesharing site marketed Steal This Film in place of its own pirate ship logo. This produced millions of downloads for the film and catapulted it to wide recognition on the Internet after it hit Digg, Slashdot, Reddit and other online <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> among his peers.|$|E
25|$|Toot Braunstein (voiced by Tara Strong): An {{overweight}} alcoholic retro-style {{sex symbol}} from black-and-white 1920s cartoons, reminiscent of Betty Boop. Toot demands {{to be the}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> cuts herself with razor blades, eats excessively when depressed and often instigates conflict in the house.|$|E
25|$|Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay Evans, Ryan's {{twin sister}} and an {{energetic}} and proud {{student with a}} love of theatre. She is very easily pushed around by her brother and is mean, unlike him, but enjoys being the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> particularly Troy's and is admired by Zeke.|$|E
50|$|In 2001-02, the make-up and {{direction}} of the Chicago Bulls changed significantly: by the season’s end, a pair of 18-year-old phenoms and an All-Star caliber player were in the line-up while Elton Brand, once thought to be the franchise’s cornerstone for rebuilding efforts, was not. The result was a renewed sense of optimism and hope surrounding the team’s future with Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Jalen Rose as the <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|R
25|$|Tallahassee was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> world <b>attention</b> for {{six weeks}} during the 2000 United States Presidential {{election}} recount, which involved numerous rulings by the Florida Secretary of State and the Florida Supreme Court.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{and again in}} 2010, the school became the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{national}} <b>attention,</b> when an investigation revealed the sexual abuse of more than 130 pupils by at least 8 teachers in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
25|$|During Pahlavi dynasty Shiraz {{has become}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> again. Many {{important}} landmarks like Tombs of Poets' such as Sa'di and Hafiz, has been constructed and presented to public. Also {{the site of}} well-known Persapolis was re-discovered by {{the order of the}} Shah to be excavated and to be valued.|$|E
25|$|Brooks asked Glazier {{to go to}} Hollywood to work {{on further}} films, but with his {{marriage}} breaking up he demurred, preferring to remain in New York {{to be close to}} his daughter. He continued a savvy business career - for example he invested in the doctor who discovered Viagra - and maintained generous friendships with many, in which he disliked being the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Rigveda is {{far more}} archaic than any other Indo-Aryan text. For this reason, {{it was in the}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> of western {{scholarship}} from the times of Max Müller and Rudolf Roth onwards. The Rigveda records an early stage of Vedic religion. There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the early Iranian Avesta, deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian times, often associated with the early Andronovo culture (or rather, the Sintashta culture within the early Andronovo horizon) of c. 2000 BC.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{declared}} as the Komsomol's high-tempo priority goal {{and was in}} the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> public <b>attention.</b> Eventually, a lot of the workers were awarded state prizes and the plant became a symbol of the industrial development of Siberia.|$|R
50|$|Śajvo (Glow) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} bookstores in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. It is located at the address: Str. Velyka Vasyľkivśka, 6.

She accepted a plea bargain, and received a 30-year sentence.|$|R
25|$|After {{seven years}} of brutal war, both sides in this {{conflict}} were suffering from weariness of the war. Although tentative peace initiatives had been put forward, neither side was yet willing to make meaningful concessions. The capture of Bergen op Zoom would be a signal defeat for the Dutch and would {{open the door for}} an invasion of the Dutch Netherlands. The siege was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in Europe and news of it followed eagerly in numerous reports with the Pragmatic allies confident that the fortress would withstand the French and the French determined it should fall.|$|E
25|$|The Curtain Rises, {{which ran}} from October to December 1933, was Arthur's first Broadway play {{in which she}} was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> With an {{improved}} résumé, she returned to Hollywood in late 1933, and turned down several contract offers until she was asked to meet with an executive from Columbia Pictures. Arthur agreed to star in a film, Whirlpool (1934), and during production she was offered a long-term contract that promised financial stability for both her and her parents. Even though hesitant to give up her stage career, Arthur signed the five-year contract on February 14, 1934.|$|E
25|$|Fashion in {{the period}} 1500–1550 in Western Europe is marked by voluminous {{clothing}} worn in an abundance of layers (one reaction to the cooling temperatures of the Little Ice Age, especially in Northern Europe and the British Isles). Contrasting fabrics, slashes, embroidery, applied trims, {{and other forms of}} surface ornamentation became prominent. The tall, narrow lines of the late Medieval period were replaced with a wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders. Sleeves were a <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> and were puffed, slashed, cuffed, and turned back to reveal contrasting linings.|$|E
50|$|Snack Boy {{was among}} the first webcast-exclusive {{programs}} to gain attention from the mainstream media, and Crummitt was briefly the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> press <b>attention.</b> However, when The Sync closed during the dot-com industry collapse, his visibility waned. Several episodes of the program remain online.|$|R
50|$|On September 1, 2014 Trabzonspor {{has landed}} the former Greek {{international}} Avraam Papadopoulos from Olympiakos. Papadopoulos, however, {{could be the}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> fans' <b>attention,</b> with the veteran midfielder set to become only the second Greek player to play in Turkey’s top-flight, following Theofanis Gekas.|$|R
50|$|Tretyakov {{wanted to}} {{transfer}} the gallery to the city as discreetly as possible, without any noise; he didn’t {{want to be in}} the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> general <b>attention</b> and an object of gratitude. But it was not possible to do it and he was very dissatisfied.|$|R
25|$|Former Maccabi Tel Aviv Manager Avram Grant was {{appointed}} in 2000 {{as manager of}} Maccabi Haifa. Under Grant's guidance, the team regained its dominating offensive style. Grant, along with a much improved squad, led the club with an almost unstoppable team, winning the championship. At the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> were a series of virtuoso performances by Yossi Benayoun, including what some consider to be several of the finest goals in Israeli league history. A spontaneous burst of celebrating fans onto the pitch caused a tragic disaster. A young fan, Amir Rand, was crushed against the guarding rails and left comatose.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} silverback generally {{determines the}} movements of the group, leading it to appropriate feeding sites throughout the year. He also mediates conflicts within the group and protects it from external threats. When the group is attacked by humans, leopards, or other gorillas, the silverback will protect them even at the cost of his own life. He is the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> during rest sessions, and young gorillas frequently stay close to him and include him in their games. If a mother dies or leaves the group, the silverback is usually the one who looks after her abandoned offspring, even allowing them to sleep in his nest. Experienced silverbacks are capable of removing poachers' snares from the hands or feet of their group members.|$|E
25|$|During {{the month}} of July 1882, Ponce was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in Puerto Rico, as an {{important}} Exhibition Trade Fair was being celebrated. The main exhibit pavilion, dedicated to agricultural and industrial exhibits, was commissioned to Maximo Meana, Lieutenant Colonel of the Spanish Militia, and later, Mayor of the city. The Moorish influence is manifested immediately for its basic rectangular plan with towers at its front corners: the active facade ornamentation, its long and narrow windows with fans at its top, its bright colorful paint application, among others, typifies a strong Moorish influence. In 1885, the building was dedicated as Ponce's official firehouse. In 1920, it was used briefly as the Mayor's office {{as a result of}} the earthquake that affected the city during that year.|$|E
25|$|In February 1985, Moskva {{became the}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} <b>attention</b> when {{a herd of}} beluga whales was trapped by ice near the Chukchi Peninsula in the Soviet Far East. The icebreaker broke a channel through the ice pack and managed to lead about 2,000 whales to the open sea.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2013, the {{district}} was the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> worldwide <b>attention,</b> due to riots that spread to several {{other parts of}} Stockholm.

50|$|Silver {{was found}} in Argenta in 1866, a small camp was built and a little town established. Argenta became in a {{shipping}} point for Austin, Nevada, and its residents had the hope that Austin would help make Argenta the railroad <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Lander County.Unhappily, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attentions</b> in Austin was Battle Mountain, Nevada, which was closer {{to the city and}} nearer Galena. People of Argenta understood that the future of the town was bedeviled. In December 1870, they moved everything and themselves to Battle Mountain, and Argenta became a ghost town. There was no activity in Argenta until 1930 when barite was discovered in Argenta Mountain. From 1930 and 1969 over $3 million in barite was produced. The mine was active until 2015, when it was closed by its owner Baker Hughes.|$|R
25|$|This was {{the second}} time trial stage, with long {{straight}} stretches, some beautiful sections of unbending road and some slight inclines (with one located about 600 m to the finish line). It was clear that time-trial specialists would be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> After an impressive performance during the Pyrenees crossing and the capture of the yellow jersey due to Michael Rasmussen's dismissal, Alberto Contador expressed his concerns about being beaten in the final time trial of the competition. Before the riders located above the 20th place started, Belgian Leif Hoste set a time of 1h 05' 32", making him the 1st ranked rider of the stage {{for a long period of}} time. Nonetheless, with the start of the favourites for the stage, he gradually went down through the standings, finishing in 9th position. David Millar, who was expected to be a contender for victory, experienced mechanical trouble, needing to change bikes twice within the first kilometer.|$|E
25|$|LeRon Ellis made local {{headlines}} at {{the start}} of his sophomore year when he became the first African American inducted into the University of Kentucky's Kappa Alpha fraternity. Ellis was also the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> on the court as many of Kentucky's high-profile basketball players were unable to play in the 1988-89 season. Offensive and defensive stars Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett graduated from school; the Wildcats' MVP Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA Draft; sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspended for the entire season from playing basketball and potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp was transferred out of the university {{before the start of the}} season. Kentucky's basketball program was essentially put into the hands of the unexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and even prior to the season many had predicted rough times ahead for the Wildcats' 198889 season.|$|E
25|$|At Bazarov's home, {{they are}} {{received}} enthusiastically by his parents, {{and the traditional}} moeurs of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as he speaks to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke about fighting over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Maryino, stopping {{on the way to}} see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.|$|E
50|$|During the 2015 European migrant crisis Hennala {{was turned}} into an {{immigrant}} reception center. In September, Hennala became the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> international <b>attention</b> after local anti-immigration activists threw stones and fireworks at the asylum seekers and Red Cross workers. One of the demonstrators was wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit.|$|R
50|$|In August 2010, {{family members}} of a murder victim {{launched}} another constitutional amendment initiative to provide for capital punishment in cases of murder combined with sexual violence.
