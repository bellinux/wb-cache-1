40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether the surgical straightening of <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature can improve intromission comfort, penile features, personal relationships and psychogenic erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: Fifty-four patients (mean age 24 years, range 20 - 31 years) whose <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> deviation due to physiological curvature was>or= 25 degrees, as measured on a graph, and who were experiencing penetration discomfort were assessed specifically for the present study. Of these, 14 patients suffered from psychogenic ED. The assessment included a case history, an objective examination, a pharmacologically-induced erection with prostaglandin E 1 10 - 20 g, a graph taken during erection, a basal and dynamic Duplex ultrasonograph, penile length measurement, nocturnal penile tumescence recording, hormonal profiles and a psychological interview to evaluate {{the quality of their}} personal relationships according to Hinde's parameters (contents, number, features, frequency, ability to perceive limits of mutuality, subjective perception of the other person[s], and reliability). All patients underwent the Nesbit procedure. The initial assessment was repeated at 3 and 12 months after surgery. Data analyses were carried out using the z test. RESULTS: Subjective judgement of cosmetic penile features and vaginal intromission comfort improved significantly after surgery whereas the quality of personal relationships and ED did not.

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} a modified plication technique {{and compare the}} results with the Nesbit procedure for treating <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature. Patients and methods Eleven men with <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature were treated by a modified tunica albuginea plication technique. An artificial erection was induced by normal saline injection; in the areas where plication was planned, Buck's fascia was opened longitudinally and dissected a short distance toward the midline to free the neurovascular bundles. Allis clamps were used to grasp the tunica albuginea and 9 ̆ 1 bumps 9 ̆ 2 created. Two interrupted U-shaped sutures using 2 / 0 polyglactin were placed underneath each Allis clamp to secure the bump. The results were analysed retrospectively and compared {{with the results of}} 11 other men treated using the Nesbit procedure. Results The mean (range) follow-up was 25 (12 - 47) months for the Nesbit procedure and 15 (8 - 26) months for the modified plication procedure. In the Nesbit group, eight patients had satisfactory cosmetic and functional results; three complained of penile shortening and one had erectile dysfunction. In the modified plication group, 10 patients reported satisfactory cosmetic and functional results; one complained of penile shortening, two were concerned about the indurations of the penis but none had erectile dysfunction.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} outcome of {{corporeal}} plication using absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures {{for the treatment of}} <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight men older than 15 years old with <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups based on the suture material (Nylon versus Vicryl) used in corporeal plication. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 8. 1 ± 1. 4 months (range, 6 to 9. 1 months). A standardized questionnaire was used to evaluate long-term outcome and patient’s satisfaction. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (17 in Vicryl group and 18 in Nylon group) completed the study. Mean age of the patients and degree of penile curvature were not significantly different between the two groups (P =. 74). Postoperatively, 15 (88. 2 %) and 16 (88. 9 %) patients in Vicryl and Nylon groups had 75 % or greater correction in penile curvature, respectively (P =. 61). Patient’s satisfaction rate differed between two groups (82 % in Vicryl group versus 66 % in Nylon group), which did not reach statistical significance (P =. 44). Palpable sutures were reported by 7 (39 %) patients in Nylon group and only 1 (6 %) in Vicryl group (P =. 04). Shortening of penile length was reported by 3 (16. 7 %) patients in Nylon group and 4 (23. 5 %) in Vicryl group (P =. 69).

METHODS: Between January 1995 and January 2004, 15 potent patients with CPC underwent corporoplasty with inguinal derma graft, with or without tunica albuginea plication. Mean age was 26. 6 years (range 19 - 36). Six patients had a simple lateral left curvature, three had a simple lateral right curvature, four had a ventro-lateral left curvature, one patient had a ventro-lateral right curvature, and one patient had ventral curvature. In nine patients the preoperative mean IIEF- 5 score was 22. 55 (range 21 - 24). All the patients were evaluated after three, six and 12 months. RESULTS: One graft was placed in one patient (6. 6 %), seven (46. 6 %) received one graft and underwent a tunica albuginea plication, four (26. 6 %) received two grafts, three (20 %) received two grafts and underwent tunica albuginea plication. A residual curvature after three, six and 12 months was present respectively in all (100 %), seven (46. 6 %) and one (6. 6 %) patients. No patients had a decrease of penile length. The mean difference in the IIEF- 5 score before and after the surgical procedure was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical correction of CPC with derma grafts in potent patients restores penile straightening with no postoperative shortening and preserves normal erectile capacity. Patient satisfaction indicates that the proposed technique may be used in selected cases...|$|R
40|$|Context: Penile {{curvature}} can be congenital or acquired. Acquired curvature {{is secondary}} due to La Peyronie (Peyronie's) disease. Objective: To provide clinical guidelines on {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of penile curvature. Evidence acquisition: A systematic literature search on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of penile curvature was performed. Articles with the highest evidence available were selected and formed the basis for assigning levels of evidence and grades of recommendations. Evidence synthesis: The pathogenesis of <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature is unknown. Peyronie's disease is a poorly understood connective tissue disorder most commonly attributed to repetitive microvascular injury or trauma during intercourse. Diagnosis is based on medical and sexual histories, which are sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Physical examination includes assessment of palpable nodules and penile length. Curvature is best documented by a self-photograph or pharmacologically induced erection. The only treatment option for <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature is surgery based on plication techniques. Conservative treatment for Peyronie's disease is associated with poor outcomes. Pharmacotherapy includes oral potassium para-aminobenzoate, intralesional treatment with verapamil, clostridial collagenase or interferon, topical verapamil gel, and iontophoresis with verapamil and dexamethasone. They can be efficacious in some patients, but none of these options carry a grade A recommendation. Steroids, vitamin E, and tamoxifen cannot be recommended. Extracorporeal shock wave treatment and penile traction devices may only be used to treat penile pain and reduce penile deformity, respectively. Surgery is indicated when Peyronie's disease is stable for at least 3 mo. Tunical shortening procedures, especially plication techniques, are the first treatment options. Tunical lengthening procedures are preferred in more severe curvatures or in complex deformities. Penile prosthesis implantation is recommended in patients with erectile dysfunction not responding to pharmacotherapy.

The relationships of coping with penile appearance, subject age, severity of hypo-spadias, number of operations, age at final surgery, and type of surgical proce-dure with psychosocial functioning were also investigated. Hypospadias patients did not exhibit a poorer psychosocial functioning and no significant relationships of various medical characteristics with psychosocial functioning could be dis-cerned. Genital/body perception of hypospadias patients ages 9 to 18 years correlated positively with psychosocial functioning, albeit with low values.

40|$|Penile {{angulation}} {{combined with}} penile torsion is an uncommon finding {{in case of}} <b>congenital</b> or acquired <b>penile</b> curvature. We describe our technique for treatment of complex penile curvature by the excision of asymmetric ellipses of tunica albuginea. During the last 4 years, 4 patients with complex penile curvature underwent surgical correction by the excision of asymmetric ellipses of tunica albuginea. 3 patients had Peyronie's disease and 1 had <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> deviation. They {{ranged in age from}} 27 to 63 years. Convalescence was uneventful with good cosmetic correction of the penile torsion and lateral curvature in all patients. 1 patient reported shortening of the penis of about 2 cm, postoperatively. 2 patients reported decreased penile sensation, which resolved after 3 months. Erectile failure did not occur postoperatively in any case. During the last years many Authors have modified the original surgical procedure in an attempt to correct penile deformity. Unfortunately there are very few reports about correction of penile deformities combined with penile torsion. Our modified Nesbit surgical technique for complex deformities differs from the others with regard to the shape of the incision. In this manner, by shortening the longer corporeal body and creating a torque on the penis, it is possible to correct both problems: penile angulation and torsion. The technique is simple, bloodless, safe and reliable. In our experience good cosmetic and functional results have been achieved without complicated surgical interventions...|$|R
40|$|Our aim was {{to review}} the {{literature}} and discuss about penile curvature {{in order to have}} an update for management after 20 years experience in the field. Penile curvature may be congenital or acquired. <b>Congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature is a relatively uncommon condition that may present in late adolescent or early adult life. The incidence is estimated to be 0. 6 %. On the other side, acquired penile curvature has an overall prevalence of 0. 5 - 13 %. Three main factors seem to increase the risk of developing an acquired penile curvature, often related to Peyronie's disease: penile traumatism, genetic and familiar conditions and a history of diseases of the genital tract. In treating Peyronie's disease, no medical therapy is fully effective, and surgery remains the gold standard in cases of severe deformity and/or erectile disfunction. Peyronie's disease is associated with significant psychological stress for patients and their partners. Appropriate treatment should be individualized and tailored to the patient's goals and expectations.

40|$|Circumcision is one {{the most}} {{frequently}} performed operations in males worldwide and {{is an integral part}} of several religions, including Judaism and lslam. Circumcision rates in the UK have reduced over the last few decades from 24 % of males in the 1950 s to an estimated 6 % today. This reduction is largely as a result of better understanding of the physiology of the normal foreskin as well as rationalization of health care provision. The normal foreskin is non-retractable at birth and gradually separates spontaneously such that 90 % of foreskins are retractable by three years of age. Medical indications for circumcision are few. Circumcision is contraindicated in a number of <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> disorders, including hypospadias, epispadias, chordee, buried penis, and micropenis. Various techniques are available for performing circumcision, including non-surgical techniques for use in neonates using devices such as the PlastibellTM, as well as surgical circumcision. Complications of circumcision include haemorrhage, infection, meatal stenosis, removal of incorrect amount of foreskin, penile injury, urethral injury, and painful scarring. However, many of these complications can be prevented using precise surgical techniques, including avoidance of monopolar diathermy and meticulous haemostasis. © 2008...|$|R

40|$|The term 'inconspicuous penis' {{refers to}} a group of {{anatomical}} abnormalities in which the penis looks smaller than is expected. Micropenis can be defined as 'true micropenis' - which results from a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis - and 'micropenis secondary to congenital anatomical anomalies of the surrounding and overlying structures' - also known as 'concealed penis'. The different forms of concealed penis include webbed penis, congenital megaprepuce and partially hidden penis caused by prepubic adiposity. This disorder can also have iatrogenic causes resulting from adhesions that are secondary to circumcision - this type of concealed penis is known as 'trapped penis'.

40|$|Objective: New {{concepts}} in ambiguous genitalia {{have questioned the}} strategy of female gender reassignment in cases of penile agenesis. Hence, we present a video {{of the construction of}} a phallus according to the de Castro technique as an alternative approach for this devastating condition. Methods: A 12 -year-old boy with <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> agenesis and posterior urethra emerging in the distal rectum was selected. An ASTRA approach was used and a phallus was constructed with a skin flap from the abdominal wall, tubularized to produce a phallic appearance. A buccal mucosa graft was tubularized to create the new urethra. Results: Immediate outcome was excellent. Partial dehiscence of the dorsal urethral sutures occurred and the patient started voiding through a scrotal urethrostomy at 9 months postoperatively. Phalloplasty provided an adequate male appearance with a good cosmetic aspect. Conclusion: the technique is a feasible alternative. A procedure in 2 stages by first creating the neourethra at a later date might be an interesting option to try to avoid the urethral complications observed. Long-term follow-up is however necessary to confirm the initial results. (c) 2012 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Objective: To assess patient {{satisfaction}} and functional results at long term follow-up after surgical correction for Peyronie’s disease (PD) and <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature (CPC) with {{the technique of}} tunical plication. Materials and Methods: One hundred and two men operated for PD (n = 76) or CPC (n = 26) in four different departments of urology in public hospitals agreed to answer a six-question telephone questionnaire about treatment satisfaction. Tunica albuginea plication procedures represented the standard surgical approach. Subjects under investigation were correction of the deformity, feeling of bumps under the skin, pain during erection, penile sensory changes, development of erectile dysfunction (ED) and postoperative ability for complete vaginal intromission. Subjective response rates were compared using the chi square test {{on the basis of}} the etiology of the disease (CPC or PD). Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 05) between patients with CPC and PD were noticed in the prevalence of postoperative penile deformity, sensory changes, ED and ability to complete vaginal intromission, PD patients always showing a more pessimistic view. No significant differences (p = ns) were detected in terms of unpleasant nodes under the penile skin or pain during erection. Conclusions: Long-term outcome after surgical correction for PD and CPC with the technique of tunical plication can be poor. Probably patient expectations are above the real performance of surgical techniques. Preoperative information should be more exhaustive.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze post pubertal results of pre pubertal tunica albuginea {{plication}} with non-absorbable sutures in the correction of CPC. Materials and Methods: The files of patients who underwent tunica albuginea plication without incision (dorsal/lateral) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients younger than 13 years of age at the time of operation and older than 14 years of age in November 2015 were included. Patients with a penile curvature of less than 30 degrees & more than 45 degrees and penile/urethral anomalies were excluded. All of the patients underwent surgery followed by circumcision. Results: The mean age of patients at the time of the operation was 9. 7 years (range, 6 - 13 years). The mean degree of ventral penile curvature measured during the operation was 39 degrees while it was 41 degrees in the lateral curvatures. All of the patients were curvature-free at the end of the operation. At the time of the follow-up examination, the mean age was 16. 7 years (range, 14 - 25 years). Six patients had a straight (0 - 10 degrees) penis during erection and seven patients had recurrent penile curvatures ranging from 30 to 50 degrees. Conclusion: Pre pubertal tunica albuginea plication of <b>congenital</b> <b>penile</b> curvature (30 - 45 degrees) with non-absorbable sutures performed without incision is a minimal invasive method especially when performed during circumcision. However, recurrence might be observed in half of the patients after puberty...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{repair of}} {{complications}} {{in patients who}} had undergone hypospadias repair is still an open problem. Patients and Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for late complications after hypospadias repair. Study inclusion criteria were patients presenting urethral, corpora cavernosa deformity, and/or <b>penile</b> <b>defects</b> due to previous hypospadias repair. Exclusion criteria were precancerous or malignant lesions and incomplete data on personal medical charts. Preoperative evaluation included clinical history, physical examination, urine culture, residual urine measurement, uroflowmetry, urethrography, urethral sonography, and urethroscopy. The patients were classified into four different groups. Success {{was defined as a}} normal functional urethra, with apical meatus, no residual penile curvature or esthetic deformity of the genitalia. Results. A total of 1, 176 patients were entered in our survey. Out of the 1, 176 patients, 301 patients (25. 5 %) underwent urethroplasty (group 1), 60 (5. 2 %) corporoplasty (group 2), 166 (14. 1 %) urethroplasty and corporoplasty (group 3), and 649 (55. 2 %) complex genitalia resurfacing (group 4). Mean followup was 60. 4 months. Out of the 1, 176 cases, 1, 036 (88. 1 %) were considered successful and 140 (11. 9 %) failures. Conclusion. The majority of patients (55. 2 %) with failed hypospadias repair require surgical reconstruction to fully resurfacing the glans and penile shaft...|$|R
