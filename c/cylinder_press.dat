25|$|The presses {{first used}} {{were of the}} {{ordinary}} letterpress type, the engraved plate being fixed {{in the place of}} the type. In later improvements the well-known <b>cylinder</b> <b>press</b> was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a sharp blade of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid on the plate, was passed round the pressure cylinder. The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.|$|E

A rotating <b>cylinder</b> <b>presses</b> a rubber sleeve against another, heated, rotating cylinder.

The cloth to be treated is transported between rubber sleeve and heated cylinder and is forced to follow this brief compression and lateral expansion, and relaxation. It is thus shrunk.|$|R
2500|$|In {{about one}} year, Cox {{replaced}} {{all of his}} printing equipment, and began using a <b>cylinder</b> <b>press,</b> which was a more modern piece of equipment. After {{a total of three}} years of printing, he upgraded to a press powered by a steam engine, and added other equipment that was the latest in newspaper technology. His newspaper equipment was far more advanced than that typical of a city of Hartford City's size. [...] The advanced equipment enabled him to also operate a printing business. By 1894, the Telegram had about 1,200 subscribers. [...] Hartford City's population ranged from 2,287 in 1890 to 5,912 in 1900, so 1,200 subscribers can be considered very successful. [...] An advertisement in an 1895 Hartford City directory said the Telegram was Democratic and the leading newspaper of Blackford County. The paper was issued every Wednesday.|$|E

5000|$|Before its invention, most inking of {{printing}} presses {{was done by}} manually pounding the type with ink balls, specially treated leather balls stuffed with wool. The difficulty and time involved in making and using ink balls led to various attempts to use cylinders, which could be rolled rather than pounded. Leather rollers (or [...] "skin rollers") were attempted, and were used on the earliest steam-powered <b>cylinder</b> <b>presses,</b> yet these did not {{work as well as}} the ink balls, and the stitching seam would appear on the printed type.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of its existence, The Land of Sunshine was printed and bound by Kingsley-Barnes and Neuner Company in the Stimson Building while its photoengraving needs were handled {{by a variety of}} local companies. In 1898, the magazine began in-house publication in a building on South Broadway that combined editorial and printing functions, which by late 1901 boasted six job <b>presses</b> and four <b>cylinder</b> <b>presses,</b> one of which was an Optimus cylinder used principally for printing illustrated pages. In April 1904, the printing of the magazine was once again physically separated from its editorial offices, and this arrangement persisted until Lummis departed in 1909.|$|R

Shortly after the brothers' printing business ceased and their Diamond Street storefront became a bookstore, a third King brother, Arthur, set up his own printing venture in the city: Arthur King and Co. [...] "Statements concerning the machinery held by King & Co. in the 1860s and later are somewhat inconsistent, but it appears that from the middle of that decade, it owned a large, double-quad platen, and two (later, three) Wharfedale machines (<b>cylinder</b> <b>presses)</b> of varying sizes." ...|$|R

50|$|When William M. Kelly (1869-1949), an {{employee}} in the sales department, proposed a design of automatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>press,</b> Nelson immediately authorized the project. The Kelly Style B Press, a three-roller, two-revolution, flat-bed <b>cylinder</b> <b>press</b> with automatic feeder and jogger {{was introduced in}} 1914 to great success. By 1923 more than 2,500 Kelly Presses had been sold {{and the next year}} production was shifted from Jersey City to a large new factory in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Several models were developed and, by 1949, more than 11,000 Kelly presses had been sold.|$|E

40|$|Contact between curved rough bodies is an {{important}} engineering problem. The paper addresses the problem in its simplest form where a smooth rigid <b>cylinder</b> <b>presses</b> down an elastic half space bounded by a plane of uniformly spaced cylindrical asperities. Keeping the separation between the bodies unchanged the problem is inverted and solved using the method of complex variables. As the asperities deform as well as move as rigid bodies, contact lengths and positions develop non-symmetrically {{with respect to the}} initial axes of symmetry of the asperities. The resulting local contact pressures are non-Hertzian and the normal load for a given contact area is greater than that estimated using a priori Hertzian pressure profiles...|$|R

This allowed the {{purchase}} of a new Linotype machine, and further upgrades were promised when on November 8, 1929, the News-Miner was purchased by Austin E. Lathrop, an Alaska industrialist. [...] Though Lathrop promised to inject money into the News-Miner, his strong Republican leanings opposed those of Nordale, a confirmed Democrat. Nordale resigned in April 1930 and was replaced by Bernard Stone. Stone and Lathrop turned the News-Miner profitable before Stone was replaced by Charles R. Settlemier in 1936. In 1935, the News-Miner purchased two <b>cylinder</b> <b>presses</b> to replace the old flatbed press still in use. Owing to shipping difficulties, however, the presses and the new crew needed to operate them did not arrive until 1936. By that time, the News-Miner was preparing to move into the new Lathrop Building, built by and named after the newspaper's owner.|$|R
