5000|$|Chemical {{enrichment}} in galaxies: When new hot {{massive stars}} are born they radiate very energetic photons that ionize the remnant parent gaseous nebula {{that has not}} formed stars; this <b>craddle</b> of new stars and ionized gas is known as an HII region. HII regions are very important because they are very luminous, {{so they can be}} used to study the star formation in far away galaxies. Also, their emission line spectrum can be used to computed the chemical abundances of the different atomic elements, thus tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies in their most recent epochs. We have developed new tools to detect and extract the spectroscopic information from HII regions (Sánchez et al., 2012b), building the largest catalog currently available (~10.000 HII regions and aggregations). This catalog has been used to define a new oxygen abundance (the abundance of oxygen is used as a reference in HII regions) calibrator anchored with electron temperature measurements (Marino et al., 2013). From these, we explored the proposed dependence of the Mass-Metallicity relation with the star formation rate (SFR; Sánchez et al., 2013), and the local Mass-Metallicity relation (Rosales-Ortega et al. 2012). We found that all galaxies in our sample present an abundance radial gradient with a common slope (when normalized to the effective radius; Sánchez et al., 2014); this agrees with the proposed inside-out scenario for galaxy growth. This characteristic slope is independent of the properties of the galaxies, and in particular of {{the presence or absence of}} dynamical structures such as stellar bars. This result has been confirmed by the analysis of the stellar abundance gradient in the same sample (Sánchez-Blázquez et al., 2014).|$|E

Palm Navigator is fully compliant with the ISO Topic Maps standard (ISO/IEC 13250) which enables exchanges between Web sites. Due to the lack of power, both in terms of memory and processing capacities, topic maps cannot be manipulated (parsing, navigating, querying) directly on the PDA. Moreover, the only way to stock data on a Palm Pilot is by using Palm Pilot Database files (PDB), which are archaical indexed files of fixed-length strings. In Palm Navigator, we propose an efficient, yet complex architecture based on a data structure issued from graph theory. A prototype in Java has been available since March 2001 and a C version is planned for March 2002. Palm Navigator is separated into two components.

40|$|Andrzej Bobkowski – Against Tradition Andrzej Bobkowski (born October 27, 1913 in Wiener Neustadt, died June 26, 1961 in Guatemala) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} emigre Polish writers. His most outstanding books are Szkice Piórkiem: Francja 1940 - 1944 (Paris, 1957) and Coco de orо, a volume of short stories and essays, published in Paris by Instytut Literacki (Institut littéraire) in 1970. Andrzej Bobkowski, who left Poland in March 1939 and France — and Europe — in 1948, was a precursor of another well known Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz. In one of his letters to Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz he wrote that Europe was for him «the <b>craddle</b> of culture and concentration camps». Не rejected in his books ail claims of the European totalitarian and nationalistic philosophies. His work was strongly influenced by Joseph Conrad. Не created the concept of a «Cosmo-Pole», a citizen of the world, liberated from the provincial Polishness. Не had a deep sense of the French rationalism. A large part of his writing remains still scattered in such periodicals as Kultura (Paris), Wiadomości (London) and in Poland in Nowiny Literackie, Dziś i Jutro and Twórczość.

A presente pesquisa trabalha com um número expressivo de desenhos produzidos durante esse longo período, no qual se destacam obras da caricatura de costumes como Quando a morena passa, O democrático bonde, Dois desejos, da série Flagrantes Cariocas, entre outras. O trabalho objetiva ainda o estudo das inovações que Seth trouxe para a publicidade com os cartazes da série Casa Mathias.

40|$|Probably one of {{the most}} often {{observed}} but least known institutions on the Great Plains is custom harvesting. Although the practice probably dates from the Hrst itinerate laborer who bought a grain <b>craddle,</b> Thomas Isern 2 ̆ 7 s book is about the men who traveled from Texas to Canada seeking employment for their expensive combining machines. For the most part, Isern 2 ̆ 7 s custom harvesters entered the business during World War II and survived the long period of low prices and high costs that characterized American agriculture in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Custom harvesting reached maturity during world War II, when farmers received high prices for their grain but were not able to acquire the machinery to harvest it. Small-grain harvesting is such a timely operation that farmers probably would have turned to custom workers {{even in the absence of}} wartime shortages of equipment and labor. Private industry and the federal government joined to make custom harvesting a Great Plains institution. Through the Federal Extension Service and state employment agencies, custom harvesters were directed toward those areas where they were most needed. In 1944, with the blessings of the American and Canadian governments, MasseyFerguson secured materials to produce extra combines and organized a series of 2 ̆ 2 harvest brigades 2 ̆ 2 to ensure that wheat and other small grains were secured for the war effort. Isern notes that, with the end of the war, agencies designed to aid farmers did not continue to serve the needs of custom harvesters. Indeed, state license requirements tended to inhibit the movement of custom harvesters across state lines. But the farmers 2 ̆ 7 dependence on custom harvesting during the war years undoubtedly conditioned them to rely on such services after the war was over. Certainly, custom harvesters were well established by the postwar period, cutting as much as 50 percent of the crop in some states. Most of the custom harvesters in Isern 2 ̆ 7 s study were farmers from the central and southern plains who moved south during the early harvest, returned home to cut their own grain, and then continued north to harvest in the spring wheat belt. Advances in combine design, particularly the development of the selfpropelled combine, were often stimulated by the experience of the custom harvesters. By the 1960 s combines became such a major investment that most purchasers had to fmd work for their machines beyond their own needs. At the same time many farmers simply could not afford the investment. In an otherwise thorough and well-written study, Isern leaves some questions unanswered. He never quite explains why some custom harvesters survived through lean years while others abandoned the business. His allusion to a certain 2 ̆ 2 romantic 2 ̆ 2 character of the custom harvesters is inadequate. He notes that 2 ̆ 2 amateurs 2 ̆ 2 came and went in the business but seems to distinguish amateurs from professionals only by their longevity. Isern points out that his subjects are primarily southern-based farmers. What comparisons could be made with custom harvesters from northern states? For example, a quick review of custom harvesters from Montana suggests that most do not engage in farming for themselves. Is that a general regional characteristic? Aside from these minor criticisms, Isern 2 ̆ 7 s study is a welcome addition to the literature of plains farming...|$|E
