50|$|Brillanceausuchus is an extinct genus of atoposaurid crocodylomorph. Fossils {{have been}} found in Early Cretaceous-age rocks of Cameroon. The genus is notable for the {{position}} of the secondary <b>choana</b> within its palate. Parts of the pterygoid bones make up the rostral margin of the <b>choana</b> and thus separate it from the palatines, a feature also seen in the more advanced neosuchian suborder Eusuchia. This characteristic was once thought to be characteristic of Eusuchia, but its presence in Brillanceausuchus suggests that the trait is homoplasic, thus making the evolution of the position of the <b>choana</b> within crocodilians more complex than previously thought.|$|E

25|$|A nasobuccal {{membrane}} {{separates the}} mouth from the nose; respectively, the inferior oral cavity (the mouth) and the superior nasal cavity (the nose). As the olfactory pits deepen, said development forms the <b>choanae,</b> the two openings that connect {{the nasal cavity}} and the nasopharynx (upper part of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). Initially, primitive-form <b>choanae</b> develop, which then further develop into the secondary, permanent <b>choanae.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>choanae</b> are {{separated}} {{into two parts}} by the vomer.|$|R
50|$|The levator veli palatini (Levator palati) is a thick, rounded muscle {{situated}} lateral to the <b>choanæ.</b>|$|R
50|$|Looking at the palate, {{it has a}} pronounced, sagittally {{elongated}} vault that {{is formed}} primarily by the vomers. The vomers contact the premaxillae at a level with the maxillary tooth margin towards {{the tip of the}} rostrum. However, it does curve strongly dorsally towards the palatines, and so we see the choanae very far above the tooth margin. To withdraw the <b>choana</b> further from the oral cavity, the vomerine and palatine borders of the <b>choana</b> are recessed dorsally.|$|E
50|$|Anarsia <b>choana</b> is a moth of the Gelechiidae family. It was {{described}} by Park in 1995. It is found in Taiwan and Japan (Ryukyus).|$|E
5000|$|Maxilla forms a large, {{completely}} dentigerous shelf bearing 83 to 107 teeth. The first {{teeth are}} large, and tooth size decreases markedly further posteriorly. On the ventral side, the maxilla contacts the ectopterygoid, palatine and vomer. In the choanal region, the maxilla is slightly broadening medially on the palatal side where it borders the <b>choana.</b> The {{margin of the}} <b>choana</b> is variable. In most skulls, it is weakly distinguished and rounded, but {{in a few cases}} it is more solid and sharply outlined.|$|E

50|$|Glanosuchus is the {{earliest}} known therapsid to possess maxilloturbinates, but it shares features with reptiles that suggest it was not fully endothermic. <b>Choanae,</b> two holes in the palate that connect the nasal cavity to the mouth, are positioned far forward in reptiles, early synapsids, and Glanosuchus. This shortens the nasal cavity, thereby reducing the ability to humidify incoming air. The <b>choanae</b> migrated farther back in the palate later in therocephalian evolution, suggesting that advanced forms like Bauria had high metabolic rates {{similar to those of}} mammals. As the <b>choanae</b> moved farther back, a secondary palate expanded in front of it. This expansion occurred in both therocephalians and the related cynodonts, indicating that the two groups were convergently acquiring mammalian characteristics in the Permian and Triassic. Although therocephalians died out by the Middle Triassic, cynodonts continued to diversify, giving rise to fully endothermic mammals in the Late Triassic.|$|R
5000|$|The lateral {{surface of}} this plate forms {{part of the}} pterygoid fossa, the medial surface {{constitutes}} the lateral boundary of the <b>choana</b> or posterior aperture of the corresponding nasal cavity.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{characters}} defining tetrapodomorphs are {{modifications to the}} fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or <b>choana.</b> Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one {{on either side of}} the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). Early tetrapodomorphs such as Kenichthys had excurrent nostrils that had migrated to the edge of the mouth. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the <b>choana.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{description}} of Kenichthys’ nasal passages, exactly how the transition between these two forms had taken place {{was a source of}} debate. Various suggestions had been put forward including that the <b>choana</b> was homologous to either the posterior or anterior nostril of non-tetrapods, that it had ‘budded off’ from one of these passages, or that it was an entirely novel form, unrelated to either of the other nostrils. The debate was further {{complicated by the fact that}} lungfishes, another group of sarcopterygian fish, also possess a <b>choana</b> with a different form to that of tetrapodomorphs.|$|E
50|$|Jarvik {{also claimed}} the {{existence}} of <b>choanae</b> in porolepiformes which linked them to tetrapods, but this has remained controversial. Recent phylogenetic reconstruction places porolepiformes close to lungfishes.|$|R
50|$|Through its copious mucus production, the sinus is an {{essential}} part of the immune defense/air filtration carried out by the nose. Nasal and sinal mucosae are ciliated and move mucus to the <b>choanae</b> and finally to the stomach. The thick upper layers of nasal mucus trap bacteria and small particles in tissue abundantly provided with immune cells, antibodies, and antibacterial proteins. The layers beneath are thinner and provide a substrate in which the cilia are able to beat and move the upper layer with its debris through the ostia toward the <b>choanae.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 19 th Century, the <b>choanae</b> (or {{internal}} nares) of the Plesiosauria {{were identified as}} a pair of palatal openings located rostral to the external nares, implying a rostrally directed respiratory duct and air path inside the rostrum. Despite obvious functional shortcomings, this idea was firmly established in the scientific literature by {{the first decade of the}} 20 th Century. The functional consequences of this morphology were only re-examined by the end of the 20 th Century, leading to the conclusion that the <b>choanae</b> were not involved in respiration but instead in underwater olfaction, the animals supposedly breathing with the mouth agape. Re-evaluation of the palatal and internal cranial anatomy of the Plesiosauria reveals that the traditional identification of the <b>choanae</b> {{as a pair of}} fenestrae situated rostral to the external nares appears erroneous. These openings more likely represent the bony apertures of ducts that lead to internal salt glands situated inside the maxillary rostrum. The 2 ̆ 7 real 2 ̆ 7 functional <b>choanae</b> (or caudal interpterygoid vacuities), are situated at the caudal end of the bony palate between the sub-temporal fossae, as was suggested in the mid- 19 th Century. The existence of a functional secondary palate in the Plesiosauria is therefore strongly supported, and the anatomical, physiological, and evolutionary implications of such a structure are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Choanal atresia is a {{congenital}} disorder {{where the}} back of the nasal passage (<b>choana)</b> is blocked, usually by abnormal bony or soft tissue (membranous) due to failed recanalization of the nasal fossae during fetal development.|$|E
50|$|Each sinus opens {{into the}} roof of the nasal cavity via {{apertures}} on the posterior wall of the sphenoethmoidal recess directly above the <b>choana.</b> The apertures are located high on the anterior walls of the sinuses themselves.|$|E
5000|$|In {{animals with}} {{secondary}} palates, they allow breathing when the mouth is closed. They are {{also known as}} the choanae (singular <b>choana)</b> (from Greek χοάνη [...] "funnel"). In tetrapods without secondary palates their function relates primarily to olfaction (sense of smell).|$|E
50|$|In all but {{the most}} basal (primitive) tetrapodomorphs, the excurrent {{nostrils}} have migrated {{from the edge of the}} mouth to the interior of the mouth. In tetrapods that lack a secondary palate (basal tetrapods and amphibians), the <b>choanae</b> are located forward in the roof of the mouth, just inside the upper jaw. These internal nasal passages evolved while the vertebrates still lived in water. In animals with complete secondary palates (mammals, crocodilians, most skinks) the space between the primary and secondary palates contain the nasal passages, with the <b>choanae</b> located above the posterior end of the secondary palate.|$|R
50|$|In bony fish, the vomers are flattened, paired, bones {{forming the}} {{anterior}} {{part of the}} roof of the mouth, just behind the premaxillary bones. In many species, they have teeth, supplementing those in the jaw proper; in some extinct species the teeth on the vomers were actually larger than the primary set. In amphibians and reptiles, the vomers become narrower, due to the presence of the enlarged <b>choanae</b> (the inner part of the nostrils) on either side, and they may extend further back in the jaw. They are typically small in birds, where they form the upper hind part of the beak, again being located between the <b>choanae.</b>|$|R
40|$|Some {{features}} of the skull of Baurusuchus salgadoensis Carvalho, Campos & Nobre 2005, a baurusuchid Mesoeucrocodylia from the Adamantina Formation of Bauru Basin, are described, discussed and reinterpreted. The punctures and perforations of the skull of B. salgadoensis, one of them previously described as the antobital fenestrae, were interpreted as tooth-marks. The probable producer is a medium or large ziphodont terrestrial archosaur, possibly a baurusuchid or Abelisauridae. The <b>choanae</b> of B. salgadoensis bears some similarities with Stratiotosuchus. The <b>choanae</b> and the palatal surfaces seem to be similar among baurusuchids, notosuchids and sphagesaurids with minor differences. This similarity is congruent with recent phylogenetic hypotheses, supporting a closer relationship among these Creataceous Mesoeucrodylia taxa...|$|R
50|$|Palate is {{flat and}} an {{elongated}} <b>choana</b> that nearly reaches {{the level of}} the anterior limit of the interpterygoid vacuities. The lateral margin of the <b>choana</b> is not exposed, the opening lacks the anterior expansion and a round shape. Anterior palatal fossil occurs on the vomers as modest concavities separated by a thin longitudinal septum. The conjoined palatines and pterygoids are broad and have a long, comparatively narrow interpterygoid vacuity. The posterior processes of the pterygoids are curved inward to join the quadrate. The posterior pterygoid process extends upward in a thin plate, including a large infra-temporal vacuity. The length of each interpterygoid vacuity is approximately three times greater than its width, or equal to {{about a third of the}} skull length. The interpterygoid vacuities set back in posterior half of skull. The vacuities widen and become broadly rounded near {{the level of the}} basal process. Small ossicles filling the interpterygoid vacuity indicate there was a plate of denticles in the vacuities. (cite Montanari). The vomerin tusks are larger and placed in a more lateral position. At the posterolateral margin of the <b>choana,</b> a second palatal tusk is present on the palatine and is accompanied by a replacement pit; the basal diameter of this tusk is slightly greater than that of the largest maxillary tooth.|$|E
50|$|Through {{convergent}} evolution, lungfishes {{have evolved}} internal nostrils {{similar to the}} tetrapods' <b>choana,</b> and a brain with certain similarities to the lissamphibian brain (except for the Queensland lungfish, which branched off in its own direction about 277 million {{years ago and has}} a brain resembling that of the Latimeria).|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} {{state of}} the nostrils of Kenichthys demonstrates that the vertebrate <b>choana</b> did in fact evolve by migration of the posterior external nostril around the jaw and up onto {{the roof of the}} mouth. Kenichthys suggests that this migration took place on the route between the premaxilla and the maxilla.|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is long. At the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the <b>choanae.</b> In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the <b>choanae</b> are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very concave in both species.|$|R
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called <b>choanae,</b> allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod <b>choanae</b> that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|R
50|$|Chanaresuchus has a low, {{elongate}} skull that {{is characteristic}} of proterochampsians. The skull is quite broad posteriorly with a narrow snout, varying in length from around 165mm to 260mm in the largest individuals. The nares are slit-like and positioned away {{from the tip of}} the rostrum, farther up the skull. The premaxilla is slightly down-curved. The skull table is highly ornamented in larger specimens, with the dermal bones well sculptured. The palate of Chanaresuchus has two elongate <b>choanae.</b> Two small openings anterior to the <b>choanae</b> may be anterior palatine foramina that could have been used for access to vomeronasal organs. The secondary palate formed between these two sets of openings may have been an adaptation for breathing through the snout while underwater.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{intermediate}} in the fish-tetrapod evolution, Panderichthys {{had the capacity}} to breathe air. The trend from the early sarcopterygians to the first tetrapods was an increase {{in the size of the}} spiracular chamber and its opening to the outside. Compared to Eusthenopteron, the spiracular chamber of Panderichthys is greatly expanded and the hyomandibula is shorter compared to those in fish. The opercular series was also shorter compared to other osteolepiforms. Panderichthys also has a single external nasal opening and a palatal <b>choana.</b> In contrast to earlier osteolepiforms, the palatal <b>choana</b> is elongated and the nariochoanal lamina is narrow. Along with the spiracular chamber, this feature in Panderichthys can be considered transitional during the evolution from fish to tetrapods. Sarcopterygians such as Panderichthys can be considered at least facultative air breathers and demonstrate {{an intermediate}} form as air breathing was becoming more abundant.|$|E
50|$|In {{the palate}} {{region of the}} skull, the {{anterior}} process of the vomer ventrally overlies the premaxilla at the anterior margin of the <b>choana.</b> This overlap is also seen in dinocephalians. However, unlike any other therapsid, the choanae are short and extend only from {{the level of the}} fourth incisor back to the first canine.|$|E
50|$|Foley's {{catheter}} of size 12-14F {{can also}} be used to prevent posterior epistaxis. After insertion balloon is inflated with 5-10 ml of saline.The bulb is inflated with saline and pulled forward so that <b>choana</b> is blocked and then an anterior nasal balloons are also available. A nasal balloons has 2 bulbs,one for post nasal space and the other for nasal cavity.|$|E
50|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is long.

50|$|Less common {{features}} of TCS may add to an affected person's breathing problems, including sleep apnea. Choanal atresia or stenosis is a narrowing {{or absence of}} the <b>choanae,</b> the internal opening of the nasal passages. Pharyngeal hypoplasia, underdevelopment of the pharynx, can also narrow the airway.|$|R
