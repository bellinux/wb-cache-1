5|$|Because of {{its heavy}} use and {{practice}} by magicians, {{sleight of hand}} is often <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> a branch of magic, but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment, as many artists practice sleight of hand without the slightest interest in magic.|$|E
5|$|Periyar was {{a radical}} {{advocate}} of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> being anti-Brahmin. Brahmanism is accepting social inequality based on birth. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste {{was seen as}} a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.|$|E
5|$|That night, Hermie roasts marshmallows with Aggie while Oscy {{succeeds in}} {{having sex with}} Miriam between the dunes. He is so {{successful}} he sneaks over to Hermie and Aggie to ask for more condoms. <b>Confused</b> <b>as</b> to what's happening, Aggie follows Oscy back, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home, upset.|$|E

5|$|An Australian version {{titled the}} Adult Swim Meat Tray Collection was {{released}} on November 28, 2012; a Region 2 version of Adult Swim in a Box had been released a year earlier. Critical reception for Adult Swim in a Box was mixed, with some reviewers <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> to the selection of content or recommending fans who have already purchased the shows on the set passing it on.|$|E
5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) {{that it should not}} be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical {{congress}} rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E

5|$|On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator Frank Greene {{introduced}} legislation for commemorative coins {{to mark the}} 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of the American victory at the Battle of Bennington the same year. His bill passed the Senate without difficulty, but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins—after this one—did not impress the full House, which added two more half dollars to the legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the many {{casualties}} inflicted on the 352nd and 716th Infantry divisions, the 7th Army quickly established plans for counter-attacks. Early orders to move towards the invasion beaches were <b>confused,</b> <b>as</b> the divisions necessary for counter-attacks fell under a different jurisdiction than those defending the coast. The panzer divisions, such as the Panzer Lehr, 12th SS Panzer and 2nd SS Panzer, could not be mobilized for the coast without authorization by Hitler. The order to mobilize Panzer Lehr and the 12th SS was finally given in the mid-afternoon of 6 June. When the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers began to advance on 7 June, they were met by dug in troops of the 716th Infantry and 21st Panzer divisions. At 17:00, the advancing force was counter-attacked by the 12th SS, {{under the command of}} Kurt Meyer. The 9th Brigade was forced to withdraw to its D-Day positions, having suffered more casualties than any unit on Juno the previous day. The 7th Brigade reached its final D-Day objectives along Line Oak, while the 8th Brigade attempted to destroy German radar stations to their east, which took until 11 June.|$|E
5|$|Victor and Nikki finally remarry in March 2013 {{just before}} she is {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis. At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming {{to take back the}} company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up overdosing on. Jack reported Victor to the FDA and he and his company were put under investigation. Dylan's supposed father and Nikki's former lover Ian Ward (Ray Wise) then arrives in town and causes pandemonium, to which Victor tries {{to get him out of}} town. It was later revealed that Victor had hired a lookalike to his granddaughter Cassie, named Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to haunt Sharon and learn a supposed secret she has. When his scheme is revealed, Nick and Sharon shun him and Nikki decides to move out for a while, but she and Victor later reunite. Victor and Nikki later learn that Ian is incapable of fathering children, leading to confusion. It is later revealed that Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Nikki's ex-lover and longtime friend, is in fact Dylan's father, causing tension in Victor and Nikki's marriage, which continues when Victor goes to extensive lengths to awaken Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) from a coma in order to find out more information on Sharon's supposed secret. Nikki falls off the wagon and begins drinking again; she leaves Victor and refuses to take him back. Victor also sells Chancellor Industries back to Jill (Jess Walton), leaving the rest of the Newman family <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> to why he gave Chancellor up so easily.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate senior {{officers}} were <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> {{to whether the}} Red River; Mobile, Alabama; or coastal Texas was the primary Union target for the spring 1864 campaign. The commander of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, General Edmund Kirby Smith, nevertheless started moving many of his men to the Shreveport area.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{these many}} rulings, the Supreme Court had never {{extended}} its agency fee rulings to unions {{covered by the}} National Labor Relations Act and many lower courts were <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> {{to the state of}} the law. In 1986, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against non-union workers in a case very similar to Beck involving the United Auto Workers.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to the}} {{possibility}} of the user being <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> to which null they were located on, as there are two, located 180 degrees apart (either side of the antenna). In practice this is a relatively minor concern, as traditional navigation methods are normally able to resolve this discrepancy – only one of the angles makes sense at a given time.|$|E

Further, it indicated that landing on the closed 23L required only that the crew continue the flight path they were already on (which was a straight-in ILS approach to 23L).|$|E
25|$|Ectopic fat is {{the storage}} of {{triglycerides}} in tissues other than adipose tissue, {{that are supposed to}} contain only small amounts of fat, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas. This can interfere with cellular functions and hence organ function and is associated with insulin resistance in type-2 diabetes. It is stored in relatively high amounts around the organs of the abdominal cavity, but is not to be <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> visceral fat.|$|E
25|$|The Second Complex is a villa otium {{located on}} the edge of the Varano hill between the Villa del Pastore and Villa Arianna and {{separated}} by a narrow alley from the latter. The site was explored for the first time in 1762 by Karl Weber, in 1775 by Peter la Vega and finally in 1967 by Libero D'Orsi: only about 1000 sq. m has been brought to light and access is via Villa Arianna, which because of its proximity is often <b>confused</b> <b>as</b> the same villa.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} is very <b>confusing,</b> <b>as</b> there are many variations of eye placement, pustulation, and spine length. Ceraurus may, in fact, be at least four genera: true Ceraurus, Gabriceraurus, Bufoceraurus and Leviceraurus.|$|R
