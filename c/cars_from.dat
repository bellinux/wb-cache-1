5|$|The {{rear wheel}} pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} <b>cars</b> <b>from</b> becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition the pods were often ripped from <b>cars</b> <b>from</b> light contact, placing hazardous debris on the track. As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak ordered 150 more Amfleet <b>cars</b> <b>from</b> Budd on March 13, 1980, {{at a cost}} of $150 million.

Budd delivered the first four cars on October 28, 1981; the unveiling took place on November 11. The final cars arrived on June 11, 1983. The Amfleet IIs were the last intercity cars Budd built. The continuing unreliability of the Budd Metroliner led to refurbished Amfleet I coaches displacing them in Metroliner service in 1981. New EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives pulled the trains.|$|E
