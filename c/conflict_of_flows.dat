Various traffic phenomena near ramps can be described by the Cell Transmission Model (CTM). However, real traffic data shows that traffic flow characteristics are far different for the ramp system with different ramp distances. We analyze traffic characteristics of ramp system with both an on-ramp and an off-ramp in Beijing 3 rd ring road firstly. Then, {{it is found that}} ramp distance between the on- ramp and the off-ramp has a great impact on the capacity, due to the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> traffic <b>flow</b> between on-ramp and off-ramp. Finally the traffic conflict is considered in the merge cell and Capacity Drop CTM (CD-CTM) is proposed to embody the conflict.

40|$|For {{qualitative}} {{modeling and}} analysis, a general qualitative abstraction of power transmission variables (flow and effort) for elements <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> paths includes information on resistance, net <b>flow,</b> permissible directions <b>of</b> <b>flow,</b> and qualitative potential is discussed. Each type of component model has flow-related variables and an associated internal flow map, connected into an overall <b>flow</b> network <b>of</b> the system. For storage devices, the implicit power {{transfer to the}} environment is represented by "virtual" circuits that include an environmental junction. A heterogeneous aggregation method simplifies the path structure. A method determines global flow-path changes during dynamic simulation and analysis, and identifies corresponding local flow state changes that are effects of global configuration changes. Flow-path determination is triggered by any change in a flow-related device variable in a simulation or analysis. Components (path elements) that may be affected are identified, and flow-related attributes favoring flow in the two possible directions are collected for each of them. Next, flow-related attributes are determined for each affected path element, based on possibly <b>conflicting</b> indications <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> direction. Spurious qualitative ambiguities are minimized by using relative magnitudes and permissible directions <b>of</b> <b>flow,</b> and by favoring flow sources over effort sources when comparing flow tendencies. The results are output to local <b>flow</b> states <b>of</b> affected components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the current}} Internet, traffic is routed {{at the level}} of {{destination}} prefixes. The next-generation Internet requires control of traffic at the level <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> or flow aggregates. To accommodate fine-grained control, modern switching substrates (e. g., OpenFlow) maintain forwarding information for each active flow in a flow table. A separate control plane manages flows within a subnetwork by updating this flow information within switches. When using network virtualization, a technique that allows sharing of networking resources among different logical networks, the physical switch and its flow table need to be shared. Current virtualization solutions in OpenFlow do not support hardware isolation in the flow table and thus lead to hidden <b>conflicts</b> and misconfiguration <b>of</b> <b>flows.</b> To maintain network-level flow integrity, we propose two new conflict detection techniques. The first algorithm uses an hybrid hash-trie structure to represent the flow table and determine the conflicting flows using a divide and conquer strategy. The second mechanism uses an ontology based logic inference system to represent and infer the conflicting flow entries. We performed extensive experimental evaluation of both the techniques. For flow table with thousands <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> entries, the proposed techniques effectively resolve the conflicts in approximately 100 milliseconds. I...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{roundabout}} is {{a priority}} junction, whose capacity is typically captured by the entry capacities of individual approaches while considering the effects <b>of</b> <b>conflicting</b> <b>flows.</b> For a single-lane roundabout, entry capacity is traditionally analyzed based on gap acceptance where entering vehicles seek an acceptable gap among the circulating <b>flow.</b> An example <b>of</b> this approach {{can be found in}} HCM (2000). This paper provides an extension to this approach for multi-lane roundabouts. Through an analysis of lane utilization, entry capacity is estimated for each entry lane. Reserve capacity is then used as a measure to assess the overall roundabout performance. This paper also studies the sensitivity of drivers' lane choices on the overall capacity of traffic roundabouts. Copyright ASCE 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground During last decades, the {{knowledge}} in pathophysiological mechanisms of Brugada Syndrome improved. ICD implantation {{is the only}} effective treatment to decrease arrhythmic mortality in high-risk patients. Based on experimental and clinical data hydroquinidine {{seems to be a}} promising alternative for the management of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD but need to be evaluated. Methods Fifty patients were included in this French multicentric, randomised, double-blind study. Hydroquinidine or placebo treatment was given during two 18 months cross-over phases. Arrhythmic events, ECG parameters and clinical events were evaluated. Results Twenty-six (52 %) patients completed the study. Thirty-four (68 %) presented side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, related to hydroquinidine therapy in whom 13 had to stopped. One appropriate ICD shock, one ventricular fibrillation with self-resolution and one inappropriate ICD shock occurred in absence of hydroquinidine therapy. Not one of these event occurred under hydroquinidine. No statistical analysis has been done, regarding this low number of arrhythmic events. Hydroquinidine, at short (3 hours after first taking) or long-term, significantly lengthen QT interval, QTc (respectively 404 vs 417 sm and 409 vs 433 ms), Tpe and Tpe max (respectively 94, 8 vs 106, 6 ms and 89, 4 vs 107, 7 ms) without any change on J-point elevation nor Tpe/QTc ratio. QTc interval was significantly longer (433 vs 417 ms) during long than short-term treatment without any other effect on ECG parameters. Conclusion High rates of hydroquinidine side effects and low number of arrhythmic events give difficulties to conduct large studies to prove its efficiency in Brugada Syndrome. Hydroquinidine lengthens and increases the repolarisation dispersal, with electrocardiographic effects generally similar during short and long-term treatment. These considerations should not stop its use in daily clinical practice, especially for management of electrical storms.
