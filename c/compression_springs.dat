25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by armored <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter idler wheel suspended from a rocker arm which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|E

50|$|Spring boards {{were added}} to the market in 2013 with the release of Strongboard Balance, which holds a patent on the multi-spring design. The board’s fulcrum {{consists}} of 4 individual <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> situated between the base and the platform. Once a user stands on the board, the springs compress. The user’s body then searches for stabilization, but because of the force applied to the springs from the user’s body weight, the board will not stabilize. By redistributing weight across the board, the rider can move the board in any direction - engaging core stabilizing muscles. The four <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> provide additional support for a variety of exercises, target the core, and improve balance, core strength, agility, and posture.|$|E

50|$|Compression garter springs are {{a type of}} {{coiled spring}} that exerts outward radial forces away from the center. They are {{typically}} {{made up of a}} thick steel wire with large coils; <b>compression</b> <b>springs</b> {{need to be able to}} handle very large loads while being able to return to their natural extended position. <b>Compression</b> <b>springs</b> store potential energy when they are compressed (length of spring decreases), and exert kinetic energy when released. Compression garter springs use this principle to withstand forces acting on it from outside. They may be placed inside a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. This is similar to squeezing a rubber ball; the ball will contract when squeezed but will return to its natural state once the external pressure is released.|$|E
50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} springs, and <b>compression</b> <b>springs.</b> The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (<b>compression</b> <b>springs)</b> due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM valve spring application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed valve spring designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|E

5000|$|As {{shown in}} the {{disassembly}} photo, the switch actuator pivots in two holes in {{the sides of the}} plastic switch body. An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the <b>compression</b> <b>spring,</b> the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.|$|R
50|$|When the {{actuator}} is moved, {{mechanical energy}} {{is stored in}} the <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the common contact bar is forced {{in the opposite direction}} by the <b>compression</b> <b>spring,</b> acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The common contact bar is made of copper, with an inlay of harder contact metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body.|$|R

40|$|Presently the {{automobile}} manufacturers are facing challenges of {{improvements in the}} quality and performance of the components together with the reduction in weight and cost of manufacturing. Efforts are directed towards the use of alternative materials in design which results in increase of strength to weight ratio. The use of composite materials is increasing {{in the design of}} automobile components due to their light weight and costs. The present work attempts to study the feasibility of select composite materials in the design of helical <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> used in automobile suspension systems. The design of helical <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> is first analysed for the conventional steel material (IS 4454 Grade 3) and then compared with that of for the composites used as spring materials study their behaviours at the two loading conditions of 1500 N(normal loads) and 3000 N (overload). Composite materials considered for the present study are Eglasss/Epoxy and Carbon/Epoxy. The modeling of the helical spring has been done using CREO 2. 0 and simulation were performed using ANSYS v 14. 5 to predict the stresses, deflections and strain energies at the stated loads. It was observed that the stresses developed in composite material helical <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> is lower as compared to the stresses developed in conventional steel (IS 4454 Grade 3) helical <b>compression</b> <b>spring.</b> Also the deflection and strain energies are observed to be higher for composite materials.

40|$|The energy-recycling {{artificial}} {{foot was}} comprised of six component groups: the attachment interface, the toe assembly, the heel assembly, the primary <b>compression</b> <b>spring,</b> the heel clutch, and the toe latch (cf. Figure 2). The interface component attached to the prosthesis simulator boot through a standard prosthetic pyramid adaptor (Figure S 1). The one-way heel clutch acted between the heel assembly and the interface component, allowing the heel to rotate freely in plantar-flexion (compressing the spring) but locking when forced {{in the opposite direction}} (unless released by motor actuation). The toe latch acted between the toe assembly and the interface component, and prevented the toe assembly from rotating in plantar-flexion unless unlatched. During preload (about 25 - 40 % stride), the torque acting on the toe assembly increased as the center of pressure advanced forward and ground reaction forces increased, eventually overcoming the torque of the primary <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> and pushing the toe assembly against a limit stop. This relieved the toe latch of load, so that a motor could move it to effectively release the toe assembly. During push-off, the primary <b>compression</b> <b>spring</b> was then allowed to force the toe assembly through plantar-flexion, returning stored energy. Simultaneously, the carbon fiber toe spring returned energy that was stored during preload. At the onset of swing, the foot then reset into the ready position by unlocking the heel clutch (cf.
