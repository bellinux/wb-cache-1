40|$|In {{the course}} of the Smart Fabrication Flexible Fab project an {{approach}} has been developped which bases on an extensive literature research covering the subject of "Flexibility Quantification in Manufacturing Industries". This approach provides its user with the possibility of recording quantitatively the flexibility of a planned semiconductor manufacturing. It offers the possibility of flexibility measurement and analysis on different hierarchical levels such as machine-oriented, job shop-oriented, fab and enterprise-wide. A classification of substantial flexibility components has been effected. By definition different measures are merged within each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility,</b> including a ranking. This article explains also the structure of a flexibility evaluation framework which contains all relevant flexibility classes and the frameworks' application on an analysis of various wafer fabrication process scenarios as well as enterprise organization scenarios. Consequently, the presented a pproach can be applied as a tool in oder to identify the most useful wafer fabrication scenario. In doing so an outlook shows in which way the flexibility framework combined with a cost tool can be applied in {{the course of}} the fabrication planning process...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a flexible {{tool for the}} simulation and analysis of real-time applications characterized by different <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> tasks. <b>Flexibility</b> is achieved by allowing the user to define new scheduling algorithms directly in C language, specify the statistical characteristics of the workload, and describe the metrics and the experiments to be performed in the simulation. Tasks can be periodic or aperiodic, and can be characterized by different levels of criticality. Each task class can be handled by a separate scheduling policy, and all policies are integrated by a class scheduler, also defined by the user. Access to shared resources can be simulated by defining specific concurrency control protocols, such as Priority Inheritance, Priority Ceiling, or other user-defined protocols. The simulator has been extensively tested and used for evaluating the performance of several novel scheduling algorithms and is currently being used for research and education. 1 Introduction GHOST ( [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical studies <b>of</b> process <b>flexibility</b> designs {{have mostly}} focused on {{expected}} sales. In this paper, {{we take a}} different approach by studying process flexibility designs from the worst-case point of view. To study the worst-case performances, we introduce the plant cover indices (PCIs), defined by bottlenecks in flexibility designs containing a fixed number of products. We prove that given a flexibility design, a general <b>class</b> <b>of</b> worst-case performance measures can be expressed as functions of the design’s PCIs and the given uncertainty set. This result has several major implications. First, it suggests a method to compare the worst-case performances <b>of</b> different <b>flexibility</b> designs without the {{need to know the}} specifics of the uncertainty sets. Second, we prove that under symmetric uncertainty sets and a large <b>class</b> <b>of</b> worst-case performance measures, the long chain, a celebrated sparse design, is superior to a large <b>class</b> <b>of</b> sparse <b>flexibility</b> designs, including any design that has a degree of two on each of its product nodes. Third, we show that under stochastic demand, the classical Jordan and Graves (JG) index can be expressed {{as a function of the}} PCIs. Furthermore, the PCIs motivate a modified JG index that is shown to be more effective in our numerical study. Finally, the PCIs lead to a heuristic for finding sparse flexibility designs that perform well under expected sales and have lower risk measures in our computational study.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> flexible conditional probability models and techniques for classification /regression problems.

A kernel function defines an embedding of examples into (high or infinite dimensional) feature vectors and allows the classification to be carried out in the feature space without ever explicitly representing it. While support vector machines are non-probabilistic classifiers they can be extended and formalized for probabilistic settings[12] (recently also [8]), which is the topic of this paper.

40|$|Motivated by {{the trend}} towards more {{collaboration}} in work flows, we study stochastic processing networks where some activities require the simultaneous collaboration of multiple human resources. Collaboration introduces resource synchronization requirements {{that are not}} captured in the standard procedure (formalized through a static planning problem) to identify bottlenecks and theoretical capacity. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable idleness. In general, collaboration architectures may feature unavoidable idleness so that the theoretical capacity exceeds the maximal achievable throughput or actual capacity. This fundamental tradeoff between collaboration and throughput does not disappear in multi-server networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. We identify a special <b>class</b> <b>of</b> collaboration architectures that have no unavoidable idleness and present a condition on this architecture that guarantees, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, that the standard bottleneck procedure in fact identifies the actual capacity of the network. In multi-server cases this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> networks guarantees that the theoretical capacity is achievable provided one has the right number of floaters. Finally, we study the subtleties that collaboration introduces to questions <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> investment. Unavoidable idleness may limit the ability to materialize the benefits <b>of</b> <b>flexibility.</b> We study the interplay <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architecture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Coarse-grained {{reconfigurable}} arrays (CGRAs) are {{a promising}} <b>class</b> <b>of</b> architectures conjugating <b>flexibility</b> and efficiency. Devising effective methodologies to map applications onto CGRAs is a challenging task, {{due to their}} parallel execution paradigm and constrained hardware resources. In order to handle complex applications, {{it is important to}} devise efficient strategies to partition a kernel into pieces that obey resource constraint and methodologies to schedule them on the underlying hardware. In this paper, we tackle these problems by proposing algorithms to address partitioning based on recursive searches over abstract trees. A novel scheduling strategy is also described that, leveraging differences in delays of various operations, is able to efficiently map operations on CGRA architectures. Experimental evidence on kernels derived from a diverse set of data flow graphs and EEMBC benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of the described methods, which, when combined, achieve a higher runtime performance on a given mesh size than stateof-the-art approaches (as much as 38 % for the benchmark applications considered).
