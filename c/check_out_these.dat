5000|$|For the Glasgow Review of Books, Laura Waddell {{commented that}} ‘Mankowski’s novel {{is about the}} pitfalls of {{externally}} defined identity; the inability to find meaning and purpose on an individual or societal level results in an attachment to mere symbols of existence.

Advanced Twin Engine training (phase 3) was designed to train cadets to fly transports and bombers. One of the major problems encountered with the switchover from single-engine to two-engine training was the instructor's lack of experience with twin-engined aircraft. Most of the instructors were recent single-engine graduates with {{less than six months}} of flight experience, When the Curtiss AT-9, Beech AT-10 Wichita, and Cessna AT-17 arrived, the instructors had to be thoroughly <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> in <b>these</b> twin-engine trainers before they could instruct the students.|$|R

5000|$|Because {{of their}} beliefs, Admonish {{has been a}} subject of {{controversy}} in the metal scene. The two members' appearance on Pimp My Ride brought the band more attention. Metal Storm's writer Collin commented the appearance on that MTV show: [...] "As fun {{as it was to}} watch, it certainly did not make me want to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> the music <b>these</b> two guys produced. So, Admonish, a joke band needing attention from a crap TV program to worm their way to the sun? Not a second. The 25 or so minutes of “Insnarjd” (their second EP) display quite a lot of skills, ideas and talent to turn a genre that is rather overcrowded and can quite rapidly become a real suckfest, i.e. melodic black metal, into something that sounds at least a little personal." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Sean Westergaard says [...] "Gold Sounds is an {{overwhelming}} success, {{not just as}} a tribute but as a jazz album ... If you're a Pavement fan, you owe it to yourself to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> what <b>these</b> guys do with the songbook. If you're a jazz fan, forget that these tunes come from the world of indie rock; in the hands of Carter and Chestnut, they might as well be undiscovered standards". On All About Jazz Michael McCaw noted [...] "Gold Sounds doesn't give you everything the first time around. Like Pavement's recordings, what may seem complete is only a portion of the melody and musical ideas to which you ultimately want to return, because each time they hook you in a different way. In the end, the album provides a meaty dose of jazz that is as infectious as the pop from which it is derived". In JazzTimes Brent Burton was less enthusiastic noting [...] "a big hunk of the covers disc is, simply put, rather anonymous sounding, which leaves listeners with the quartet's somewhat cheesy conception of what it means to--gulp--rock".|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the applicability and suitability of the deterministic controller, the cautious controller, and the dual controller for the reduction of helicopter vibration by using higher harmonic blade pitch control. A randomly generated linear plant model was assumed and the performance index was defined to be a quadratic output metric of this linear plant. A computer code, designed to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> and evaluate <b>these</b> controllers, was implemented and used to accomplish this comparison. The effects of random measurement noise, the initial estimate of the plant matrix, and the plant matrix propagation rate were determined for each of the controllers. With few exceptions, the deterministic controller yielded the greatest vibration reduction (as characterized by the quadratic output metric) and operated with the greatest reliability. Theoretical limitations of these controllers were defined and appropriate candidate alternative methods, including one method particularly suitable to the cockpit, were identified...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The use of Regular Expressions to {{represent}} the conditions of operations of a finite automaton is becoming popular. A finite automaton can be represented by several regular expressions which are entirely different in out-looks and in structures. It is {{the primary purpose of}} this paper to develop several approaches to prove the equivalence of regular expressions, in a unified manner, pointing out the similarities and differences in the various treatments. The first technique of proving the equivalence is by converting each regular expression into a state graph representing an automaton, then by testing the isomorphism of the resulting automata will show whether the given regular expressions are equivalent. The second technique of proving the equivalence is by converting each regular expression into a graph and then one of the graphs is converted into another graph which is different in appearance, but still representing the same regular expression. This process goes on until the graphs representing two regular expressions become identical, thus the equivalence of the regular expressions is proved. Otherwise they are not equivalent. Axiomic approach is presented in the last chapter of this paper, so that there are formal systems for the algebraic transformation of regular expressions. Equivalence of regular expressions can be clearly <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> within <b>these</b> systems...|$|R
