5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct <b>current</b> <b>power</b> source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} uses a constant <b>current</b> <b>power</b> source, {{meaning that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E

5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct <b>current</b> <b>power</b> test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E

5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant <b>current</b> <b>power</b> supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant <b>current</b> <b>power</b> supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the battle}} of Char, in , Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to {{evaluate}} the extension of Kerrigan's <b>current</b> <b>power</b> to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity {{in order to save}} him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.|$|E

A new on-chip <b>current</b> and <b>power</b> measurement technique is proposed in this dissertation. This technique is based on utilizing the pervasive on-chip voltage regulators. We demonstrate that <b>current</b> and <b>power</b> information can be directly obtained from the power source, typically {{in the form of a}} voltage regulator. This technique has the advantage of minimizing the impact on system 2 ̆ 7 s design and performance. ^ The proposed on-chip <b>current</b> and <b>power</b> measurement technique reuses the existing low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO) and obtain on-chip <b>current</b> and <b>power</b> information from LDO 2 ̆ 7 s internal signal. <b>Current</b> and <b>power</b> information is directly obtained from the power source, typically in the form of a voltage regulator. Due to the unique structure, <b>current</b> or <b>power</b> sensors do not have physical connection with system 2 ̆ 7 s function units. Therefore, this technique is expected to have minimum impact on system 2 ̆ 7 s performance and design complexity. ^ Power management techniques need the capability to continuous monitor the power consumption, preferably on-chip. The proposed technique can be used to provide continuous power information. This technique is investigated by testing ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits. Using this technique, on-chip power sensors were designed and verified to have good linearity and accuracy. Experiment results show that the average non-linearity is about 0. 4...|$|R
