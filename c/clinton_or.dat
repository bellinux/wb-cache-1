5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either <b>Clinton</b> <b>or</b> Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

He also said it was possible Clinton was not [...] "technically sophisticated" [...] enough to understand what the three classified markings meant. The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it [...] "is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account." [...] Comey stated that although <b>Clinton</b> <b>or</b> her colleagues were [...] "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information", the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that [...] "no charges are appropriate in this case." [...] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.|$|E
500|$|While out fishing, Homer is {{abducted}} {{by the two}} aliens, Kang and Kodos. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer informs them of the upcoming presidential election and says the winner could be either Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>or</b> Bob Dole. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through [...] "bio-duplication" [...] to ensure {{that one of them}} will become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, so nobody will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton, with both candidates agreeing they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On the day before the election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to the people that they still have to choose one of them because it is too late to get new candidates. Kang is subsequently elected president and enslaves all of humanity.|$|E

2500|$|After his win in South Carolina, Obama {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former President John F.

Not Democrats, not Republicans - and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the <b>Clintons</b> <b>or</b> dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration." [...] In a June 2013 interview with former President Bill Clinton, Clinton told Ferguson that he and Larry Summers couldn't change Alan Greenspan's mind about the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which deregulated derivatives and helped fuel the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent 2008-2012 global recession. Congress then passed the Act with a veto-proof supermajority. Ferguson thought Clinton was [...] "a really good actor" [...] and that this was a lie, actually, Ferguson wrote, the Clinton Administration and Larry Summers lobbied for the Act and, along with Robert Rubin privately attacked advocates of regulation.|$|R
