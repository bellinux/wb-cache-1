50|$|When one {{considers}} the magnet layout needed to achieve both goals, a twisted path around the circumference of the device {{as well as many}} smaller twists and mixes along the way, the design becomes extremely complex, well beyond the abilities of conventional design tools. It was only through the use of massively parallel computers that the designs could be studied in depth, and suitable magnet designs created. The result was a very <b>compact</b> <b>device,</b> significantly smaller outside than a classical design for any given volume of plasma, with a low aspect ratio. Lower aspect ratios are highly desirable, because they allow a machine of any given power to be smaller, which lowers construction costs.|$|E
