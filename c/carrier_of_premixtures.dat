40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} amphetamine, procaine, procainamide, DOPA, isoproterenol, and atenolol upon activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} in the absence and presence of acetaldehyde have been investigated. In the absence of acetaldehyde, amphetamine and isoproterenol exhibit a procoagulant effect upon {{activated partial thromboplastin time}}, whereas atenolol and procaine display anticoagulant effects upon activated partial thromboplastin time. DOPA and procainamide do not alter activated partial thromboplastin time. <b>Premixtures</b> <b>of</b> procaine with acetaldehyde produce an additive anticoagulant effect on activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting independent action of these compounds upon clotting factors. <b>Premixtures</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine with acetaldehyde, as well as atenolol with acetaldehyde, generate a detoxication of the anticoagulant effect of acetaldehyde upon activated partial thromboplastin time. A similar statistically significant decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time is seen when procainamide is premixed with acetaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. <b>Premixtures</b> <b>of</b> DOPA and isoproterenol with acetaldehyde do not affect an alteration in activated partial thromboplastin time relative to acetaldehyde alone. Hence, a selective interaction of atenolol, procaine, and amphetamine with acetaldehyde to produce detoxication of the acetaldehyde is suggested, undoubtedly due to the presence of amino, hydroxyl, or amide groups in these drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{premixed}} {{source of}} 50 % N 2 O and 50 % O 2 diluted with room air was evaluated {{in a series of}} 32 patients undergoing a routine dental procedure. Dependent variables observed were the flow rates of gas necessary to achieve adequate sedation, patient acceptance of the administration method and clinical signs of hypoxia. The median flow rate observed when patients were sedated was 3 liters per minute (range 1 to 5 liters per minute). Twenty-four patients tolerated the dental procedure without need to alter the initial dose, 6 required an increased dose and 2 required less of the gas mixture. No clinical signs of diffusion hypoxia were noted in this small sample. The results of this open clinical evaluation suggest that use <b>of</b> a <b>premixture</b> <b>of</b> 50 % N 2 O and 50 % O 2 results in adequate sedation, is well tolerated by patients and dose not result in any clinically obvious signs of hypoxia...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} relationship of autoignition delay time with temperature and pressure is employed to derive the propagation velocities of autoignitive reaction fronts for particular reactivity gradients, once autoignition has been initiated. In {{the present study}} of a variety <b>of</b> <b>premixtures,</b> with different {{functional relationship}}s, such gradients comprise fixed initial temperature gradients. The smaller is {{the ratio of the}} acoustic speed through the mixture to the localised velocity of the autoignitive front, the greater are the amplitude and frequency of the induced pressure wave. This might lead to damaging engine knock. At higher values of the ratio, the autoignition can be benign with only small over-pressures. This approach to the effects of autoignition is confirmed by its application to a variety of experimental studies involving:(i) Imposed temperature gradients in a rapid compression and expansion machine. (ii) Onset of knock in an engine with advancing spark timing. (iii) Development of autoignition at a single hot spot in an engine. (iv) Autoignition fronts initiated by several hot spots. There is much diversity in the effects that can be produced by different fuels in different ranges of temperature and pressure. Higher values of autoignitive propagation speeds lead to increasingly severe engine knock. Such effects cannot always be predicted from the Research and Motor octane numbers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Carriers</b> <b>of</b> {{haemophilia}} {{are known}} to have a wide range of clotting factor levels and bleeding symptoms. This study aimed at investigating whether <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> severe and moderate haemophilia had an increased bleeding tendency, compared with a control group, using a condensed version of a bleeding assessment tool developed by the Molecular and Clinical Markers for the Diagnosis and Management of Type 1 VWD study group (MCMDM- 1 VWD). One hundred and twenty-six genetically verified <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> severe and moderate haemophilia and 90 controls were interviewed regarding bleeding symptoms. A bleeding score of at least 4 was considered positive, indicating a significant bleeding tendency. Clotting factor levels were tested in the <b>carriers.</b> Nineteen <b>of</b> the women were <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> haemophilia B, with a mean factor (F) IX:C level of 0. 54 (± 0. 27) kIU/l, and 107 were <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> haemophilia A, with a mean FVIII:C level of 0. 74 (± 0. 32) kIU/l. The median bleeding score was 2 (- 3 - 12) among carriers and - 1 (- 3 - 8) among controls (P < 0. 001). The bleeding score was weakly correlated to clotting factor levels in <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> haemophilia A (rs = - 0. 36, P < 0. 001). We conclude that the bleeding tendency in our cohort <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> differed significantly from that in the controls and that clotting factor levels might not be sufficient to predict the bleeding tendency...|$|R
