25|$|The name Patara {{is still}} {{attached}} to the numerous ruins of the city. These, {{according to the survey}} of Capt. Francis Beaufort, are situated on the sea-shore, a little to the eastward of the river Xanthus, and consist of a theatre excavated in the northern side of a small hill, a ruined temple {{on the side of the}} same hill, and a deep circular pit, of singular appearance, which may have been the seat of the oracle. The town walls surrounded an area of considerable extent; they may easily be traced, as well as the situation of a castle which commanded the harbour, and of several towers which flanked the walls. On the outside of the walls there is a multitude of stone sarcophagi, most of them bearing inscriptions, but all open and empty; and within the walls, temples, altars, pedestals, and fragments of sculpture appear in profusion, but ruined and mutilated. The situation of the harbour is still apparent, but it is a swamp, <b>choked</b> <b>up</b> with sand and bushes. The theatre was built in the reign of Antoninus Pius; its diameter is 265feet, and has about 30 rows of seats. There are also ruins of thermae, which, according to an inscription upon them, were built by Vespasian.|$|E

She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me <b>choked</b> <b>up,</b> crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up".
