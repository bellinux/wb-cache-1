25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel injector, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> Heat from the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E
25|$|The premixing/prevaporizing {{injectors}} work {{by mixing}} or vaporizing the fuel {{before it reaches}} the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> This method allows the fuel to be very uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. One disadvantage of this method is that fuel may auto-ignite or otherwise combust before the fuel-air mixture reaches the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> If this happens the combustor can be seriously damaged.|$|E
25|$|Combustion {{can vary}} in degree of violence. A {{deflagration}} is a propagation of a <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> at a velocity {{less than the}} speed of sound in the unreacted medium. A detonation is a propagation of a <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> at a velocity greater {{than the speed of}} sound in the unreacted medium. An explosion is the bursting or rupture of an enclosure or container due to the development of internal pressure from a deflagration or detonation as defined in NFPA 69.|$|E
5000|$|Cannular type: Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have {{discrete}} <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> {{contained in}} separate liners {{with their own}} fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> share a common air casing.|$|R
5000|$|Annular type: Annular combustors do {{away with}} the {{separate}} <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> and simply have a continuous liner and casing in a ring (the annulus).|$|R
2500|$|One {{variation}} on the standard annular combustor is the double annular combustor (DAC). Like an annular combustor, the DAC is a continuous ring without separate <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> around the radius. The {{difference is that the}} combustor has two <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> around the ring; a pilot zone and a main zone. The pilot zone acts like that of a single annular combustor, and is the only zone operating at low power levels. At high power levels, the main zone is used as well, increasing air and mass flow through the combustor. GE's implementation of this type of combustor focuses on reducing NOx and CO2 emissions[...] Extending the same principles as the double annular combustor, triple annular and [...] "multiple annular" [...] combustors have been proposed and even patented.|$|R
25|$|Intermediate air is the air {{injected}} into the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> through {{the second set of}} liner holes (primary air goes through the first set). This air completes the reaction processes, cooling the air down and diluting the high concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2).|$|E
25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter {{needs to be}} in the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{boiler furnace}} {{auxiliary}} equipment includes coal feed nozzles and igniter guns, soot blowers, water lancing and observation ports (in the furnace walls) for {{observation of the}} furnace interior. Furnace explosions due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> before igniting the coal.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} jet engines, the combustor's {{job is to}} create hot air, by burning a fuel with the air at {{essentially}} constant pressure. The airflow through the jet engine is usually quite high, so sheltered <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> are produced by using 'flame holders' to stop the flames from blowing out.|$|R
5000|$|One {{variation}} on the standard annular combustor is the double annular combustor (DAC). Like an annular combustor, the DAC is a continuous ring without separate <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> around the radius.

A good diagram of a DAC is available from Purdue. Extending the same principles as the double annular combustor, triple annular and [...] "multiple annular" [...] combustors have been proposed and even patented.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of inferring information regarding turbulence and combustion details in turbulent <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> through the acoustic field is explored. The well known theoretical formulation of Strahle is used. The real difficulty in prediction of the acoustic field {{is seen to}} be the unavailability of an expression for the local, instantaneous reaction rate in a turbulent field. A simplified expression is used to infer {{the nature of the}} acoustic field. Based on earlier photographic observations, a model is used as a working hypothesis to extract information regarding the acoustic field. These are seen to be substantiated by experiments as well. More importantly, it is found that changes in the operating conditions of various burners are almost instantly revealed in the acoustic spectra. Several experiments with a laboratory burner using several different gaseous reactants are reported to support this diagnostic information content of the acoustic fields of turbulent <b>combustion</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, CFMI {{began work}} on a new, double-annular {{combustor}}. Instead of having just one <b>combustion</b> <b>zone,</b> the double-annular combustor has a second <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> that is used at high thrust levels. This design lowers the emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The first CFM56 engine with the double-annular combustor entered service in 1995, and the combustor is used on [...] "Tech Insertion" [...] CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B variants.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the {{spatial distribution of}} spontaneous <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> under a Y ventilation scheme, field tests and numerical modelling {{studies were carried out}} on a longwall face in Fenghuangshan mine. Computational fluid dynamics models were developed and base model results validated using tube bundle gas monitoring data. A three dimensional high oxygen concentration <b>zone</b> where spontaneous <b>combustion</b> was most likely to occur was predicted behind the longwall face. Parametric studies were conducted to develop proactive goaf inertisation strategies to minimise the spontaneous <b>combustion</b> <b>zones.</b> Results indicated that effective goaf inertisation can be achieved by injecting inert gas on the belt road side at least 100 m behind the face, and, if underground access becomes prohibitive, injection can be carried out via surface wells/boreholes. Injection behind the retaining wall is only effective for localised heating(s) around the injection point(s), as much of the injected inert gas will be dispersed by air leakage along the unconsolidated goaf boundary...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} lignite {{originating}} from North Dakota (USA) was thermally treated in an oxygen/steam blown commercial-scale moving bed gasifier operating on lump coal at the Dakota Gasification Company (DGC) {{in order to}} identify the physical property changes that occur during heating. After reaction, the solid particulate remnants were extracted from the reactor and characterised using standard techniques. Thermal fragmentation was found to be severe with the coal tested, i. e. the lump coal was found to decrease in size to about 90 % b 6. 3 mm particles in the drying and de-volatilisation zones of the reactor. The particle size (mean Sauter diameter) however increased slightly in the reduction and <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> due to ash melting and subsequent agglomeration. The particle as well as the bulk density residual profiles of the fuel bed samples in the reactor was found to be in alignment with the residual ash content profile. The ash fusion temperature (AFT) of the feed coal to the commercial-scale moving-bed gasifier was found to be higher as compared to the ash bed. Fluxing elements in the dominating glass phase determined in the reduction and <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> are most probably the reason behind this phenomenon. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{study of}} heat and mass {{transfer}} {{taking into account the}} combustion of coal particles in the furnace at the three-stage combustion of pulverized coal was performed. Analysis of the reburning zone stoichiometry on the concentration of nitrogen oxides at the furnace outlet was made. The values of excess air in the primary and reburning <b>combustion</b> <b>zones,</b> providing for the concentration of nitrogen oxides at the furnace outlet is not more than 350 mg/m 3 and unburned carbon not more than 1 % when burning coal with a high content of nitrogen were established...|$|R
2500|$|Clean agents {{extinguish}} fire by displacing oxygen (CO2 or inert gases), removing {{heat from}} the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> (Halotron-1, FE-36, Novec 1230) or inhibiting the chemical chain reaction (Halons). [...] They {{are referred to as}} clean agents because they do not leave any residue after discharge which is ideal for protecting sensitive electronics, aircraft, armored vehicles and archival storage, museums, and valuable documents.|$|E
2500|$|Like CO, Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are {{produced}} in the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> However, unlike CO, it is most produced during the conditions that CO is most consumed (high temperature, high pressure, long residence time). This means that, in general, reducing CO emissions results {{in an increase in}} NOx and vice versa. This fact means that most successful emission reductions require the combination of several methods.|$|E
2500|$|Can combustors are {{self-contained}} cylindrical combustion chambers. Each [...] "can" [...] {{has its own}} fuel injector, igniter, liner, and casing. The {{primary air}} from the compressor is guided into each individual can, where it is decelerated, mixed with fuel, and then ignited. The secondary air also comes from the compressor, where it is fed outside of the liner (inside of {{which is where the}} combustion is taking place). The secondary air is then fed, usually through slits in the liner, into the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> to cool the liner via thin film cooling.|$|E
40|$|Waste {{disposal}} is a core issue worldwide. Different researches {{are being}} carried out in order to handle waste materials, generated in industrial production and application processes, e. g. paint residue from metal coating in the automobile industry. Often waste is disposed in landfills at substantial economic and environmental cost. Combustion {{is another way to}} get rid of possibly hazardous waste. Pulverized fuel combustion is one of the latest combustion technologies. However, pulverized fuel combustion faces severe problems if the waste (fuel) contains components with low melting point. Having a low melting point, it gets difficult to manage and convey the pulverized material to the hot combustion chamber. The melting of fuel causes clogging in the fuel transport nozzle used to convey the material into the combustion chamber. In this work, a new technology for combustion of materials with low melting points is proposed, focusing on apparatus and nozzle design to preven t clogging. For this purpose, different nozzle designs were evaluated by multi-phase CFD simulations. Two sets of nozzle air flow rates were used in four nozzles. Effect of different flow rates and fuel particle size on combustion temperatures are also discussed. It was noted that nozzle air flow rate has a strong influence on the temperature distributions. Small fuel particle sizes result in wider <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> while larger particles give longer <b>combustion</b> <b>zones.</b> The results come up with optimized nozzle design and nozzle air flow for transportation of pulverized material with low melting point...|$|R

40|$|In this study, lignite fromNorth Dakota (USA) was {{thermally}} {{treated in}} a commercial-scale oxygen/steamblown moving bed reactor at the Dakota Gasification Conpany (DGC) {{in order to identify}} mineralogical changes that occur during the conversion process. After reaction, the solid particulate remnants were extracted from the reactor reaction zones and characterised using XRD, CCSEM and SEMPC techniques. It was found that the feed coal mineralization was mainly dominated by organically bound calcium. On the other hand, the crystalline phases present in the hottest regions of the reactor were governed by gehlenite and bredigite which may have formed from the transformation, (at higher temperatures), of the organically bound Ca and Mg to form CaO and MgO and subsequent interaction with the reactive silica and transformation products of the clays. A significant amount of calcitewas found to develop {{at the start of the}} reduction zone; it is suggested that the calcitewas synthesised fromthe reaction of CaO (formed fromthe transformation of the organically bound Ca) with the CO 2 from the product gas in the reactor, in agreementwith the literature. The glass phase was found to constitute the major part of the ash mineral assemblage in the reduction and <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> of the reactor. This phase was composed mainly of the Ca, Mg, Na aluminosilicates with some Fe. There was therefore a significant amount of melting that occurred in the hotter reaction zones (i. e. reduction and <b>combustion</b> <b>zones)</b> of the reactor. The organically bound Ca, Mg and Na seemed to have played a significant role in the formation of this glass phase. [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{is responsible for}} introducing fuel to the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four primary types of {{fuel injector}}s; pressure-atomizing, air blast, vaporizing, and premix/prevaporizing injectors. Pressure atomizing fuel injectors rely on high fuel pressures (as much as [...] ) to atomize the fuel. This type of fuel injector {{has the advantage of}} being very simple, but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to withstand such high pressures, and the fuel tends to be heterogeneously atomized, resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone.</b> Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combustion}} flue gases {{inside the}} chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes {{the bottom of}} the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure {{at the bottom of a}} corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called [...] "natural draught/draft", [...] "natural ventilation", [...] "chimney effect", or [...] "stack effect". The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney. [...] This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause creosote to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.|$|E

The measurements were obtained using the ion cyclotron resonance technique at 298 K. In several reactions an association product was observed at pressures as low as 0. 000001 torr, and in these cases stabilization of the intermediate {{was assumed to be}} by photon emission. Most of the reaction studied yield ions having a larger carbon skeleton than the reactant ion.

The combustor layer has four individually controlled <b>combustion</b> <b>zones</b> each connected to a separate fuel supply.

2500|$|The next type of {{combustor}} is the cannular combustor; {{the term}} is a portmanteau of [...] "can annular". Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common ring (annulus) casing. Each <b>combustion</b> <b>zone</b> no longer has {{to serve as a}} pressure vessel. The combustion zones can also [...] "communicate" [...] with each other via liner holes or connecting tubes that allow some air to flow circumferentially. The exit flow from the cannular combustor generally has a more uniform temperature profile, which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is [...] also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a cannular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor.
