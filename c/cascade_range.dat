5|$|In 1829 Hall J. Kelley led a {{campaign}} to rename the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{which usually}} appears from late summer to autumn, is {{distributed}} in the hemlock forests of the Pacific Coast Ranges from Northern California to Alaska, the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range,</b> {{as well as in}} interior forests such as in Manitoba.

5|$|Starting 20 {{million years}} ago (in the Cenozoic) and lasting until 5 {{million years ago}}, a now-extinct {{extension}} of <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas.|$|E

5|$|State Route 168 (SR168) is a legislated, but not constructed, {{state highway}} located in Washington, United States. The highway {{is meant to}} serve as an {{alternate}} crossing through the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> at Naches Pass, supplementing the seasonal Chinook Pass on SR410. Proposals were first drawn in the 1930s, and the highway has been codified in law under its current designation since 1970, however no construction has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Subduction, having ceased at the {{existing}} zone, eventually reinitiated {{further to the}} west as the current Cascadia subduction zone. Volcanism from the new subduction zone (such as the Grays River Volcanics and Northcraft Volcanics) reached the surface about 42 Ma, thereby initiating {{the rise of the}} ancestral <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sculptured}} puffball grows solitarily or {{in small}} groups in forest duff. It is typically associated with coniferous forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range.</b> The United States distribution includes the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.

5|$|Although more {{abundant}} in montane and northern coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico.

5|$|As the Bonneville Floods rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula Floods {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula Floods, which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills. The Palouse River canyon was {{the largest of the}} many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills, and could not have become as large as it now is {{if it were not for}} the Missoula Floods. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> to the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range,</b> Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, major river-control {{projects}} {{had begun to}} take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40percent of the basin. Most {{of them do not}} have fish ladders.|$|E
5|$|Goat Rocks is an extinct {{stratovolcano}} in the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range,</b> {{located between}} Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in southern Washington, in the United States. Part of the Cascade Volcanoes, it {{was formed by}} the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under {{the western edge of}} the North American Plate. The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago. Throughout its complex eruptive history, volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous, mafic activity.|$|E
50|$|Independence is {{a popular}} {{resupply}} location for hikers trekking the 2,650 mile long Pacific Crest Trail which extends from the Mexican border to Canada along {{the crest of the}} Sierra Nevada and <b>Cascade</b> <b>Ranges.</b> The highest pass along the entire trail, 13,153 foot (4009 m) Forester Pass, is directly west of Independence.|$|R
50|$|Seahpo Peak is a {{subsidiary}} peak of Mount Shuksan, which {{rises in the}} U.S. state of Washington. It is located about 2 mi east of the main peak of Shuksan and rises to about 7441 ft.

50|$|The town lies {{mostly on}} the north bank of the Skagit River, and is split into half by the lower Baker River (a {{tributary}} to the Skagit River).

5|$|On the Olympic Peninsula the Blue Mountain unit at {{the base}} of the Crescent Formation {{includes}} sediments (including large boulders of quartz diorite) of continental origin, showing that the continent was close by; other sediments were eroded from the pre-Cenozoic rock of Vancouver Island and the northern <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range.</b> At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains, while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to rock of the Idaho Batholith.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> in {{the late}} Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata, layers of stream-deposited {{volcanic}} tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses, camels, rhinoceroses, bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12million years ago. The fossils of oak, sycamore, maple, ginkgo, and elm trees reflect the area's cool climate during this time period.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cascade</b> <b>Range</b> is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Douglas-firs from 91 seed {{sources in}} North America were {{evaluated}} after 5 and 6 years in 15 common-garden {{tests in the}} mountainous regions of northwest and north central Spain. Analyses of tallest trees showed {{that most of the}} sources of highest potential for reforestation in Spain are found in regions where the Pacific Ocean air mass dominates climate. Fast growers came from coastal slopes of the Coast Ranges from northwest California to the Georgia Strait of southwest British Columbia and inland slopes of the Olympic Mountains and Coast and <b>Cascade</b> <b>Ranges</b> facing the Puget Trough in western Washington and Willamette Valley in northwest Oregon. Slow growers came from latitudes south of 44 ° and north of 50 ° N, high altitudes west of the crest of the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Ranges,</b> and regions east of the crest where the continental air mass dominates climate...|$|R
