5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher <b>clamping</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor to another. The successful use of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor, it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an electro-mechanical brake (EMB) for an automotive brake-by-wire (BBW) system. A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor is typically used in EMB designs {{and the elimination of}} this component is strongly demanded due to implementation difficulties and cost issues. The motivation behind this thesis is to make developmental inroads into the deficiencies provided by previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> Previous attempts have deficiencies for high speed braking applications as well as handling thermally dependent parameter variations. A dynamic stiffness model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and two additional temperature sensors. Previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> have been stiffness based and have not been capable of successfully modelling parameter variations in response to heating. This thesis introduces new developments on how to model stiffness parameter variations under the influence of heating. Two temperature sensors are required to be employed in this new approach. These additional sensors will not have a considerable impact towards the cost savings created by omitting a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor. A torque balance model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is also developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and actuator motor current sensors. A training strategy is used for the dynamic stiffness and torque balance models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> so that wear dependent parameters can be adapted. The two independent models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> are fused using various sensor fusion algorithms to give improved estimates of <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> A maximum-likelihood estimator is used to optimize the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimation. This is followed by implementing a Kalman filter to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an EMB. The dynamic stiffness model is used as the state space equation in the Kalman filter, whilst the torque balance model is used to give measurement updates. Experimental verification showed that the Kalman filter was more accurate than the maximum-likelihood estimator as expected, however the Kalman filter required more computational burden. A RMSE of 0. 5 kN was attained for the Kalman filter and 0. 56 kN for the maximum-likelihood estimator...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate aspects of hybrid joint design for a shear connection. Part 1 is design considerations and a case study based on a engine mount. In Part 2, an experimental study is conducted regarding how relaxation and creep affects properties of a hybrid joint between carbon fiber vinylester and steel. Failure modes, loss of <b>clamped</b> <b>force</b> and ultimate strength of the joint and how these are affected by elevated temperature and different <b>clamped</b> <b>forces</b> are presented. Test specimens were 184 × 45 × 5 mm CFRP, in double lap joint between two steel plates of same dimensions, with either a single or double M 10 hexagon flange screw. Creep/ relaxation testing was preformed over a 28 day period. Results shows that the amount of initial <b>clamped</b> <b>force</b> does not effect amount of loss of <b>clamped</b> <b>force,</b> but increase in temperature significantly does. Average loss was between 8. 3 an 8. 8 % for single joint specimens, initial torque of 28, 37 and 46 Nm, and 10. 8 % for double joint specimens, 37 Nm. But losses for specimens subjected to heat, 80 °C, was 35. 5 %. Ultimate bearing strength of the lamina was not effected by any circumstances. Slip load was lower for specimens clamped with lower <b>clamped</b> <b>force,</b> the loss over the 28 day period was not enough to produced any clear results regarding the amount of loss.

He flipped it over and reattached it. He was able then to drop the bottom of the bars another few millimeters to his liking. He later won his Cruiser class at this national using that configuration.

2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the <b>clamping</b> <b>force,</b> allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} design tools for analysing block stability around a tunnel. First, {{it was determined that}} joint length and field stress have a significant influence on estimating block stability. The results of calculations using methods based on kinematic limit equilibrium (KLE) were compared with the results of filtered DFN-DEM, which are closer to reality. The comparison shows that none of the KLE approaches– conventional, limited joint length, limited joint length with stress and probabilistic KLE – could provide results similar to DFN-DEM. This is due to KLE’s unrealistic assumptions in estimating either volume or <b>clamping</b> <b>forces.</b> A simple mechanism for estimating <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> such as continuum mechanics or the solution proposed by Crawford-Bray leads to an overestimation of <b>clamping</b> <b>forces,</b> and thus unsafe design. The results of such approaches were compared to those of DEM, and it was determined that these simple mechanisms ignore a key stage of relaxation of <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> due to joint existence. The amount of relaxation is a function of many parameters, such as stiffness of the joint and surrounding rock, the joint friction angle and the block half-apical angle. Based on a conceptual model, the key stage was considered in a new analytical solution for symmetric blocks, and the amount of joint relaxation was quantified. The results of the new analytical solution compared to those of DEM and the model uncertainty of the new solution were quantified. Further numerical investigations based on local and regional stress models were performed to study initial <b>clamping</b> <b>forces.</b> Numerical analyses reveal that local stresses, which are a product of regional stress and joint stiffness, govern block stability. Models with a block assembly show that the <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> in a block assembly are equal to the <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> in a regional stress model. Therefore, considering a single block in massive rock results in lower <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> and thus safer design compared to a block assembly in the same condition of in-situ stress and properties. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which is  the most important parameter by assessing sensitivity factors and studying the applicability of the partial coefficient method for designing block stability. It was determined that the governing parameter is the dispersion of the half-apical angle. For a dip angle with a high dispersion, partial factors become very large and the design value for <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> is close to zero. This suggests that in cases with a high dispersion of the half-apical angle, the <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> could be ignored in a stability analysis, unlike in cases with a lower dispersion. The costs of gathering more information about the joint dip angle could be compared to the costs of overdesign. The use of partial factors is uncertain, at least without dividing the problem into sub-classes. The application of partial factors is possible in some circumstances but not always, and a FORM analysis is preferable. QC 2011120...|$|R

30|$|Lag screws {{which have}} {{benefits}} of minimal loosening and slippage {{during the initial}} application of loads are increasingly used to join timber members [1]. Construction management {{is an important component}} of ensuring lag screw joints are sufficiently strong, which require managers to exercise more caution than with bolt joints. For example, lag screws often cause wood cracking if screwed in without drilling a pilot hole, or driven in using a hammer [1]. These concerns are not limited to wood cracking: over-tightening lag screws may cause such joints to no longer perform at their true strength. Take for example the case of using a wrench to join a steel plate (or washer) to a timber member with a lag screw. Some of the force generated acts as a compressive force on the timber member, which generates an equivalent pull-out force on the lag screw. Tightening the lag screw until the pull-out force exceeds the wood’s pull-out strength causes the axial force on the joint (“clamp force” below) to weaken, leading to poor adhesion between the two members. Among other construction management-related considerations, builders should ensure that lag screw joints are fastened with the proper amount of torque to prevent this from happening. To determine what constitutes “proper” torque, it is imperative to determine first the degree of <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> caused by tightening a lag screw, and second how that <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> relates to the pull-out strength of that screw. While many studies have been conducted on screw joints’ pull-out strength, shear strength, and other mechanical properties [2 – 9], we can find none that regard the relationship between <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> and pull-out force for lag screws. We are currently developing a high damping shear wall, in which the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> of lag screws in wood acts as a frictional resistance force between two timber members or between a timber member and a steel plate [10]. Controlling the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> {{is an important part of}} generating the frictional resistance in this project. We thus became interested in clarifying the relationship between <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> and pull-out strength in lag screws, to investigate techniques for controlling the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> of lag screws.|$|R
