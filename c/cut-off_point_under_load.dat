METHODS:Serum NTproBNP and TNF-alpha levels were assayed in 50 patients with MC+HCV, and in 50 sex- and age-matched controls. RESULTS:Cryoglobulinemic patients showed significantly higher mean NTproBNP and TNF-alpha levels than controls (P < 0. 001; Mann-Whitney U test). By defining high NTproBNP level as a value higher than 125 pg/mL (the single <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for outpatients <b>under</b> 75 years of age), 30 % of MC+HCV and 6 % of controls had high NTproBNP (c 2, P < 0. 01).

However, in many patients, these symptoms are not {{proportional to the}} liver involvement and could resemble symptoms of chronic heart failure. To our knowledge, no study evaluated serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in a large series of patients with HCV chronic infection (HCV+). Serum NT-proBNP was assayed in 50 patients HCV+ and in 50 sex- and age-matched controls. HCV+ patients showed significantly higher mean NT-proBNP level than controls (P = 0. 001). By defining high NT-proBNP level as a value higher than 125 pg/mL (the single <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for patient <b>under</b> 75 years of age), 34 % HCV+ and 6 % controls had high NT-proBNP (Fisher exact test; P < 0. 001).

40|$|Diagnostic tests play a {{vital role}} inmodern {{medicine}} not only forconfirming the presence of disease butalso to rule out the disease in individual patient. Diagnostic tests with two outcome categories such as a positive test (+) and negative test (–) are known as dichotomous, whereas those with more than two categories such as positive, indeterminate and negative are called polytomous tests. The validity of a dichotomous test compared with the gold standard is determined by sensitivity and specificity. These two are components that measure the inherent validity of a test. A test is called continuous when it yields numeric values such as bilirubin level and nominal when it yields categories such as Mantoux test. Sensitivity and specificity can be calculated in both cases but ROC curve is applicable only for continuous or ordinal test. When the response of a diagnostic test is continuous or on ordinal scale (minimum 5 categories), sensitivity and specificity can be computed across all possible threshold values. Sensitivity is inversely related with specificity in the sense that sensitivity increases as specificity decreases across various threshold. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is the plot that displays the full picture of trade-off between the sensitivity and (1 - specificity) across a series of <b>cut-off</b> <b>points.</b> Area <b>under</b> the ROC curve is considered as an effective measure of inherent validity of a diagnostic test. This curve is useful in (i) finding optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> to least misclassify diseased or non-diseased subjects, (ii) evaluating the discri-minatory ability of a test to correctly pick diseased and non-diseased subjects; (iii) comparing the efficacy of two or more tests for assessing the same disease; and (iv) comparing two or more observers measuring the same test (inter-observer variability) ...|$|R

The vertical axis <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 133 counts per 5 sec for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 193 counts for vigorous activity (VPA) corresponding to a metabolic threshold of 5 MET and 233 for VPA corresponding to 6 MET.

Neck circumference (NC), as an additional measure, was previously {{found to be a}} worthy identifier of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the aim was to determine NC and WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to our Caucasian cohort, to confirm baseline <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> and {{to determine whether or not}} WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to this cohort differed from the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) WC guidelines. Design, subjects and setting: A target population study, nested in a prospective cohort, was assessed and included 90 and 96 Caucasian men and women aged 24 - 65 years from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipality District, North West province. Outcomes measures: Anthropometric and fasting biological markers for metabolic syndrome, e. g. systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein, were obtained. Results: <b>Cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were determined with the use of a receiver operating characteristic. With the use of cohortspecific WC cut-offs, metabolic syndrome prevalence did not change. WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 96 cm for men and 88 cm for women. NC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 42 cm and 35 cm, for men and women, respectively. Conclusion: WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to these Caucasians differed to those from the JIS guidelines, but corresponded with the baseline findings of the prospective cohort. From a clinical perspective, we cautiously suggest the application of NC, rather than WC, as an anthropometric measure of metabolic syndrome in women as it was a stronger predictor of metabolic syndrome and is not influenced by menopausal status per se.

40|$|Purpose: Diseases {{characterized}} by a continuous trait can be defined by setting a <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for the disease measure in question, accepting some misclassification. The 97. 5 th percentile is commonly used as a <b>cut-off</b> <b>point.</b> However, {{it is unclear whether}} this percentile is the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> {{from the point of view}} of risk-factor analysis. The optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for risk-factor analysis can be found with a statistical method that minimizes the effect of misclassification. We applied this method to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Here, the continuous trait is the cup-disc ratio. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal cup-disc ratio <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for risk-factor analysis in population-based epidemiology. Methods: All participants in the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, assessment of the cup-disc ratio with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) and visual field testing. In the statistical method, the cup-disc ratio (the continuous trait) and the IOP (a major risk factor) were independent variables and glaucomatous visual field loss (the true glaucoma endpoint) the dependent variable in a logistic regression model. The optimal cup-disc ratio <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> was found by minimizing the influence of IOP in this model. Variability of the approach was assessed by using a bootstrap resampling technique. Results: Of 2444 included participants, 93 had glaucomatous visual field loss. The median optimal cup-disc ratio <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> was the 97. 0 th percentile with a 95 % central range from 95. 5 to 98. 5.

The highest <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> from the defined patients with diabetes for men was 99. 0 cm (sensitivity 61 %, specificity 70. 2 %), for women – cm (sensitivity 64. 1 %, specificity 65. 9 %). Conclusions: <b>Cut-off</b> <b>point</b> from the persons {{with the presence of}} ≥ 2 MS components in Siberian population 45 – 69 years, in accordance with the ROC analysis are 93. 3 cm for men and 90. 2 cm for women. The lowest <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> WC marked BP ≥ 130 / 85 mm Hg for men – 90 cm, for women – 86. 5 cm. The highest <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> from the defined patients with diabetes for men was 99. 0 cm, for women – 95 cm. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was to verify the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of the body mass index (BMI) <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) for the diagnosis of obesity in the elderly. A cross-sectional study was made with 180 healthy elderly subjects from Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Body fat percentage (%BF) was determined using DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry). The BMI <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> of the NSI offers better sensitivity and specificity for men (73. 7 % and 72. 5 % respectively). For women, the lower the <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> the better the sensitivity, with a BMI of 25 kg/m² (sensitivity of 76. 3 % and specificity of 100 %) being the most accurate for diagnosing obesity in elderly women. The WHO <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> offered very low sensitivity (28. 9 %). The results of this investigation lead {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> proposed by the WHO and the ones adopted by the NSI and by Lipschitz are not good indicators of obesity for the elderly of either sex, since they offer low sensitivity...|$|R
