Lanping County of Yunnan has a {{difficult}} used ore of high oxidation rate lead-zinc, lead mainly include <b>cerusite,</b> followed by galena, {{a small amount}} of phosphorus (arsenic) lead and lead chloride (iron) alum; Zinc mainly include hemimorphite,{{a small amount of}} sphalerite. grade of lead is 6. 83 %, zinc 4. 95 %, lead oxide ratio is 91. 74 %, zinc 98. 76 %, so the ore is a high oxidation rate of refractory lead-zinc. Through extensive testing, ultimately used flotation process. Through the closed-process,lead concentrate’s grade is 44. 98 %, zinc 1. 95 %, recovery of lead is 72. 62 %;zinc’s concentrate grade is 21. 20 %, lead 2. 50 %, zinc’s recovery is 69. 53 %, the experiment has a good result.

The main gangue minerals are calcite, limonite, quartz, sericite. The ore is high degree of oxidation and difficult to recycle. 1. Mineralogical studies The oxidation of the ore used in the experiments is from Lanping, Yunnan province.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the study (macroscopic and microscopic) of the {{transformation}} of classic silver ore (galena: PbS) and its evolution from a repository produced experimentally in a muffle furnace operating at charcoal. While the chemical reaction that leads from the sulfide lead bullion is identified for a long time, its reproduction in a reactor bottom furnace remains unsatisfactory and attempts to understand the transformation processes of the galena remain largely unsuccessful. This lack of mastery of the process blocks possible reflections on material balances and weight mining in ancient economies including matters related to the circulation of lead. Thus two great moments in this production line must be better understood: the roasting phase of galena and the reduction into lead. To reach these objectives, µRaman spectroscopy provides a complementary view of the macroscopy approach to processing the silver galena especially to identify the various chemical species of lead (oxides, sulfates, oxysulfates, carbonates) formed during the transformation of galena. The transformation of the mineral occurs in the following steps: appearance of elemental sulfur and sulfates in the first minutes; reduction of sulfates {{in favor of the}} emergence of lead oxides; further reduction of sulfates with the appearance of <b>cerusite...</b>|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{a yellow}} layer of lead {{chromate}} mixed with linseed oil was found under the gold leaf. For {{the application of}} gold surfaces, pieces of gold leaf {{are attached to the}} desired areas using an adhesive, mordant such as linseed oil, lead white, verdigris, varnish and bole [6 – 8]. The gilding is traditionally made with a thin piece of gold metal leaf applied to a gypsum layer and covered with a red or ochre layer of bole. In previous works, we observed in sculptures, altarpieces, etc. that the gold leaf was usually applied onto a bole. The bole is a mixture of clay minerals, iron oxides and organic compounds, such as oils. In addition, the bole is unctuous and capable of being polished. It has served, since early mediaeval times, as a ground for gilding [35]. For carved decorative pieces, a linseed oil added with a pigment, such as lead white, or coloured pigments was used as the support. In the study of four 17 th century Albanian icons [36], gold powder was used in the mixture with pigments containing Ca, Fe and Pb for creating yellow tonalities. On Greek icons from the 16 th century [37], the gold leaf was attached to the support using animal glue mixed with yellow bole. Pararealgar was found between two layers of gilding in other Greek icons [38]. Yellow bole was also detected in Cretan icons from the 17 th century [39]. Yellow support made from Pb-Sn was found in mural paintings from Northern Italy [40]. We have also detected complex mixtures in the gilding of ceramic and stone sculptures composed of compounds such as minium, hydrocerusite, <b>cerusite</b> and linseed oil [8].|$|E
40|$|Grains of {{pyrochlore}} {{and secondary}} phases from tailings of Silver Crater Mine in Bancroft, Ontario (Canada) {{have been studied}} to understand the alteration processes, redox conditions, and retention of pyrochlore-derived species (U, Ti, Nb, Pb, Ta, REE) in near-field environments. Alteration processes are documented by the formation of two types of co-existing secondary veins associated with primary apatite and calcite: (i) amorphous Fe-rich veins, 46 - 75 wt. % of FeO, and ~ 500 ppm of UO 2, and (ii) crystalline calcite-rich veins, found in fractures and penetrating the pyrochlore. Based on electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), the chemical composition of the pyrochlore is: (Ca 0. 84 U 0. 35 Fe 0. 20 Na 0. 09 Pb 0. 04 Ln 0. 04 Mn 0. 03 Sr 0. 01 Th 0. 01 Mg 0. 01) 1. 62 (Nb 1. 00 Ti 0. 87 Ta 0. 10 Si 0. 02) 2. 0 O 6. 5 F 0. 14. Elemental mapping revealed that migration of liberated U, Pb, Nb, Ta, Ti, and REE, is confined to the secondary veins of Fe-rich and calcite-rich compositions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) results showed that pyrochlore contains nanoparticulate inclusions of uraninite, galena, and magnetite, while secondary veins host betafite, magnetite, Pb 0, <b>cerusite,</b> and 10 Å mica nanoparticles (NPs). Randomly oriented uraninite NPs, 15 nm in size, concentrate around pores, 50 - 100 nm in size, in the pyrochlore. In the Fe-rich veins, HAADF-STEM images revealed that U, Pb, Nb, and Ti were sequestered {{in the form of}} spherical betafite NPs, < 800 nm in size, with composition: (Ca 1. 1 Fe 0. 35 Pb 0. 28 U 0. 09) 1. 83 (Ti 1. 56 Nb 0. 44) 2. 0 O 6. 1. The association of betafite NPs, magnetite, and Pb 0 NPs in Fe-rich and calcite-rich veins indicates reducing conditions during alteration of pyrochlore and immobilization of pyrochlore derived elements. This observation combined with identification of nanoscale galena and magnetite in pyrochlore, and the association of Pb 0 and Fe 3 O 4 in veins, indicate relatively low fS 2 and fO 2 conditions during pyrochlore alteration. In spite of prolonged exposure (≥ 20 years) to atmospheric conditions, pyrochlore and betafite NPs retained < 25 wt. % and < 6 wt. % of UO 2, respectively; and no secondary uranyl phases were observed. The alteration of pyrochlore most likely began with metamictization, followed by volume swelling, fracturing and surface interactions with fluids that caused mobilization of major and minor elements. The occurrence of amorphous Fe-rich material {{on the surface of the}} pyrochlore suggests that amorphous gels could form in Fe-rich environments as an alteration product of crystalline waste forms. The nano-geochemical complexity of the samples investigated here suggests that there is a significant nano-scale component to the sequestration of actinides during the alteration of natural and likely synthetic materials...|$|E
