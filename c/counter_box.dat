40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a threshold type aerogel Čerenkov counter with a large sensitive area of 0. 6 m 2 to be carried onboard the BESS rigidity spectrometer to detect cosmic-ray antiprotons. The design incorporates a large diffusion box containing 46 finemesh photomultipliers, with special attention being paid to achieving good performance under a magnetic field and providing sufficient endurance while minimizing material usage. The refractive index of the aerogel was chosen to be 1. 03. By utilizing the muons and protons accumulated during the cosmic-ray measurements at sea level, a rejection factor of 104 was obtained against muons with β ≈ 1, while keeping 97 % efficiency for protons below the threshold.

40|$|M any {{projects}} in the Louisville Dis-trict have cooperative agreements with local sheriff departments for patrol of recreation areas during high-use peri-ods. In recent years, several of these projects have used watchman’s clocks to document the activity and move-ments of deputies patrolling {{within the scope of}} these agreements. The clocks produce a record showing the location and exact time a deputy makes his patrol. Each location has a key with a differ-ent number. The keys are chained inside our traffic <b>counter</b> <b>boxes</b> to pro-tect them from vandalism or removal. Each deputy has a clock. When he enters the recreation area, the deputy inserts the key in the clock and turns it. This prints the time and location number on the tape. Each Monday the sheriff’s secretary opens the clock with a special control key and removes the printed portion of the tape [...] Pen-and-ink entries are made on the tape to show the beginning and ending dates. (Newer model clocks print the date with the time and location.) Each time the clock is opened, a record is made on the tape. Four lakes are currently using the clocks at 20 sta-tions in 9 counties. The only malfunctions have been dead batteries. Replacing the standard D-cell battery and paper tape periodically has kept the clocks functioning properly for 5 years. Batteries should be removed during the off-season to protect the clocks from leakage and corrosion. The initial investment was $ 315 per clock plus $ 12. 50 for tape for a season. This record can provide useful information to the sheriffs and project personnel. Each summer, com-plaints are received from disgruntled visitors alleg-ing inadequate patrolling of an area, allowing loud parties, etc., to continue all night. The tapes can be used to refute these allegations. The record also provides useful documentation for future audits. There are many instances of depu-ties working when no Government representatives are on duty to verify their performance. This rec-ord protects deputies from false accusations con-cerning when or where they patrolled...|$|R

40|$|We present 2 {{years of}} NOx {{observations}} from the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory {{located in the}} tropical Atlantic boundary layer. We find that NOx mixing ratios peak around solar noon (at 20 - 30 pptV depending on season), which is <b>counter</b> to <b>box</b> model simulations that show a midday minimum due to OH conversion of NO 2 to HNO 3. Production of NOx via decomposition of organic nitrogen species and the photolysis of HNO 3 appear insufficient to provide the observed noontime maximum. A rapid photolysis of nitrate aerosol to produce HONO and NO 2, however, is able to simulate the observed diurnal cycle. This would make it the dominant source of NOx at this remote marine boundary layer site, overturning the previous paradigm according to which the transport of organic nitrogen species, such as PAN, is the dominant source. We show that observed mixing ratios (November-December 2015) of HONO at Cape Verde (∼ 3. 5 pptV peak at solar noon) are consistent with this route for NOx production. Reactions between the nitrate radical and halogen hydroxides which have been postulated in the literature appear to improve the box model simulation of NOx. This rapid conversion of aerosol phase nitrate to NOx changes our perspective of the NOx cycling chemistry in the tropical marine boundary layer, suggesting a more chemically complex environment than previously thought...|$|R

50|$|Members of {{the public}} can buy a ticket at a ticket window or <b>counter,</b> called a <b>box</b> office in the {{entertainment}} industry (this term is also used for the total receipts). The ticket check may also be there, or it may be separate. Tickets may also be available from resellers, which typically are commercial enterprises that purchase tickets in bulk, and resell them to members {{of the public}}, adding a surcharge. Consumers buy from resellers for reasons of convenience and availability. The convenience factor relates to being able to obtain tickets locally, and also being able to make alternate selections on the spot if the preferred performance is not available. The availability factor relates to the fact that all tickets may have been sold out at the box office, requiring the purchaser to either obtain tickets from the reseller, or not to see the show (or at least not see the particular performance of choice).|$|R
40|$|The Box Counting {{algorithm}} {{is a well-known}} method for the computation of the fractal dimension of an image. It is often implemented using a recursive subdivision of the image into a set of regular tiles or boxes. Parallel implementations often try to map the boxes to different compute units, and combine the results to get {{the total number of}} boxes intersecting a shape. This paper presents a novel and highly efficient method using OpenCL kernels to perform the computation on a per-pixel basis. The mapping and reduction stages are performed in a single pass, and therefore require the enqueuing of only a single kernel. Each instance of the kernel updates the information pertaining to all the boxes containing the pixel, and simultaneously increments the <b>box</b> <b>counters</b> at multiple levels, thereby eliminating the need for another pass to perform the summation. The complete implementation and coding details of the proposed method are outlined. The performance of the method on different processors are analysed with respect to varying image sizes...|$|R

Each box [...] for [...] and [...] has size in complex coordinates of [...] and , where [...] and [...] for an image of width [...] and height [...] For each <b>box,</b> a corresponding <b>counter</b> is initialized to zero. Next, a random sampling of [...] points are iterated through the Mandelbrot function. For points which do escape within a chosen maximum number of iterations, and therefore {{are not in the}} Mandelbrot set, the <b>counter</b> for each <b>box</b> entered during the escape to infinity is incremented by 1. In other words, for each sequence corresponding to [...] that escapes, for each point [...] during the escape, the box that [...] lies within is incremented by 1. Points which do not escape within the maximum number of iterations (and considered to be in the Mandelbrot set) are discarded. After a large number of [...] values have been iterated, grayscale shades are then chosen based on the distribution of values recorded in the array. The result is a density plot highlighting regions where [...] values spend the most time on their way to infinity.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation focuses on the measurement and analysis of subjective probability distributions over stochastic outcomes, a central issue {{in the study of}} decision-making under uncertainty. The empirical setting is rural Tanzania, where the degrees of risk and uncertainty characterizing both human capital and productive investment decisions are exacerbated by widespread dependence on rain-fed agriculture, inadequate social safety nets, and a poorly developed information infrastructure. I present a sequence of methodological, theoretical and empirical chapters in which I estimate subjective returns distributions in an existing data set, develop and explain a new method of collecting subjective distributions data, characterize the information content of the data collected, and make use of the data to estimate a structural agricultural production model. Chapter 1 explores the role of estimated, rather than measured, subjective returns to education in schooling choice decisions. Using an existing panel survey from Tanzania, I estimate earnings-education distributions separately for 1991, 2004 and 2010. I then use individual-level predictions of the first two moments of the earnings distribution to estimate a random effects probit model on binary enrollment decisions for school-aged children in the years 1991 - 1994. I find that the returns to education have been and remain high for women, while for men the returns increased over the twenty study years to nearly match those of women. In addition, the probability of enrollment is increasing in the subjective conditional expectation of earnings, and decreasing in the subjective conditional variance of earnings. Chapter 2 describes the phone-based survey method that I used to gather subjective probability distributions data from a sample of Tanzanian cotton farmers. I describe the various technical issues faced in the implementation of this method, outline the lessons learned and the numerous refinements made {{over the course of the}} study, and speculate on the feasibility of phone-based data collection in other settings in low income countries. In Chapter 3, I analyze the information content of subjective distributions data gathered in the way that has become standard in development economics, i. e., by having respondents allocate a fixed number of <b>counters</b> to <b>boxes</b> that represent the intervals of a histogram. I use inference about the respondents' choice problem to analyze the partial identification of the underlying belief. I provide bounds on the density in subsets of intervals, provide bounds on the underlying CDF, define the joint identification region for the measure vector, and develop and implement a feasible numerical method for jointly bounding the moments of the unobserved distribution. I also provide simulation evidence for the optimal design of survey instruments and the optimal way to approximate these data with smooth distributions. Lastly, Chapter 4 makes use of the regularly spaced within-season measures of subjective yield and price distributions collected from Tanzanian cotton farmers to study the farmer's dynamic resource allocation problem. Using these data, I develop a novel method for estimating a stochastic production function when error parameters are observed at the plot-level throughout the cultivation season...|$|R
2500|$|Following a protest, the World Boxing Organization named Cázares the {{mandatory}} challenger for the championship. The event {{was scheduled for}} August 30, 2008. Calderón entered the ring dressed as a matador in reference to his boxing style, which propiciated [...] "Olé" [...] chants from the public. In the early stages, the fight's pattern {{was similar to the}} first meeting. Calderón relied on <b>counter</b> punching while <b>boxing</b> to avoid Cázares' offensive. Late in the first round, the challenger fell following a combination, but the referee declared that it was an accidental slip. In the following rounds, Cázares tried pressuring in the offensive, but Calderón continued boxing and held his opponent if approached. The challenger was momentarily stunned by an uppercut in the final seconds of the third episode. Cázares' technique in the next two rounds consisted of throwing punches to the body, while his offensive to the head was being stopped by his opponent's forearms. In the sixth round, Calderón focused on his defense, slowing the pace of his offensive. In the seventh episode, an accidental head clash opened a laceration in Calderón's forehead. Who was examined by the ringside doctor, after expressing that he was feeling disoriented. The physician recommended stopping the fight. Due to the circumstances, the outcome was decided by the judges' score cards, which favored Calderón 67-66 and 68-65 twice. Following the event, he announced his intention to participate in a unification match against one of the other light flyweight champions. Due to the nature of this injury, the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission prohibited Calderón participation in any card within 120 days. Two weeks after the contest, the wound was reopened and he underwent plastic surgery to prevent reinjury. On September 23, 2008, Peter Rivera announced that Calderón was expected to return between January and February 2009. Rivera noted that the fight would be against one of the other light flyweight champions, most likely [...] César Canchila, citing that although both Ulises Solís and Edgar Sosa were approached, with both claiming to be available, neither one actually pursued serious negotiations. He subsequently stated that negotiations had been extended to Solís' representatives, but that those of Sosa still declined, citing that [...] " [...] is a fighter that has always refused to fight with Iván. His managers don't want to sacrifice him and prefer to keep him in Mexico competing in soft fights." [...] In the meanwhile, he received a homage as part of the Dominican Parade in San Juan, serving as Padrino Internacional (lit. [...] "International Godfather") along Juan Manuel López.|$|R
