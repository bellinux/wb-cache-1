40|$|Children's {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} number, i. e. number sense, {{is associated with}} individual differences in mathematics achievement. To investigate the causal association between number sense, traditionally assessed with <b>comparison</b> or number <b>line</b> estimation tasks, and mathematics achievement, often assessed with an arithmetic test, an intervention study was conducted that aimed at training either <b>comparison</b> or number <b>line</b> estimation skills. We contrasted a <b>comparison</b> and number <b>line</b> estimation training. By doing so, we wanted {{to address the question}} which intervention had the largest effect on arithmetic. In addition, such a direct comparison between <b>comparison</b> and number <b>line</b> estimation trainings would allow us to get more insight in the association between both tasks. Participants were 151 five-year-olds that were randomly allocated to either an experimental condition (i. e. <b>comparison</b> or number <b>line</b> estimation) or one of the two control conditions (i. e., active control condition and empty control condition) in a pretest-posttest design measuring number knowledge, (non-) symbolic <b>comparison</b> and number <b>line</b> estimation and arithmetic. The results showed that both <b>comparison</b> and number <b>line</b> estimation trainings had a positive effect on arithmetic. However, the absence of transfer effects from one task to another, also suggested that <b>comparison</b> and number <b>line</b> estimation rely on different mechanisms and probably influence arithmetic through different mechanisms. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|With {{isolated}} binocular targets, {{the best}} depth discrimination {{is found in}} the fixation plane (Blakemore, C., Journal of Physiology 211 (1970) 599). More recent studies have suggested that stereoscopic thresholds are not always a simple function of absolute disparity, but depend on the relative disparities in the stimulus. Here, we explored the effects of relative disparity in more detail, taking particular care to control for the possibility that subjects might change their binocular eye position or exploit monocular information provided by additional reference cues. Subjects judged the depth of a vertical target line presented above a <b>comparison</b> <b>line</b> in a blank window within a fronto-parallel reference surface composed of randomly positioned dots. On individual trials, the reference surface was presented at one of three disparities (- 10, 0 and + 10 arc min). To control for changes in binocular eye position, exposure duration was 150 ms, and experimental conditions with different disparities of the reference surface and <b>comparison</b> <b>line</b> were randomly interleaved. To control for monocular cues, changes in threshold were determined with respect to a disparity noise condition that was in all ways identical to the reference plane condition, except that the disparities of the dots were randomly assigned between 10 and + 10 arc min. Stereo-thresholds were lowered by a factor of about 2 when the surface was at the same depth as the <b>comparison</b> <b>line.</b> Thresholds were also lowered when the comparison disparity was close to the same depth as the reference surface, but were often raised when the comparison disparity had the opposite disparity sign. These results provide unequivocal evidence that the fundamental sensitivity of the disparity detecting system can be influenced by relative disparity cues that are not related to the task...|$|E

40|$|Perhaps surprisingly, {{given the}} {{importance}} of conformity as a theoretical construct in social psychology and the profound implications autism has for social function, little research has been done on whether autism is associated with the propensity to conform to a social majority. This study is a modern, child-friendly implementation of the classic Asch conformity studies. The performance of 15 children with autism was compared to that of 15 typically developing children on a line judgement task. Children were matched for age, gender and numeracy and literacy ability. In each trial, the child had to say which of three lines a <b>comparison</b> <b>line</b> matched in length. On some trials, children were misled as to what most people thought the answer was. Children with autism were much less likely to conform in the misleading condition than typically developing children. This finding was replicated using a continuous measure of autism traits, the Autism Quotient questionnaire, which showed that autism traits negatively correlated with likelihood to conform in the typically developing group. This study demonstrates the resistance of children with autism to social pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{irradiation}} {{of selective}} regions in a polymer gel dosimeter {{results in an}} increase in optical density and refractive index (RI) at those regions. An optical tomography-based dosimeter depends on rayline path through the dosimeter to estimate and reconstruct the dose distribution. The refraction of light passing through a dose region results in artefacts in the reconstructed images. These refraction errors are dependant on the scanning geometry and collection optics. We developed a fully 3 D image reconstruction algorithm, algebraic reconstruction technique-refraction correction (ART-rc) that corrects for the refractive index mismatches present in a gel dosimeter scanner not only at the boundary, but also for any rayline refraction due to multiple dose regions inside the dosimeter. In this study, simulation and experimental studies have been carried out to reconstruct a 3 D dose volume using 2 D CCD measurements taken for various views. The study also focuses on the effectiveness of using different refractive-index matching media surrounding the gel dosimeter. Since the optical density is assumed to be low for a dosimeter, the filtered backprojection is routinely used for reconstruction. We carry out the reconstructions using conventional algebraic reconstruction (ART) and refractive index corrected ART (ART-rc) algorithms. The reconstructions based on FDK algorithm for cone-beam tomography has also been carried out for <b>comparison.</b> <b>Line</b> scanners and point detectors, are used to obtain reconstructions plane by plane. The rays passing through dose region with a RI mismatch does not reach the detector in the same plane depending on the angle of incidence and RI. In the fully 3 D scanning setup using 2 D array detectors, light rays that undergo refraction are still collected and hence can still be accounted for in the reconstruction algorithm. It is found that, for the central region of the dosimeter, the usable radius using ART-rc algorithm with water as RI matched medium is 71. 8 %, an increase of 6. 4 % compared to that achieved using conventional ART algorithm. Smaller diameter dosimeters are scanned with dry air scanning by using a wide-angle lens that collects refracted light. The images reconstructed using cone beam geometry is seen to deteriorate in some planes as those regions are not scanned. Refraction correction is important and needs to be taken in to consideration to achieve quantitatively accurate dose reconstructions. Refraction modeling is crucial in array based scanners as {{it is not possible to}} identify refracted rays in the sinogram space...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} found a {{relation}} between, on the one hand, the performance in magnitude <b>comparison</b> and number <b>line</b> estimation tasks and, on the other hand, mathematical ability.

To investigate the relations between magnitude <b>comparison,</b> number <b>line</b> estimation and mathematical ability more directly, we conducted an intervention study in which either <b>comparison</b> or number <b>line</b> estimation was trained in kindergartners, and examined (a) whether training on one skill could be generalized to the other skill (Experiment 1), and (b) whether training also led to improved arithmetic ability (Experiment 2).

Results concerning transfer effects to arithmetic ability will be available at the conference (Experiment 2). status: publishe...|$|R
