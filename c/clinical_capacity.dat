40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2004 In the mid 1980 s, {{education}} {{associated with}} the requirement for registration as a Nurse in the State of Victoria moved from a hospital-based system into the university setting. This move brought with it many and varied requirements for change within the health care setting. The students of nursing were now no longer {{a part of the}} workforce, they were transient visitors in the patient care setting with very specific clinical requirements to be met; and they were there for less time! This research project is not about whether this change in preparation should have occurred. It is well accepted amongst the profession that this was necessary to raise the status of the nursing professional. We now have registered nurses with a primary degree in nursing or health science. The question here however, is what <b>clinical</b> <b>capacities</b> do the newly graduates and registered nurses have when they enter the clinical workforce, and what <b>clinical</b> <b>capacities</b> are required by the health care institutions that are employing them. Have these institutions an accurate and realistic knowledge of the <b>clinical</b> <b>capacities</b> of the newly graduated registered nurses they employ? This research concentrated on the self-perceived and reported <b>clinical</b> <b>capacities</b> of newly graduated registered nurses as they entered the clinical environment and the <b>clinical</b> <b>capacities</b> required by the clinical areas that employed them. Clinical congruence was then measured between these two sources. The findings demonstrated that in a supported environment, where graduates can expect and receive clinical support and mentorship, clinical congruence:is likely to be achieved. However, in an environment where clinical skills are required to be undertaken at an unsupervised level, there were a significant number of distinct clinical skills for which the graduates report unpreparedness. Graduates and Nurse Managers alike agreed that increased clinical experience during the undergraduate preparation time is optimal, but the universities indicated that the fiscal and chronological constraints of a three-year degree program, in an environment where there is a cost incurred for the clinical experience, is difficult to achieve. This research demonstrates, in a tangible way, the need for a supported Graduate Transition Program to facilitate the consolidation and / or achievement of clinical competency for the graduates as they enter the workforce. This support will assist in ensuring the maintenance of a dynamic nursing workforce into the 21 st century {{to meet the needs of}} the Victorian community at a time when it is most vulnerable during the period of ill health.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Physiotherapy) - MSc(Physio) Zambia is {{undergoing}} epidemiological changes from communicable diseases to NCDs {{as a result}} of demographic transition and hence Stroke is an emerging NCD in the country. The process of care of stroke in Zambia as country is unknown. Exploring the process of care of stroke in Zambia, could help understand the gaps in service delivery thereby helping to create interventions to improve stroke service delivery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine and explore the process of care of stroke in Zambia. As there is no information regarding stroke care in Zambia, the study aimed to explore and determine the process of care and explore the conditions under which diagnosis and management of stroke is done in Zambia and are the factors influencing stroke diagnosis and management in Zambia. The study was conducted in Zambia’s five general hospitals which were selected conveniently. The study consisted of both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative part consisted of stroke patients’ medical records reviews, who were admitted to general hospitals between 1 st January to 3 oth October 2014. A sample of 80 medical records was selected randomly from each general hospital, making the total of 400 medical records from all the hospitals. Data was collected using a checklist which was specifically design for the study after literature review and contained stroke care processes including diagnosis, medical management, rehabilitation, lifestyle management and community linkage. Analysis of quantitative data was done using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22. The qualitative part consisted of individual in-depth interviews with a purposefully selected sample of three health workers from each hospital making 15 health workers. The in-depth interviews were based on predetermined themes including staffing levels, multidisciplinary team action, treatment guidelines, <b>clinical</b> <b>capacity,</b> planning and budgeting and technical environment. All the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and the predetermined themes were analysed using content analysis. Ethical clearance to conduct the study was obtained from the University of the Western Cape Faculty Board Research and Ethics Committees and Senate Research Committee and ERES Converge in Zambia. Permission to conduct the study in Zambia was obtained from the Ministry of Health, Zambia. Informed consent was obtained from the health workers who took part in the study. The study found that the stroke process of care in Zambia ranged from diagnosis through to physical rehabilitation and lifestyle management. The stroke process of care was challenged in the area of diagnosis using biochemistry, haematology, CT scan, MRI and Angiography etc. The process of care in rehabilitation was challenged by lack of gadgets and space to use in rehabilitation. Community linkage, speech therapy and social welfares services were not part of the stroke process of care in Zambia as the study as established. Staff shortages, busy schedules, no treatment guidelines, poor <b>clinical</b> <b>capacity,</b> lack of resources and poor technical environment impacted negatively on the stroke process of care according to this study. Diagnosis and management of stroke was made with no treatment guidelines, poor <b>clinical</b> <b>capacity</b> and poor technical environment. The same were the factors which were influencing diagnosis and management namely staff shortages, no multidisciplinary teams due to busy schedules of health workers, lack of treatment guidelines, poor <b>clinical</b> <b>capacity</b> by health workers, lack of resources for stroke and poor technical environment. Using the Chi-square association of variables, the study showed that CT scan was associated with definitive diagnosis with the p-value of 0. 000.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} publications analysing geographical trends in Australian HIV incidence, diagnosis and clinical service provision. In Chapter two, estimates of HIV incidence among {{men who have sex}} with men are presented using national case reporting surveillance data and a modified statistical back-projection method. It was found that HIV diagnoses in Australia reflected changes in estimated incidence to 2000, and revealed an increase in Queensland in the subsequent ten years. In Chapter three, a study is presented to identify clinical opportunities for targeting HIV testing, by Local Health District of NSW. The Australian HIV database was linked to cancer diagnoses, notifiable condition diagnoses, emergency department presentations and hospital admissions for all HIV diagnoses between 1993 and 2012 in NSW. Date of HIV acquisition was estimated from back-projection models. Sexually transmitted infection diagnoses (particularly gonorrhoea) and some hospital admissions (mental health and non-infective digestive disorder diagnoses) were common among people estimated to be living with undiagnosed HIV. People with these diagnoses could be targeted for increased HIV testing to facilitate earlier and efficient HIV diagnosis. A retrospective analysis of HIV <b>clinical</b> service <b>capacity</b> records in Australia is presented in Chapter four. The number of hospital departments, sexual health services, general practitioners and shared-care services providing expertise in HIV management from 2007 to 2010 was obtained from the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine. There was a decreasing supply of HIV <b>clinical</b> service <b>capacity</b> in Australia despite increasing numbers of people living with HIV (PLHIV). This is extended in Chapter five by elucidating more precisely the number and location of the HIV <b>clinical</b> workforce <b>capacity</b> to enable service planning. A survey of HIV services was conducted and novel geostatistical analysis was used to identify significant regions of clinical service undersupply, relative to the estimated number of PLHIV in 2010 and 2020. In 2010, an estimated 9. 7 % of all PLHIV resided in regions more than 15 km from a HIV clinical service provider. By 2020, this is estimated to rise to 11. 5 %.

40|$|Introduction | Guaranteeing the {{capacity}} of laboratories to generate reliable and accurate data is vital for successful <b>clinical</b> research. <b>Capacity</b> strengthening is not only acquisition of modern equipment and reagents but also sustained commitment to training, quality, and biosafety. Through an EDCTP capacity building grant, ICRH-Kenya undertook projects to improve <b>clinical</b> trial <b>capacity.</b> Key laboratory capacity building activities are summarised. Methods | A holistic approach was taken to strengthen infrastructure, equipment, training, and testing capacity. Local and/or sustainable solutions were preferred and were executed with GCLP-compliance and a long-term goal of accreditation in mind. Results | A spacious building was refurbished to house the laboratory, and then equipped with an access control system, reliable electricity and water backups, a state-of-the-art communication infrastructure serving staff and a temperature e-monitoring system. Equipment acquired includes: ultra low temperature freezers fitted with temperature e-monitoring auto-dial system, autoclave, real-time and conventional thermal cyclers. Training designed to establish capacity so that the laboratory is subsequently able to do/renew its own trainings, was done on biosafety, quality management systems, and GCLP. High-quality tests for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HSV- 2, HIV- 1 viral load, and HPV genotyping, among others, were set up. Conclusion | Overall, the laboratory experienced manifest capacity growth resulting in augmented staff competence and confi dence and an expanded test repertoire. Improved appreciation of safety and quality {{led to the formation}} of a safety committee, and the preparation of safety and quality manuals.

Fifty health care workers were included in seven focus groups, comprising midwives, laboratory technicians, clinical and medical officers, junior and senior nurses, and medical doctors. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded through a data-driven approach for qualitative content analysis. Nineteen different POC tests were identified as currently being in use. While participants displayed being widely accustomed to and appreciative of the use of POC tests, they also assessed the use and characteristics of current tests as imperfect. An ideal POC test was characterized as being adapted to local conditions, thoughtfully implemented in the specific health system, and capable of improving the care of patients. Tests for specific medical conditions were requested. Opinions differed with regard to the ideal distribution of POC tests in the local health system. POC tests are commonly used and greatly appreciated in this study setting. However, there are dissatisfactions with current POC tests and their use.
