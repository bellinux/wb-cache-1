Viscoelastic <b>cohesive</b> <b>zones</b> are employed within the framework of a finite element code to model a two-phase particle-reinforced composite material consisting of a relatively stiff aggregate embedded in a copolymer binder. The composite of interest, LX 17, is noted to have a very large aggregate volume fraction and as such, Voronoi tessellation has been used to generate aggregate grain boundaries within finite element meshes along which viscoelastic <b>cohesive</b> <b>zones</b> have been embedded to model the binder. It has been observed experimentally that the majority of damage in LX 17 occurs within the binder, and thus, a damage evolution law has been applied to the viscoelastic <b>cohesive</b> <b>zones</b> that is phenomenological in nature. The responses obtained for the composite from the FEM analysis are then compared to the experimental data compiled by Lawrence Livermore National Labs for various constant strain rate tests conducted by Groves and Cunningham (2000). In addition, comparisons are made to a previous effort at modeling LX 17 in an endeavor to demonstrate the improved effectiveness in the modeling of granular composites using viscoelastic <b>cohesive</b> <b>zones</b> with damage.

40|$|AbstractMethodology for {{analysis}} of meso-structure effects on longer-scale mechanical response of concrete is developed. Efficient algorithms for particle generation and packing are proposed to represent 3 D meso-structures as collections of discrete features distributed randomly in a continuous phase. Specialised to concrete, the continuous phase represents mortar, while the features are aggregates and voids. Intra- and inter-phase <b>cohesive</b> <b>zones</b> are used for failure initiation and crack propagation. A Monte Carlo approach is proposed to analyse the effects of meso-structure geometrical (volume density, size distribution and shape of features) and physical (strength and energy of <b>cohesive</b> <b>zones)</b> properties, whereas a number of model realisations with identical properties are used for statistical analysis. The results present the relative significance of each meso-structure parameter for the emergent load capacity (tensile strength), damage evolution via micro-crack coalescence and macro-crack patterns, and failure energy density (toughness) of concrete. The proposed methodology is an effective tool for meso-structure optimisation {{in the design of}} concrete structures with prescribed requirements for strength and toughness...|$|R

40|$|Multi-layered {{electronic}} packages {{increase in}} complexity with demands for functionality. Interfacial delamination remains a prominent failure mechanism due to mismatch of {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE). Numerous studies have investigated interfacial cracking in microelectronic packages using fracture mechanics, which requires knowledge of starter crack locations and crack propagation paths. <b>Cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> {{theory has been}} identified as an alternative method for modeling crack propagation and delamination without the need for a pre-existing crack. In a <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> approach, traction forces between surfaces are related to the crack tip opening displacement and are governed by a traction-separation law. Unlike traditional fracture mechanics approaches, <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> analyses can predict starter crack locations and directions or simulate complex geometries with more than one type of interface. In a <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> model, <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> elements are placed along material interfaces. Parameters that define <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> behavior must be experimentally determined to be able to predict delamination propagation in a microelectronic package. The objective of this work is to study delamination propagation in a copper/mold compound interface through <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> modeling.

A {{comparison}} between the prediction of crack propagation through an adhesive interface based on a fracture mechanics approach and a <b>cohesive</b> <b>zone</b> approach is presented.
