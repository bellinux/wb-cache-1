40|$|International audienceAll humans, {{regardless}} of their culture and education, possess an intuitive understanding of number. Behavioural evidence suggests that numerical competence may be present early on in infancy. Here, we present brain-imaging evidence for distinct <b>cerebral</b> <b>coding</b> of number and object identity in 3 -mo-old infants. We compared the visual event-related potentials evoked by unforeseen changes either in the identity of objects forming a set, or in the cardinal of this set. In adults and 4 -y-old children, number sense relies on a dorsal system of bilateral intraparietal areas, different from the ventral occipitotemporal system sensitive to object identity. Scalp voltage topographies and cortical source modelling revealed a similar distinction in 3 -mo-olds, with changes in object identity activating ventral temporal areas, whereas changes in number involved an additional right parietoprefrontal network. These results underscore the developmental continuity of number sense by pointing to early functional biases in brain organization that may channel subsequent learning to restricted brain areas...|$|R

40|$|Phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} the primary {{structures}} of mammalian pancreatic-type ribonucleases, indicated that gene duplication events, which occurred during the evolution of ancestral ruminants, {{gave rise to the}} three paralogous enzymes present in the bovine species. Herein we report data that demonstrate the existence of the orthologues of the bovine pancreatic, seminal, and <b>cerebral</b> ribonucleases <b>coding</b> sequences in the genomes of giraffe and sheep. The ''seminal'' sequence is a pseudogene in both species. We also report an analysis of the transcriptional expression of ribonuclease genes in sheep tissues.

40|$|Identification {{of brain}} regions that {{differentially}} respond to pain intensity may improve {{our understanding of}} trigeminally mediated nociception. This report analyzed cortical responses to painless and painful electrical stimulation of a right human maxillary canine tooth. Functional magnetic resonance images were obtained during the application of five graded stimulus strengths, from below, at, and above the individually determined pain thresholds. Study participants reported each stimulus on a visual rating scale with respect to evoked sensation. Based on hemodynamic responses of all pooled stimuli, a cerebral network was identified that largely corresponds to the known lateral and medial nociceptive system. Further analysis of the five graded stimulus strengths revealed positive linear correlations for the anterior insula bilaterally, the contralateral (left) anterior mid-cingulate, as well as contralateral (left) pregenual cingulate cortices. <b>Cerebral</b> toothache intensity <b>coding</b> on a group level can thus be attributed to specific subregions within the cortical pain network...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} 732 {{children}} suffering from cerebral palsy from the South East Thames region (births from 1970 - 9) was ascertained {{at the end}} of 1989, and copies of death certificates of the 73 children who have died, aged 4 weeks to nearly 16 years, were obtained. Infantile <b>cerebral</b> palsy (ICD <b>Code</b> 343 -) was coded as the underlying cause of death in only 16 (22 %) cases. On 28 (38 %) certificates {{there was no mention of}} any form of cerebral palsy, the proportion in which it was not mentioned increasing with age. In 20 (28 %) cases the coded underlying cause of death was respiratory, hence in published national statistics the number of deaths from respiratory causes is inflated. A postmortem examination was known to have been performed in 23 cases, but the recorded information was in some cases limited to a 'terminal event'. The importance of good data on the death certificate, and the significance of published national statistics, need to be communicated to all those involved in the certification process if cerebral palsy and other chronic conditions, which raise the relative risk of death, are not to be under-represented...|$|R
30|$|Perception, therefore, {{reveals itself}} as an {{implicit}} preption {{of the body to}} respond and act, and a type of understanding springs from it whose nature is in fact eminently pragmatic and does not in itself determine any “semantic” representation of the object. Rather than being, for example, identified and recognised on the grounds of its form, meaning or function, in a word its belonging to an already classified, coded set, the said object would therefore be perceived and recognised simply as something that can be grasped by the hand. “F 5 and AIP neurons only respond to certain features of objects (their shape, size, inclination, etc.), and this selectivity is significant in that these features are interpreted as just as many systems of visual affordances and potential motor acts. Whereas the neurons populating the lower <b>cerebral</b> cortex areas <b>code</b> profiles, colours and wefts of objects, processing the information selected in images that, once memorised, would enable them to be recognised in their visual features. But is this enough to resolve the anatomical distinction between the ventral and dorsal routes in the functional opposition between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action? We do not think so – unless perception is reduced to an iconic representation of objects, the portrayal of a thing, independent from any where or how, and action reduced to an intention that discriminates between how and perhaps where, but {{has nothing to do with}} what. Unless, that is, the perceptive process is relegated to a mere identification of figures (ideas, in the literal sense of the word), corrected of any motor meaningfulness and raised to the rank of single possible vehicles of meaning, and the sense of the action broken up into a simple succession of movements in themselves devoid of any objective correlative” (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia 2006, p. 49 - 50).|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveCarotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{remains the}} gold {{standard}} for the treatment of carotid disease, with mortality rates generally at 0. 4 % to 1. 7 %. Controversy remains with regards to its role in the treatment of the high-risk surgical population. We developed a new clinical scale incorporating weighted risk factors into a single numerical score that correlates with the risk of in-hospital death after CEA. We propose that this tool may serve to prospectively identify the high-risk patient. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of 10 years (1994 to 2003) of the Maryland hospital discharge database. Included in the analysis were patients with (1) International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) procedure code 38. 12 (endarterectomy of the vessels {{of the head and neck}} other than intracranial vessels) in the primary coding position but not in any secondary position, or (2) Diagnosis Code 433. 00 to 433. 91 (occlusion/stenosis, precerebral artery), or (3) the Diagnosis-Related Group 5 (extracranial vascular procedure). ICD codes representing preoperative conditions of the patients were identified and evaluated with stepwise regression modeling techniques for association with in-hospital deaths. Different regression models were evaluated and compared by discriminative power as measured by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and goodness-of-fit to data as measured by r 2 and the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. A numeric index correlating with the risk of in-hospital death was constructed by rounding the correlation coefficients for the statistically significant variables from the logistic regression. ResultsWe identified 23, 237 cases. The mean age of patients was 70. 6 years, with 54. 7 % male patients. There were 125 in-hospital deaths (0. 54 %). Patient age and four patient medical conditions emerged with significant associations with in-hospital deaths after CEA, and their relationships can be summarized in a single diagnostic scale: 1 point for age ≥ 75, 2 points for atherosclerosis (ICD code 440), 3 points for cardiomyopathy (ICD code 425), 4 points for iron-deficiency anemia (ICD code 280), and 5 points for <b>cerebral</b> degeneration (ICD <b>code</b> 331). This scale has moderate discriminative power (ROC = 0. 67). On average, each point increase on this scale is associated with a 1. 58 -times increase in mortality risk, with score of 6 on the scale carrying a mortality risk > 5 %. ConclusionsThis new 5 -item scale, based on patient age and past medical history, correlates moderately with the rate of in-hospital death after CEA. This clinical index may serve to identify high-risk patients. Future improvements to this diagnostic scale should focus on the diagnostic values of additional laboratory and demographic data...|$|R
