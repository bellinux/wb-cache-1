40|$|Purpose: The {{content of}} and methods for {{collecting}} health information often vary across settings and challenge the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> health <b>information</b> across time, individuals or populations. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) contains an exhaustive set <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>information</b> which constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable {{as a reference}} for comparing health information. Methods and results: In two earlier papers, we have proposed rules for linking existing health information to the ICF. Further refinements to these existing ICF Linking Rules are {{presented in this paper}} to enhance the transparency of the linking process. The refinements involve preparing information for linking, perspectives from which information is collected and the categorization of response options. Issues regarding the linking <b>of</b> <b>information</b> not covered or unspecified within the ICF are also revisited in this paper. Conclusion: The ICF Linking Rules are valuable for enhancing <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> health <b>information</b> to ensure that information is available in a consistent manner to serve as a foundation for evidence-based decision-making across all levels of health systems. The refinements presented in this paper enhance transparency in, and ultimately reliability of the process <b>of,</b> linking health <b>information</b> to the ICF. Implications for Rehabilitation: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable as a reference for comparing health <b>information.</b> <b>Comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is essential to ensure that the widest range <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is available in a consistent manner for any decision-maker {{at all levels of the}} health system. The refined ICF Linking Rules presented in this article outline the method to establish <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> health <b>information</b> based on the ICF. <br/...|$|R

A common problem, which arises from monitoring, is how to relate information contained in data to the information needed by water resource management for decision-making. This is generally attempted through statistical analysis of the monitoring data. However, how the selection of methods with which to routinely analyze the data affects the quality and <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> produced is not as well understood as may first appear.

As a consequence, studies using TTO to value health states may share the core element of trading length of life for quality of life, but can differ considerably on many other elements. While this pluriformity in specifications advances the understanding of TTO from a methodological point of view, it also results in incomparable health state values. Health state values are applied in health technology assessments, and in that context <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is desired. In this article, we discuss several alternative specifications of TTO presented in the literature. The defining elements of these specifications are identified as being either methodological, procedural or analytical in nature. Where possible, it is indicated how these elements affect health state values (i. e., upward or downward). Finally, a checklist for TTO studies is presented, which incorporates a list of choices {{to be made by}} researchers who wish to perform a TTO task.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of IFRS by many countries worldwide fuels {{the expectation that}} financial accounting might become more comparable across countries. This expectation is opposed to an alternative view that {{stresses the importance of}} incentives in shaping accounting information. We provide early evidence on this debate by investigating the effects of mandatory IFRS adoption on the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> financial accounting <b>information</b> around the world. Our results suggest that while mandatory {{adoption of}} IFRS increases the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> some prominent balance sheet line items across countries, it has no clear effect on the cross-country <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> earnings attributes. To provide a rationale for these mixed findings, we investigate the IFRS measurement and disclosure compliance choices for a hand-collected sample of German and Italian firms. We find that predictable country-, region-, and firm-level incentives continue to shape the outcome of the financial reporting process and thus limit the crosssectional <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> financial accounting <b>information.</b> Overall, our results suggest that the mandatory adoption of IFRS has a limited impact on accounting comparability and that accounting information continues to be shaped by both reporting standards and incentives. international accounting, IFRS, comparability, accounting harmonization, earnings attributes, disclosure determinants, accounting incentives...|$|R

However the concern some authors have as to effective <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> depending {{on the possibility of}} disparate interpretations even with the use of identical standards, still persists. Thus, this study aims to identify how independent auditors of companies indexed in the CVM interpret four Brazilian Accounting Pronouncements, by means of a questionnaire adapted from Chand, Patel and Patel (2010). In addition, the research attempts to identify the association between the auditors’ interpretations and four variables (the size of the undertaking; familiarity with IFRS; experience with auditing; and experience with IFRS-related activities). Analysis was done via Chi-square Test, Correspondence Analysis (ANACOR) and Homogeneity Analysis (HOMALS). The results show a lack of consensus among auditors in the sample. It was noticed that interpretations of the three Brazilian Accounting Pronouncements were statistically distinct in function: the size of the undertaking, familiarity with IFRS, and experience with IFRS-related activities. In light of these results, it can be inferred that, within the use of the same standard, {{there is a possibility that}} Brazilian professionals have different interpretations and, therefore, make decisions that will produce non-comparable accounting reports...|$|R

A total of 1, 270 subjects each completed a telephone interview and a mailed questionnaire 1 month apart in 1999; 564 subjects received the interview first, and 706 received the mailed questionnaire first. Agreement between the two methods was 91. 2 % and 88. 6 % for whole-body skin examination by a physician in the last 12 months and the last 3 years, respectively, and 81. 9 % for whole-body skin self-examination in the last 12 months.

Design/methodology: For this study, we made a review of literature, about the position of POCAL (1999), the IPSAS of IPSASB, and doctrinal perspective, on the recognition of public assets. In addition, a study was made about the evolution of public assets values, in the years 2006 - 2013, of the total of 308 Portuguese municipalities, to conclude concerning the existence of difficulties in the recognition of these assets, and the need to adopt international standards. Findings: In Portugal, and in some municipalities, the inventory process is not yet complete, with difficulties as regards the recognition of BDP. These difficulties are {{due to the fact that}} the POCAL (1999) does not provide the requirements for the recognition of assets; problem exceeded in the IPSAS nº 17 of IPSASB (2006 b), to refer these requirements. Adopt a new Accounting Standards System applicable to Public Administration (SNC-AP), based on IPSAS, may be the solution to these questions, by introducing criteria to be taken into the recognition of assets, to ensure the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and heritage values of the Portuguese municipalities. Research limitations/implications: The inexistence of recognition criteria to be followed by municipalities has limitations in terms <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the values of the different components of assets presented by various municipalities.
