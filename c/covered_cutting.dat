Pearson's aim in promoting this plan was to facilitate the improvement of the social conditions of City workers by enabling them to commute into London on cheap trains from new residential developments of good quality, cheap homes built outside the capital.

50|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.In 1846, Pearson proposed {{with the support of the}} City Corporation a central railway station for London located in Farringdon that was estimated to cost £1 million (approximately £ today).

40|$|Abstract. The EBH 300 Roadheader {{is one of}} the {{important}} equipment in laneway excavation of coal mine. It composed of mechanical, hydraulic, electrical and control systems, and <b>covered</b> <b>cutting,</b> shipment and travelling. Because of its hard working conditions, the complex cutting force and load fluctuation and vibration during the working process, the mechanical parts design plays very important roll to the EBH 300 Roadheader. The 3 D models of the EBH 300 Roadheader were built based on the engineering prototype. The mechanical characteristics were studied for further development, which included mechanical structure, the vibration modes of the cutting parts, maximum amplitudes by modal analysis. According to the result, more attention must be paid to the complex force condition, violent and irregular vibration of the cutting parts in the design...|$|E

5000|$|Lennon's quote was {{featured}} in a 3 July article in The New York Times Magazine and provoked no reaction. However, in late July, when Datebook republished the interviews, art editor Art Unger chose to put Lennon's quote about Christianity on the front <b>cover,</b> <b>cutting</b> the prose before it. In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about the quotation from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me. I {{am not going to}} play the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|R
