5|$|American {{economist}} and former <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician and <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding {{did not believe}} it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E
