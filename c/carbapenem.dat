25|$|Resistance to {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics {{has become}} a particular problem in recent decades, as strains of bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have become more common. These beta-lactamase enzymes make many, if not all, of the penicillins and cephalosporins ineffective as therapy. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing E. coli (ESBL E. coli) are highly resistant to an array of antibiotics, and infections by these strains are difficult to treat. In many instances, only two oral antibiotics and a very limited group of intravenous antibiotics remain effective. In 2009, a gene called New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (shortened NDM-1) that even gives resistance to intravenous antibiotic <b>carbapenem,</b> were discovered in India and Pakistan on E. coli bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Using another {{antibiotic}} concomitantly with <b>carbapenem</b> {{can help}} prevent the development of <b>carbapenem</b> resistance. One specific study showed {{a higher rate of}} <b>carbapenem</b> resistance when using meropenem alone compared with combination therapy with moxifloxacin.|$|E
50|$|Penems {{are similar}} in {{structure}} to <b>carbapenems.</b> However, where penems have a sulfur, <b>carbapenems</b> have another carbon.|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium abscessus is {{resistant}} to multiple antibiotics, creating treatment challenges. <b>Carbapenems</b> are tested to increase therapeutic alternatives. We performed in vitro susceptibility testing by Etest of four <b>carbapenems</b> for M. abscessus isolates.

5000|$|Serious and {{occasionally}} fatal allergic reactions {{can occur in}} people treated with <b>carbapenems.</b> [...] Seizures are a dose-limiting toxicity for both imipenem and meropenem. [...] Clostridium difficile-related diarrhea may occur in people treated with <b>carbapenems</b> or other broad spectrum antibiotics. Those with an allergy to [...] penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to <b>carbapenems.</b>|$|R

50|$|NDM-1 is {{an enzyme}} that {{introduces}} bacterial resistance to <b>carbapenem</b> antibiotics via hydrolysis of the <b>carbapenem</b> backbone, thereby inactivating {{its ability to}} inhibit cell wall synthesis.|$|E
50|$|In a Thailand-based {{study of}} CRE in {{hospital}} settings, <b>carbapenem</b> resistance {{was defined as}} any strain that shows resistance {{to at least one}} of three <b>carbapenem</b> antibiotics tested.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{performed}} on subjects with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins have demonstrated a 1 % rate of cross-reactivity between penicillins and both imipenem and meropenem, while a single study found a 5. 5 % rate of cross-reactivity with imipenem/cilastatin {{in subjects with}} T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity to β-lactams, mostly penicillins. We studied 204 consecutive subjects with a well-demonstrated T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity to assess the cross-reactivity with <b>carbapenems</b> and the tolerability of such alternative β-lactams. All 204 subjects underwent skin tests with imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem; 130 of them were skin-tested also with ertapenem. Subjects with negative test results were challenged with these <b>carbapenems.</b> All subjects displayed negative skin tests to <b>carbapenems</b> and tolerated challenges. These data demonstrate the absence of clinically significant T-cell-mediated cross-reactivity between penicillins and <b>carbapenems.</b> Negative delayed-reading skin testing with <b>carbapenems</b> in individuals with documented T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins correlates well with subsequent clinical tolerance of therapeutic doses of <b>carbapenems...</b>|$|R
30|$|Results: 3236 {{patients}} were admitted in ICU during the period. 1633 patients received antibiotics, of whom 226 received <b>carbapenems.</b> We analyzed 270 prescriptions of <b>carbapenems</b> (248 prescriptions of imipenem and 22 prescriptions of meropenem). 238 (88 %) prescriptions were compliant with the indication of <b>carbapenems</b> and 239 (89 %) were compliant with the re-evaluation. 191 (85 %) patients received <b>carbapenems</b> {{according to the}} recommendations. A compliant prescription had no impact on hospital or ICU length of stay and no impact on duration of mechanical ventilation but seemed associated with increase mortality (p =  0.04).|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, when {{analyzing}} those publications {{with a focus}} on the use of alternatives to <b>carbapenems</b> for definitive therapy, a number of limitations hamper the interpretation of studies comparing BL/BLI to <b>carbapenems.</b>|$|R

40|$|Valproic acid (VPA) is {{a widely}} used {{antiepileptic}} drug (AED). When <b>carbapenems</b> are concomitantly used with VPA, the serum levels of VPA may decrease and aggravate seizures. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the risk factors associated with decreased serum VPA levels and clinical outcome in patients being treated with a combination of <b>carbapenems</b> and VPA. Fifty-four adult patients who were treated with VPA for epileptic seizures concomitant with <b>carbapenems</b> for the treatment of infections were evaluated in this study. Serum VPA levels were measured before and during combination therapy with VPA and <b>carbapenems,</b> and the change in serum VPA levels was calculated. The risk factors related to the decrease in serum VPA levels and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Our results show that VPA concentrations were reduced to subtherapeutic levels after the introduction of <b>carbapenems.</b> The reduction in VPA concentrations was found within 24 hours of the start of treatment with <b>carbapenems.</b> VPA levels continuously declined while the combination of treatments was used, which aggravated epileptic seizures in 48 % of the patients. Renal disease and enzyme-inducing AEDs were risk factors that contributed to the severity of reduced serum VPA levels during combined treatment with <b>carbapenems.</b> This study suggests that clinicians need to be aware of the reduction of VPA concentrations to subtherapeutic levels and the aggravation of seizures while patients are treated with a combination of <b>carbapenems</b> and VPA...|$|R
40|$|Several {{antimicrobial}} agents are being investigated as alternatives to <b>carbapenems</b> {{in the treatment}} of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which may be useful in avoiding overuse of <b>carbapenems</b> in the context of recent global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The most promising candidates for invasive infections so far are -lactam/-lacta-mase inhibitor combinations and cephamycins. Extended-spectrum [...] lactamase (ESBL) -producing membersof the Enterobacteriaceae are frequent causes of community-and health care-associated infections (1); <b>carbapenems</b> are con-sidered the drugs of choice for serious infections due to ESBL producers (2); the consumption of <b>carbapenems</b> is increasing dra-matically (3); and carbapenemase-producing organisms are now widespread and rampant in many countries (4). While it is obvi-ous that the spread of carbapenemases is amultifactorial phenom-enon, a correlation between these facts looks like a rational hy-pothesis. Therefore, finding alternatives to <b>carbapenems</b> for treat-ment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteria...|$|R

5000|$|In general, <b>carbapenem,</b> a β-lactam antibiotic, targets cells by {{inhibiting}} transpeptidases (penicillin-binding proteins).

40|$|AbstractAntibiotic {{resistance}} among Gram-negative pathogens {{in hospitals}} {{is a growing}} threat to patients and is driving {{the increased use of}} <b>carbapenems.</b> <b>Carbapenems</b> are potent members of the β-lactam family of antibiotics, with a history of safety and efficacy for serious infections that exceeds 20 years. Original and review articles were identified from a Medline search (1979 – 2008). Reference citations from identified publications, abstracts from the Interscience Conferences on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and package inserts were also used. <b>Carbapenems</b> are effective in treating severe infections at diverse sites, with relatively low resistance rates and a favourable safety profile. <b>Carbapenems</b> are the β-lactams of choice for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Optimized dosing of <b>carbapenems</b> should limit the emergence of resistance and prolong the utility of these agents.

50|$|<b>Carbapenem</b> {{antibiotics}} {{were originally}} developed at Merck & Co. from the <b>carbapenem</b> thienamycin, a naturally derived product of Streptomyces cattleya. Concern has arisen {{in recent years}} over increasing rates of resistance to carbapenems, as there are few therapeutic options for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria (such as the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella pneumoniae).|$|E
30|$|Since the 1980 s, extended-spectrum {{beta-lactamase}} (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) {{have been}} spreading worldwide [1, 2]. Several reports underline the concomitant {{increasing use of}} <b>carbapenems</b> [3, 4]. Indeed, the recently published 2015 ESAC report noted a threefold increased use of <b>carbapenems</b> between 2010 and 2014 [5]. This induces a selective pressure for carbapenem-resistant isolates, and recent data suggest that even a brief exposure to <b>carbapenems</b> {{increases the risk of}} colonization with carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB) in intensive care unit patients [6].|$|R
50|$|The {{spectrum}} of activity of the <b>carbapenems</b> against gram-positive bacteria is fairly broad, but not as exceptionally so {{as in the case}} of gram-negative bacteria. Good activity is seen against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus species, but many other antibiotics provide coverage for such infections. Good activity is also observed for most Streptococcus species, including penicillin-resistant strains. <b>Carbapenems</b> are not highly active against methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus or most enterococcal infections because <b>carbapenems</b> do not bind to the penicillin-binding protein used by these pathogens.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} structure, the <b>carbapenems</b> {{are very similar}} to the {{penicillins}} (penams), but the sulfur atom in position 1 of the structure has been replaced with a carbon atom, and an unsaturation has been introduced - hence the name of the group, the <b>carbapenems.</b>|$|R
