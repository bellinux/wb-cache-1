2500|$|Horizontal {{convective}} rolls, {{also known}} as horizontal roll vortices or <b>cloud</b> <b>streets,</b> are long rolls of counter-rotating air that are oriented approximately {{parallel to the ground}} in the planetary boundary layer. Although horizontal convective rolls, {{also known as}} <b>cloud</b> <b>streets,</b> have been clearly seen in satellite photographs for the last 30 years, their development is poorly understood {{due to a lack of}} observational data. From the ground they appear as rows of cumulus [...] or cumulus-type clouds aligned parallel to the low-level wind. Research has shown these eddies to be significant to the vertical transport of momentum, heat, moisture, and air pollutants within the boundary layer. <b>Cloud</b> <b>streets</b> are usually more or less straight, but rarely <b>cloud</b> <b>streets</b> assume paisley patterns when the wind driving the clouds encounters an obstacle.

These were discovered in 1933 by two German glider pilots, Hans Deutschmann and Wolf Hirth, above the Krkonoše.They are periodic changes of atmospheric pressure, temperature and orthometric height in a current of air caused by vertical displacement, for example orographic lift when the wind blows over a mountain or mountain range. They can also be caused by the surface wind blowing over an escarpment or plateau, or even by upper winds deflected over a thermal updraft or <b>cloud</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} design {{philosophy and}} computational analysis of cross-country flight performance of Diana- 2 sailplane in different thermal conditions are presented. To address the second issue, a continuous spectrum of thermal models is created.

Finally expected cross-country speed for different thermal conditions and water ballast weight, as well the optimum water ballast amount, can be predicted. The main goal of the analysis is the optimization of sailplane parameters and helping pilot to make decisions regarding optimum balasting technique in flight. An estimation {{of the influence of}} bugs and rain on the sailplane aerodynamic characteristics is also presented...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used source of lift is created by the sun's energy heating the ground which in turn heats the air above it. This warm air rises in columns known as thermals. Soaring pilots quickly become aware of land features which can generate thermals and their trigger points downwind, because thermals have a surface tension with the ground and roll until hitting a trigger point. When the thermal lifts, the first indicator are the swooping birds feeding on the insects being carried aloft, or dust devils or a change in wind direction as the air is pulled in below the thermal. As the thermal climbs, bigger soaring birds indicate the thermal. The thermal rises until it either forms into a cumulus cloud or hits an inversion layer, {{which is where the}} surrounding air is becoming warmer with height, and stops the thermal developing into a cloud. Also, nearly every glider contains an instrument known as a variometer (a very sensitive vertical speed indicator) which shows visually (and often audibly) the presence of lift and sink. Having located a thermal, a glider pilot will circle within the area of rising air to gain height. In the case of a <b>cloud</b> <b>street,</b> thermals can line up with the wind, creating rows of thermals and sinking air. A pilot can use a <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> to fly long straight-line distances by remaining in the row of rising air.|$|E

40|$|Aircraft and {{airborne}} cloud radar {{data are}} {{used to describe the}} vertical structure of the convective boundary layer (CBL) during cold-air outbreaks over Lake Michigan in January 2004. Two days with mesoscale <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> structure and a day with cellular organization are contrasted. The radar reflectivity and vertical velocity structure of the CBL, as well as the radar-inferred topography of the CBL inversion, are collected along flight legs normal to the cloud streets. High-resolution horizontal and vertical transects of the dual-Doppler airflow field capture horizontal convective roll circulations on one day. Coherent structures within the CBL are analyzed as echo plumes, updraft plumes, and CBL domes. Only updraft plumes have the characteristics of buoyant thermals. Updrafts are narrower, weaker, and less buoyant on the no-roll day, but the differences in characteristics between two <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> days are larger than those between the no-roll day and the two <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> days. The lack of a clear buoyancy signal in echo plumes and under CBL domes is attributed to a temporal phase shift between maximum buoyancy, maxi-mum ice particle size, and maximum overshooting in thermals, and the transience of convective updrafts. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cloud</b> <b>streets</b> {{are common}} {{feature in the}} Amazon Basin. They form from the {{combination}} of the vertical trade wind stress and moist convection. Here, satellite imagery, data collected during the COBRA-PARA (Caxiuan Observations in the Biosphere, River and Atmosphere of Para) field campaign, and high resolution modeling are used to understand the streets` formation and behavior. The observations show that the streets have an aspect ratio of about 3. 5 and they reach their maximum activity around 15 : 00 UTC when the wind shear is weaker, and the convective boundary layer reaches its maximum height. The simulations reveal that the <b>cloud</b> <b>streets</b> onset is caused by the local circulations and convection produced at the interfaces between forest and rivers of the Amazon. The satellite data and modeling show that the large rivers anchor the <b>cloud</b> <b>streets</b> producing a quasi-stationary horizontal pattern. The streets are associated with horizontal roll vortices parallel to the mean flow that organizes the turbulence causing advection of latent heat flux towards the upward branches. The streets have multiple warm plumes that promote a connection between the rolls. These spatial patterns allow fundamental insights on the interpretation of the Amazon exchanges between surface and atmosphere with important consequences for the climate change understanding.

25|$|If the {{environmental}} air is near saturation, condensation may occur in updrafts produced from the vortex rotation.

40|$|The {{development}} of mixed layers {{and the formation}} of <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> over Funka Bay during cold air outbreaks were simulated by using the three dimensional non-hydrostatic model GESIMA (Geesthacht Simulation Model of the Atmosphere). The model successfully produced the <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> over Funka Bay with properties {{similar to that of the}} cloud streets observed by satellite. The predominant northwesterly winds were changed complexly over Funka Bay because of the various orography around the bay. A remarkable convergence line was developed after three hours of simulation which was consistent with wind fields observations existing over Funka Bay. The model also simulated the {{development of}} a mixed layer over the bay through the heat and moist fluxes from the relatively warm sea. It is indicated that the orography and air mass transformation are the main factors for the cloud formation. (orig.)

40|$|Convection {{waves are}} a strong {{function}} of the original forcing by convection in the boundary layer. This convection can {{take the form of}} random or 2 -D spatial structure. When clouds are formed as a result of 2 -D boundary layer forcing, they are called cloud streets. Convective waves may be important in the global momentum balance. Global circulation models presently overestimate wind speeds in the middle and upper troposphere, and do not account for convective waves. If the hypothesis that convective waves significantly contribute to momentum transport in the troposphere is correct, then climatology of cloud streets will help understand convective waves' role in the global momentum balance. If the hypothesis is incorrect, then <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> climatology is still useful because cloud streets show areas where large amounts of sensible and latent heat are transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere. Interannual variation of seasonal means and subseasonal variability of <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> occurrence off the east coast of North America is examined and compared.

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{characteristics of}} surface layer turbulence for the near-shore <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> regions over the Atlantic Ocean were examined using 50 -m level data of airborne measurements of atmospheric turbulence spectra above the western Atlantic Ocean during cold air outbreaks. The present study, performed for the Mesoscale Air-Sea Exchange (MASEX) experiment, extends and completes the preliminary analyses of Chou and Yeh (1987). In the inertial subrange, a near 4 / 3 ratio was observed between velocity spectra normal to and those along the aircraft heading. A {{comparison of the}} turbulent kinetic energy budgets with those of Wyngaard and Cote (1971) and Caughey and Wyngaard (1979) data indicates that the turbulent kinetic energy in the surface layer is dissipated less in the MASEX data than in data obtained by the previous groups...|$|E
40|$|The joint {{frequency}} distribution technique {{was used to}} analyze buoyancy fluxes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) for the <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> regime noted during the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment. It is found that for {{the lower half of}} the MABL, the buoyancy flux is mainly generated by the rising thermals and the sinking compensating ambient air, and is mainly consumed by the entrainment and detrainment of thermals, penetrative convection, and the entrainment from the MABL top. If the buoyancy flux is primarily driven by the temperature flux, these buoyancy-flux generating processes should be the same for the lower boundary layers over land and ocean. The results of the scale analysis of the buoyancy flux agree well with those obtained for mesoscale cellular convection during the Air-Mass Transformation Experiment...|$|E
40|$|Estimates of <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> {{geometry}} {{produced by}} {{a model of the}} parallel/thermal instability modes of shallow convection are compared with observations obtained during the 1981 KonTur experiment. Good agreement between the modeled and observed orientation angles, wavelengths and Reynolds numbers are found when the streets are assumed to derive their energy from the average shear and the lowest order sine terms of a Fourier expansion of the mean wind profile (or equivalently from the lowest order cosine terms of the mean shear profile). The modes associated with the cosine terms of the wind profile (or the sine terms of the wind shear profile) do not agree well with the observations. These results suggest that the boundary layer rolls observed during KonTur might have developed owing to a combined parallel/thermal instability originating primarily from the cosine terms of the ambient roll parallel wind shear...|$|E

40|$|A two layer {{spectral}} quasi-geostrophic {{model is}} used to simulate the effects of topography on the equilibria, the stability, and the long term evaluation of incipient unstable waves. The flow is forced by latitudinally dependent radiational heating. The nature of the form drag instability of high index equilibria is investigated. The proximity of the equilibrium shear to a resonant value {{is essential for the}} instability, provided the equilibrium occurs at a slightly stronger shear than resonance. The properties of the steady Hadley and Rossby required for a thermally forced rotating fluid on a sphere are further explained. An objective parameterization technique is developed for general nonlinear hydrodynamical systems. The typical structure is one in which the rates of change of the dependent variables depend on homogeneous quadratic and linear forms, as well as on inhomogeneous forcing terms. Also documented is a steady, axisymmetric model of the general circulation developed as a basis for climate stability studies. The model includes the effects of heating, rotation, and internal friction, but neglects topography. Included is further research on <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> phenomena. Orientation angles and horizontal wavelengths of boundary layer rolls and cloud streets are determined from an analysis of a truncated spectral model of three dimensional shallow moist Boussinesq convection in a shearing environment is further explained.

40|$|When a flow happens {{around a}} solid body, at certain speeds, the flow {{down-stream}} {{of the body}} separates into a time periodic alternating ejections of vortices. This {{is known as the}} Karman vortex street, named after Theodore von Karman, a first generation disciple of Ludwig Prandtl, who first proposed the concept of a viscous boundary layer with which one can explain this phe-nomenon. If the body is of circular cross section, the vortices eject from the top and bottom portion of the circular cross section. This is a beautiful phe-nomenon to observe even in a small size laboratory experiment. Here is a picture in a laboratory scale [1]. Like other such phenomenon, Karman vortices abound in Nature. Here is one recent instance pictured by NASA satellite where a karman vortex street is formed by the ’flow ’ of clouds over the island of Jan Mayen on Greenland. The parallel dark and light streaks are cloud streets (not Karman vortices) formed by cold winds meeting moist air above the ground. The Jan Mayen island (my guess from the scale of the picture, should be about 20 km across) influences the local weather by posing as an obstacle for the wind. In turn the <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> above and downstream (downwind) of the island is split into a continuous stream of alternating vortices. More details of the vortices can be observed in the larger size image available at the NASA site [2]. A brief (and crude) technical summary of the Karman vortex trail: With respect to the laboratory scale picture above, consider a small fluid region upstream of the obstacle (cylinder). As it approaches the leading edge (front end) of the cylinder, the pressure increases to stagnation pressure as the flow is 1 intended as course notes. c©Arunn Narasimha...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the observational, experimental, theoretical, and {{numerical}} studies of mesoscale shallow convection (MSC) in the atmosphere. Typically, MSC is 1 to 2 km deep, has a horizontal length scale of a few to a few tens of kilometers, and takes distinctive planforms: linear and hexagonal. The former is called a <b>cloud</b> <b>street,</b> roll, or band, while the latter is called mesoscale cellular convection (MCC), comprising three-dimensional cells. MSC is characterized by its shape, horizontal extent, convective depth, and aspect ratio. The latter is the ratio of the horizontal extent to that in the vertical. For cells the horizontal extent is their diameter, whereas for rolls it is their spacing. Rolls usually align along or at angles of up to 10 ° from the mean horizontal wind of the convective layer, with lengths from 20 to 200 km, widths from 2 to 10 km, and convective depths from 2 to 3 km. The typical value of aspect ratio ranges from 2 to 20. Rolls may occur over both water surface and land surfaces. Mesoscale convective cells may be divided into two types: open and closed. Open-cell circulation has downward motion and clear sky in the cell center, surrounded by cloud associated with upward motion. Closed cells have the opposite circulation. Both types of cell have diameters ranging from 10 to 40 km and aspect ratios of 5 to 50, and both occur in a convective layer with a depth of about 1 to 3 km. Both the magnitude and direction of horizontal wind in the convective layer change little with height. MSC results from a complex and incompletely understood mix of processes. These processes are outlined, and their interplay is examined through {{a review of the}}oretical and laboratory analyses and numerical modeling of MSC...|$|E
