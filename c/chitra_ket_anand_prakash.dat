Previously, we reported p-toluenesulfonic acid-promoted syntheses, molecular modeling and in vitro antitumor activity of 5 H-benzo[h]thiazolo[2, 3 -b]quinazoline against human hepatoma (Hep-G 2) cells where compounds 4 A and 6 A were found to be potent inhibitors among the series. In continuation to our previous effort to develop novel therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment, here we investigated the in vivo antitumor activity and the mechanism underlying the effects of 4 A and 6 A in N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) -induced HCC using male Wistar rats. NDEA was administered weekly intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 6 weeks. Various physiological and morphological changes, oxidative parameters, liver marker enzymes and cytokines were assessed to evaluate the antitumor effect of 4 A and 6 A. In addition, proton nuclear magnetic resonance-based serum metabolomics were performed to analyze the effects of 4 A and 6 A against HCC-induced metabolic alterations. Significant tumor incidences with an imbalance in carcinogen metabolizing enzymes and cellular redox status were observed in carcinogenic rats. Tumor inhibitory effects of 4 A and 6 A were noted by histopathology and biochemical profiles in NDEA-induced hepatic cancer. Compounds 4 A and 6 A had a potential role in normalizing the elevated levels of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 2, IL- 6 and IL- 10. At molecular level, the real-time quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that 4 A and 6 A attenuated the IL- 6 gene overexpression in hepatic cancer. Further, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis scores plot demonstrated a significant separation of 4 A and 6 A-treated groups from carcinogen control group. Both the compounds have potential to restore the imbalanced metabolites due to HCC, signifying promising hepatoprotective activities. All these findings suggested that 4 A and 6 A could be potential drug candidates to treat HCC.

They take insurance policies with fake identities and then fake their own deaths and claim insurance. Prem Krishan, a crime reporter, unearths this nefarious plan but is killed by Diwan. Prem Krishan's step brother Kailash is implicated in Prem Krishan's murder. Anand (Mithun Chakraborthy) is {{in search of}} his sister who married her lover without informing him, and has gone missing thereafter. When Anand finally finds her, she is in a mental asylum, her husband is reported dead and <b>Anand's</b> friend <b>Prakash</b> (Raj Babbar) finds evidence which proves that Kailash (Raaj Kumar) is again responsible for her husband's murder. As if his troubles are not enough, Kailash's step sister and Anand's girl friend (Dimple Kapadia) also has a low opinion of Kailash. Chased by cops and Anand, Kailash fakes his own death, but returns to town with a fake identity. After a series of badly scripted events, Kailash proves his innocence, Prakash {{turns out to be the}} secret third villain (who cheated Anand's sister) and all the bad guys are caught by police.
