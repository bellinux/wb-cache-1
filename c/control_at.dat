5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional <b>control</b> <b>at</b> high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|After his exile, Larrea {{moved to}} Bordeaux in France, and did {{business}} {{with some of}} his old associates. He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia, and in 1818 he moved to Montevideo, under Brazilian <b>control</b> <b>at</b> that time, and strengthened his contacts in Buenos Aires from there. He was finally able to return to Buenos Aires in 1822 due to the oblivion law.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the album's release in late August 1994, Edwards was hospitalised at the private Priory Hospital in Roehampton. He rejoined the band to tour during the autumn of 1994. Other band members felt that his {{drinking}} was under <b>control</b> <b>at</b> this point, but his eating continued to be a problem and he continued to self-harm. On 1 February 1995, he disappeared and is presumed to have committed suicide. His car was found close to the Severn Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater political <b>control</b> <b>at</b> the expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 {{and the death of}} the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, the Vorticon {{mothership}} has locked its X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons on eight of Earth's landmarks, and Keen journeys {{to the ship}} to find and deactivate each of the cannons. Keen does so by fighting more varied enemies and hazards and a Vorticon at each cannon's <b>control.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the}} episode, he discovers that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth.|$|E
30|$|The fermentations {{were carried}} out in a 3 litre Jar {{fermenter}} fully controlled by a computer system. Parameters such as temperature, pH, agitation, cell concentration, and sodium hydroxide consumption were monitored on-line in real time. The OD was monitored by a laser sensor, model LA 300 -LT (Automatic Research System, Tokyo, Japan) at 780 nm. The temperature was <b>controlled</b> <b>at</b> 30 °C and the pH was <b>controlled</b> <b>at</b> 6.5 (Shibata et al.[2007]). The agitation was <b>controlled</b> <b>at</b> 200 rpm. The media used contained LSS at 20 g/l and 5 g/l of YE. The pH was controlled with 10 M sodium hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} has undergone numerous anti-terror upgrades since 9/11/01 including extensive installation of crash barriers, inspection stations, and traffic <b>controls</b> <b>at</b> all base entry points.

5|$|M-117 in Mackinac County was {{shifted to}} a new routing along Country Avenue in 1957. The {{previous}} routing was transferred to local <b>control</b> <b>at</b> the same time. M-117 was truncated to M-28 west of Newberry in late 1961 or early 1962. The section of highway north of M-28 through Newberry to Four Mile Corner was included in an extension of M-123 between Newberry and Paradise. M-117 was dedicated in 1993 to the deactivated 117th Quartermaster Battalion based out of Kingsford.|$|E
5|$|Mounted {{police have}} been used since the 18th century, and still are used {{worldwide}} to control traffic and crowds, patrol public parks, keep order in processionals and during ceremonies and perform general street patrol duties. Today, many cities still have mounted police units. In rural areas, horses are used by law enforcement for mounted patrols over rugged terrain, crowd <b>control</b> <b>at</b> religious shrines, and border patrol.|$|E
5|$|On July 5th, French forces re-embarked {{when word}} arrived that a British fleet under Admiral John Byron was approaching. The two fleets battled the next day.

5|$|The {{air traffic}} <b>control</b> <b>at</b> Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.|$|E

5|$|When the South {{returned}} to firm Democratic <b>control</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} the 1870s, Indiana became a key swing state, one of a few that often decided the outcome of national elections. Five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets in elections held between 1868 and 1916. Benjamin Harrison, an Indianapolis lawyer and former officer in the Union army, was elected the 23rd president of the United States in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive <b>control.</b> <b>At</b> these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Air traffic {{services}} for all UK airspace {{is provided by}} National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which also provides air traffic <b>control</b> <b>at</b> 15 airports. The largest airport operator is BAA Limited, owner of six UK airports including London Heathrow airport. In some cases airport ownership {{is in the hands}} of local government authorities rather than private businesses, and the largest UK owned operator, Manchester Airports Group, operator of Manchester Airport, Bournemouth Airport, East Midlands Airport, and Humberside Airport, is owned by a consortium of 10 Manchester area local authorities. Whilst the number of airports in the UK runs into hundreds, many are smaller aerodromes dealing with general aviation rather than air transport. In terms of the latter, statistics are collected from 59 main airports, and the largest concentration of services is located in the London and South East of England areas.|$|E

At 40/20, White has scored 54.6% (W37.0 D35.2 L27.8) in games played among 284 engines (as of May 24, 2009). At the fastest time control (40/4), White has scored 54.8% (W39.6 D30.5 L30.0), in games played among 128 programs (as of May 28, 2009).|$|E
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes <b>control.</b> <b>At</b> six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{handed over}} North-Western Area to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth in September 1944. He took up an {{appointment}} as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in October, but was removed soon afterwards following an incident at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, received an anonymous letter alleging that Cole had become drunk and lost <b>control</b> <b>at</b> a mess meeting on 8November. Investigating the matter, Jones {{was unable to}} establish whether or not Cole had been drunk but was satisfied {{that he had not}} behaved appropriately, and issued him a warning without charging or otherwise disciplining him. Under pressure from the Federal government, Jones dismissed Cole from the position of AMP and posted him to Ceylon in January 1945 as RAAF Liaison Officer to South East Asia Command. Cole served in this role {{until the end of the}} war, taking part in negotiations for the Japanese capitulation and acting as Australia's senior representative at the formal surrender ceremony in Singapore on 12September 1945.|$|E
