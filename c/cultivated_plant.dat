5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code are prompted by international symposia for <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants. Each new <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> {{taxonomy}} is {{the study}} of the theory and practice of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigensthose plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. <b>Cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> {{taxonomy}} {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.|$|E

However, there are still no commercially available disease resistant genetically modified <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants,</b> only <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> that are resistant to particular pests and mainly tolerant to wide - spectrum herbicides...|$|R
50|$|For {{the naming}} of <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> there is a {{separate}} code, the International Code of Nomenclature for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants,</b> which gives rules and recommendations that supplement the ICN.|$|R
5|$|The key {{activities}} of <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomy relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature). The rules associated with naming plants are {{separate from the}} methods, principles or purposes of classification, except that the units of classification, the taxa, are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera, and genera within families. There are three classification categories used in the <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> {{taxonomy}} is {{one part}} of the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultigen}} nomenclature {{has been discussed}} by William T. Stearn and Brandenberg, Hetterscheid and Berg. It has also been examined from a botanical perspective and from {{the origin of the}} <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code in 1953 until 2004.|$|E
50|$|The ICN {{does not}} {{regulate}} {{the names of}} <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants,</b> of cultivars, i.e. plants specifically created for use in agriculture or horticulture. Such names are regulated by the International Code of Nomenclature for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants</b> (ICNCP).|$|R
50|$|Empoasca decedens is {{a highly}} {{polyphagous}} species, constituting an important pest to several <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> including several fruit trees such as citrus, peaches, and almonds. It also damages many other <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> such as cotton, raspberries, potatoes, vines and grain plants.|$|R
40|$|In the 1995 International Code of Nomenclature for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants</b> (ICNCP) the {{cultivar}} and cultivar-group {{are used}} as the main categories to classify <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants.</b> In order to link the cultonomic classification to the taxonomic (botanical) classification it might be desirable to indicate to what botanical category the <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> are to be assigned. This link between cultonomy and taxonomy is best established at a level above the cultivar-group. The sum total of cultivar-groups constitutes the crop, and it is suggested to recognize the crop as a culton {{and use it to}} define the relationship between groups of <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> and the categories of the botanical classification governed by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). The crop category is also the logical choice to function as denomination class. By applying the crop concept the dependence of classification and nomenclature of <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> on botanical classification and nomenclature with its implicit threat of instability is reduced...|$|R
5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then there is the practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. <b>Cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century, Parkinson helped {{to ensure the}} {{popularity}} of the daffodil as a <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> by describing a hundred different varieties in his Paradisus Terrestris (1629), and introducing the great double yellow Spanish daffodil (Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus flore pleno or Parkinson's Daffodil, see illustration) to England.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> {{taxonomist}} is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (<b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} international communication on <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomy, organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands. One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by {{the first issue of}} Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy. This filled a gap left when the American journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s. Another development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Taxonomy. Hortax also publishes Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} {{the historical development of}} <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomy traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present-day International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.|$|E
5|$|Current {{challenges}} for <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomists include: {{the use of}} large plant name databases; {{ways of dealing with}} the use of non-scientific names in commerce (known as trade designations), especially for plant labels in nurseries; intellectual property and plants; adapting modern technology, in particular molecular techniques, to the creation and identification of cultivars; maintaining germplasm collections of cultivars, including herbaria; the recording and registration of cultivars.|$|E

5|$|The terms {{cultigen}} and cultivar may {{be confused}} with each other. Cultigen is a general-purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category. Cultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group. The <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plant</b> Code points out that cultigens are: deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated stocks, or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation. Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants, plants with binomial Latin names that {{are the result of}} ancient human selection, and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names. In practice most cultigens are cultivars.|$|E

25|$|Although Linnaeus’ {{system of}} {{binomial}} nomenclature was rapidly adopted {{after the publication}} of his Species Plantarum and Systema Naturae in 1753 and 1758 respectively, {{it was a long time}} before there was international consensus concerning the more general rules governing biological nomenclature. The first botanical code was produced in 1905, the zoological code in 1889 and <b>cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> code in 1953. Agreement on the nomenclature and symbols for genes emerged in 1979.|$|E

25|$|The Eurasian landmass extends many {{thousands}} of miles along an east–west axis. Climate zones also extend for thousands of miles, which facilitated the spread of agriculture, domestication of animals, and the diseases associated with domestication.
