25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some have criticised the over-reliance on private tuition, saying that {{students}} may not pay attention during lessons as {{they are able to}} fall back on their tuition classes later. Students may also be unable to find answers on their own, having relied on their tutors for answers during their school years. Some tuition centres reportedly do schoolwork on their students' behalf. Others have also criticised private tuition for taking up too much of students' free time. Due to the high cost of tuition, there are concerns that low-income families were unable to send their children for such classes. However, the government have partially subsidised private tuition at certain <b>community</b> <b>bodies</b> for children from low-income families.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor project Future Planet Studies, major biology. ABSTRACT Animal {{species with}} a larger body-size tend to have larger home ranges than small-bodied animals. Therefore {{it is likely that}} they are more {{affected}} by habitat fragmentation than small-bodied species. Body size of birds also seems to have a negative relation with species richness. This research has therefore looked into whether birds {{with a larger}} body-size are more sensitive to habitat fragmentation caused by forest fragmentation, than birds with a smaller body-size. Also the relation between biodiversity and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass was investigated. This was done by linking the community body-mass of birds at specific sites in 14 different countries spread around the globe with the core area index (CAI) of these sites and the distance from these sites {{to the edge of a}} habitat supporting a high biodiversity (DEHHB). Of the 10 analyzed studies concerning the relation between CAI and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> size for three studies a negative relation was found, while the remaining seven indicated a positive relation. Of these 10 studies only three studies had a p-value lower than 0. 05. These three studies did not correspond with the three studies for which a negative relation was found. Of the seven analyzed studies concerning the relation between DEHHB and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> size for three studies a negative relation was found, while the remaining four indicated a positive relation. None of these relations were significant. Therefore, it is concluded that no relation was found between CAI and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass as well as no relation between DEHHB and <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass. Both these findings are in contrast with previous literature might be due to the fact that there was no consistent edge type in the analysed studies, also the limited size of this study and the lack of data could be a cause. It is recommended to obtain more data concerning bird species abundance and mean <b>community</b> <b>body</b> mass with a large amount of species per study, so more inclusive research can be conducted and to study areas which contain the same type of edge...|$|R
