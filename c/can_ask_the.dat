5|$|Although Sullivan County has boroughs and townships, {{it has no}} cities. Any {{municipality}} in Pennsylvania {{with more}} than 10 persons can incorporate as a borough. Any township or borough {{with a population of}} at least 10,000 <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> state legislature to become chartered as a city. However, as Sullivan County has a population of only 6,428, it has no cities. There are no unincorporated areas in the county, since all territory in Pennsylvania is incorporated.|$|E

However, the Prime Minister <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Yang di-Pertuan Agong to dissolve the Parliament at any time before this five-year period has expired. A general election should be held no later than two months in West Malaysia and three months for East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) after {{the dissolution of the}} Parliament.|$|E

The program started in 1991, {{due in part to}} the activities of serial rapist and killer Paul Bernardo. On October 13, 2011, after many requests from the public and, finally, a letter by LGBTQ rights group Queer Ontario, the TTC announced that it would make the Request Stop Program available to all passengers in need.|$|E

25|$|A new {{mechanism}} {{was introduced}} by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The Committee <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the Court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for European Union accession to the Convention. The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010. It entered into force on 1 June 2010.|$|E
25|$|Photography {{on private}} {{property}} that is generally {{open to the public}} (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both.|$|E
25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to be able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E

500|$|Right to {{constitutional}} remedies [...] empowers {{the citizens}} {{to move a}} court of law in case of any denial of the fundamental rights. For instance, in case of imprisonment, any citizen <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> court to see if it is according to the provisions of the law of the country by lodging a PIL. If the court finds that it is not, the person will have to be freed. This procedure of asking the courts to preserve or safeguard the citizens' fundamental rights can be done in various ways. The courts can issue various kinds of writs. These writs are habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari.|$|E
500|$|Battles are turn-based, and {{consist of}} players letting the {{characters}} in their party attack with swords or guns, summon demons, or cast magic spells; both demons and humans, {{with the exception of}} the player character, are able to use magic. By participating in battles, human characters in the player's party receive experience points; by accumulating these points, the characters' levels rise and new abilities are randomly learned. Players can choose to talk to demons instead of fighting them; they <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> demons for items or money, try to get them to go away, or try to form an alliance with them. At some places, called [...] "Cathedrals of Shadows", players can fuse two to three allied demons into one single, more powerful demon; as demons do not receive experience points, this is the only way for the player to increase their demons' power. Magnetite is used as a fuel for allied demons, and is used up by summoned demons as the player character walks around in the dungeons; if players run out of magnetite, summoned demons take damage.|$|E

500|$|The archetypal {{example of}} an {{invariant}} is the discriminant B2 − 4AC of a binary quadratic form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2. This is called an invariant because it is unchanged by linear substitutions x→ax + by, y→cx + dy with determinant ad − bc = 1. These substitutions form the special linear group SL2. (There are no invariants under the general linear group of all invertible linear transformations because these transformations can be multiplication by a scaling factor. To remedy this, classical invariant theory also considered relative invariants, which were forms invariant up to a scale factor.) One can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged {{by the action of}} SL2; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms, and {{turn out to be the}} polynomials in the discriminant. More generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A0xr'y0 + ... + A'rx0y'r of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A0, ..., A'r, and more generally still, one <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.|$|E

2500|$|For most {{of these}} cases, the {{jurisdiction}} of the federal district courts is concurrent with that of the state courts. [...] In other words, a plaintiff can choose to bring these cases in either a federal district court or a state court. [...] Congress has established a procedure whereby a party, typically the defendant, can [...] "remove" [...] a case from state court to federal court, provided that the federal court also has original jurisdiction over the matter (meaning that the case could have been filed in federal court initially). [...] If the party that initially filed the case in state court believes that removal was improper, that party <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> district court to [...] "remand" [...] the case to the state court system. [...] For certain matters, such as patent and copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes, {{the jurisdiction of the}} district courts is exclusive of that of the state courts, meaning that only federal courts can hear those cases.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one of his}} books, Gambetta {{illustrates}} this concept with the scenario of a meat wholesaler who wishes to sell some meat to a supermarket without paying sales tax. Since the transaction is essentially a black market deal, the agents cannot turn to the police or the courts if either of them cheats the other. [...] The seller might supply rotting meat, or the purchaser might refuse to pay. The mistrust and fear of being cheated with no recourse might prevent these two agents from making a profitable transaction. To guarantee each other's honesty, the two parties <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> local mafia clan to oversee the transaction. [...] In exchange for a commission, the mafioso promises to both the buyer and seller that if either of them tries to cheat the other, the cheater can expect to be assaulted or have his property vandalized. Such is the mafioso's reputation for viciousness, impartiality, and reliability that neither the buyer nor the seller would consider cheating with him overseeing the deal. The transaction thus proceeds smoothly.|$|E
