40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 75). The {{current state}} of class division in contemporary American society is problematic; therefore, {{it is critical to}} understand and analyze the multiple factors that can contribute to inequitable class division. One such factor is how society chooses to consume goods and services, and how media play a part in this decision. By analyzing a medium that is easily accessible, consumed, and used across America, such as magazines and their advertisements, I can review the probable, yet subtle, communication that is being passed from the medium???s content to the consumers. Little research has been conducted in the field of rhetoric that visually analyzes advertisements and their ideological influence on personal values and economic standing. This thesis is an analysis of two magazines aimed at two opposite audiences: FORTUNE Magazine and People StyleWatch Magazine. Both magazines are produced by the same corporation, Time Inc. In this thesis, I will review literature on visual rhetoric, consumption, advertising, ideology theory, and Time, Inc. This review will set a foundation from which I can analyze how advertising perpetuates and extends class division. I will also discuss the limitations of my research that are {{due to the nature of}} a case study, such as only reviewing a small section of the advertisements in a magazine, only focusing on two publications, and only analyzing the advertisements at a single point in time. Further, I will discuss options to extend this research and findings, such as analyzing advertisements used in a different publishing house, analyzing various advertising media, analyzing magazines without advertisements, and <b>conducting</b> <b>general</b> <b>research</b> on magazines with a rhetorical lens. My findings show that the difference among magazines consumed by the varying economic demographics can contribute to the issues of class division due the ideological messages promoted in the advertisements, which is significant considering the extreme class division that is currently at a problematic state in America...|$|E

50|$|By 1920 the {{majority}} of French Laos was at peace and colonial order had been established. In 1928 the first school for the training of Lao civil servants was established, and allowed for the upward mobility of Lao to fill positions occupied by the Vietnamese. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s France attempted to implement Western, particularly French, education, modern healthcare and medicine, and public works with mixed success. The budget for colonial Laos was secondary to Hanoi, and the worldwide Great Depression further restricted funds. It {{was also in the}} 1920s and 1930s that the first stirings of Lao nationalist identity emerged due to the work of Prince Phetsarath Rattanavongsa and the French Ecole Francaise d’Extreme Orient to restore ancient monuments, temples, and <b>conduct</b> <b>general</b> <b>research</b> into Lao history, literature, art and architecture. French interest in indigenous history served a dual purpose in Laos it reinforced the image of the colonial mission as protection against Siamese domination, and was also a legitimate route for scholarship.|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses our past work examining the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) progress and challenges in developing and acquiring new technologies to address homeland security needs. DHS acquisition programs represent {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars in life-cycle costs and support a wide range of missions and investments including border surveillance and screening equipment, nuclear detection equipment, and technologies used to screen airline passengers and baggage for explosives, among others. Since its creation in 2003, DHS has spent billions of dollars developing and procuring technologies and other countermeasures to address various threats and to conduct its missions. Within DHS, the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) <b>conducts</b> <b>general</b> <b>research</b> and development and oversees the testing and evaluation efforts of DHS components, which are responsible for developing, testing, and acquiring their own technologies. This testimony focuses on the findings of our prior work related to DHS's efforts to acquire and deploy new technologies to address homeland security needs. Our past work has identified three key challenges: (1) developing technology program requirements, (2) conducting and completing testing and evaluation of technologies and (3) incorporating information on costs and benefits in making technology acquisition decisions. This statement will also discuss recent DHS efforts to strengthen its investment and acquisition processes. ...|$|R

40|$|Women {{who stay}} {{informed}} throughout their pregnancy {{have the opportunity}} to have the best health outcomes for themselves and their baby. In the UK women use a variety of information systems, and rely heavily on the resources provided by the NHS. With a myriad of sources available to pregnant women, it is important to see how well their chosen resources meet their information needs. The focus of this dissertation is to understand what causes pregnant women to search for information and how they reach a satisfactory conclusion to their information needs. This dissertation met the research aims through a mixed method research approach which included a survey and in-depth interviews of women who were pregnant in the UK in the last five years. The research provided a number of key findings: women <b>conduct</b> <b>general</b> preparatory <b>research</b> over the course of their pregnancy using a small number of trusted resources; commonly new information needs were provoked by interactions with physicians or midwives; unexpected events such as complications triggered the most intensive periods of research; women had a greater number of information needs during pregnancy and typically adapted their pre-pregnancy information behaviour to satisfy these needs; while women sought out scientifically-backed information, their emotions strongly influenced whether they decided to trust new sources. The main conclusion drawn from this research was the importance of midwives as information providers to facilitate healthy information searching. The midwife is perfectly positioned to verify the vast amount of pregnancy-related information women access and can help them answer queries quickly...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{present a}} {{reflection}} on ethnography as a method composed {{of a variety of}} techniques for <b>conducting</b> social <b>research.</b> <b>General</b> information is given on its origin and links with anthropological research. By questioning the classical-normative notion of the ethnographic method and using the distinction between method, methodology and technique, I offer a concept which links ethnographic research to a strategic process in which the researcher acts to connect his or her experience and knowledge on methods with creativity and personal commitment. In the course of this process, ethnography achieves scientific rigor in that it permits the emergence of the principles of creativity, system, transparency, and empirical reference, which in my opinion are the key principles in the general definition of the method.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to advance {{understanding}} of the cognitive and behavioural profiles associated with Sotos syndrome. Specifically, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to establish the cognitive profile and whether autistic features are associated with Sotos syndrome. Initially, a systematic review of all published literature providing data on cognition and behaviour in Sotos syndrome was <b>conducted.</b> In <b>general,</b> <b>research</b> investigating cognition and behaviour in Sotos syndrome has been sporadic and much of the existing literature is based on small samples. The findings from the systematic review were used to inform the design of the research presented in the subsequent chapters. The studies reported within this thesis have used the largest samples to date to investigate cognition and behaviour in individuals with Sotos syndrome. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that Sotos syndrome is associated with a high prevalence of autistic features, as well as a clear and consistent cognitive profile. In particular, the Sotos syndrome cognitive profile is characterised by relative strength in verbal ability and visuospatial memory and relative weakness in non-verbal reasoning ability and quantitative reasoning. Furthermore, greater severity of autistic features is associated with lower intellectual ability for individuals with Sotos syndrome. Communicative difficulties are common in both adults and children with Sotos syndrome and individuals display difficulty with both structural and pragmatic aspects of language. Overall, the findings reported within this thesis advance understanding of the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of Sotos syndrome and have important implications for considering the syndrome-specific needs of these individuals...|$|R
40|$|Honorary Council Election (DKPP) is {{considered}} very progressive because {{in less than}} two years from its inauguration, it has solved around 127 cases. However, there are several decisions made by DKPP which are controversial because they make decisions and give sanctions to not only violations of ethical codes, but also administrative sectors and conflicts related to general elections. The problems of this research are: first, what are the limits of DKPP 2 ̆ 7 s authority in investigating and making decisions on ethical code violation during general election? Second, how is the relationship pattern among KPU (Election Supervisory Committee), Bawaslu (Election Watchdog), and DKPP which is based on electoral integrity in <b>conducting</b> <b>general</b> election? This <b>research</b> employed statute and conceptual approach as well as qualitative analysis. The findings show that: first, the limits of DKPP 2 ̆ 7 s authority have been governed in the Constitution of Elections. DKPP only has authority to investigate and make decisions on the notions of ethical code violations which are done by election committee. Second, the pattern of the relationship among election committees in Indonesia has actually adopted the electoral integrity principles, but it will be better if DKPP, in doing its duties, does not overlap with the authority of other agencies or institutions so that they can work professionally...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to uncover the reasons behind what {{so-called}} total failure in e-government project in Jordan. Reviewing the published papers in this context revealed that both citizens and employees do not understand the current status of this program. The majority of these papers measure the quality of e-services presented by e-government. However, according to the minister of Communication and Information Technologies (MOCIT), only three e-services are provided by this program up to writing this paper. Moreover, he decided to freeze the current working on e-government programme. These facts drove the authors to <b>conduct</b> this <b>research.</b> <b>General</b> review of the existing literature concerning e-government implementation in Jordan was applied, then a qualitative research was utilised to uncover the reasons behind the failure of the e-government program in Jordan. The collected data then was analysed using Strauss and Corbin's method of grounded theory. This paper illustrates that Jordanian government need to exert strenuous efforts to move from the first stage of e-government implementation into an interactive one after fourteen years of launching the program, considering that only three e-services are presented up to October 2013. Reasons behind the failure of e-government in Jordan have also been identified. Keywords—e-government; grounded theory; Jordan; total failure I...|$|R

40|$|Privacy is a {{fundamental}} human right. During the last decades, in the information age, information privacy {{has become one of}} the most essential aspects of privacy. Information privacy is concerned with protecting personal information pertaining to individuals. Organizations, which frequently process the personal information, and individuals, who are the subjects of the information, have different needs, rights and obligations. Organizations need to utilize personal information as a basis to develop tailored services and products to their customers in order to gain advantage over their competitors. Individuals need assurance from the organizations that their personal information is not changed, disclosed, deleted or misused in any other way. Without this guarantee from the organizations, individuals will be more unwilling to share their personal information. Information privacy metrics is a set of parameters used for the quantitative assessment and benchmark of an organization’s measures to protect personal information. These metrics can be used by organizations to demonstrate, and by individuals to evaluate, the type and level of protection given to personal information.  Currently, there are no systematically developed, established or widely used information privacy metrics. Hence, the purpose of this study is to establish a solid foundation for building information privacy metrics by discovering some of the most critical constructs and dimensions of these metrics.   The research was <b>conducted</b> within the <b>general</b> <b>research</b> strategy of design science and by applying research methods such as data collection and analysis informed by grounded theory as well as surveys using interviews and questionnaires in Sweden and in Sri Lanka. The result is a conceptual model for information privacy metrics including its basic foundation; the constructs and dimensions of the metrics.   At the time of the doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 6 : Accepted. </p...|$|R
