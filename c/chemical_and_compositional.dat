5000|$|Auger {{electron}} spectroscopy (AES; pronounced [...] in French) is {{a common}} analytical technique used specifically {{in the study of}} surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science. Underlying the spectroscopic technique is the Auger effect, as it has come to be called, which is based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events. The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s. Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal Zeitschrift für Physik in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community. Until the early 1950s Auger transitions were considered nuisance effects by spectroscopists, not containing much relevant material information, but studied so as to explain anomalies in X-ray spectroscopy data. Since 1953 however, AES has become a practical and straightforward characterization technique for probing <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> surface environments and has found applications in metallurgy, gas-phase chemistry, and throughout the microelectronics industry.|$|E

As a consequence, the quality of measurements themselves, e. g., the metrological traceability of the measured quantity values is essential to allow a proper evaluation of the results with regard to specifications and regulatory limits. This requires knowledge of the measurement uncertainties of all quantity values involved in the measurement procedure, including measurement standards. This study shows how the uncertainties due to the preparation, as well as the <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> stability of a chemical measurement standard, or calibrator, can be estimated. The results show that the relative standard uncertainty of the concentration value of a typical analytical measurement standard runs up to 2. 8 % after 1 year. Of this, 1. 9 % originates from the preparation of the measurement standard, while 2. 0 and 0. 53 % originate from the <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> stability during storage at - 20 A degrees C. The monthly preparation of working calibrators stored at 4 A degrees C and used on a weekly basis, results in an additional standard uncertainty of the analyte concentration value of 0. 35 % per month due to compositional stability.

The {{effect of the}} substrate temperature (T{sub s}) on the growth characteristics and the properties of a-SiCN:H films was evaluated. The properties of the films were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) for surface morphological analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> analyses; spectroscopic ellipsometry for optical properties and thickness determination and nanoindentation to determine the mechanical properties of the a-SiCN:H films. Films deposited at low T{sub s} depict organic like features, while the films deposited at high T{sub s} depict ceramic like features. FTIR and XPS studies reveal that an increases in T{sub s} helps in the elimination of organic moieties and incorporation of nitrogen in the film. Films deposited at T{sub s} of 425 C have an index of refraction (n) of 1. 84 and hardness (H) of 14. 8 GPa.

The idea is to check if there can be variation of cationic ratios, impurities, possible diffusion of substrate/buffer layer atoms into the YBCO for different processing methods and microstructures. Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD), Metal Organic Deposition (MOD) and Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) films on Ion Beam Assisted Deposited (IBAD) -textured buffer layers and, Rolling Assisted Biaxial textured substrate (RABiTS) combinations have been compared. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) has been used in conjunction with ion beam sputtering as well as gentle chemical etching to obtain composition and chemistry information at different depths into the film. Correlation with Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) has been obtained as needed. Top view as well as cross section Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was performed for microstructure analysis. Using the gentle chemical etching method, depth profiling of composition and microstructure of the films has been achieved.

In the model, each representative particle interacts with a common gas phase but otherwise evolves separately from all other particles.

40|$|Modern oil paints, {{introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century, differ from those classically used in antiquity in their <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> features. The main ingredients were still traditional drying oils, often used in mixtures with less expensive oils and added with several classes of additives. Consequently, detailed lipid profiling, together with the study of lipid degradation processes, is essential for the knowledge and the conservation of paint materials used in modern and contemporary art. A multi-analytical approach based on mass spectrometry was used for the study of original paint materials from Munch's atelier, owned by the Munch Museum in Oslo. The results obtained in the analysis of paint tubes were compared with those obtained by characterizing a paint sample collected from one of the artist's sketches for the decoration of the Festival Hall of the University of Oslo (1909 - 1916). Py-GC/MS was used as screening method to evaluate the presence of lipid, proteic or polysaccaridic materials. GC/MS after hydrolysis and derivatization allowed us to determine the fatty acid profile of the paint tubes, and to evaluate the molecular changes associated to curing and ageing. The determination of the fatty acid profile is not conclusive for the characterization of complex mixtures of lipid materials, thus the characterization of the triglyceride profiles was performed using an analytical procedure based on HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF. This paper describes the first application of HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF for the acquisition of the triglyceride profile in a modern paint sample, showing the potentialities of liquid chromatography in the field of lipid characterization in modern paint materials. Moreover, our results highlighted that the application of this approach can contribute to address dating, authenticity and conservation issues relative to modern and contemporary artworks...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{isostatic}} pressing (HIP) {{is one of}} the industrial techniques for production of structural ceramics. A high quality of the as-HIPed surface is highly desirable, as it may make it possible to minimise or eliminate costly finishing machining. When a porous ceramic is HIPed, an encapsulation of glass can be applied on the component as a gas tight envelope. Silicon nitride ceramics work well with a borosilicate encapsulation glass but oxides, such as alumina and zirconia, react severely. A protective barrier between the oxides and the borosilicate glass has been developed earlier. With such a system of protective layers it was possible to demonstrate HIP of some oxides, with good mechanical as well as biocompatibility properties as a result. However, {{there is a difference between}} the bulk and the surface properties of these materials. A model system of silicon nitride and borosilicate glass was chosen for a more thorough study on interactions between the encapsulation glass and the porous ceramic green body during HIPing. Mechanical, <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> gradient from the surface of the ceramic into the bulk were studied. Theoretical calculations on chemical reactions in the system Si 3 N 4 - B 2 O 3 were done accompanied by practical experiments. Special attention has been given the part of the HIP-cycle when the pressure is applied and the glass is pushed against the still porous ceramic component. Possible viscous flow of the glass into the ceramic was analysed. TEM-studies of the densified silicon nitride revealed two different types of hexagonal boron nitride formed in the surface region and their role in the encapsulation is discussed. The increased knowledge can beused in work for improved surface quality and for development of intermediate protective layers. Validerad; 1998; 20061123 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to metals and metal-containing {{materials}} daily, either conscious, e. g. using metal tools or objects, or unconscious, e. g. during exposure to airborne metal-, and metal-containing particles. The diffuse dispersion of metals from different sources in the society, and the concern related to its potential risk for adverse effects on humans have gained an increased public and governmental attention both on a national and international level. In this context, the knowledge on metal release from metallic objects or metal-containing particles is essential for health risk assessment. This thesis focuses {{on the study of}} metal release from powder particles of stainless steel and Cu-based materials exposed to synthetic body fluids mainly for simulating lung-like environments. The study comprises: i) development of a suitable experimental method for metal release studies of micron sized particles, ii) metal release data of individual alloy constituents from stainless steel powder particles of different particle sizes, and iii) Cu release from different Cu-based powder particles. In addition, the influence of chemical and physical properties of metallic particles and the test media are investigated. Selected results from Ni powder particles exposed to artificial sweat are presented for comparison. The outcome of this research is summarized through ten questions that are formulated to improve the general understanding of corrosion-induced metal release from metallic particles from a health risk perspective. A robust, reproducible, fairly simple, and straightforward experimental procedure was elaborated for metal release studies on particles of micron or submicron size. Results in terms of metal release rates show, for stainless steel powder particles, generally very low metal release rates due to a protective surface oxide film, and Fe preferentially released compared to Cr and Ni. Metal release rates are time-dependent for both stainless steel powder particles and the different Cu-containing powders investigated. The release of Cu from the Cu-containing particles depends on the <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> properties of the Cu-based material, being either corrosion-induced or chemically dissolved. Moreover, the test medium also influences the metal release process. The metal release rate increases generally with decreasing pH of the test media. However, even at a comparable pH, the release rate may be different due to differences in the interaction between the particle surface and specific media. The nature of particles is essentially different compared to massive sheet in terms of physical shape, surface composition and morphology. The surface area, and even the surface composition of metallic particles, depend on the particle size. The specific surface area of particles, area per mass, is intimately related to the particle size and has a large effect on the metal release process. Release rates increase with decreasing particle size due to a larger active surface area that takes part in the corrosion/dissolution process. The surface area that actually is active in the corrosion and metal release process (the effective area) governs the metal release process for both particles and massive sheet of metals or alloys. For particles, the effective surface area depends also on agglomeration conditions of particles during exposure. QC 2010111...|$|E

Advisor: Jonathan Schilling. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 193 pages. Biodegradation of wood by fungi offers {{an example of}} how lignocellulose can be efficiently converted from a recalcitrant mixture of complex biopolymers into readily metabolized sugars. Representing a diverse group, brown rot fungi utilize a unique, yet incompletely understood cellulolytic decay process, believed to involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals by Fenton chemistry, which rapidly depolymerize cellulose. Thermodynamically driven in the absence of enymzatic catalysis, this process can be chemically mimicked, allowing for accelerated bioconversion as fungal growth and colonization rates often bottleneck biological pretreatment times. Furthemore, brown rot fungi are able to circumvent lignin, leaving behind a potentially value-added byproduct {{in the form of an}} oxidized lignin-rich residue. This dissertation expands our understanding of brown rot decay through a set of studies with differing approaches. First, decay residues were compared across phylogenetic groupings of brown rot fungi to explore decay variability. As substrate can dictate decay rates, three distinct and representative substrate types were used. Noting significant differences in the Antrodia clade on corn stover, a separate study was conducted to explore the relationship between membership in this clade and the extent of decay they can cause in Poales grasses. Next, a survey of wood-degrading fungi was conducted to assess their ability to improve saccharification yield, the differences in variability across decay types, and to determine the relationship between chemical changes within the substrate and yield improvement. Lastly, hydroquinone-driven Fenton oxidation was both chemically mimicked and theoretically modeled to discern the efficacy of this mechanism in improving cellulose accessibility, its compatibility with cellulases, and the potential role that other redox active chemical species might have in the brown rot mechanism. Saccharification potential in relation to <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> changes in various substrates was used as a metric in most studies, allowing for consideration of the applied biotechnological benefit of brown rot, while furthering our fundamental understanding of this remarkable decay mechanism. The progression of substrate chemical component losses on a mass loss basis was found to be consistently identical among all known clades of brown rot fungi in all relevant studies. This contrasted with white rot decay, which displayed notably greater variation among tested species in how decay progressed. Despite this consistency in how brown rot decay progressed, there were notable differences between clades in their ability to initiate decay. Where a Gloeophyllum-clade representative was capable of degradation rates similar to those observed on wood substrates, Antrodia clade brown-rotters were found to have a limited ability to degrade Poales grasses. Meta-analysis indicated that this finding was consistent with previous studies. Lastly, the direct use of the Fenton reaction resulted in chemical composition changes that were consistent with brown rot. Despite this, improvement in saccharification yield was difficult to realize because of the reactivity of hydroxyl radical with the desired monosaccharide product. This suggests that if the mechanism for brown is dependent on Fenton chemistry, the manner in which hydroxyl radicals are produced by this reaction must be highly controlled...|$|E
40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} residue, a {{thermochemical}} conversion process, {{is fast becoming}} an attractive method of syngas production by extracting energy from the non-food based biomass feedstocks. Unlike the more popular biochemical processes, like fermentation of cellulosic biomass, it can operate {{with a wide range}} of biomass-feedstock in terms of feed???s quality and consistency, thus expanding the available pool of feedstock and thereby reducing the overall costs. Moreover, by doing almost complete depolymerization of the source biomass to useful gaseous products like syngas, gasification currently is the only established technology that can theoretically make the most of the energy stored in the raw biomass. However, on gasification, along with the syngas, gaseous impurities like sulfur containing species (H 2 S, COS), ammonia, alkali oxides, halides etc are also generated due to the volatile contaminants present in the biomass residue. Many downstream processes, like Fischer Tropsch synthesis, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and methanol production, use catalysts that have little tolerance with gaseous contaminants. Transition metal / metal oxide catalysts, typically employed for such value-addition processes, are especially vulnerable to sulfur containing gaseous species like hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, before this raw syngas can be used for different downstream applications, it needs to be cleaned. Among the different processes used for H 2 S removal, wet amine scrubbing has been the most popular. However, such wet processes require comparatively low operating temperatures (35 - 55 ???C). The cleaned syngas has to be subsequently reheated for the downstream processes (300 - 800 ???C). Such consecutive cooling and heating can cause considerable thermal losses. To avoid such energy losses, it is important to desulfurize the gas stream at suitably high temperatures. A solid-phase sulfur-sorbent material that has a high reactivity, good structural stability, and easy regenerability at such high temperatures can provide such an alternative. In past work, different bulk sorbents with different chemical and structural properties have been tried for high temperature desulfurization. However, in spite of numerous efforts to modify <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>compositional</b> properties, only a limited success has been achieved. It is due to sorbent's failure in meeting one or more of the aforementioned criteria. For instance, in the past, it has been demonstrated that due to mass transfer limitations, if a bulk sorbent gets completely sulfided, it is almost impossible to achieve complete regeneration afterwards, regardless of process's favorable thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. This incomplete regeneration, partly due to mass transfer limitation and subsequent loss of sorbent's surface area, leads to underutilization of the sorbent material, which is typically a transition or rare earth metal oxide. To overcome these limitations, it seems necessary that one needs to go beyond doing modifications in sorbent chemical composition alone. One option that has been little explored involves integration of tailored design and morphology of the sorbent with the process's favorable kinetics. The attempt in this work will be to describe how the structure-based modification of sorbents, specifically nanostructuring, can help in achieving improved sorbent performance for a process requiring reusable sorbents. Since the reaction time has been shown to be comparatively short, the approach here will be to come up with a sorbent design that facilitates short contact time so that deep sulfidation of sorbent can be avoided without affecting the sulfur removal capacity. As this would require high gas velocity along with sorbent's high specific surface area, the use of conventional bulk sorbent will lead to incomplete regeneration and significant pressure drop. Sorbents with tailored designs and sizes, however, can help in overcoming such limitations. The criteria for such designs should be to maximize available specific surface area along with short diffusion lengths. Nanosizing of sorbent seems as a good alternative. However, sorbent in the form of nanopowders tend to aggregate and cause mass transfer limitations similar to bulk sorbents. On the other hand, nanostructures having high aspect ratio, like nanofibers, can remain isolated; thus, potentially providing a more suitable framework for carrying out frequent cyclic sulfidation-regeneration operation. These high aspect ratio nanoscale structures can not only retain the properties from their bulk form such as favorable thermodynamics, chemical affinity etc., but they also tend to develop useful properties due to highly anisotropic geometry and confined grain size. Because of the confinement of the grain size and short contacting time, nanofibers will tend to limit the large volume changes and accompanying grain boundary collisions which are typical during repeated sulfidation/regeneration. Thus, it is expected that the use of nanostructured sorbent will not only lead to high specific surface area and improved mass-transfer, it can also lead to an improved mechanical behavior during high temperature cyclic operation. This work will present the results from the experimental investigation of such high-aspect ratio nanofibers for their potential to serve as a regenerable sorbents. Sol-gel based electrospinning was used to synthesize composite zinc and titanium oxide adsorbents in the form of non-woven fiber-mats. Two such samples, with different zinc-to-titanium atomic ratio were selected for further investigation. The Zn-to-Ti ratio for the first sample (Sample- 1) was 3. 69 and for the second sample (Sample- 2 a) it was 1. 17. Salt solutions of the respective metals, with PVP (Mw ~ 1300000) as the binding polymer, were used to prepare the corresponding sol-gels, which were then used as the precursor solutions for electrospinning of the fibers. Calcination of the as-spun fibers at 600 ???C for 4 hrs resulted in zinc-titanate fiber-mats free from polymer. These fiber mats were characterized by substantially high specific surface areas: 151. 7 and 90. 1 m 2 /g respectively. The average fiber diameter for Sample- 1 (post-sintering) was found to be 435 nm and for the second sample it was 714 nm. Fibers were then characterized for their internal crystal structure and surface morphology using the techniques of XRD, SEM and TEM. XRD results and selected-electron-diffraction done using TEM revealed that the electrospun fibers, obtained after the heat-treatment, are multi-phase and polycrystalline in nature. The crystallites formed within a fiber are within the range of 10 ??? 15 nm in size. SEM allowed observation of surface morphology of the fiber mats. Fiber diameters, ranging from 165 nm to 830 nm, were obtained. It was found that the use of inorganic binders, like lithium polysilicate, can help in reducing the spread in the fiber diameters. These specimens were subsequently tested for their high temperature reduction behavior. Testing of the reduction behavior is important as it determines the durability and resistance of the sorbent specimens in a cyclic sulfidation/regeneration operation. Temperature controlled reduction was carried out using a Thermo-gravimetric Analyzer (TGA). Fiber-based sorbents with Zn-to-Ti ratio closer to one were found to be more resistant to deactivation caused by reduction. During the reduction reaction, different compositions of the mixed oxide sorbent exhibited different regimes with different rate-controlling steps. More zinc content in the sorbent implied that the overall reaction rate was controlled by the gas-film diffusion step. Product layer diffusion step becomes rate controlling if there is comparable zinc-to-titanium content (as in Sample - 2 a). In such sample, shrinking-core mechanism can be seen in operation in which inert product layer grows as the active core shrinks. TGA was again used for the sulfidation experiments, carried out at isothermal conditions of 600 ???C with 1 % H 2 S (rest N 2) gas stream (with flow rate of 200 ml/min). It was found that the composite oxides (Zn-Ti ratio ??? 1. 1) based nanofibrous sorbent specimens (Sample- 2 a) were slightly more reactive than the specimens rich in free zinc oxide (e. g. Sample- 1 with Zn-Ti ratio ??? 3. 7, both specimens being pre-reduced). This may be an indication of higher density of active sites and surface defects in polycrystalline complex oxides as compared to simple metal oxides. Equivalent grain model was used for identification of the rate-controlling step. For majority of the reaction duration, chemical reaction step was found to be the rate-controlling step rather than the product layer diffusion ??? an indication of minimal mass transfer resistance offered by the nanofibrous sorbent specimens. During sulfidation, dendritic growth from the parent composite fibers was observed. This was attributed to specific local occurrences of the polar planes of ZnS/ZnO as fiber outer surface along with locally high gas (H 2 S) / vapor (Zn) concentration. These structures may have contributed to increased specific surface area. Also, no sulfate formation was detected post-sulfidation, as confirmed by the results from the EDX and XPS analysis. Absence of formation of any sulfate compounds during the sulfidation of nanofibrous zinc titanate adsorbent is expected to improve the chances of achieving complete regeneration. In addition, formation of wurtzite phase during sulfidation, a distinct crystal form of zinc sulfide, was seen as another potential advantage of using nanostructured sorbent morphology. Although bulk wurtzite is only metastable at temperatures less than 1020 ???C, wurtzite, in its nanocrystalline form, was apparently stable at lower temperatures (??? 600 ???C). Wurtzite tend to oxidize directly to zinc oxide whereas oxidation of sphalerite (another ZnS crystal form) has been reportedly linked with the formation of ZnSO 4 and Zn 3 O(SO 4) 2. Regeneration experiments were carried out at the same temperature as the sulfidation (600 ???C) with a gas stream containing 3 % O 2 (rest nitrogen) flowing at 200 ml /min. Comparing the reaction data for the two different specimens (Sample- 1 vs Sample- 2 a), sorbent specimens rich in zinc titanates (Sample- 2 a) showed faster kinetics than the zinc oxide sorbents (both pre-reduced). It was found that it is possible to achieve complete regeneration without raising the sulfidation temperature (600 ???C). Again, results from the XPS analysis confirmed no formation of sulfates on oxidation even when the regeneration temperature was kept same as the sulfidation temperature. Structural properties of the sorbent specimen like the fibrous morphology, grain size of the fresh sorbent mostly remained intact in the regenerated specimens. Multi-cycle sulfidation and regeneration tests found that the nanofibrous design of zinc titanate sorbents can successfully withstand repeated sulfidation-regeneration operations whithout suffering microstructure degradation while maintainng high sulfur capacities. Progressive improvement in the textural properties of the fiber was seen as the reason for better performance. Activation energy associated with the sulfidation reaction was also found to be atleast 3 times smaller than that needed for the other sorbent geometries. All these observations promise an enhanced performance of composite oxides with nanofibrous morphology in a process requiring regenerable sorbents. These findings confirm the main propositions of this work that the sorbent morphology and overall structure influence the sorbent performance as much as the compositional modifications. The above-discussed modifications in the sorbent morphology helped in overcoming some problem areas generally associated with the compositionally-enhanced metal oxides; for instance their lower reactivity, the requirement of high regeneration temperatures, mass transfer controlled overall rate and the consequent incomplete regeneration, all were found to be absent in the above nanostructured sorbent specimens. Future studies will explore the extent to which these improvements can be sustained in a many-cycle operation...|$|E

Among the many discoveries included several surprising characteristics about the surface of Mercury, including elevated S abundances (up to 4 percent by weight), low Fe abundances (less than 4 percent by weight), and relatively low O abundances (O/Si ratio of 1. 40 plus or minus 0. 03). The surface chemistry as determined by MESSENGER {{has been used to}} identify up to nine distinct geochemical terranes on Mercury. Numerous modeling and experimental efforts have been undertaken to infer the mineralogy and petrology of mercurian lavas and surface materials. However, all of these efforts have presumed valence states for each of the elements according to the following: Si 4 +, Ti 4 +, Al 3 +, Cr 2 +, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Na+, K+, S 2 -, Cl-. Based on these valence assignments, cations are charged balanced with the anions O 2 -, S 2 -, and Cl- and the compositions are recast in terms of oxides, sulfides, and chlorides. Based on these assumptions, the geochemical terranes that have been identified on Mercury yield O/Si wt. ratios ranging from 1. 61 to 1. 84, which is substantially higher than the preliminary O/Si ratio of 1. 40 plus or minus 0. 03 determined by the MESSENGER GRS].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review current studies {{concerning}} the relationship of fuel composition to vehicle engine-out and tail-pipe emissions and to outline future research needed in this area. A number of recent combustion experiments and vehicle studies demonstrated that reformulated gasoline can reduce vehicle engine-out, tail-pipe, running-loss, and evaporative emissions. Some of these studies were extended to understand the fundamental relationships between fuel composition and emissions. To further establish these relationships, it was necessary to develop advanced analytical methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of hydrocarbons in fuels and vehicle emissions. The development of real-time techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, laser diode spectroscopy, and atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry were useful in studying the transient behavior of exhaust emissions under various engine operating conditions. Laboratory studies using specific fuels and fuel blends were carried out using pulse flame combustors, single- and multicylinder engines, and vehicle fleets. Chemometric statistical methods were used to analyze the large volumes of emissions data generated from these studies. Models were developed that were able to accurately predict tail-pipe emissions from fuel <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>compositional</b> data. Some of the primary fuel precursors for benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and C 2 -C 4 alkene emissions are described.

Although the number of sample is small, the crystallization sequence and presence of two types of magma can be recognized from the following mineral textures and compositions : (1) Plagioclase occurs as a post-cumulus phase in rocks from the Lower Zone to lower subzone in the Critical Zone, whereas it occurs as a cumulus phase in rocks from the upper subzone in the Critical Zone, Main Zone and Upper Zone. (2) A distinctive compositional difference of plagioclase and orthopyroxene can be seen between the lower subzone and upper subzone in the Critical Zone. In the lower subzone in the Critical Zone, post-cumulus plagioclase has low An {{within the range of}} 74 - 50,whereas the upper subzone has An= 83 - 63. This result is consistent with previous work.
