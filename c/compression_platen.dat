40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of dynamic compression on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) chondrogenesis. Dynamic compression was applied to agarose hydrogels seeded with bone marrow-derived adult equine MSCs. In the absence of the chondrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGFb), dynamic compression applied for 12 h per day led to significantly greater proteoglycan synthesis than in unloaded TGFb-free cultures, although at a rate that was approximately 20 % to 35 % of unloaded TGFb cultures. These data suggest that the emergence of aggrecan dominated a chondrogenic response to loading as increases in proteoglycan synthesis. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to subjectively identify potential spatial distributions of heterogeneous differentiation. In loaded samples, cell viability and metachromatic staining was low near the porous <b>compression</b> <b>platen</b> interface but increased with depth, reaching levels in the lower portion of the hydrogel that resembled unloaded TGFb cultures. These results suggest that the combination of high hydrostatic pressure and low dynamic strain and fluid flow had a stronger effect on chondrogenesis than did low hydrostatic pressure coupled with high dynamic strain and fluid flow. Next, the 12 -h per day loading protocol was applied in the presence of TGFb. Biosynthesis in loaded cultures was less than in unloaded TGFb samples. Taken together, these data suggest that the duration of loading necessary to stimulate mechanoinduction of MSCs may not be optimal for neo-tissue accumulation in the presence of chondrogenic cytokines.

40|$|Two phase alpha/beta {{titanium}} alloys {{are used in}} a wide variety of applications such as aerospace, biomedical, gas turbine engine, sport and energy. These alloys have high specific strength and specific modulus as compared to magnesium and aluminium alloys as well as excellent corrosion resistance. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (α+β) alloy is the most widely used and the best known of all the Ti alloys. Although there are a number of observations in the literature reporting the mechanical responses of these two phase alloys, there exists very little understanding of the mechanisms of the individual phases and the alpha/beta interface’s role in strengthening. Additionally, it has often been reported in the literature that ‘smaller is stronger’ for different metals due to the presence of a size effect. There is no real understanding of the mechanism of the size effect in the alpha-beta titanium and HCP and its dependence on orientation. Single alpha, beta and alpha-beta colony micro-pillars have been manufactured from a polycrystalline commercial Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sample using Focused Ion Beam (FIB). Alpha/beta pillar contained two alpha lamellae separated by a thin fillet of beta phase. A nano-indenter was then used to conduct uniaxial micro-compression tests on Ti alloy single crystals, using a diamond flat tip as a <b>compression</b> <b>platen.</b> By controlling the crystal orientation along the micro-pillar using Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) different slip systems have been selectively activated. The advantage of the micro-compression method over conventional mechanical testing techniques is the ability to localize a single crystal volume which is characterisable after deformation. This study makes a contribution to knowledge in several key areas, including an understanding of the mechanical response of different crystals at micro/submicro-scale, the effect of phase interfaces on deformation, and an understanding of the strengthening mechanism in two-phase Ti alloys, the orientation size effect in HCP metals and the CRSSs for each phase in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Therefore, in order to evaluate the behaviour of these alloys for future applications, it is imperative that the microstructural features and characteristics be quantified and examined on a small scale. The results showed that the beta phase in between alpha lamellae caused strengthening deformation. When the surface normal is parallel to the [0001] of the single alpha crystal, the material deforms with difficulty in the [0001] direction of the single alpha phase. The mechanical responses of the alpha, beta, and alpha/beta crystals not only depended on the size of the pillars, but also on the crystallographic orientation, the initial dislocation density and the relationship between the two phases in the case of α/β crystals. Extensive electron microscopy investigation revealed that the anisotropy in basal and prismatic slip systems can be directly correlated with the transmission of dislocations across the single crystal, the beta laths, and the accumulation of residual dislocation content near the interfaces and in the single beta phase. This information is essential in order to better model mechanical deformation in these materials. In addition, dislocation analysis indicated that the deformation of individual grains conformed to the Schmid factor (SF) analysis where slip primarily occurs on those slip systems where the resolved shear stress (SF) values are highest. The results presented in this thesis bring to light several concerns for designing with {{titanium alloys}} and identify a number of phenomena of strong scientific interest. They will allow for the development of realistic models for the mechanical behaviour and provide a comprehensive analysis that can contribute to the theoretical development of the design and enhancement of the titanium allows. Moreover, the role of crystallography in plastic deformation provides a novel insight into the nature of the orientation size effect in HCP. This work points towards the need for further investigations into the higher and lower temperature deformation behaviour of Ti- 64 to fully understand the phenomena identified within this study...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} and mechanical properties of short fibre-reinforced polymer composites {{depend on the}} geometry, content, distribution and orientation of fibres within the polymer matrix. These microstructure features are mainly induced during the forming stage, i. e., when composites usually flow in moulds and behave as non-Newtonian fibre suspensions. Their flow-induced microstructures still cannot be well predicted by current rheological models. To better understand them, non-Newtonian dilute fibre suspensions were prepared and subjected to lubricated compression experiments using a micro-rheometer mounted in a synchrotron X-ray microtomograph. These experiments enabled, for the first time, fast and in situ 3 D imaging of the translation and rotation of fibres in the suspending fluid. Fibre motions were compared with the prediction of the Jeffery's model. Despite {{the use of a}} non-Newtonian suspending fluid and confined flow conditions, i. e., with a gap between <b>compression</b> <b>platens</b> of the same order of magnitude than the fibre length, we showed that Jeffery's prediction was satisfactory if the fibres were sufficiently far from the <b>compression</b> <b>platens</b> (approximately at a distance of once to twice their diameter).

Buckling of {{compressed}} flat-end columns loaded by unattached flat platens is shown, theoretically and experimentally, {{to occur}} {{first at the}} critical load and associated mode shape of a built-in column, followed extremely closely by a second critical load and different mode shape characterized by column end-tilt. The theoretical critical load for secondary or end tilt buckling is shown to be only 0. 13 % greater than the critical load for primary buckling, in which the ends are in full contact with the <b>compression</b> <b>platens.</b> The experimental value is consistent with this theoretical one. Interestingly, under displacement control, the first buckling instability {{is characterized by a}} smoothly-increasing applied load, whereas the closely-following second instability causes an abrupt and large load drop (and hence exhibits incremental negative stiffness).

40|$|Abstract Background The compressional modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{an important}} mechanical property for understanding stalk lodging, but this property is rarely available for thin-walled plant stems such as maize and sorghum because excised tissue samples from these plants are highly susceptible to buckling. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a testing protocol that provides accurate and reliable measurements of the compressive {{modulus of elasticity}} of the rind of pith-filled plant stems. The general approach was to relying upon standard methods and practices as much as possible, while developing new techniques as necessary. Results Two methods were developed for measuring the compressional modulus of elasticity of pith-filled node–node specimens. Both methods had an average repeatability of ±  4 %. The use of natural plant morphology and architecture was used to avoid buckling failure. Both methods relied up on spherical <b>compression</b> <b>platens</b> to accommodate inaccuracies in sample preparation. The effect of sample position within the test fixture was quantified to ensure that sample placement did not introduce systematic errors.

Results indicate that die temperature has a strong effect on bulge radius and friction factor.

As {{a result of this}} rapid quenching operation, residual stresses of yield strength magnitude can develop, leaving the material in an unsuitable condition for further machining operations and for service.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) should ideally have {{mechanical properties}} {{similar to those}} of the bone tissue the material is used to replace or repair. Usually, the compressive strength of the CPCs is reported and, more rarely, the elastic modulus. Conversely, scarce or no data are available on Poisson's ratio and strain-to-crack-initiation. This is unfortunate, as data on the elastic response is key to, e. g., numerical model accuracy. In this study, the compressive behaviour of brushite, monetite and apatite cements was fully characterised. Measurement of the surface strains was done using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and compared to results obtained with the commonly used built-in displacement measurement of the materials testers. The collected data showed that the use of fixed <b>compression</b> <b>platens,</b> as opposed to spherically seated ones, may in some cases underestimate the compressive strength by up to 40 %. Also, the built-in measurements may underestimate the elastic modulus by up to 62 % as compared to DIC measurements. Using DIC, the brushite cement was found to be much stiffer (24. 3 ± 2. 3  GPa) than the apatite (13. 5 ± 1. 6  GPa) and monetite (7. 1 ± 1. 0  GPa) cements, and elastic moduli were inversely related to the porosity of the materials. Poisson's ratio was determined to be 0. 26 ± 0. 02 for brushite, 0. 21 ± 0. 02 for apatite and 0. 20 ± 0. 03 for monetite. All investigated CPCs showed low strain-to-crack-initiation (0. 17 – 0. 19 %). In summary, the elastic modulus of CPCs is substantially higher than previously reported and it is concluded that an accurate procedure is a prerequisite in order to properly compare the mechanical properties of different CPC formulations. It is recommended to use spherically seated platens and measuring the strain at a relevant resolution and on the specimen surface. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study focused on the reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression</b> (RPC) test of cancellous bone in the rodent proximal tibia. The objective was to improve methods for this mechanical test, specifically in the areas of specimen location, specimen preparation, and platen sizing. Analytical studies were utilized to assess the effect of platen size and shape on the resultant values obtained for elastic modulus of cancellous bone induced by compression. RPC specimens are made from transverse slices of the proximal tibial metaphysis. The specimen location was determined using radiographic methods in which the distance from the proximal end of the bone to the distal extent of the growth plate was measured. Using this distance, 2 -mm thick specimens were cut from the metaphysis and then platen sized for testing. Three platen sizing methods, which were based on various imaging methods, were studied. The cancellous bone was then tested under compression to failure. Three-dimensional finite element models of the specimens under the loading scenario were created with the ANSYS package. The models incorporated specimen geometry in the cross-sectional plane and through the thickness of the sample. The models were used to conduct parametric studies of the effects of platen size and shape on the percent error in elastic modulus as determined by the reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression</b> test. Based on this study, several improvements to the reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression</b> test were recommended.

The objective {{of this study was}} to improve the current testing methods with an emphasis on the location of the RPC specimens, and to correlate the mechanical properties of the rodent cancellous bone with the various density measures. Analytical studies were made to assess the effect of the size and shape of the platen based on the values from mechanical testing of the cancellous bone. RPC specimens are made from transverse slices of the proximal tibia metaphysis. Specimen location was determined using planar radiograph method at a distance of 1. 75 mm distal to the growth plate. The distance from the top of the proximal tibia to the line at 1. 75 mm distal to the growth plate was measured and this distance is termed as the first cut distance. Specimen thickness of 2 mm was then cut for the RPC test. Endocortical method was followed to determine the platen sizing for RPC testing. The cancellous bone was then tested in compression to failure. Correlations were performed between the mechanical properties of the cancellous bone and the density measures from pQCT and radiographic techniques. SigmaStat and TableCurve 2 D were used to perform the correlations and estimate the P value for the correlation. Linear and power law fits were made for all the correlations. Based on this study, several improvements to the reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression</b> test were recommended. An improved specimen location method was developed.

Adult 6 -mo. old male rats were assigned to 3 groups of 12 each: hindlimb unloaded (HU), aging cage control (CC), and baseline (BL). The CC group was pair-fed to match the nutritional intake of HU animals during the 28 days of the study. The left leg was exercised 3 days a week {{for the duration of the}} study, with the unexercised right leg serving as a contra-lateral control. Mechanical tests were conducted to assess the strength of cancellous bone in the proximal tibia metaphysis.

It is also notable that ultimate stress was 32 % higher (but not statistically significant) for HU-Ex compared to CC.

These improvements are aimed at decreasing {{the amount of time}} required to complete an RPC analysis and improving the quality of the obtained results. High-resolution micro-CT scans are used {{to gain a better understanding}} of rat long bone anatomy by quantifying the location, shape, and orientation of the growth plate, primary spongiosa, and secondary spongiosa. Micro-CT analysis shows that there are easily identifiable external landmarks on the anterior side of both tibias and femurs that identify the end of the growth plate and the point at which the top of an ideal RPC specimen should be located. The landmarks are the most proximal tip of the patellar surface for the femur and the base of the tibial tuberosity for the tibia. This study also analyzes the effect of variations in the actual RPC specimen location from the ideal location and the effect of different platen sizes on test results using BMD as a surrogate for mechanical properties. The analysis shows that the BMD increases as the target RPC specimen location approaches the growth plate and decreases on moving away from the growth plate. The study also indicates that consistency is necessary when obtaining RPC specimens to avoid error due to variation from the specified landmark. Additionally, the BMD decreased as the diameter of the platen is reduced. Choosing platen size then becomes a trade off between testing the greatest amount of cancellous bone possible and potentially higher load sharing by the cortical shell with larger platen sizes as well as the risk of compressing cortical bone during the test...|$|R
40|$|The {{wedge shape}} {{is a fairly}} common {{cross-section}} found in many non-axisymmetric components used in machines, aircraft, ships and automobiles. If such components are forged between two mutually inclined dies the metal displaced by the dies flows into the converging as well as into the diverging channels created by the inclined dies. The extent of each type of flow (convergent/divergent) depends on the die—material interface friction and the included die angle. Given the initial cross-section, the length {{as well as the}} exact geometry of the forged cross-section are therefore uniquely determined by these parameters. In this paper a simple stress analysis is used to predict changes in the geometry of a wedge undergoing <b>compression</b> between inclined <b>platens.</b> The flow in directions normal to the cross-section is assumed to be negligible. Experiments carried out using wedge-shaped lead billets show that, knowing the interface friction {{and as long as the}} deformation is not too large, the dimensional changes in the wedge can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The predicted flow behaviour of metal for a wide range of die angles and interface friction is presented: these characteristics can be used by the die designer to choose the die lubricant (only) if the die angle is specified and to choose both of these parameters if there is no restriction on the exact die angle. The present work shows that the length of a wedge undergoing compression is highly sensitive to die—material interface friction. Thus in a situation where the top and bottom dies are inclined to each other, a wedge made of the material to be forged could be put between the dies and then compressed, whereupon the length of the compressed wedge — given the degree of compression — affords an estimate of the die—material interface friction...|$|R
40|$|Bisphosphonates {{have been}} shown to be an {{effective}} method to treat detrimental bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis. In microgravity, astronauts experience mechanical unloading of the skeleton. This can cause detrimental bone loss. Bisphosphonates offer astronauts a pharmacological method to combat the negative effect of space flight. This study looked at the effectiveness of two bisphosphonate drug treatments administered prior to hindlimb unloading (HU) and their effect as a countermeasure to disuse induced bone loss and recovery following reambulation. The model used to mimic space flight was the adult HU rat model, specifically 6 -month old, male, Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats underwent 28 days of pre-treatment, 28 days of HU and 56 days of recovery. The rats were divided into four treatment groups. The groups included an age-matched control group (AC) that did not undergo HU. The other groups that underwent HU were hindlimb unloaded control (HUC), alendronate pre-treated (ALN), and risedronate pre-treated (RIS). The effects of pre-treatment and the differences between the two drugs were explored. Data were collected ex vivo from left tibia using peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) and mechanical testing at both the proximal metaphysis and the mid-diaphysis. The results of this study showed that bisphosphonates were able to prevent the bone loss that was seen in the HUC animals, and maintain bone at levels that were not statistically different from AC. Metaphysis pQCT scans showed that the drugs were able to significantly combat losses due to HU and were specifically effective in the cancellous bone. Reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression</b> tests showed that ALN and RIS were able to maintain cancellous strength in the metaphysis. Mid-diaphysis pQCT scans and 3 -point bend tests showed no significant changes in cortical bone due to the drug treatments or HU. Over recovery there were no indications that bisphosphonate pre-treated animals fared worse than AC, despite the fact that they did not completely recover all lost bone.

40|$|Extended {{periods of}} {{mechanical}} unloading {{are known to}} be detrimental to bone health. Astronauts who spend months in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are at particular risk. It is anticipated that NASA will not drastically increase the size of the astronaut corps, and this will mean increased likelihood of repeat missions for more astronauts. Thus, it is important to better understand the effects that prolonged, multiple bouts of unloading have on bone. This study utilized the hindlimb unloaded (HU) rat model to examine bone loss and recovery for single and double unloading bouts. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 months old) were randomized into the following groups: baseline (sacrificed at 6 months), 1 HU 7 (unloaded for 1 month, weight-bearing recovery for 3 months), 2 HU 10 (unloaded for 1 month, recovered for 2 months, unloaded for another month, and then recovered 2 months), 1 HU 10 (normal cage activity until 1 month HU ending at month 10, 2 month recovery followed), and aging controls (remained ambulatory throughout experiment). Every month (28 days), animals were terminated and the left femurs were excised, resulting in n= 15 per group for each time point. Mineral and geometric properties were measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at the distal femur metaphysis, and quasi-static reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression</b> (RPC) was used to estimate the mechanical properties of cancellous bone. Strength indices based on pQCT parameters were calculated as predictors of mechanical properties. Bone mass properties decreased due to HU and recovered within 2 - 3 months post-HU. A combination of increased periosteal apposition and endocortical resorption also occurred during HU. The initial HU bout suppressed normal age-related increases in mechanical properties and recovered within 1 - 2 months. Cancellous compressive strength index (CSI) most closely matched changes in mechanical properties. A second HU bout after two months recovery had a less detrimental effect on pQCT parameters but a greater negative impact on mechanical properties, when compared to pre-HU values. The opposite is true for mechanical properties if loss is characterized relative to aging controls.

Skeletally mature female beagles (n = 12 per group) were treated daily for 1 yr with oral doses of vehicle or raloxifene (0. 50 mg/kg d). Trabecular bone mechanical properties were measured at the femoral neck using reduced <b>platen</b> <b>compression,</b> a method that allows the trabecular bone to be tested without coring specimens. Cortical bone properties were assessed on prismatic beam specimens machined from the femoral diaphysis using both monotonic and dynamic (cyclic relaxation) four-point bending tests. Trabecular bone from raloxifene-treated animals had significantly higher ultimate stress (+ 130 %), modulus (+ 89 %), and toughness (+ 152 %) compared with vehicle-treated animals. Cortical bone from raloxifene-treated animals had significantly greater toughness (+ 62 %) compared with vehicle, primarily as a function of increased postyield displacement (+ 100 %). There was no significant difference between groups in the percentage of stiffness loss during cortical bone cyclic relaxation tests. These results are consistent with previous data from the vertebrae of these same animals, showing raloxifene has positive effects on biomechanical properties independent of changes in bone volume/density. This may help explain how raloxifene reduces osteoporotic fractures despite modest changes in bone mass.

The skeleton functions as a vital part of our everyday existence and acts as a framework for the body to provide movement, resist the forces of gravity, and protect vital organs. Skeletal research studies the effect of disease, lifestyle, and stimuli on the skeleton and its ability to perform these everyday functions. The current state of bone testing is focused on understanding the mechanical properties of bone through use of traditional mechanical testing procedures such as three point bending, torsion, and compression testing. The traditional method of compression testing involves compressing a bone specimen between two parallel platens to failure or until a desired displacement is obtained. This method is useful for studying the properties of the entire bone sample. Bone can be categorized into two major types: cortical bone and cancellous bone. Current compression testing techniques do not allow the properties of cancellous bone to be determined. The Reduced <b>Platen</b> <b>Compression</b> Test attempts to improve the traditional compression test to allow cancellous bone to be tested while the outer cortical shell remains on the specimen by using smaller diameter platens to compress only the inner cancellous area of the specimen. The RPC is relatively new and several questions still remain as to the correct method for identifying the location and size of the test specimen. Rat femurs used in preliminary RPC Testing were analyzed to determine the best method for locating and sizing the test specimen. X-rays of approximately 120 rat femurs were studied to see if a standard location and size could be defined for the RPC test specimen. The results indicate that the rat femur develops too inconsistently for a standard length or percentage of the overall length to be used to define the location. The best method for locating the specimen is to identify the location of the distal end of the epiphyseal growth plate and take the specimen just below that location. The results also indicate that the best method for defining the specimen thickness is to average the largest and smallest overall bone lengths in the test group and use a reference thickness of 2 millimeters as a percentage of this average length. This percentage of the overall average length then defines the specimen thickness for each individual bone...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} thesis {{was written}} in 1989 / 90 on a Macintosh Plus with a processor at 8 Mhz and 2. 5 Mb of RAM; it was written using Micro$oft Word Version 4 for the Macintosh {{and all of the}} figures, {{with the exception of the}} photographs, were included. Significant changes in computer technology have occurred in the years between the writing and the generation of this electronic copy in 2008, there have been some problems with backward compatibility of the software used, in particular with respect to the graphics handling capability, so there have been some significant problems with the use of old file formats; consequently not all of the figures are as clear as they were when the original was written. Tubes of glass reinforced thermosetting resins have been tested in axial <b>compression</b> between steel <b>platens</b> with one end chamfered to prevent critically high loads causing catastrophic centre failure. By testing in such a manner these tubes crush in a progressive and controlled manner, and are capable of exhibiting high levels of energy absorption, particularly when related to the material mass involved. Polymers are known to display viscoelastic behaviour and polymer composites are similarly sensitive to test speed and temperature. Energy absorption in tube crushing has been shown to be speed and temperature sensitive and the purpose of this project has been to understand the variability of the energy absorption and the associated mechanisms. The main aim has been to show how the two variables interrelate. The materials used have been produced by hot rolling of pre-preg cloth or by resinjection into closed moulds. Reinforcement has consisted of woven glass cloth or random glass mat; matrix materials have been epoxy and polyester resins. Trends to higher values of specific energy absorption with increasing speed have been observed for epoxy matrix tubes, while polyester matrix tubes have shown less certain trends and give lower values of specific energy absorption at high speeds. All the tubes have shown a rapid drop in specific energy absorption with increasing temperature above normal room temperature, with changes in crush mode being very apparent. At temperatures in excess of about 100 degrees C the tubes have failed by centre buckling, the transition temperature from normal crushing to buckling being sensitive to the crush speed. The interrelation between speed and temperature effects has been examined. Three factors that prevent simple interrelation have been identified; these are inertial effects of crush debris, residual stresses in the hoop direction of the tube and frictional heating in the crush zone. Speed sensitivity of the energy absorption has been determined over a range of temperatures and various features of these responses related to the responses of the material properties. Frictional temperature rises have been modelled mathematically and the predictions have been shown to be reasonably consistent with experimental measurements. These temperature rises have been shown to be important in determining the speed sensitive behaviour of the energy absorption levels, particularly for polyester resin matrix tubes tested at high speeds...|$|R
