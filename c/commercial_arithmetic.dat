He {{was an expert}} mathematician and geometer, writing books on solid geometry and [...] perspective, including De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting), Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise), and De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids). The historian Vasari in his Lives of the Painters calls Piero the [...] "greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time." [...] Piero's interest in perspective {{can be seen in}} his paintings including the Polyptych of Perugia, the San Agostino altarpiece and The Flagellation of Christ. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including Luca Pacioli in his De Divina Proportione and Leonardo da Vinci. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of Archimedes. He was taught <b>commercial</b> <b>arithmetic</b> in [...] "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks, perhaps including Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)'s 1202 Liber Abaci. Linear perspective was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 De pictura: [...] "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of pyramid with the eye as vertex." [...] A painting constructed with linear perspective is a cross-section of that pyramid.|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} reason {{for the lack of}} <b>commercial</b> residue <b>arithmetic</b> (RA) based systems is not the “slow” and area consuming reverse conversion, but the absence of research that explores the system-level trade-offs of such arithmetic in actual VLSI implementations. Such system-level issues are-choice of the moduli set, effect of moduli imbalance on resulting VLSI implementation, choice of the reverse and forward convertors, use of lookup versus computation for modular operations, system characteristics that indicate RA suitability and finally, typical VLSI area and performance figures. This paper explains these concerns by presenting novel RA architectures for VLSI correlators employed in radioastronomy and ultrasonic blood flow measurement.

This model is extensively simulated to ensure correct functionality and performance. Later, a Register Transfer Level (RTL) implementation is created in Verilog, either manually by a designer or automatically by a high-level synthesis tool. It is essential to check that the C and Verilog programs are consistent. In this paper, we present a two-step approach, embodied in two equivalence checking tools, VERIFOX and HW-CBMC, to validate designs at the software and RTL levels, respectively. VERIFOX is used for equivalence checking of an untimed software model in C against a high-level reference model in C. HW-CBMC verifies the equivalence of a Verilog RTL implementation against an untimed software model in C.

40|$|Decimal {{arithmetic}} {{has gained}} high {{impact on the}} overall performance of today’s financial and <b>commercial</b> applications. Decimal <b>arithmetic</b> is pervasive in human-oriented applications but has a limited use in numerical data processing. Decimal additions and multiplication plays a main role in decimal operations which is used in any decimal arithmetic algorithm. Decimal digit adders and decimal digit multipliers are usually the building blocks for higher order decimal adders and multipliers. FPGAs provide an efficient hardware platform that can be employed for accelerating decimal algorithms. In this paper, different designs for two decimal digit adders and one decimal digit multiplier are proposed. The proposed designs were described, functionally tested, and implemented using VHDL and the Xilinx ISE 10. 1 targeting Xilinx Vertix- 5 XC 5 VLX 30 - 3 FPGA. This design is mainly used to decrease the area and as well as increase the functioning speed. Implementation results and comparison with existing designs are provided...|$|R

In 1876, he and his brother, Elias, established a horse and cattle ranch in Meadowville, Rich County, and moved there with their immediate family.

For the purpose of continuing his education he studied civil engineering at the Institute for Literature {{of the state of}} Yucatan, under the wise leadership of Manuel Cepeda Sales. At that time, facing the danger of a collapse of one of the towers of the Cathedral of Yucatan, the authorities asked the teacher Sales Cepeda to assist in determining the weight of the church bell that had been ignored. The teacher passed the problem on to Ricalde Gamboa who did the calculations exactly. Since then he was appointed professor of rational arithmetic at the Institute where he studied. For various reasons he could no longer continue his desire to study engineering, but soon after, in 1902, he was appointed professor and later director of his own engineering school, a position he continued until 1905 when he resigned to devote himself to the studies of mathematics and became a correspondent for various specialized institutions abroad.|$|E

Phelps, who had been conducting business institutes in Bozeman and Livingston, Montana. Initially the business curriculum {{was supported by the}} college to ensure that women would enroll. Economics and agricultural economics would eventually provide a more theoretical approach to some of the business subjects, but in the beginning, typewriting, shorthand, business machine operation, and office management constituted the basic courses. The secretarial and business options maintained a strong attraction for years, but in time, Leona Barnes, Bernice Lamb, John Blankenhorn, Alfred Day, and Harvey Larson presided over the transition to a truly professional business curriculum. It wasn’t until 1958-1959, when the department of commerce emerged to join with the new College of Professional Schools. While general business remained the most popular option, accounting attracted an increasing number of students. In 1975, the core areas of the school were realigned and emphasis was placed on accounting, finance, management, marketing, and international trade.|$|E

From {{the very beginning of}} the Commerce department was run in the evening in the interest of the otherwise employed students. But with the increasing tendency of the girl students to study commerce, the department was shifted from the evening to the morning. In view of the ever-increasing need and demand of the locality, Calcutta University offered affiliation in Honours Course in Bengali, English, Chemistry, History, Political Science, Mathematics, Economics and Accountancy at degree level in quick succession. But since 1985, the affiliation of the colleges of undivided Midnapore district was changed from C.U. to V.U. by the Govt. policy and affiliation in Honours course was obtained from V.U. in Physics, Zoology, Botany, Physiology, Philosophy and Sanskrit. Recently, self-financed courses in Geography, Education, Physical Education, Computer science have been introduced. The college is now more or less equipped with a good no. of faculty members, technical staff and ministerial staff. The college is governed by a well-coordinated Governing Body.

It began teaching commercial subjects and placed graduates in business positions. Paul Kenneth Smith, son of James Ayers Smith, began as the typewriter machinist and later served as an instructor at the college. For about 19 years, Stevens-Henager College was known as Intermountain Business College. A Biennial Catalogue for enrollment 1908-09 shows the schools name as The Smithsonian Business College and Shorthand School, 258 Twenty Fourth Street, Ogden, Utah. The faculty and staff were James A.
