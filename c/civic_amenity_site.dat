On {{the western side of}} the woodland, adjacent to Valley Road which runs through the Nightingale Valley, sits another disused quarry which now is the site for the local <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
50|$|Altens {{is home to}} a large {{industrial}} estate, alongside a similar estate in neighbouring Tullos. The industrial estates have offices, including a large facility built for Royal Dutch Shell, as well as industrial units of various sizes, including the Royal Mail's main mail centre for the North East of Scotland. There are also warehouses, car dealerships, and a <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
50|$|A major {{constraint}} in {{the optimal}} recycling of materials {{is that at}} <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites,</b> products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin, but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin.|$|R
50|$|The {{feedstock}} for {{the plant}} is wood which has {{reached the end of}} its useful life such as old shipping pallets, manufacturing offcuts, wood from the construction and demolition industries, and material from <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites.</b> This wood is collected through a network set up by Dalkia The fuel would other wise be sent to landfill.|$|R
50|$|Glass {{collection}} points, {{known as}} Bottle Banks are very common near shopping centres, at <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites</b> and in local {{neighborhoods in the}} United Kingdom. Bottle Banks commonly stand beside collection points for other recyclable waste like paper, metals and plastics. Local, municipal waste collectors usually have one central point {{for all types of}} waste in which large glass containers are located. There are now over 50,000 bottle banks in the United Kingdom, and 752,000 tons of glass are now recycled annually.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} of the zone runs north along the Prinzregentenstraße avenue then west of the square Vogelweideplatz between the <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> and the tram depot on the railway track which forms the eastern border, where the entire track is still part of Haidhausen. In the south the Rosenheimer, Hoch, Rabl and Balanstraße streets form the border with Au. To the west there are the right banks of the Isar river.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a new}} {{bridge over}} fabian way linking Port Tennant to the docks and SA1 area. The Killvey {{woodland}} {{is a great place}} to walk a see the panoramic views of Swansea bay and beyond. There are horses stables on the side of the mountain and hotels car dealerships, petrol stations, post offices all within Port Tennant. The Tir John landfill site and adjacent <b>Civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> is located east of the residential area.|$|E
50|$|A <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> (CA site) or {{household}} waste recycling centre (HWRC) is a facility where {{the public can}} dispose of {{household waste}} and also often containing recycling points. Civic amenity sites are run by the local authority in a given area. Collection points for recyclable waste such as green waste, metals, glass and other waste types (including WVO) are available. Items that cannot be collected by local waste collection schemes such as bulky waste are also provided.|$|E
50|$|Glass {{collection}} points, {{known as}} Bottle Banks are very common near shopping centres, at <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites</b> and in local {{neighborhoods in the}} United Kingdom. The first Bottle Bank was introduced by Stanley Race CBE, then president of the Glass Manufacturers’ Federation and Ron England in Barnsley on 6 June 1977. Development work {{was done by the}} DoE at Warren Springs laboratory, Stevenage, (now AERA at Harwell) and Nazeing Glass Works, Broxboure to prove if a usable glass product could be made from over 90% recycled glass. It was found necessary to use magnets to remove unwanted metal closures in the mixture.|$|R
50|$|Obviously, {{disassembling}} {{products is}} not feasible at currently designed <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites,</b> {{and a better}} method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer, so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product. These disassembled product can then be used for making new products {{or at least to}} have the components sent separately to recycling sites (for proper recycling, by the exact type of material). At present though, few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to take back their products for disassembly, nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle-to-cradle products. One process where this is happening is in the EU with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938 the Local Government Board was {{empowered}} {{to create a}} board (commonly {{referred to as a}} [...] "combination authority") consisting of members of two or more local authorities to exercise specified functions of those authorities. Such an authority, now called a [...] "joint board", is a body corporate, and its members are appointed from the members of the constituent local authorities (and in some cases representatives of the Department of Local Government and the Environment). Joint boards are created for a specified purpose, and existing boards deal with refuse collection, sheltered accommodation, <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites,</b> and swimming pools. Local authorities also have power to set up [...] "joint committees", which are similar to joint boards but are not bodies corporate.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{miniature}} model railway (open {{to the public}} on bank-holidays in the summer), and before 2009 was home to The Bible College of Wales. The edge of Derwen Fawr and Clyne Valley Country park is also {{the location of a}} <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site,</b> still open to the public. However, the attached landfill site, which was once the main facility for the City of Swansea, closed in the 1980s when the Tir John site in St. Thomas, Swansea took over as the Swansea's main refuse site.|$|E
50|$|The first (at 51.471456,-2.790383) {{is from a}} {{minor road}} which leads north from the Portishead to Weston in Gordano road; just past the <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site.</b> It enters the north {{west side of the}} wood and leads up a set of steps to the main {{circular}} path through the woods. The second entrance (at 51.467293,-2.783898) leads past the old quarries along a pathway which leads along the south eastern side of the wood. A final entrance is off Underwood Road in Portishead (at 51.472967,-2.777782) and enters {{the eastern side of the}} wood. A circular walk has been marked out inside the wood.|$|E
50|$|The {{school was}} started in 1985 in rented {{premises}} with 18 children with classes Nursery to III. This {{was made possible by}} the support of Mr. B. Ratnakar, the then chairman of Canara Bank who made sure that the loan was sanctioned for starting the school. In 1986 the No Objection Certificate was obtained from the Government of Karnataka and the strength of the school grew to 30. In 1987, the school was granted Provisional Affiliation by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. Then began the search for a piece of land. After a lot of wrangling and struggle the present <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> was allotted to the school.|$|E
40|$|Local waste {{management}} strategies {{need to take}} into account all household waste arisings, including those taken to <b>Civic</b> <b>Amenity</b> <b>sites</b> (also known as Household Waste Recycling Centres or HWRCs) and other ‘bring’ facilities. However research in this area has consistently failed to integrate site-based data with collection round data. Research that deals with one aspect of the household waste stream in isolation can build a misleading picture of the amount and type of waste produced by households in any particular area and can be a serious weakness in the development of realistic {{waste management}} scenarios. This paper describes research, carried out in collaboration with Hampshire County Council, to develop a method of integrating compositional data from a limited sample of waste collection rounds with operational data on the relative use of the different collection facilities for household waste. The resultant reconstructed waste arisings and compositional profile for each area was then used to develop scenarios for exploring future policy options...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{amounts of}} waste {{recycled}} in <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> or household waste recycling sites (HWRSs) are increasing, many recyclable and recoverable materials entering sites are being overlooked. This paper analyses the residual waste from two well-managed urban <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites</b> in Brighton and Hove with combined recycling rates of 24. 9 per cent in 2001 / 02. Detailed residual waste composition data from such facilities is seldom made widely available. Levels of wood waste {{were found to}} be 24. 6 per cent by sample weight, higher than had previously been estimated, whilst fines were also high at 16. 6. per cent. This new data indicates options for wood should be strongly considered {{from the perspective of the}} statutory recycling targets and the Landfill Directive. For compliance with both, untreated wood could be recycled into compost filler or recovered for its energetic value, whilst treated wood could be collected for manufacture into chipboards or amenity uses. However, since the largest single category of wood recorded at sites was chipboard at 7. 7 per cent by weight, closed loop systems need to be developed so that this and other board products can be recycled. Options for other recycled materials alongside textiles and plastics as well as bulky items and inert material are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Household waste {{recycling}} centres (HWRCs) evolved from <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites</b> (CAS) {{introduced by the}} <b>Civic</b> <b>Amenities</b> Act 1967, and provide householders with an outlet for the disposal {{of a wide range}} of materials. Sites are now handling significant volumes of recyclables (66 % of total household recyclables), and the transport impacts associated with increasing visitor numbers to HWRCs are of interest to traffic managers and land use planners. The transport logistics associated with servicing sites, including the collection, treatment and disposal of different materials, is complex. The reduction in landfill disposal coupled to more stringent requirements for material recycling and treatment has resulted in short journeys from HWRCs to landfill being replaced by complex road trips to different facilities at various locations. The operational, environmental and social impacts associated with these potential increases in commercial transport activities can be quantified through modelling current and projected fleet operations under various future scenarios. This can be achieved through routing and scheduling applications, which can be used to optimise transportation fleets and identify the optimal locations for waste treatment facilities. This paper provides an overview of the literature, identifying the transport arisings associated with the movement of waste to HWRCs by site users, and from HWRCs to treatment or disposal facilities by service operators. It also discusses the potential impacts on waste transportation from current and impending legislation, and the use of routing and scheduling applications to maximise commercial service vehicle operating efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{move from}} landfill-based to resource-based waste {{management}} systems requires a greater {{knowledge of the}} composition of municipal solid waste. This paper draws together the findings of municipal solid waste (MSW) compositional surveys undertaken in the United Kingdom. The results from recent surveys show a good agreement over the composition of household-collected waste, but less agreement over <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> waste composition. There is insufficient data to allow comparisons of the commercial waste element of municipal waste or of the other components, and further work is necessary to produce more reliable estimates of the composition of these streams. The use of questionnaire surveys {{and analysis of the}} results suggests that the size and age profile of a household influence the generation of household-collected waste. Some research suggests that the waste container provided by the local authority and the socio-economic classification of a household also influence household-collected waste generation, but other studies failed to find this link. Further research is required to investigate this by surveying all of the waste disposal routes available to specific households...|$|E
40|$|In {{many regions}} and countries, {{national}} and international targets have been set for municipal solid waste (MSW) recycling, recovery and diversion from landfill. To develop and implement effective strategies to meet these targets requires reliable information on the composition of {{all parts of the}} MSW stream. Previous studies on the composition of MSW in the United Kingdom have covered only some components of the waste stream or very localised geographical areas. This research was designed to obtain and analyse representative samples of all the components of the MSW stream across Wales. Samples were taken of household-colleted waste, <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> waste, commercial waste and litter in nine local authority areas across the country and the waste samples were sorted into categories by material type. A questionnaire survey was also undertaken among the households sampled. The results from the research estimate that 36 % of MSW in Wales consists of recyclable material and a further 28 % is compostable. Sixty-two percent of this MSW is classed as biodegradable and packaging material accounts for 17 % of the total. Electrical and electronic goods account for 2 % and 0. 8 % of the MSW consists of potentially hazardous material...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{progressively}} recognised that civic amenity (CA) sites {{have an important}} role to play in increasing recycling levels. However, very few studies have focused on improving the operations of CA sites in areas of relatively high socio-economic deprivation. This study, carried out during 2007 in Plymouth in the south-west of England, involved the refurbishment of an urban CA site with multiple operational problems that is situated in a neighbourhood blighted by high crime and high levels of social and economic deprivation. This paper reports on the refurbishment project and evaluates its success, focusing on operational efficiency, trade abuse and other misuse, access to the site and facilities, quality of the local environment. The study has clearly shown how a carefully planned refurbishment project can significantly improve the impacts of a <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site</b> in an area of high socio-economic derivation, with key outcomes including a reduction in waste arisings and enviro-crime; significant improvements in recycling rates, aesthetic impacts, access, health & safety; and an affirmation that a dynamic, flexible, integrated and multi-faceted approach is necessary in complex refurbishment projects of this nature...|$|E
40|$|YesTheory {{predicts that}} the {{voluntary}} or community sector will contribute a range of services that are not delivered by the state or private sectors. This paper examines the changing contributions of the community waste sector in the UK to reflect upon these claims. A rosy picture of the community waste sector is presented from research on the sector in 2002, with {{a growing number of}} organisations carrying out a range of services, drawing on multiple and diverse sources of funding. More recent evidence, and information drawn from outside the sector, however, suggests that regulation, competition, and changes to funding regimes are putting the sector under considerable pressure, such that it is likely to change, and that some parts of it will contract. In terms of the claims from theory, the paper finds evidence that the community sector can and has been innovative in the services it provides and the way that it provides them, though similar innovations may emerge from the private and public sectors. The sparse evidence on participation and recycling rates in kerbside and <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites</b> are equivocal on whether the sector provides enhanced communication as theory would predict. Overall, the paper highlights the difficulty in achieving direct comparisons between the waste sectors without specific focused research for this purpose. It concludes that the challenge for European, national and local government is to influence the necessarily constructed waste markets in a way which will enhance rather than discourage service providers to innovate in the waste material collected, and to communicate effectively with the public whom they serve. Such policies promise to encourage the effective delivery of sustainable waste services from all three - public, private and community - sectors...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, all local {{authorities}} {{have been set}} statutory performance standards for the recycling and composting of household waste. As part of their strategy for achieving these standards, Lancashire County Council (LCC) has {{made a number of}} alterations to the layout and facilities available at <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>sites</b> (renamed Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs)) in the county and tried to create a more positive image of the sites for members of the public. This study consisted of two surveys carried out in order to establish how to maximise household waste recycling at the 26 HWRCs in Lancashire. A telephone survey was carried out amongst all Lancashire's HWRC attendants in order to establish the effects of recent site improvements and to provide an indication of overall customer satisfaction. An on-site questionnaire survey was conducted amongst HWRC customers on five selected sites, over three separate seasons, incorporating comparative weekend and weekday surveys at each site. This survey investigated public opinion of HWRCs in Lancashire, as well as exploring effective methods that would assist customers in maximising the amount of recycling at HWRCs. The attendants' survey revealed that site attendants were actively encouraging customers to segregate waste more efficiently at the HWRCs, and that a recycling-related bonus scheme had provided an incentive towards this effort. Site attendants have a key role in educating the public about waste segregation and the effective use of HWRCs. Lancashire HWRC users were mostly male, used private cars to transport waste and showed high levels of customer satisfaction. Practical changes to encourage more recycling at HWRCs were clearly identified in the customers' survey; these include longer opening hours and the provision of boxes to enable pre-separation of waste. The study has clearly shown how the results of user surveys can provide practical assistance in the development of improved sustainable waste management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Researchers at Rits Information Security {{performed}} {{a study in}} how the Irish population disposes of their old computers. How would you dispose of your old computer, or how would the company you work for dispose of their old computers? The majority of Irish homeowners, would bring their old computers to local civic amenity centres, give it away to a relative or sell it on to another party. Some organisations would give their old equipment to a staff member, as a gift gesture, others may simply discard in the local <b>civic</b> <b>amenity</b> <b>site.</b> What {{is wrong with the}} methods currently being used for discarding of our old PCs? With this question in mind, Rits Information Security embarked on a study to highlight the problems home users, and corporate users face when discarding retired PCs. In this paper, Rits Information Security describes research in which a number of hard disks were taken from computers after they had been released for resale on Irish online auction sites. The research that was undertaken involved an analysis of the disks to determine if any information remained on these disks, and whether the information could be easily recovered using commonly available tools and techniques. From this analysis, a number of disks could be traced to specific organisations, including large financial institutions, various consultancy firms, numerous small trade organisation, auctioneers, and insurance brokers. In addition to these, a number of computers were found to have originated from the home environment. The results indicate that careless disposal of computers and storage media in the Republic of Ireland is a significant problem. Very few of the disks tested had undergone a thorough or efficient cleansing process. The level of information that could be recovered from the majority of the disks tested would have proven useful for corporate espionage, identity theft, blackmail, and fraud. </p...|$|E
