40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of aluminium}} in automotive and transport applications is primarily driven by its high strength to weight ratio, enabling substantially improved fuel economy and reduced CO 2 emissions when substituted for heavier materials. However, the change of material presents new challenges with respect to design and methods of joining. Structural adhesive bonding offers several advantages compared with welding, but a major limitation is concern about the durability of joints in wet and corrosive environments. The pre-treatment of the aluminium surface prior to bonding {{is the key to}} long service life. Pre-treatments successfully employed by the aerospace industry cannot be used in automotive production, where cheaper and more environmentally friendly pre-treatments are required. Specifically, the use of chromates is unacceptable. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop chromate-free pre-treatments that will consistently provide the required level of performance, while being acceptable both in terms of general engineering practice and economy. To accomplish this task, basic knowledge of the processes occurring on the aluminium surface during pre-treatment, properties of the modified surface, and mechanisms of joint degradation are necessary. The purpose of the present work has therefore been to contribute to a better understanding of how the aluminium substrate affects the formation and properties of conversion coatings for adhesive bonding. In particular, a commercial chromate-free fluorotitanate/zirconate based process has been investigated and compared with conventional chromate treatment. The materials chosen for this work were commercially extruded AA 6060 -T 6 aluminium and a structural single-part epoxy adhesive. To complement the studies of the commercial alloy, model analogues of the AA 6060 aluminium matrix and α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si phase particles present in the commercial alloy were also investigated. It was observed that the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles played an essential role in the formation and properties of Ti-Zr oxide conversion coatings on AA 6060 aluminium. The particles were significantly nobler than the aluminium matrix in the pre-treatment solution. An alkaline diffusion layer therefore developed around the particles during pre-treatment due to oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. As Ti-Zr oxide precipitation was favoured at high pH, the conversion layers normally deposited at and in the vicinity of the cathodic particles. The conversion layers formed consequently exhibited considerable lateral variations in thickness. In addition to substrate microstructure, bulk pH and agitation of the conversion bath were important factors controlling the extent of Ti-Zr oxide deposition and its distribution on the surface. On areas well away from the cathodic particles coverage was generally very poor, although a high density of small (< 50 nm) oxide particles was deposited, presumably with a composition similar to the continuous conversion layer close to the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The cathodic activity of the particles was only slightly reduced by formation of the Ti-Zr oxide conversion coating. In combination with poor coverage of the aluminium matrix, these conversion coatings are therefore not expected to improve the corrosion resistance of aluminium significantly. In contrast to the above mechanism, the chromate conversion coating (CCC) formed by a redox reaction between chromate ions and aluminium. A relatively thick, porous chromium oxide layer developed over the aluminium matrix of AA 6060, while a significantly thinner film was formed on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The morphology of the CCC covering the matrix was influenced by the hardening Mg 2 Si phase, primarily by promoting nucleation of the CCC. Despite the thin film (< 50 nm) formed on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles by chromating, the cathodic activity was significantly reduced. Inhibition of the cathodic reactivity at these particles is suggested as an important factor contributing to the high performance of chromate pretreatments on aluminium. Testing of epoxy-bonded AA 6060 aluminium joints in humid environment showed that Ti-Zr based pre-treatment provided improved adhesion relative to alkaline etching and deoxidation only. However, Ti-Zr based pre-treatment was inferior to chromating. Rapid, interfacial crack growth during wedge testing was particularly observed for adherends with a relatively thick Ti-Zr oxide deposit, suggesting that excessive Ti-Zr oxide deposition should be avoided. Furthermore, as the substrate microstructure (i. e. type, area fraction and distribution of cathodic sites) strongly affected the Ti-Zr oxide deposition, the pre-treatment conditions should be adapted to the specific alloy in order to achieve optimum performance. In the presence of chlorides, degradation of adhesive-bonded joints may be accelerated by a filiform corrosion (FFC) type of mechanism. The α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles in AA 6060 played a crucial role in promoting FFC, as demonstrated by complete FFC immunity of the iron-free AA 6060 model analogue alloy. Ti-Zr based pre-treatment provided less protection against FFC relative to chromate pre-treatment. The good FFC resistance of CCCs was partly attributed to a better inhibition of the cathodic activity at the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles. The cathodic α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles present on the surface of AA 6060 aluminium could be effectively removed by different etch treatments. However, selective removal of surface intermetallics did not prevent FFC because filament growth was supported by cathodic activity on particles that become exposed in the filament tail as a result of the corrosion process. Based on lap shear testing, hot AC anodising in sulphuric acid to a film thickness of about 0. 2 µm showed promise as another <b>chromate-free</b> <b>pretreatment</b> for durable adhesive bonding. The performance was better than a conventional chromic-sulphuric acid based etch treatment. While hot AC anodising did not significantly inhibit the cathodic activity on the α-Al(Fe,Mn) Si particles, good resistance against FFC was still obtained due to the oxide film covering the whole aluminium matrix. Based also on separate durability data recently available, hot AC anodising is considered as a robust alternative to chromating for adhesive bonding of aluminium in certain industrial applications. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{results of}} a {{detailed}} evaluation of {{the properties of the}} anode and the cathode of a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC) and the factors determining the power output of the MFC using different electrochemical techniques are presented in Chapter 1. In the MFC under investigation, the biocatalyst - Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 - oxidizes the fuel and transfers the electrons directly into the anode which consists of graphite felt. Oxygen is reduced at the cathode which consists of Pt-plated graphite felt. A proton exchange membrane separates the anode and the cathode compartments. The electrolyte was a PIPES buffer solution and lactate was used as the fuel. Separate tests were performed with the buffer solution containing lactate and with the buffer solution with lactate and MR- 1 as anolytes.; Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) carried out at the open-circuit potential (OCP) has been used to determine the electrochemical properties of the anode and the cathode at different anolyte conditions. Cell voltage (V) – current (I) curves were recorded using a potentiodynamic sweep between the open-circuit cell voltage and the short- circuit cell voltage. Power (P) -V curves were constructed from the recorded V-I data and the cell voltage, Vmax, at which the maximum power could be obtained, was determined. P- time (t) curves were obtained by applying Vmax or using a resistor between the anode and the cathode that would result in a similar cell voltage. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded for the anode for the different anolytes. Finally, anodic polarization curves were obtained for the anode with different anolytes and a cathodic polarization curve was recorded for the cathode.; The internal resistance (Rint) of the MFC has been determined {{as a function of the}} cell voltage V using EIS for the MFC described above and a MFC in which stainless steel (SS) balls had been added to the anode compartment. The experimental values of Rint of the MFCs studied here are determined by the sum of the polarization resistance of the anode (Rap) and the cathode (Rcp), and therefore Rint depends on V. The ohmic contribution to the Rint was very small. It has been found that Rint decreased with decreasing cell voltage as the increasing current flow decreased Rap and Rcp. In the presence of MR- 1, Rint was lower by a factor of about 100 than Rint of the MFC with buffer and lactate as anolyte. Additions of SS balls to the anode compartment produced a very large decrease of Rint. For the MFC containing SS balls in the anode compartment no significant further decrease of Rint could be observed when MR- 1 was added to the anolyte.; In Chapter 2, EIS has been used to determine the properties and stability of polymer coatings based on different chromate or <b>chromate-free</b> <b>pretreatments</b> and primers. Five sets of coated aluminum 2024 samples were exposed to 0. 5 N NaCl for a period of 31 days. Impedance spectra of the samples were measured during this period and the changes of the properties of the different coatings were studied as a function of time. From the analysis of the fit parameters of the impedance spectra, it was found that the corrosion protection of the coated samples depended on the type of primer used. The coating with the chromate based primer provided better corrosion protection than the coating with the chromate free primer.; After 31 days of exposure, one sample from each set was scribed and exposed to 0. 5 N NaCl. The corrosion behavior of the scribed coatings was found to be dependent upon the type of pretreatment employed. The samples with the chromate conversion coating pretreatment showed better corrosion resistance in the scribed area than the samples that were treated by the trivalent chromium based method...|$|R
