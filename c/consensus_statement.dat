For assessment of transparency of document development, 7 additional items were taken from the Institute of Medicine's standards for practice guidelines and the Journal of Clinical Oncology guidelines for authors of guidance documents. Thirty-four <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> and 67 clinical practice guidelines were evaluated. The rigour of development score for <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> over the three journals was 32 % lower than that of clinical practice guidelines. The editorial independence score was 15 % lower for <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> than clinical practice guidelines. One journal scored consistently lower than the others over both domains. No journals adhered to all the items related to the transparency of document development. One journal's <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> endorsed a product made by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company in 64 % of cases. Guidance documents are an essential part of oncology care and should be subjected to a rigorous and validated development process. <b>Consensus</b> <b>statements</b> had lower methodological quality than clinical practice guidelines using AGREE II.

40|$|The {{literature}} review found that pulmonary exacerbations (PEXs) {{impact on the}} quality of life (QOL) of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). There is currently no standardised definition of a PEX in CF to inform patient care and QOL. Before a definition can be achieved agreement must be attained on the indicators of a PEX. This thesis aims to identify important indicators of a PEX in adults with CF (ACFs) and establish consensus among ACFs and CF health professionals (CFHPs). The Delphi technique was used to conduct parallel web surveys over a series of rounds across 13 CF centres in the UK and Ireland. A range of sources were utilised to develop 48 statements that informed the Delphi surveys in Round 1 (R 1). A 75 % consensus level was applied for R 1 and Round 2 (R 2). R 1 : Participants rated their level of agreement with each statement. ACFs (n= 31) : 21 <b>consensus</b> <b>statements.</b> CFHPs (n= 38) : 23 <b>consensus</b> <b>statements.</b> Five additional statements were generated through open questions and added to R 2. R 2 : <b>Statements</b> not reaching <b>consensus</b> in R 1 and the 5 additional statements were presented to participants to re-rate. ACFs (n= 28) : 1 0 <b>consensus</b> <b>statements.</b> CFHPs (n= 38) : 7 <b>consensus</b> <b>statements.</b> R 3 : Analysis of R 1 and R 2 found 26 <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> common in both groups. Additional <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> were identified from each group (ACF: 5; CFHP: 4). 35 statements were presented to both participant groups in R 3 to rate from 1 - 10. Results were averaged and ranked in importance. Agreement was established within each participant group on 35 important indicators of a PEX. Each group identified a different hierarchy of indicators. This consensus is an important step {{in the development of a}} tool to be used by CFHPs to identify when a PEX is occurring and provides a strong platform for further research into PEXs in CF.

40|$|Liver {{fibrosis}} is {{a common}} pathway leading to cirrhosis, which is the final result of injury to the liver. Accurate assessment {{of the degree of}} fibrosis is important clinically, especially when treatments aimed at reversing fibrosis are being evolved. Liver biopsy has been considered to be the “gold standard” to assess fibrosis. However, liver biopsy being invasive and, in many instances, not favored by patients or physicians, alternative approaches to assess liver fibrosis have assumed great importance. Moreover, therapies aimed at reversing the liver fibrosis have also been tried lately with variable results. Till now, there has been no consensus on various clinical, pathological, and radiological aspects of liver fibrosis. The Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver set up a working party on liver fibrosis in 2007, with a mandate to develop consensus guidelines on various aspects of liver fibrosis relevant to disease patterns and clinical practice in the Asia-Pacific region. The process for the development of these consensus guidelines involved the following: review of all available published literature by a core group of experts; proposal of <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> by the experts; discussion of the contentious issues; and unanimous approval of the <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> after discussion. The Oxford System of evidence-based approach was adopted for developing the <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> using the level of evidence from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest) and grade of recommendation from A (strongest) to D (weakest).

At the end of the meeting, the group issued the Chapel Hill <b>Consensus</b> <b>Statement,</b> which stated [...] "BPA at concentrations found in the human body is associated with organizational changes in the prostate, breast, testis, mammary glands, body size, brain structure and chemistry, and behavior of laboratory animals." [...] The Chapel Hill <b>Consensus</b> <b>Statement</b> stated that average BPA levels in people were above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments. It noted that while BPA is not persistent in the environment or in humans, biomonitoring surveys indicate that exposure is continuous. This is problematic because acute animal exposure studies are used to estimate daily human exposure to BPA, and no studies that had examined BPA pharmacokinetics in animal models had followed continuous low-level exposures. The authors added that measurement of BPA levels in serum and other body fluids suggests the possibilities that BPA intake is much higher than accounted for or that BPA can bioaccumulate in some conditions (such as pregnancy).|$|E

40|$|Aim Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is axial {{inflammatory}} arthritis where plain radiographic damage is not evident. An unknown proportion {{of these patients}} will progress to ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The increasing recognition of nr-axSpA has been greatly assisted by {{the widespread use of}} magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this article was to construct a set of <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> based on a literature review to guide investigation and promote best management of nr-axSpA. Methods A literature review using Medline was conducted covering the major investigation modalities and treatment options available. A group of rheumatologists and a radiologist with expertise in investigation and management of SpA reviewed the literature and formulated a set of <b>consensus</b> <b>statements.</b> The Grade system encompassing the level of evidence and strength of recommendation was used. The opinion of a patient with nr-axSpA and a nurse experienced in the care of SpA patients was also sought and included. Results The literature review found few studies specifically addressing nr-axSpA, or if these patients were included, their results were often not separately reported. Fourteen <b>consensus</b> <b>statements</b> covering investigation and management of nr-axSpA were formulated. The level of agreement was high and ranged from 8. 1 to 9. 8.
