5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black <b>cross-hatching</b> on gold, {{usually to}} render {{metallic}} {{objects such as}} brooches, crowns or buckles, in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E

25|$|Also of {{interest}} amongst the finds is a jar with a painted {{scene at the}} top where two warriors fight surrounded by areas of <b>cross-hatching</b> (with a fruit tree).

25|$|Wheels : Abrasive cups or {{wheels are}} used to {{superfinish}} flat and spherical surfaces. The wheel and workpiece are rotated in opposite directions, which creates the <b>cross-hatching.</b> If the two are parallel then the result if a flat finish, but if the wheel is tilted slightly a convex or concave surface will form.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} bore {{finishing}} is {{better suited for}} bores with relatively low length-to-diameter ratios, usually less than 2:1. However, if there are cross-holes, or other interruptions in the bore, then a ratio greater than 2:1 is possible, because swarf and fluids may be expelled via these routes. This process is also not well suited for surfaces that require <b>cross-hatching.</b>|$|E

25|$|Effects not {{generally}} associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved. Traditional pen-and-ink {{techniques such as}} stippling and <b>cross-hatching</b> {{can be used to}} create half-tones or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.|$|E
25|$|Many of the centres operate online art {{galleries}} where {{local and international}} visitors can purchase works directly from the communities without the need of going through an intermediary. The cooperatives reflect the diversity of art across Indigenous Australia from the north west region where ochre is significantly used; to the tropical north where the use of <b>cross-hatching</b> prevails; to the Papunya style of art from the central desert cooperatives. Art is increasingly becoming {{a significant source of}} income and livelihood for some of these communities.|$|E
25|$|After a {{metal piece}} is ground to an initial finish, it is {{superfinished}} with a finer grit solid abrasive. The abrasive is oscillated or rotated while the workpiece is rotated {{in the opposite}} direction; these motions are what causes the <b>cross-hatching.</b> The geometry of the abrasive depends on the geometry of the workpiece surface; a stone (rectangular shape) is for cylindrical surfaces and cups and wheels are used for flat and spherical surfaces. A lubricant is used to minimize heat production, which can alter the metallurgical properties, and to carry away the swarf; kerosene is a common lubricant.|$|E
40|$|Zinc-blende {{semiconductor}} heterostructures {{grown in}} the [001] direction with a small lattice mismatch accommodate stress by developing a <b>cross-hatch</b> dislocation pattern. In GaAs based planar microcavitiesgrown by molecular beam epitaxy, this pattern creates a potential landscape for exciton-polaritons, causing scattering and localization. We report here on suppressing the <b>cross-hatch</b> by introducing strain-compensating AlP layers {{into the center of}} the low index AlAs layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors. We observe a reduction of the <b>cross-hatch</b> dislocation density by at least one order of magnitude for 1. 1 [*]nm thick AlP layers, which correspond to an effective AlAs 0. 985 P 0. 015 low index layer. These compensated structures show a remaining polariton disorder potential in the 10 [*]μeV range...|$|R

25|$|In Europe, woodcut is {{the oldest}} {{technique}} used for old master prints, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts {{in the middle of}} the century led to a fall in standards, and many popular prints were very crude. The development of hatching followed on rather later than in engraving. Michael Wolgemut was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and Erhard Reuwich was the first to use <b>cross-hatching</b> (far harder to do than in engraving or etching). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century Albrecht Dürer brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the single-leaf (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that Master's style was closely related to that of paintings from south-western Germany and Switzerland in the period 1430–50, by artists of whom the best known is Konrad Witz. In addition, the Alpine cyclamen - a flowering plant native to the region - very frequently appears in the engravings. Although the theory proposed by Leo Baer to identify the Master as Witz has not been widely accepted, the Master does {{appear to have been}} trained as an artist rather than a goldsmith like many other early engravers. His prints show an engraving technique closely related to drawing, with forms conceived in three dimensions and delicately modeled; other engravers were usually trained as goldsmiths, such as Master E. S. or Israhel van Meckenem, and their works display a different set of stylistic conventions. The Master's shading is mostly done using parallel vertical lines, and <b>cross-hatching</b> is rare.|$|E
500|$|Brown's drawing style {{had always}} changed from project to project. [...] He {{frequently}} cited Harold Gray of Little Orphan Annie {{as the primary}} influence on the drawing style of Louis Riel—restrained artwork which avoids extreme closeups, and blank-eyed characters with large bodies, small heads, and oversized noses. [...] Gray's drawing and compositional style was well suited {{to the subject of}} Louis Riel. [...] Gray often used his strip as a public platform for politics, and Louis Riel was also very public and outward-looking. [...] This approach is in great contrast to the inward-looking comics Brown had previously been known for—notably his autobiographical work. [...] His <b>cross-hatching</b> style was reminiscent of the editorial cartoonists of Riel's time. [...] Gray's outdoor scenes were inspired by the Illinois plains of Gray's youth, terrain similar to that of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.|$|E
50|$|Thumb forceps {{can have}} smooth tips, <b>cross-hatched</b> tips or {{serrated}} tips (often called 'mouse's teeth'). Common arrangements of teeth are 1×2 (two teeth {{on one side}} meshing with a single tooth on the other), 7×7 and 9×9. Serrated forceps are used on tissue; counter-intuitively, teeth will damage tissue less than a smooth surface because one can grasp with less overall pressure. Smooth or <b>cross-hatched</b> forceps are used to move dressings, remove sutures and similar tasks.|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of microdamage in bone {{may contribute to}} loss of bone quality in osteoporosis, {{and the role of}} microdamage in the etiology of fatigue fractures is unknown. Microdamage created during testing, ex vivo, can increase the fragility of bone by decreasing the load necessary to cause fracture. Microdamage can also accumulate in vivo, but its influence on bone fragility is unknown. To date, stained microcracks are the only criteria to have been correlated with bone mechanics, leaving the influence of ultrastructural damage on bone fragility open for scrutiny. Staining en bloc has identified three morphological features in the tissue, discrete microcracks, <b>cross-hatch</b> staining, and diffuse staining. The relationship between these features and their identification as microdamage remains equivocal. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the three-dimensional nature of microdamage in cancellous bone and also to describe stained microcracks, <b>cross-hatch</b> staining, and diffuse staining and to determine whether they all relate to microdamage in bone. Laser scanning confocal microscopy that provides improved spatial resolution over bright-field microscopy was used to visualize bone damage. It was found that crack surface density was highly correlated with crack density (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 0001), suggesting that the crack surface of preexisting cracks increases as new cracks are formed or submicroscopic cracks become visible under bright-field microscopy. <b>Cross-hatch</b> staining and diffuse staining included ultra-microcracks about 10 μm in length. The ultra-microcracks in <b>cross-hatch</b> staining were organized in bands and surrounded by diffuse staining. This study demonstrates that damage in bone occurs over a wide range and that discrete microcracks, <b>cross-hatch</b> staining, and diffuse staining are all indicative of bone damage. The diffuse staining still evident in association with the ultra-microcracks seen in <b>cross-hatch</b> staining and diffuse staining is probably due to damage at a still smaller scale than we have been able to investigate.

2500|$|With {{very rare}} exceptions, diapering is not [...] {{a part of}} [...] the blazon, but is mere decoration, or {{ornamental}} accessory. Thus a shield with diapering is considered {{the same as a}} shield of the same design but without diapering. For this reason diapering must not be so obtrusive or so heavily drawn that it could be mistaken for a substantive charge or for a variation of the field. This is especially the case with diaper of simple <b>cross-hatching</b> which might be mistaken for a field of lozengy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} engraving, {{which is}} a purely linear medium, the impression of half-tones was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called hatching. When two sets of parallel-line hatchings intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as <b>cross-hatching.</b> Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called stippling, first used around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Claude Mellan {{was one of many}} 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the [...] "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was Goltzius) – see picture below. One famous example is his Sudarium of Saint Veronica (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.|$|E

2500|$|To further confuse things, {{even the}} meaning of [...] "friend" [...] is subject to scrutiny. [...] "Friend" [...] {{can be used to}} greet a {{complete}} stranger, it can mean someone of the same sex that is an extremely close friend, and it can even be used to describe {{a man and a woman}} in love. [...] In the same respect, lover can be meant to have sexual connotations or just imply a strong platonic friendship. Hammond states, [...] "The words 'love', 'lover', and 'friend' in the Sonnets have no single or unambiguous meanings, but are continually being redefined, refelt, reimagined." [...] He also states, [...] "Sometimes indications of sexual desire are present not in the form of metaphor or simile, but as a <b>cross-hatching</b> of sexually charged vocabulary across the surface of a poem whose attention seems to lie elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 99.
