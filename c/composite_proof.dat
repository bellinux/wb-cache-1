40|$|Mechanized proof assistants are {{powerful}} verification tools, but proof developments {{can still be}} difficult and timeconsuming. When verifying a family of related programs, the effort can be reduced by proof reuse. In this paper, we show how to engineer proofs for product lines built from feature modules. Each module contains proof fragments which are composed together to build a complete proof of correctness for each product. We consider a product line of programming languages, where each variant includes metatheory proofs verifying the correctness of its syntax and semantic definitions. This approach has been realized in the Coq proof assistant, with the proofs of each feature independently certifiable by Coq. These proofs are composed for each language variant, with Coq mechanically verifying that the <b>composite</b> <b>proofs</b> are correct. As validation, we formalize a core calculus for Java in Coq which can be extended with any combination of casts, interfaces, or generics. 1...|$|R

40|$|The special {{requirements}} for <b>proof</b> test of <b>composites</b> are identified {{based on the}} underlying failure process of <b>composites.</b> Two <b>proof</b> test methods are developed to eliminate the inevitable weak fiber sites without also causing flaw clustering which weakens the post-proof-test composite. Significant reliability enhancement by these proof test methods has been experimentally demonstrated for composite strength and composite life in tension. This basic proof test methodology is relevant to the certification and acceptance of critical composite structures. It can also {{be applied to the}} manufacturing process development to achieve zero-reject for very large composite structures...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{are often used}} in bridge engineering. In most cases steel girders are combined with a cast in place concrete slab, but composite systems with precast concrete girders are also widely built. Although often applied in everyday structures, composite structures require challeng-ing design procedures due to the necessity of considering the difference in behaviour of the materi-als and providing full connection between the structural parts. These requirements are related to topics like properly considering the actual construction schedule in order to assign different loading components to the respective structural system. Further special needs arise in the simulation of certain loadings such as self weight of wet concrete or temperature differences between the different materials. A third major problem is related to correct simulation of long time behaviour redistributing stresses from the concrete slab to the girders and to dealing with pre-stressing in case of structures with pre-stressed concrete girders. Once deformations and internal forces have been correctly calculated there still remain several problems relating to result assessment and proof checks. Stress and strain distribution over the composite section is no longer linear, i. e. stress checks have usually to be done separately for the individual parts. Ultimate load checks however relate to the final <b>composite</b> section. <b>Proof</b> checks for the shear keys between the different parts complete the set of requirements. Consistent analysis procedures considering all these special problems have recently been developed and are presented herein. The solution allows for considering all required effects with sufficient accuracy in comprehensive manner and in accordance with generally accepted theories...|$|R
40|$|Packaging {{is used to}} contain, preserve, protect, and {{advertise}} both manufactured {{and natural}} products. In 2013 {{it was reported that}} over thirty percent of solid waste in the United States was from packaging. One way to reduce the impact of packaging on the environment is to create a solution that is edible and sourced from a waste or secondary food product that is not currently being utilized. Food-contact packaging made from recycled materials must meet strict U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations to be utilized as raw material for packaging. Fruit pomace is a candidate material since it may be cross-linked to increase strength and become the base for a multilayer packaging <b>composite.</b> This <b>proof</b> of concept study was designed to determine the ideal composition of fruit pomace and an effective cross-linking process. A pilot study of seven samples compared two different compositions and assessed a first attempt at cross-linking. Our studies showed that one of the compositions was stronger than the other based on tensile strength. This was true for both stress (MPa) and normalized stress (N). A second cross-linking process based on a patented method did not indicate any improvements in strength. The effect of aging was studied through the apple samples produced with a control procedure across multiple trials. While there was no indication of aging effects based on the ultimate tensile strength, there was indication that other factors may have altered strength values. The two suspected factors are the improvement of the rehydration process and the amount of time between preparation (rehydration and strip formation) and processing (cross-linking and dehydration) ...|$|R
40|$|The complex domain {{structure}} in ferroelectrics {{gives rise to}} electromechanical coupling, and its evolution (via domain switching) results in a time-dependent (i. e. viscoelastic) response. Although ferroelectrics are used in many technological applications, most do not attempt to exploit the viscoelastic response of ferroelectrics, mainly {{due to a lack}} of understanding and accurate models for their description and prediction. Thus, the aim of this thesis research is to gain better understanding of the influence of domain evolution in ferroelectrics on their dynamic mechanical response. There have been few studies on the viscoelastic properties of ferroelectrics, mainly {{due to a lack of}} experimental methods. Therefore, an apparatus and method called Broadband Electromechanical Spectroscopy (BES) was designed and built. BES allows for the simultaneous application of dynamic mechanical and electrical loading in a vacuum environment. Using BES, the dynamic stiffness and loss tangent in bending and torsion of a particular ferroelectric, viz. lead zirconate titanate (PZT), was characterized for different combinations of electrical and mechanical loading frequencies throughout the entire electric displacement hysteresis. Experimental results showed significant increases in loss tangent (by nearly an order of magnitude) and compliance during domain switching, which shows promise as a new approach to structural damping. A continuum model of the viscoelasticity of ferroelectrics was developed, which incorporates microstructural evolution via internal variables and associated kinetic relations. For the first time, through a new linearization process, the incremental dynamic stiffness and loss tangent of materials were computed throughout the entire electric displacement hysteresis for different combinations of mechanical and electrical loading frequencies. The model accurately captured experimental results. Using the understanding gained from the characterization and modeling of PZT, two applications of domain switching kinetics were explored by using Micro Fiber <b>Composites</b> (MFCs). <b>Proofs</b> of concept of set-and-hold actuation and structural damping using MFCs were demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Service {{composition}} is {{a mechanism to}} combine two or more services to form a composite service for delivering the users' desirable functionalities. Existing service composition system in pervasive computing does not capture state information of the smart objects (SOs). Based {{on the study of}} relationships of SOs' states and services, we identify unqualified composite services generated by existing service composition systems, which are either inefficiently executed or fail to complete their execution. This handicaps the applications of pervasive computing because its applications like health care normally need more reliable and timing services. In this paper, we first formally model SOs' states and their transitions using finite state machines and propose extending existing service description technologies using the SOs'state information. The obtained information is then used in designing an algorithm to compose SOs' services, which avoids generating the identified unqualified <b>composite</b> services. The <b>proof</b> of the efficiency of the composite services obtained by our proposed algorithms is elaborated. Finally, a performance study was conducted to evaluate our algorithm against the one without considering SO state information. Our experimental results show that the composite services generated using our algorithm can execute faster and more reliably. Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|Recycling as an {{economic}} disposal process for many hazardous waste materials has become a popular means of conserving our planet’s scarce and diminishing natural resources. This paper is {{a study of the}} influence of oil sludge (OS) on the physical behavior and performance of asphalt filled with heavy oil fly ash (HOFA), cement kiln dust (CKD) and limestone dust (LMD). Conventional asphalt consistency tests in addition to a new bond strength (BS) test were conducted on the modified asphalt mastics. The results were statistically analyzed and assessed in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 332 and ASTM D 449 specifications. Too much OS resulted in strength deterioration of the asphalt mastic, which can be compensated for by filling the mastic with HOFA. OS interacts constructively with the fillers to improve their effectiveness in raising the softening point (SP) and viscosity of the asphalt, and also in reducing its penetration and ductility. Even though sludge mastics hold promise as suitable <b>composites</b> for damp <b>proofing</b> and waterproofing, the resulting low flash point (FP) and SP of some of these mastics make their suitability for roofing applications questionable...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{application}} of natural fibres such as bamboo, jute, banana, coir, linen {{and the like}} in Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (FRP) composites have become so vital due to their high effective stiffness and strength, availability, low cost, specific strength, better dimensional stability and mechanical properties, eco-friendly and biodegradable as compared with synthetic fibres. The interest in natural fibre reinforced polymeric composites is rapidly springing up in terms of research and industrial applications. The increased applications of these natural fibres in such <b>composites</b> are a <b>proof</b> to this claim. The paper deals with the detailed study of bamboo fibre, banana fibre and linen fibre cut into 2 − 4 mm of length with epoxy resin having random orientations. Various tests like Impact test (IZOD and CHARPY test), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) test and Rockwell Hardness test were conducted on 10 specimens of bamboo epoxy resin composite, bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite and bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite. It is analysed and proved that bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite shows better results in Impact test with values of 4 Joules for Izod test and 5 Joules for Charpy test and in FTIR test, compatibility of fibres with polymers in bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite are the best while bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite shows better result in Rockwell hardness test with value of 40 RHN...|$|R
40|$|The various {{surviving}} disc and <b>composite</b> brooches provide <b>proof</b> of {{the skill}} and craftsmanship of Anglo-Saxon metalsmiths. Surprisingly, no one has conducted a full geometrical analysis of these brooches to discover the design process preceding the casting and decoration. This thesis endeavors to rectify this through a geometrical investigation of the sophisticated geometrical planning principles used by Anglo-Saxon craftsmen {{in the creation of}} these elaborate brooches. Through the use of simple geometrical constructions, smiths were able to create works of great beauty and sophistication. Closer inspection reveals that Anglo-Saxon smiths produced all the composite disc brooches in this study using similar processes of planning. In order to plan out the compositions of each brooch, master smiths would only need a compass, a straightedge, and some material on which to write. Each brooch reveals the same kind of coherent geometry, sharing traits and patterns; with proportions tend to be governed by a series of modular association. Although the master smiths or designers of the composite brooches used simple tools to create the composition, the figures in this thesis were created using the Vectorworks CAD program. This significantly expedited the analytical process and allowed for exact measurements. Despite using the computer program to replicate the planning process, all the figures can be recreated with just a compass and straightedge. While a complete geometric study of all the composite disc brooches needs to be done, this study examines five of the best preserved and well-crafted of that type, ranging from some of the simplest to the most elaborate, as an introduction to the subject...|$|R
40|$|This online {{appendix}} includes proofs of all mathematical {{results in}} the main text and a documentation appendix for Table 1. THEOREM 1 : Suppose each student has a complete rank ordering and k> 1. The old Chicago Public Schools mechanism (Chi k) {{is at least as}} manipulable as any weakly stable mechanism. PROOF: Fix a problem P and let ϕ be an arbitrary mechanism that is weakly stable. Suppose that Chi k is not manipulable for problem P. Claim 1 : Any student assigned under Chik (P) receives her top choice. Proof. If not, since each student has a complete rank order list, |I |> Q, k> 1, there must be a student that is assigned to a school s he has not ranked first. Consider the highest composite score student i who is unassigned. Student i can rank school s first and will be assigned a seat there {{in the first round of}} Chik mechanism instead of some student who has not ranked school s first. That contradicts Chik is not manipulable for problem P. Claim 2. The set of students who are assigned a seat under Chik (P) is equal to the set of top Q <b>composite</b> score students. <b>Proof.</b> If not, there is a school seat assigned to a student j who does not have a top Q score. Let student i be the highest scoring top Q student who is not assigned. Since student i has a complete rank order list, she can manipulate Chi k by ranking student j’s assignment as her top choice again contradicting Chi k is not manipulable for problem P. Since each of the top Q students is matched to her top choice in matching Chi k (P), all other students are unassigned. Claim 3. In problem P, matching Chi k (P) is the unique weakly stable matching. Proof. By Claims 1 and 2 it is possible to assign each one of the top Q students a seat at their top choice school under P and Chi k (P) picks that matching. Let µ = Chi k (P). That means under µ there exists a top Q student i who is no...|$|R
