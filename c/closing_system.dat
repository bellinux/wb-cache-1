Next, a motor gear transmission system is designed based on analyses & design theory for motion of a gear train. Finally, an automatic car-door opening (<b>closing)</b> <b>system</b> with design in engineering is devised under constraints in design for automatic opening (closing) of a car door. With the systematic scheme for innovative automatic car-door opening (closing) design evolved to a prototype in this study, the research can {{be taken as a}} model for development of an automatic car-door opening (<b>closing)</b> <b>system</b> in the industry.

40|$|Abstract Industrialized closing systems {{appear as}} {{rational}} solutions in steel-structured construction. These closing systems, consisting of multi-layered panels, {{have been applied}} in projects where {{it is intended to}} obtain a high sound transmission loss without raising the cost and without using a lot of mass. However, acoustic isolation depends on several factors, including the type of connection between the panels, requiring a preliminary study of the acoustic performance of the <b>closing</b> <b>system</b> to prevent future interventions. This paper uses a simplified graphical method to evaluate the influence of the type of connection (line-line, line-punctual or punctual-punctual) of industrialized closing panels on the estimation of the sound transmission loss that occurs across the wall constituted by these panels. The panels are combined, forming multi-layered closings interleaved by a layer of air, either without or with a sound-absorbing material between them. The results show {{that it is necessary to}} check the effectiveness of each type of fastening of the closing systems because, for example, for the frequency range between 500 and 2, 000 Hz, the sound transmission loss of a <b>closing</b> <b>system</b> consisting of cementitious plate with glass wool and line-punctual and punctual-punctual connections exceeds in 6. 25 % the sound transmission loss of the same system with line-line fastening. For a system composed of expanded polystyrene with glass wool, the sound transmission loss provided by line-line fastening exceeds in 7. 0 % the sound transmission loss of the same <b>closing</b> <b>system</b> with line-punctual and punctual-punctual fastenings...|$|E

40|$|The <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> {{is defined}} as a warehouse-like {{structure}} covered with opaque thermally insulated walls, multi-shelves with lamps, home-use air conditioners, and other equipments for water and CO_ 2 supply. Environments inside the <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> are not disturbed and thus can be controlled as desired.

It was estimated that the initial cost for construction of the <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> per transplant could be {{the same as that of}} the open system (i. e., greenhouse). Optimally controlled environments in the <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> enhanced the growth and development of several transplants so that the production period in the <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> was reduced by 10 to 50 %, compared with that in the open system. Electric energy consumption per transplant in the <b>closed</b> <b>system</b> was 0. 3 - 0. 6 MJ, and its cost was 1 - 2 Japanese Yen.

40|$|Wood boxes kind "k" are {{the most}} used in table tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum P. Miller) commercialization in Brazil. Due to the fruit {{accommodation}} process that occurs during the transport from the production place to the commercialization point, producers fill tomato boxes a little bit over its physical capacity, and they close it with wood strips fixed with nails. In order to prevent strips from cracking, {{it is common to}} keep them inside water before using, to increase flexibility. When boxes are opened, many fruits are cracked or kneaded in a significant part of their total area, and normally they are thrown away. The purpose of this paper was to quantify the compression tomato fruits are exposed to in consequence of the "k" box fill / <b>closing</b> <b>system.</b> For this study a special instrumented box was constructed with a scales plate located at the bottom, with a hydraulic load cell instrumented in the box.

The "k" box <b>closing</b> <b>system</b> caused an initial compression increase 3. 5 times the compression of the open tomato box, and during time as the fruits are substantially deformed.
