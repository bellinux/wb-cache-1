40|$|International audienceAn {{implicit}} method {{based on}} high-order differentiation {{to determine the}} mean, Gaussian and principal <b>curvatures</b> <b>of</b> implicit surfaces from a three-dimensional scalar field is presented and assessed. The method also determines normal vectors and principal directions. Compared to explicit methods, the implicit approach shows robustness and improved accuracy to measure <b>curvatures</b> <b>of</b> implicit surfaces. This is evaluated on simple cases where curvature is known in closed-form. The method is applied to compute the <b>curvatures</b> <b>of</b> wrinkled flames on large triangular unstructured meshes (namely a 3 D isosurface of temperature) ...|$|R
5|$|In general relativity, gravity {{becomes a}} fictitious force that arises in {{situations}} where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other fundamental forces respectively to the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E
5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. What this means is addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> spacetime.|$|E

NY427 parallels both {{the river and the}} expressway into Wellsburg, a small village sandwiched between the Chemung River and the Pennsylvania state line. In the center of the village, NY427, named Front Street, intersects with the northern end of NY367, a short highway linking NY427 to the Pennsylvania border. Just east of NY367, NY427 intersects County Route8 (CR8), a highway that crosses the Chemung River and links Wellsburg to NY17 at exit58.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction.

5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from}} the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of motion was compatible with the excavation of tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as Rahonavis and Buitreraptor were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as Deinonychus and Neuquenraptor could have used this ability to catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E

His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David was compelled to leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family. He took {{a job with a}} local stock and station agent.|$|E

5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
