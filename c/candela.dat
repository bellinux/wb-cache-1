5|$|The {{proposed}} {{definition of}} the <b>candela</b> is effectively {{the same as the}} current definition, but has been rephrased with the only difference being the additional rigour in the {{definition of the}} second and metre will propagate to the <b>candela.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the mole}} and the <b>candela</b> were {{accepted}} by the CGPM in 1971 and 1975 respectively, both had been defined by third parties by reference to phenomena rather than artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>candela,</b> all the base units will {{be defined in}} terms of {{universal}} physical constants, but without an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the constants and the base units. Thus six physical constants will be needed to define the six base units.|$|E

5|$|The International System of Units (Système {{international}} d'unités or SI) is {{the current}} international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world.

5|$|Proposed definition: The <b>candela,</b> symbol cd, is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity {{in a given}} direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency , Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W−1, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W−1, or cd⋅sr⋅kg−1⋅m−2⋅s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are {{defined in terms of}} h, c and ΔνCs.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 <b>candela.</b> The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, {{because of}} the {{difficulties}} in realizing a Planck radiator at high temperatures and the new possibilities offered by radiometry, the 16thCGPM adopted the modern definition of the <b>candela.</b> The arbitrary (1/683) term was chosen so that the new definition would exactly match the old definition. Although the <b>candela</b> is now {{defined in terms of}} the second (an SI base unit) and the watt (a derived SI unit), the <b>candela</b> remains a base unit of the SI system, by definition.|$|E

25|$|The <b>candela</b> (cd) is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity, that {{is power}} per unit solid angle {{in a given}} direction, weighted according to {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 <b>candela</b> of luminous intensity in all directions. A lamp can produce higher luminous intensity either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The luminous intensity of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use {{of the power of the}} lamp than lights using rotationally symmetrical optics.|$|E

25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed beam headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 <b>candela</b> per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 <b>candela</b> on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed beam headlamps with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the sealed beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|E

Following the purchase of talented youngster Cassano the next season, Capello switched to a 3–5–2 formation.|$|E
