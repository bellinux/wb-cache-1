5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether or not that is a {{sensible}} result, the statutes <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> do not support it—especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes {{in favor of the}} accused. I respectfully dissent.|$|E
5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt {{was convinced that}} federal activism was needed to reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E

The Ryan White CARE Act funds {{programs}} to improve availability of care for low-income, uninsured and under-insured victims of AIDS and their families.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 {{prohibits the}} {{election}} or appointment to any {{federal or state}} office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason. However, a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation. In 1898, the <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> a general removal of Section 3's limitation. In 1975, the citizenship of Confederate general Robert E. Lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution, retroactive to June 13, 1865. In 1978, pursuant to Section 3, the Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate president Jefferson Davis.|$|E
5|$|Two {{provisions}} require certain jurisdictions {{to provide}} election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials {{related to an}} election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E
25|$|April 19 - The U.S. <b>Congress</b> <b>enacts</b> a joint {{resolution}} demanding independence for Cuba, and giving President McKinley the authorization {{to declare war}} if Spain does not yield.

50|$|In 1944, the President {{requested}} that <b>Congress</b> <b>enact</b> legislation which would tax all unreasonable profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 {{billion in revenue}} for the war and other government measures. The Congress passed a revenue bill raising $2 billion, which Roosevelt vetoed, though Congress in turn overrode him.|$|R
5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1960, prisoners had {{virtually}} no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights. That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material. In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney Phil Hirschkop discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the Virginia State Penitentiary strike, and won an important victory in 1971's Landman v. Royster which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways. In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the National Prison Project. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as Ruiz v. Estelle (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 U.S. <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.|$|E
5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), {{and a majority of}} African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after <b>Congress</b> <b>enacted</b> the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{previously}} {{ruled in}} Medellín v. Texas that international legal obligations are not binding unless <b>Congress</b> <b>enacts</b> {{them in a}} statute.
