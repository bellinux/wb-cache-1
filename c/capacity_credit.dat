40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with development of a methodology to determine the <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> of micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP), and application of the method for the UK. <b>Capacity</b> <b>credit</b> is an important parameter in electricity system planning because it measures the amount of conventional generation that would be displaced by an alternative technology. Firstly, a mathematical formulation is presented. <b>Capacity</b> <b>credit</b> is then calculated for three types of micro-CHP units [...] Stirling engine, internal combustion engine, and fuel cell systems [...] operating under various control strategies. It is found that low heat-to-power ratio fuel cell technologies achieve the highest <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> of approximately 85 % for a 1. 1 Â GW penetration when a heat-led control strategy is applied. Higher heat-to-power ratio Stirling engine technology achieves approximately 33 % <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> for heat-led operation. Low heat-to-power ratio technologies achieve higher <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> because {{they are able to}} continue operating even when heat demand is relatively low. <b>Capacity</b> <b>credit</b> diminishes as penetration of the technology increases. Overall, the high <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> of micro-CHP contributes to the viewpoint that the technology can help meet a number of economic and environmental energy policy aims. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> {{is often}} erroneously {{considered}} to be a time-invariant quantity. A multi-year analysis of the incident wind profile of various potential wind sites uncovered that there exist large differences between annual <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> figures. The uniformity of these <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> figures is found to decrease with diminishing wind time series interval lengths. In recognition of the resulting uncertainty, decision maker risk propensity toward various <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> scenarios was investigated by adopting cumulative prospect theory. The methodology proposed in this paper is an extension of the effective load carrying capability method. It enables the quantitative analysis of the attitudes of decision makers with regard to deviations (gains and losses) from the forecasted <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> {{as a result of the}} uncertainty of the incident wind profile. Here, gains and losses may not be viewed by decision makers as having equal but opposite effects on the appeal of wind power production. Therefore, it is argued that a decision maker will not have a neutral risk propensity toward changes to the outcome of the <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> and will discount increases and decreases of the loss of load expectation according to a non-linear preference. In line with the well-known adagium that losses loom larger than gains the value of the <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> is found to be lower than its corresponding least squares forecast. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} power generation of co-located offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters along the California coast is investigated. Meteorological wind and wave data from the National Buoy Data Center were used to estimate the hourly power output from offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters at the sites of the buoys. The data set from 12 buoys consists of over 1, 000, 000 h of simultaneous hourly mean wind and wave measurements. At the buoys, offshore wind farms would have capacity factors ranging from 30 % to 50 %, and wave farms would have capacity factors ranging from 22 % to 29 %. An analysis of the power output indicates that co-located offshore wind and wave energy farms generate less variable power output than a wind or wave farm operating alone. The reduction in variability results from the low temporal correlation of the resources and occurs on all time scales. Aggregate power from a co-located wind and wave farm achieves reductions in variability equivalent to aggregating power from two offshore wind farms approximately 500 km apart or two wave farms approximately 800 km apart. Combined wind and wave farms in California would have less than 100 h of no power output per year, compared to over 1000 h for offshore wind or over 200 h for wave farms alone. Ten offshore farms of wind, wave, or both modeled in the California power system would have capacity factors during the summer ranging from 21 % (all wave) to 36 % (all wind) with combined wind and wave farms between 21 % and 36 %. The <b>capacity</b> <b>credits</b> for these farms range from 16 % to 24 % with some combined wind and wave farms achieving <b>capacity</b> <b>credits</b> {{equal to or greater}} than a 100 % wind farm because of their reduction in power output variability...|$|R

40|$|As {{the utility}} {{industry}} adapts {{to meet the}} changing regulatory and business climate, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important for utilities to identify and quantify the risks in various aspects of doing business. To reduce the risk of depending too heavily on one specific type of generation or fuel, generation expansion planning techniques are incorporating methods of portfolio diversification theory. Financial option theory is also used to evaluate the relative costs of building now or building later. Applying these theories to utility planning helps utilities assess risks in the emerging competitive environment. Risk is typically measured as a variance. For example, the risk associated with an investment can be characterized by the rate-of-return variance. Many studies that calculate the <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> of a wind plant do not calculate its variance, and therefore ignore risk. A <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> that is calculated in this way can be far different than the long-term average value. This problem is compounded by the usual method of calculating <b>capacity</b> <b>credit,</b> which depends very heavily on the level of wind generation during the system peak hours. A small change in wind power during the peak can have a dramatic effect on the <b>capacity</b> <b>credit.</b> This problem is further compounded by the limited availability of multi-year wind data sets {{that can be used in}} utility production cost modeling. For example, a study that uses a single year of data and finds a 30 % <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> may be based on a wind generation pattern that is not at all typical. Although the preferred approach would be to use many years of wind data to obtain a range of <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> estimates, this is not always possible.

40|$|The {{value of}} wind power as firm {{capacity}} in an electricity grid without storage is investigated, primarily {{by means of}} a numerical probabilistic model. The magnitude of wind power <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> is usually found to be greater than 40 percent of the <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> of a typical conventional unit with the same average power output. For very small values of wind power penetration into the grid, the two measures of <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> utilised are each approximately equal to the average wind power, while for large penetrations the measures approach different constant values. The behaviour at both limits is in good agreement with the results of an analytic probabilistic model. The results are also compared with those from an hour by hour computer simulation. It is found that wind power <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> is very sensitive to the penetration of wind power into the grid, to the unit sizes of the conventional plant in the grid and to the start up speed of the aerogenerators. The credit is moderately sensitive to the replacement of the load distribution by a Gaussian distribution, to the forced outage rate of conventional plant, to the wind speed distribution and to the magnitude of the loss of load probability in the absence of wind power plant. The credit is found to be insensitive to the rated speed of the aero generators (given the same average wind power output) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> {{is widely used}} to {{quantify}} the contribution of renewable technologies to securing demand. This may be quantified {{in a number of}} ways; this paper recommends the use of Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC, the additional demand which the new generation can support without increasing system risk), with system risk being measured using Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE, this is calculated through direct use of historic time series for demand and wind load factor). The key benefit of this approach is that it automatically incorporates the available statistical information on the relationship between wind availability and demand during the hours of very high demand which are most relevant in assessing system adequacy risk. The underlying assumptions are discussed in detail, and a comparison is made with alternative calculation approaches; a theme running through the paper is the need to consider the assumptions carefully when presenting or interpreting risk assessment results. A range of applications of capacity credits from Great Britain and Ireland are presented; this includes presentation of effective plant margin, ensuring that the optimal plant mix secures peak demand in economic projection models, and the Irish capacity payments system. Finally, new results comparing <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> results from the Great Britain and Irish systems using the same wind data are presented. This allows the various factors which influence <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> results to be identified clearly. It is well known that increasing the wind load factor or demand level typically increases the calculated <b>capacity</b> <b>credit,</b> while increasing the installed wind capacity typically decreases its <b>capacity</b> <b>credit</b> (as a percentage of rated capacity). The new results also show that the width of the probability distribution for available conventional generating capacity, relative to the peak demand level, also has a strong influence on the results.
