Aakash Chopra then reminds Bhogle that Pakistan will get a chance to enter the quarterfinals if India beat Ireland in their next match. The supporter switches back to his Pakistan jersey after his team wins its next match. He then hears Chopra saying that Pakistan are not yet through to the knockout stage as a big defeat in their last group game to Ireland <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> exit the World Cup.|$|E
25|$|UPCI {{doctrine}} also {{distinguishes between}} {{the fruit of}} the Spirit, as mentioned in Galatians 5:22â€“23, and the initial act of speaking in tongues. The fruit of the Spirit takes time to develop or cultivate and therefore does not qualify as an immediate, outward and identifiable sign of receiving the Holy Ghost. Speaking in other tongues, on the other hand, does serve as that sign and is therefore considered an indispensable part of any person's salvation process. Acts 2:33, they knew they had the Holy Ghost because they could hear them and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> speak with tongues. 1 Cor. 14:22, tongues is for a sign, not to them that believe but to them that believe not.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservative}} {{parties were}} in opposition {{through most of}} the 1980s with Labor yet to suffer from major fallout from the WA Inc fiasco and the 1987 stock market crash. In 1989 Liberal opposition leader Barry MacKinnon was pushing for the Nationals to help block supply in the Upper House to topple the Dowding government. Cowan refused to cooperate knowing that a small swing to the Liberals in the coming election <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> (the Liberals) gain as many as nine seats and an absolute majority in the Assembly, thus weakening the Nationals' position. In February the following year, Cowan and the Nationals had reversed their stance and decided to block supply in a bid to present themselves as a decisive and consistent conservative force.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, on the New York Giants' road uniforms, purple lines {{gave their}} uniforms a tartan-like effect, and {{another kind of}} road uniform was a solid dark blue or black {{material}} with white around this time. The Kansas City Athletics' home and road uniforms were changed by Charles O. Finley in 1963, to the colors of gold and green. Some teams used light blue for their road uniforms from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Early striped patterns developed into long stripes {{along the length of}} the uniforms, called pinstriping. This was first worn on some major league baseball team's uniforms in 1907, and the pinstripes were then widened in 1912, so that the crowd <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> more clearly.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
25|$|The first intimation {{that the}} British {{received}} that a withdrawal had begun was when British patrols probing German outposts towards Serre, found them unoccupied. They then began a slow follow-up but unreadiness, the decrepitude {{of the local}} roads and the German advantage of falling back on prepared lines behind rearguards of machine-gunners, meant that the Germans completed an orderly withdrawal. The new defences were built on a reverse slope (Hinterhanstellung) where there were positions behind the defences, from which artillery observers <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> experience having showed that infantry equipped with machine-guns needed a field of fire {{only a few hundred}} yards/meters deep. Unfortunately, General Ludwig von Lauter and Colonel Kramer from OHL ignored the new thinking and in much of the new line, artillery observation posts in the front line or in front of it and the front position was on forward slopes, near crests or at the rear of long reverse slopes.|$|E

25|$|The book rose to #84 on the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bestseller lists in June 2011 {{shortly after}} its title was announced. Green promised that every pre-order would be hand-signed by him, {{requiring}} {{him to sign}} every copy of the first printing. He proposed that the general public vote on the color Sharpie he would use to sign the books, resulting in him signing the 150,000 books {{with a variety of}} Sharpie colors, each in proportion to the amount of votes received for that color. However, some people who ordered from international booksellers received unsigned copies because those bookstores, including Amazon UK, underestimated how many books they needed and ordered more after the signing was complete, but Green agreed to fix this problem, telling people with unsigned pre-orders to email him so they could be sent a signed bookplate. Many fans submitted their book cover designs to various outlets including Tumblr and Twitter, tagging Green in these posts so he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> The sizeable number of posts received has prompted Green's publisher Penguin to seek a fan-designed cover for a reprint of one of Green's other books, An Abundance of Katherines. The Fault in Our Stars debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Chapter Books and remained in that spot for seven consecutive weeks. A Hebrew edition of The Fault in Our Stars was published in Israel in August 2012 and more editions of the novel are forthcoming in Dutch, German, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Chinese, and Portuguese. The Fault in Our Stars has also gained places on several bestseller lists. It was #1 on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, #1 on the Indiebound bestseller list, and #9 on The Bookseller bestseller list. The novel was also The New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice. As of January 2013, there are nearly 1 million copies of the novel in print. In December 2012, it was announced that a special edition with a silver cover and an expanded Q, dubbed the 'Exclusive Collector's Edition', would be available from Barnes and Noble. All or at least most of the copies first available for purchase of this edition of the book contained a printing error wherein several pages of the first chapter were replaced with pages from the Q section {{at the back of the}} book.|$|E

500|$|Jack and Kate {{return to}} the beach and Jack starts talking to people about moving to the caves. The castaways argue whether to stay on the beach where a rescue party <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> (and keep the signal fire burning), or move to the caves, where there is more shelter and fresh water. The group splits into two camps accordingly: Jack, Locke, Charlie, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Jin, Sun, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), Doug, and Sullivan (Scott Paulin) move to the caves while Kate, Sawyer, Sayid, Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Walt, Vincent (Madison), Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace), Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), Rose Nadler (L.

500|$|Several pre-release {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal gave the episode a largely positive review and noted that [...] "If you can erase last season from your mind, you'll see this ... is exactly how The Office should have carried on after Steve Carell left." [...] Furthermore, he praised the addition of Duke and Lacy, calling their performances [...] "so good you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> become {{the centerpiece of a}} new series." [...] Verne Gay of Newsweek awarded the episode an [...] "Aâ€“" [...] and called the installment [...] "very (very) funny." [...] He was especially happy about the addition of Lacy and Duke, calling them [...] "flashbacks to a younger Jim and Dwight." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "the ninth and final season actually may offer completion" [...] of a show that has just [...] "merely offered variations on [...] tics" [...] for the past eight seasons. Bob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the episode [...] "generally funnier than [...] was last season" [...] and wrote that the episode would be a good opportunity [...] "for viewers who quit the [...] last year ... {{to come back to the}} show." [...] Particularly, he was excited to [...] "see the seeds of the show's end planted." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] âˆ’ including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears âˆ’ until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> glaze over." ...|$|E
500|$|As their {{relationship}} progresses, Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in}} with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RTÃ‰ Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in. Nicholls said, [...] "And then in his usual charming style he brings her breakfast in bed on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, he knows how to bring the balance back to the relationship." [...] In May 2010, the Daily Mirror's Brian Roberts reported that a new plot for Audrey and Lewis <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Greece. The couple go on holiday to a Greek island and Audrey is taken with Lewis' idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life out there. Roberts likened the plot development to that of the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan; Nicholls said that Audrey is unaware of his doubts. Laws also compared the plot to a similar one in another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), and predicted that both storylines would end in heartache. Nicholls wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and have a happy ending, and wanted to see a spin-off series focusing on the pair and their new life in Greece. Olivia Buxton from the Daily Mirror questioned whether Lewis would go through with the plan; she wrote that two endings to his story arc had been filmed, one of which showed him making a dramatic exit.|$|E

500|$|Conger {{tracked down}} Jett and interrogated him, {{learning}} of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers {{caught up with}} the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett's tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying, [...] "I prefer to come out and fight." [...] The soldiers then set the barn on fire. As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive [...] "raised his pistol to shoot" [...] at them. Conger's report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth [...] "without order, pretext or excuse," [...] and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive. Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26. The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, [...] "Tell my mother I died for my country." [...] Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> Booth uttered his last words, [...] "Useless, useless," [...] and died as dawn was breaking. In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth's fiancÃ©e Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, [...] "Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment." ...|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Wall, {{like the}} much longer inner German border between East and West Germany, was {{designed}} with two purposes in mind: to obstruct would-be border-crossers and to enable border guards {{to detect and}} stop illegal border crossings. In its final form, the [...] wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a [...] "death strip" [...] some [...] to [...] wide. [...] It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. [...] The shooting orders, or SchieÃŸbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and {{that the use of}} deadly force was required to deal with them: [...] "Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used". [...] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was [...] "a dead refugee is better than an escaped one". At first, wounded or shot refugees were left out in the open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was sought to be prevented. Because of this, border guards often pulled people down into the car-moat {{that was part of the}} whole border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall.|$|E
