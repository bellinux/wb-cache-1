2500|$|According to Tuna's log {{the five}} {{remaining}} canoes were disembarked at 1930 hours on 7 December. However sources differ on the start time between 1936 and 2022. The plan {{was for the}} crews to paddle and rest for five minutes in every hour. The first night, 7/8 December, fighting against strong cross tides and cross winds, canoe <b>Coalfish</b> had disappeared. Further on the surviving crews encountered [...] high waves and canoe Conger capsized and was lost. The crew consisting of Sheard and Moffatt held on {{to two of the}} remaining canoes, which carried them as close to the shore as possible, and had to swim ashore. Carrying on with the raid, the canoes approached a major checkpoint in the river and came upon three German frigates.|$|E
50|$|Saltstraumen {{is popular}} with anglers, {{due to its}} {{abundance}} of fish such as saithe, cod, wolffish, rose fish, and halibut. <b>Coalfish</b> is a specialty of the area. The largest documented <b>coalfish</b> of 22.7 kg was caught in Saltstraumen on a fishing rod.|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} also an ideal spot for fishing, with pollock, <b>coalfish,</b> wrasse and {{mackerel}} being caught.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to rising}} cod prices, modern kibbeling is {{typically}} made from {{other species of}} fish, such as pollack, hake, whiting or <b>coalfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{inhabited}} early {{due to a}} lagoon, perfect for boats in bad weather. Wildlife includes fresh water fish (trout, salmon), sea fish (cod, <b>coalfish,</b> crustacean), grouse, and moose. It is an attractive area for fishing and hunting.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century large {{quantities}} of herring were produced in Scotland.Today mainly mackerel, Atlantic cod, whiting, <b>coalfish,</b> European plaice, and sole are caught. In addition, common shrimp, lobster, and crab, along with a variety of shellfish are harvested.|$|E
5000|$|Kinnagoe Bay attracts {{fisherman}} {{from all}} around Ireland. The wreck of [...] "La Trinidad Valencera" [...] is favoured by many fish, which can be caught by either spinning from the rocks or casting from the beach. They include pollack, wrasse, <b>coalfish,</b> dogfish, bass, flounder and others.|$|E
50|$|The {{flesh of}} <b>coalfish</b> (P. virens) is darkly {{coloured}} (hence the common name) while that of P. pollachius {{is similar to}} {{other members of the}} cod family. This dark colour in the fresh uncooked flesh may have led to the undeserved reputation of this fish as poor for eating.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coalfish</b> is edible and has {{commercial}} value, {{although it}} is considerably less valuable than premium whitefish such as cod and haddock. To achieve a salmon-like orange color, it can be salted and smoked. In Germany, the fish is commonly sold as Seelachs (literally 'sea salmon'), {{although it is}} not closely related to any salmon.|$|E
5000|$|Whale {{watching}} attracts {{tourists to}} Andøy and the Tysfjord /Lødingen /Svolvær area, and fishing is also popular {{along the coast}} and in the salmon and trout rivers; there is also Arctic char in some rivers. Saltstraumen has the world record for <b>coalfish</b> using a fishing rod, and Røst has the world record for halibut, 202 kg (...) [...]|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} in the {{northern}} parts of the Northern Atlantic, including the Bay of Biscay and Palmas Altas Campus. Adults can grow up to 130 cm and weigh up to 32 kg; the species is of great commercial value to fisheries. The fish can be found close to the shore, particularly in rocky areas, but larger examples tend to be found around off-shore wrecks and reefs. The largest <b>coalfish</b> ever caught was 50 lb at Saltstraumen.|$|E

50|$|Arasvikfjord or Arasvikfjorden (Arasvik Fjord) is a fjord in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The fjord {{is located}} between Aure Municipality and Halsa Municipality in the Nordmøre {{region of the}} county. The fjord {{is part of the}} larger Vinjefjorden, near where the Valsøyfjorden {{branches}} off to the south. European route E39 runs along the south shore of the fjord, through the village of Valsøyfjord. The ferry from Hennset to Arasvika crosses the fjord. The Arasvikfjorden is known for its fishery of cod, <b>coalfish,</b> pollock, mackerel, common ling, tusk, catfish, and several types of flatfish.|$|E
5000|$|In the winter, the codfish {{comes to}} the coastal waters to spawn, {{especially}} to the cod fisheries of Lofoten. Mølja, boiled codfish with liver and roe, is a delicacy that today is served in the best restaurants. In the summer, the <b>coalfish,</b> or saithe, bites, and fresh saithe is often served on the beach, boiled in seawater over an open fire, or fried (typically the smaller <b>coalfish).</b> Halibut is traditional Christmas food. Most fish is served plainly poached, only accompanied by boiled potatoes, carrots and possibly fried bacon. A more particular kind of fish is [...] "gammelsei", saithe that has been conserved {{for a year or}} more. Other traditions are lutefisk and boknafisk, the latter made from stockfish, and in Nordland often from herring. Seawolf and rose fish are regarded as good food, the latter often eaten salted and poached, with the brain (krus) highly regarded, sometimes fried with onions. In addition to cod, herring and potatoes were traditional staple foods (except in the most northern area). Salmon has long traditions as food along the rivers, and also trout which are common also in the numerous lakes. In the latest decades consumption has increased in correspondence with increased salmon fish farming; smoked salmon is very popular, often on open sandwiches, alone or together with boiled or scrambled eggs or salad.|$|E
50|$|The Ofotfjord has a rich marine life, {{with huge}} {{quantities}} of herring {{staying in the}} fjord in the winter. These fish attract a lot of whales (orca). Divers have occasionally observed lobsters in the fjord, the northernmost sightings of lobsters in the world. Cod, as well as <b>coalfish,</b> {{are the most common}} fish species throughout the year. Mackerel is common from July to mid-September. Sea eagles and otters have made a strong comeback and are now very common in and around the fjord. Sea gulls are common all year, and many migratory birds arrive in summer, such as oystercatchers and grey herons.|$|E
5000|$|Pollock (alternatively {{and more}} {{commonly}} among anglers spelled pollack; pronounced [...] ) {{is the common}} name used for {{either of the two}} species of North Atlantic marine fish in the genus Pollachius. Pollachius pollachius is referred to as pollock in both North America and the United Kingdom, while Pollachius virens today is usually known as coley in the British Isles (derived from the older name <b>coalfish).</b> Other names for P. pollachius include the Atlantic pollock, European pollock, lieu jaune, and lythe; while P. virens is also known as Boston blue (distinct from bluefish), silver bill, or saithe.|$|E
5000|$|Marine life {{includes}} the basking shark {{which have been}} known to enter the harbour. In 1972 a particularly large example was seen at the end of Polruan Quay; it was longer than the width of the quay. Other fish that may be found in local waters including the estuary include: bass, wrasse (4 varieties), seahorse, pipe fish, pollack, <b>coalfish,</b> flounder, plaice, conger eel, European eel, dragonet, red gurnard, grey gurnard, blenny (shanney), bullhead, burbot, butterfish, sand-eel, salmon, sea trout, garfish, mackerel, angler fish (incorrectly named in restaurants [...] "monk fish"), dab, whitebait, scad (horse mackerel), shad, herring, turbot, pouting, poor cod and rockling.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sablefish}} (Anoplopoma fimbria) {{is one of}} {{two members}} of the fish family Anoplopomatidae and the only species in the Anoplopoma genus. In English, common names for it include sable (USA), butterfish (USA), black cod (USA, UK, Canada), blue cod (UK), bluefish (UK), candlefish (UK), coal cod (UK), <b>coalfish</b> (Canada), beshow, and skil(fish) (Canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. In the USA, the FDA accepts only [...] "sablefish" [...] as the Acceptable Market Name; [...] "black cod" [...] is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a Statement of Identity for this species. The sablefish is found in muddy sea beds in the North Pacific at depths of 300 to 2,700 m and is commercially important to Japan.|$|E
5000|$|Sei is the Norwegian {{word for}} pollock, also {{referred}} to as <b>coalfish,</b> a close relative of codfish. Sei whales appeared off the coast of Norway {{at the same time as}} the pollock, both coming to feed on the abundant plankton. The specific name is the Latin word borealis, meaning northern. In the Pacific, the whale has been called the Japan finner; [...] "finner" [...] was a common term used to refer to rorquals. In Japanese, the whale was called iwashi kujira, or sardine whale, a name originally applied to Bryde's whales by early Japanese whalers. Later, as modern whaling shifted to Sanriku — where both species occur — it was confused for the sei whale. Now the term only applies to the latter species. It has also been referred to as the lesser fin whale because it somewhat resembles the fin whale. The American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews compared the sei whale to the cheetah, because it can swim at great speeds [...] "for a few hundred yards", but it [...] "soon tires if the chase is long" [...] and [...] "does not have the strength and staying power of its larger relatives".|$|E
50|$|The sea {{along the}} coast has a rich marine life, and the cod {{fisheries}} in Lofoten has lasted for more than 1,000 years. In addition to cod, <b>coalfish,</b> haddock, herring, wolf fish and halibut are all common {{along the coast}} and in the fjords. Nordland also features many lakes. The largest deep water coral reef (Lophelia pertusa) in the world, the Røst Reef, 40 km long, is located west of Røst, and protected from trawling since 2003. The coast of Nordland has the highest density of sea eagles in Europe. There are millions of seabirds; the islands of Røst has the largest colonies in Norway with about one-quarter of all seabirds in continental Norway, probably most famous for the puffins and cormorants. Lovund also has a well-known colony of puffins. Otters are very common along the coast and fjords, as is harbour porpoise, harbour seals; there are also seals. The largest fish in the sea is the basking shark, which were hunted in earlier days. The character birds along the coast, common in all areas including the fjords, are sea gulls, Eurasian oystercatcher and Arctic terns, and the grey heron has also become common. The Eurasian eagle-owl has a stronghold along the Helgeland coast; predator birds like golden eagle, gyrfalcon and peregrine falcon nest in some inaccessible areas. Orcas are common along the coast and in the Vestfjord area (even in the fjords) in winter, and the world's largest predator, the sperm whale, hunt for prey in the deep waters west of Andøya. Tysfjord and Folda fjord {{is home to the}} world's northernmost lobster population.Spruce forest expansion have been blocked by Saltfjell and Kjølen mountains, thus spruce forest naturally grows only in Helgeland, but are commonly planted in the whole county for economic reasons, sparking some debate. Sitka spruce is also commonly planted in Nordland, particularly in coastal areas. The coastal areas belong to the Scandinavian coastal conifer forests ecoregion; some small areas have been classified as rainforest using botanical criteria as well as precipitation data. Inland areas up to the conifer treeline belong to the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion, while the highlands and mountains belong to the Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|In the North Atlantic, they {{primarily}} eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of <b>coalfish</b> and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|E
40|$|Blood {{samples of}} <b>coalfish</b> from Norwegian and Icelandic waters were {{collected}} and analyzed for hemoglobin, serum protein, and serum esterase variations {{in order to}} study {{the relation between the}} two <b>coalfish</b> stocks. Clear intraspecific variation was found in the serum transferrins, but the distributions of phenotypes were nearly the same in the sample from Iceland as in the total samples from Norwegian waters...|$|E
40|$|At the Møre coast {{there are}} {{important}} spawning areas for cod, <b>coalfish,</b> haddock and herring. As a part of an interaction study of these species, i. e. the predation of the demersal species on the spawning stock and the eggs of herring, an acoustic survey for estimation of the abundance of the demersal stocks {{was carried out in}} the last week of March. During the survey hydrographic data were sampled by a CTD-sonde. Acoustic abundance of demersal fish was devided between cod and haddock as one category and <b>coalfish</b> as another. As biological sampling by trawling occasionally was difficult because of high density of fishermens gillnets and rough bottom, biological data also were sampled from commercial catches in the surveyed area througout March. The behaviour of the fish was favourable for acoustic abundance estimation. However, some informations about haddock, observed as a heavy predator on eggs of herring, were supposed to be lost because it often stuck close to the bottom. The highest densities of cod were observed in the Breisund and at the Buagrunn, the last area also with the best acoustic recordings of <b>coalfish</b> and haddock. The stock abundance estimates of cod, haddock and <b>coalfish</b> were respectively 32 200, 11 560 and 51 760 tonnes. The experiences from this investigation indicate the acoustic method to be prosperous in abundance estimation of demersal fish in the surveyed area during the winter season...|$|E
40|$|Gadoid Fish Committee. Total Norwegian {{landings}} of <b>coalfish</b> {{during the}} last decade averaged 66 000 tons annually. The main types of gear are purse seine, gill nets and otter trawl. Statistics of quantities by month and area are available, but effort data for other than trawl fisheries are lacking. Regular <b>coalfish</b> investigations were started in 1953 / 54 with main emphasis on age and growth studies and tagging experiments. Fluctuations in relative year-class strength are probably apparent already in the littoral stage of the O-group, but numerical estimates of recruitment at this age have not yet been accomplished. Variations in growth rate between different localities and from year to year seem to occur, particularly in the younger age-groups. There is some evidence of density dependent growth. Fall and winter fisheries with gill nets and otter trawl are mainly exploiting the mature stock, while the purse seine fisheries are to a great extent based on a few age-groups if immature fish. In years of great abundance of the III-group some purse seine effort is diverted to fishing small fish for industrial purposes, and this has probably dampened the fluctuations in recruitment to the stock of larger and more valuable fish. Since 1954 over 11 700 tagged <b>coalfish</b> have been released, mainly in July, August at the coast of Finnmark. Mre than 3 700 recoveries are reported to date. The young age-groups are fairly stationary, whereas the mature fish undertake regular distant spawning migrations to the west coast banks and the northern North Sea. Since 1956 / 57 yearly emigrations of adult <b>coalfish</b> to Faroe Islands and Icelandic waters have been demonstrated. The tag density at SE Iceland indicates that this emigration is of considerable magnitude. The tagging data suggest a high yearly reduction rate for <b>coalfish</b> at the Norwegian coast, similar to that shown by German investigations. Factors other than fishing seem to be the dominating cause, and it is suggested that dispersal and emigration are significant contributors to the high apparent total mortality rate...|$|E

In the young immature fish there is a marked trend of gradual movement towards north and east. The regular spawning migrations previously reported on, are clearly demonstrated. In Finnmark migrations start from October to December. By January the main bulk have reached the Malangen and Lofoten banks where immature fish are left behind. On the spawning grounds tagged fish are recaptured in January, February and March. The eventual return migrations are not clearly demonstrated as only few mature fish are recaptured in April, May and June.
