He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' Theorem. [...] Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, which is credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem, [...] though the statement of the theorem has a long history. Eudoxus (408-c. 355 BC) developed the method of exhaustion, which allowed the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> and volumes of curvilinear figures, {{as well as a}} theory of ratios that avoided the problem of incommensurable magnitudes, which enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time, introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today. Archimedes (c. 287-212 BC) of Syracuse used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave remarkably accurate approximations of Pi. He also studied the spiral bearing his name and obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution.|$|E

In the second stage, generates the surfaces of roads domain zones. Finally, it jointly processes the layers of APP and surfaces of roads with a preexisting land use classification layer.

40|$|Abstract Background A C 825 T {{polymorphism}} {{was recently}} {{identified in the}} gene encoding the β 3 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (GNB 3). The T-allele is significantly associated with essential hypertension and obesity. In order to further explore a possible pathogenetic link between the T-allele and impaired glucose tolerance we studied metabolic and haemodynamic responses to oral glucose loading in young, healthy subjects with and without the 825 T-allele. Methods Twelve subjects with and 10 without the 825 T-allele were investigated at rest and following glucose ingestion (75 g). Blood glucose, serum insulin and haemodynamics were determined prior to and over 2 hours following glucose ingestion. We non-invasively measured stroke volume (SV, by impedance-cardiography), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and systolic-time-intervals. Cardiac output (CO) was calculated from HR and SV. Total peripheral resistance was calculated from CO and BP. Metabolic and haemodynamic changes were quantified by maximal responses and by <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> under the concentration time profile (AUC). Significances of differences between subjects with and without the T-allele were determined by unpaired two-tailed t-tests. A p Results Metabolic and haemodynamic parameters at baseline were very similar between both groups. The presence of the T-allele did not alter the response of any metabolic or haemodynamic parameter to glucose loading. Conclusions In conclusion, this study {{does not support the}} hypothesis that the C 825 T polymorphism may serve as a genetic marker of early impaired glucose tolerance. </p...|$|E

40|$|Close range hyperspectral imaging is a {{developing}} method {{for the analysis}} and identification of material composition in many applications, such as in within the earth sciences. Using compact imaging devices in the field allows near-vertical topography to be imaged, thus bypassing the key limitations of viewing angle and resolution that preclude the use of airborne and spaceborne platforms. Terrestrial laser scanning allows 3 D topography to be captured with high precision and spatial resolution. The combination of 3 D geometry from laser scanning, and material properties from hyperspectral imaging allows new fusion products to be created, adding new information for solving application problems. This paper highlights the advantages of terrestrial lidar and hyperspectral integration, focussing on the qualitative and quantitative aspects, with examples from a geological field application. Accurate co-registration of the two data types is required. This allows 2 D pixels {{to be linked to}} the 3 D lidar geometry, giving increased quantitative analysis as classified material vectors are projected to 3 D space for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> and examination of spatial relationships.
