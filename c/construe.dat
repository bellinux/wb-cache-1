5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, {{where women}} broke social {{conventions}} by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares these traditions to the benandanti of early modern Friuli, and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to <b>construe</b> the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to <b>construe</b> the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the past}} twenty years however, there has been a major shift in linguists' {{understanding}} of intermediate levels of acceptability. This is due to the increasing use of experimental methods to measure acceptability, making it possible to detect subtle differences along a scale of acceptability. Keller (2000) and Fanselow et al. (2004) are two proponents of this new way to <b>construe</b> grammaticality.|$|E
25|$|For example, most {{insurance}} {{policies in the}} English language today have been carefully drafted in plain English; the industry {{learned the hard way}} that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} interpretations for the orb Mary is holding {{in her right}} hand. It is tempting to <b>construe</b> it as the globus cruciger of the Holy Roman Empire.

25|$|Claims {{that someone}} other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works {{traditionally}} attributed to him were first explicitly made in the 19th century. Many scholars consider {{that there is no}} evidence of his authorship ever being questioned prior to then. This conclusion is not accepted, however, by proponents of an alternative author, who discern veiled allusions in contemporary documents they <b>construe</b> as evidence that the works attributed to him were written by someone else, and that certain early 18th-century satirical and allegorical tracts contain similar hints.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{also has}} the power to grant {{declarations}} to strike down unconstitutional legislation. Article 4 of the Constitution states that legislation enacted after the commencement of the Constitution on 9 August 1965 that is inconsistent with the Constitution is void, but the Court of Appeal has held that on a purposive reading of Article 4 even inconsistent legislation enacted before the Constitution's commencement can be invalidated. In addition, Article 162 places a duty on the Court to <b>construe</b> legislation enacted prior to the commencement of the Constitution into conformity with the Constitution.|$|E
40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) is {{an eating}} {{disorder}} characterized by severe body image disturbances. Recent studies from spatial cognition showed {{a connection between the}} experience of body and of space. The objectives of this study were to explore the meanings that characterize AN experience and to deepen the examination of spatiality in relational terms, through the study of how the patient <b>construes</b> herself and her interpersonal world. More specifically this study aimed (1) to verify whether spatial variables and aspects of <b>construing</b> differentiate patients with AN and healthy controls (HCs) and are related to severity of anorexic symptomatology; (2) to explore correlations between impairments in spatial abilities and interpersonal <b>construing.</b> A sample of 12 AN patients and 12 HCs participated in the study. The Eating Disorder Inventory, a virtual reality-based procedure, traditional measures of spatial abilities, and repertory grids were administered. The AN group compared to HCs showed significant impairments in spatial abilities, more unidimensional <b>construing,</b> and more extreme <b>construing</b> of the present self and of the self as seen by others. All these dimensions correlated with the severity of symptomatology. Extreme ways of <b>construing</b> characterized individuals with AN and might represent the interpersonal aspect of impairment in spatial reference frames...|$|R

25|$|On the whole, I cannot {{find in the}} Canadian Bill of Rights {{anything}} clearly {{showing that}} Parliament intended to establish concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles to be enforced by the courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes existing at the time. In my opinion, Parliament did nothing more than instruct the courts to <b>construe</b> and apply those laws {{in accordance with the}} principles enunciated in the Bill on the basis that the recognized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the courts.|$|E
25|$|Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this {{influenced}} the logical positivists, who formulated {{the theory of}} emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of attitudes and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not <b>construe</b> ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that ethical considerations are not only meaningful, but {{that they are a}} vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to ethical considerations.|$|E
25|$|After the {{transfer}} of sovereignty, certain provisions of the Bill of Rights ceased to have effect, including sections 2(3) (duty to have regard to purpose of Ordinance in interpretation), 3(1) (duty to <b>construe</b> pre-existing legislation consistently with the Ordinance), 3(2) (pre-existing legislation that cannot be construed consistently is repealed) and 4 (all future to be construed {{so as to be}} consistent with the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong). However, due to the entrenchment of the ICCPR as applied in Hong Kong in Article 39 of the Basic Law, the significance of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, which was modelled after the ICCPR, has been reinstated.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between context and lexicogrammatical systems {{is still being}} developed within SFL. For the position taken in this paper, the relationship of instantiation may provide one way to develop an account of lexical representation within the framework. The concept of construal is also significant. Halliday (1991 : 282) explains that “the culture is <b>construed</b> by systems of language choice; the situation is <b>construed</b> by patterns of language use”. Based on Fig.  2, this statement can be rephrased in more abstract general terms as follows: the meaning potential is <b>construed</b> by systems of language choice; the instance is <b>construed</b> by patterns of language use. This is a point we {{will come back to}} in the next section when considering meaning potential and instance in terms of lexical representation.|$|R
25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to {{lend support to the}} theory that would class them as such, their {{fundamental}} doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to <b>construe</b> from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E
25|$|Contract law {{works best}} when an {{agreement}} is performed, and recourse {{to the courts}} is never needed because each party knows her rights and duties. However, where an unforeseen event renders an agreement very hard, or even impossible to perform, the courts typically will <b>construe</b> the parties to want to have released themselves from their obligations. It may also be that one party simply breaches a contract's terms. If a contract is not substantially performed, then the innocent party is entitled to cease her own performance and sue for damages {{to put her in}} the position as if the contract were performed. She is under a duty to mitigate her losses and cannot claim for harm that was a remote consequence of the contractual breach, but remedies in English law are footed on the principle that full compensation for all losses, pecuniary or not, should be made good. In exceptional circumstances, the law goes further to require a wrongdoer to make restitution for their gains from breaching a contract, and may demand specific performance of the agreement rather than monetary compensation. It is also possible that a contract becomes voidable, because, depending on the specific type of contract, one party failed to make adequate disclosure or they made misrepresentations during negotiations.|$|E
500|$|Section 9A(3)(d) {{allows the}} court to {{consider}} [...] "any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament". Under this provision, material relating to the original Act may be looked at in interpreting an amendment. However, {{it would not be}} wise to set a precedent for the unregulated use of original material in construing a subsequent amendment. After all, it is not a rule that Parliament must legislate consistently with past legislation. On the contrary, subsequent legislation must, where inconsistent with its predecessor, prevail over it. The objective of the court is not to <b>construe</b> all legislation as if Parliament was in some way bound by its intentions when it first passed the Act. It is to <b>construe</b> why Parliament has seen fit to amend that Act {{in the light of the}} inadequacies that the passage of time has revealed or new needs carried by the tide of progress.|$|E
