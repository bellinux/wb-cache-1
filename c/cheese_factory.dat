5|$|One Fierce Beer Coaster was {{originally}} released on Republic Records, which, under its earlier name, <b>Cheese</b> <b>Factory</b> Records, had previously released material by the band. As word-of-mouth {{praise for the}} album spread, however, Geffen Records signed the band after two months. Packaging design was created by designer Michael Calleia.|$|E
25|$|The EUS {{is housed}} in a {{building}} known as The Cheeze. The Cheeze or <b>Cheese</b> <b>Factory</b> is a former <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> located at 2335 Engineering Road, UBC—east of the Cairn. The building, built in 1919, is currently the oldest wood-frame building on campus and has been modified {{for use by the}} EUS.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997 general election, the Bloc lost {{official}} opposition status, slipping {{to third}} place in the House of Commons behind Preston Manning's Reform Party. During the campaign, Duceppe visited a <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> where he was photographed wearing a hairnet resembling a shower cap, which was widely parodied on Canadian television.|$|E
50|$|Charles W. Sweeting, Wisconsin State Assemblyman and businessman, {{lived in}} Clarks Mills; Sweeting managed several <b>cheese</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of {{poor soil}} conditions, early farmers {{eventually}} turned to raising dairy herds. By 1887, {{there were six}} <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> in Norway.|$|R
50|$|There's also a dairy {{industry}} of 300 centres of extraction and 25 <b>cheese</b> <b>factories,</b> honey production, and salt extraction from salt basins.|$|R
25|$|Since 1940 {{there has}} been no major new {{construction}} in the district, save the 1948 Classical Revival Monroe Theatre, next to the <b>cheese</b> <b>factory.</b> The racetrack's grandstand was demolished in 1964. The stone bridge was demolished in 1994. The Monroe Theater was demolished and replaced with a modern structure, which has since been acquired by the Town of Monroe.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{lifeblood of}} Tokoroa is forestry, centred {{at the nearby}} Kinleith Mill; and dairy farming. In 1995, Fonterra built the southern hemisphere's largest <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> in Lichfield, some 5km north of the town. Recently, due {{to an increase in}} dairy prices, large amounts of previously forested land either have been or {{are in the process of}} being converted into farmland.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the rise}} and fall in {{population}} of this southern prairie community, Willow Bunch has hosted and said farewell to a variety of businesses, services, and industries. Scanning historical records and personal stories, one can find everything from Jean-Louis Légaré’s <b>cheese</b> <b>factory,</b> in operation from 1887 to 1894, to Joanne Prefontaine’s photography business, For Real Photography, in full operation today.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to tourism, Malbuisson {{has one of}} the last <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> to produce Comté cheese in the traditional fashion in big copper cauldrons.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} {{primarily}} agricultural before becoming {{more dependent on}} dairying {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, when six <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> were located in Ava.|$|R
50|$|Sebeka {{once had}} {{the second largest}} creamery {{in the state of}} Minnesota. Over the years there have been {{approximately}} ten creameries in the county and ten <b>cheese</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
25|$|Weather and prairie fires {{took their}} toll on ranchers in the area. A {{combination}} of drought and harsh winter weather between 1886 and 1887 devastated herds in southwestern Saskatchewan. Légaré himself lost 350 head of cattle in 1893-1894, forcing {{the closure of the}} <b>cheese</b> <b>factory.</b> Prairie fires in 1885 were also responsible for the destruction of the willows that the town and area were named for.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} industry, Jibou has profiled, in time, on certain sectors of light industry, wood processing, food, crafts and construction. Productive units have small {{production}} capacities, but optimally harness material {{and human resources}} of the area. In this regard can be mentioned: Confecții SA, Samtex, Multiprod, Mining Company, Bălănean Mill, the Progress cooperative, the Craftsman cooperative, the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Factory,</b> Absolut Typography, Clem SRL, Calion Prod, etc.|$|E
25|$|The French Counts of St Hubert, Saskatchewan {{established}} Rolanderie Ranch and {{a gentleman}} lifestyle at Whitewood, Saskatchewan in 1884. The Counts sought {{to establish a}} number of commercial ventures, including a chicory processing factory, a Gruyere <b>cheese</b> <b>factory,</b> a sugar beet venture and a horse breeding operation. They occasionally socialized with the English colonial outpost of Cannington Manor. In the 1880s Edward Pierce tried to transplant early Victorian living at Cannington Manor in the 1880s, now preserved as Cannington Manor Provincial Park.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{poor soil}} conditions, dairy herding was {{prominent}} from the pioneer days, leading to five butter and <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> {{in the town}} at one time in the past.|$|R
50|$|In {{partnership}} with his wife's brother, he owned three <b>cheese</b> <b>factories.</b> Chamberlain {{was also a}} director of the Parry Sound Lumber Company, owned by John Classon Miller, the husband of his sister Adelaide Augusta.|$|R
50|$|P008 is a phage {{specific}} to Lactococcus lactis, an {{acid lactic bacterium}} used {{in the first stage}} of making cheese. P008 and related species are responsible for important loss each year in <b>cheese</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Kyrö Distillery Company was {{registered}} as Rye Rye Oy by Miika Lipiäinen, Mikko Koskinen, Kalle Valkonen, Miko Heinilä and Jouni Ritola on 29 August 2012 in Isokyrö, Finland. The idea {{to establish the}} company came to the founders in a sauna while wondering the lack of whisky distilleries based on rye in Finland—an ingredient they considered vital to Finnish society. The distillery itself was built next to the River Kyrö in a 1908 built <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> used to produce Finnish Oltermanni cheese—that Heinilä knew to be vacant at the time.|$|E
25|$|Gruyère {{cheese is}} an {{important}} factor in supporting the tourist trade in the region. A major tourist attraction is the medieval town of Gruyères with its castle, containing a regional museum and an arts museum. There are cultural activities in the castle (concerts, theater). There is a <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> in Pringy which is open to visitors. Nearby is Mont Moléson, a mountain suitable for climbing, or for the less athletic there is a cablecar to the summit which was rebuilt in 1998. The resort town Moléson-Village caters for both summer and winter tourism.|$|E
25|$|The mile {{of highway}} along the Wallkill is at first wooded and curvy but then offers many {{pleasant}} riverside scenes. A burned-out former Borden <b>Cheese</b> <b>factory</b> {{is the last}} highlight before crossing the county line. This section of the river is popular with local fishermen {{and there are many}} informal parking spots available (In winters when it is cold enough for the river to freeze over, snowmobile trails can be seen on the ice). A Ulster County sheriff's substation is the first in a string of buildings that indicate the road has reached the hamlet of Wallkill.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} more widely {{available}} after some local <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> began producing it {{and it can be}} a useful way of using up the ritagli ("scraps" [...] or [...] "rags") of mozzarella.|$|R
50|$|He {{attended}} the common schools there and later {{attended the}} Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University). He worked at his father’s store and later, as a Farmington businessman and agriculturist, he established thirteen <b>cheese</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} in milk production {{led to the}} emergence of both privately owned and cooperative <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> by the 1860s. Canadian cheddar was produced for export and was a source of hard cash in a cash-starved economy.|$|R
25|$|Agriculture {{also played}} an {{important}} part in Waterford's economic history. Kilmeadan about 5km from the city was also home to a very successful co-operative. The farmers of the area benefited greatly from the sale of their produce (mostly butter and milk) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated, and was registered as Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> on a green field site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was {{to become one of the}} most recognised and successful cheddar brands in the world. This is evident as the brand won a gold and bronze medal in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Sheep were {{introduced}} to the area in 1894, of which the Métis tended small herds. Growth, however, was slow for ranchers. Limited markets and a lack of transportation infrastructure in southwestern Saskatchewan forced ranchers to start out small. Bonneau, Sr. and his three sons began ranching in 1886 with only four horses and four cattle, but by 1900, Bonneau, Sr. had a herd of 400 head of cattle and 400 head of horses. After opening a <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> in 1888, Jean-Louis Légaré maintained the largest ranching operation in the area for a time. The ranching operation of Bonneau, Sr.'s son, Pascal Bonneau, Jr., became even bigger. By 1900 Bonneau, Jr. had a herd of 5,000 to 6,000 head.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Nada moved to Europe, setting in Austria, {{and began working}} with a <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> in Graz. In 1961, {{a close friend of}} Nada's invited him to Libya where a {{construction}} boom was developing. Nada seized on the occasion and started to spend his time between Libya and Austria. In {{a matter of a few}} years he became the largest supplier of cement to the North African country. The activity led him to partner with Cementir, the Italian cement maker, to develop in 1965 the world's first floating cement silos, two barges named GI-1 and GD-2 able to store bulk cement and loaded with bagging facilities. Cement soon became his main business along with smaller operations in other commodities ranging from steel to agricultural materials. Nada had tremendous business success in his ventures with Saudi Arabia, Libya and eventually, the Nigerian government.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} once famous for cheese production. Today, the {{remnants}} of the industry are seen with one of the old <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> remaining in the town; it has been converted into a commercial row of shops.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s and 40's Lansing {{was home}} to one of two <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> in Ashe County. Lansing's cheese plant offered local farmers a place to bring their goods instead of {{traveling}} to the county's other cheese plant in West Jefferson.|$|R
50|$|Wolfe Island is {{the site}} of most Kingston radio {{transmit}}ters; CKWS TV and radio, CKLC, CIKR and CFRC transmit from the island. It also had historically been the site of various <b>cheese</b> <b>factories,</b> including one once operated by Kraft Foods.|$|R
500|$|The <b>cheese</b> <b>factory</b> {{is housed}} in a small, glass-walled {{facility}} in Seattle's Pike Place Market, on Pike Place between Stewart Street and Pine Street. The location includes a retail shop and a café that features cheese-based meals. Passers-by in the heavily touristed market can watch the cheese making process. Beecher's produces over [...] of cheese annually. Their manufacturing facility now operates {{twenty-four hours a day}} to keep up with their demand. The New York facility is significantly larger than Seattle's and can produce over three tons of cheese a day.|$|E
500|$|The Bloodhound Gang {{began as}} a small {{alternative}} band from King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The band took its name from [...] "The Bloodhound Gang", a segment on the 1980s PBS kids' show 3-2-1 Contact that featured three young detectives solving mysteries and fighting crime. The band consisted of Jimmy Pop, Daddy Long Legs, M.S.G., Lupus Thunder, and Skip O'Pot2Mus. In April 1994, the band released their second demo tape, The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to Hitler's Handicapped Helpers (1994). This resulted in a record deal with <b>Cheese</b> <b>Factory</b> Records, which was later renamed Republic Records. Later that year, the Bloodhound Gang released their first EP, Dingleberry Haze (1994).|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{began with}} {{three weeks of}} [...] "cryptic" [...] messages designed to create interest in the promotion. Herb was mentioned in newspaper advertisements, on banners at football games, and in flyers distributed to the public. On November 24, 1985, the first commercials were aired on CBS, NBC, and ABC. The premise of the commercials was that Herb {{was the only person}} in the United States who had not eaten a burger from Burger King. The advertising agency created a fictional biography for the character, claiming that he was raised in Wisconsin, had worked in a <b>cheese</b> <b>factory,</b> and had also sold decoy ducks. The character is commonly referred to as [...] "Herb the Nerd".|$|E
50|$|In 1915, Gravelford had two <b>cheese</b> <b>factories,</b> two churches, an Adventist academy, and {{a public}} school. As of 1990, only two houses {{remained}} of the town. Gravelford's volunteer fire department is a satellite station of Myrtle Point. Gravelford Cemetery was founded in 1884.|$|R
50|$|The town lies at {{an average}} {{altitude}} of 1600 m, {{in the foothills of}} the Virunga Mountains. Masisi is the location of a number of <b>cheese</b> <b>factories.</b> Most of the cheese produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo comes from Masisi Territory.|$|R
40|$|Surveys {{were made}} of rural artisan <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> located {{in the region of}} Olancho, Catacamas, and Juticalpa in Honduras (n= 10) and in Esquipulas and Muy-Muy in Nicaragua (n= 13). The {{objective}} was to analyze the milk market of small rural artisan <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> in livestock watersheds of Honduras and Nicaragua to determine if there is a market for higher milk production; how much additional milk can the market absorb in each season of the year; there is a market for milk of higher hygienic quality. The main buyer of the milk from small and medium scale farmers in Honduras and Nicaragua is the rural artisan cheese industry, which absorbs almost 80 % of the milk produced in both countries. Total milk production during the rainy season is about twice that during the dry season, causing an over-supply and scarcity of milk, respectively. The shortage of fluid milk during the dry season leads to an unsatisfied market. The artisan <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> in Honduras and Nicaragua would be willing to buy 76 % and 55 % more milk during the dry season, but this supply is not available due low milk productivity. This fact suggests that an aggressive program for the promotion of shrub legumes with sugarcane to supplement the herd during the dry season would have more impact that the promotion of grasses or legumes for the rainy season when there is little market for additional milk produced. In addition, rural artisan <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> in Honduras and Nicaragua, that consider the milk they collect is of bad quality, {{would be willing to pay}} a higher price if the option to collect milk of better hygienic quality exists. In Honduras this price would be about 9 % higher during the dry season and 11 % higher during the rainy season. In Nicaragua the <b>cheese</b> <b>factories</b> would be willing to pay a milk price which is 17 % higher, but only during the rainy season. As a result, large incentives exist in both countries to increase milk production during the dry season and to improve the hygienic quality of milk in the studied areas...|$|R
