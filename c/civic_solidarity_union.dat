5000|$|Part of the KMT's loss {{could be}} {{attributed}} to defections to both the People First Party and Taiwan <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Union.</b> The People First Party formed by James Soong and his supporters after the 2000 presidential elections. Soong had been expelled from the KMT after launching an independent bid for the presidency and narrowly lost the race to Chen Shui-bian. The Taiwan <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Union</b> was formed by supporters of former President and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who took the title of [...] "spiritual leader" [...] in the party. For this, Lee was also expelled from the KMT. Though the both offshoots of the Kuomintang, the People First Party advocated a more conservative position than the KMT while the Taiwan <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Union</b> took on a radical pro-independence stance. After Lee's expulsion, the KMT and PFP had a warming of relations and cooperated in the election. The more moderate pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party cooperated with the Taiwan <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Union</b> likewise, leading to the formation of the pan-blue and pan-green coalitions.|$|R
