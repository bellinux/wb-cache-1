40|$|The {{accelerated}} erosion of soil by water from Mediterranean hill-slopes under viticulture {{is a major}} problem. It is largely {{a result of the}} land management techniques employed and their influence on soil protection, structure and stability. Within this study, the relationships between viticulture practices, soil physical characteristics and erosion processes have been explored in detail, and a soil conservation strategy, which incorporates the use of herbicide managed cover, has been developed. The strategy was applied and tested in two established vineyards in southern France over a three year period (October 2001 to December 2004). Sediment and runoff losses were monitored at the plot scale from the date of treatment installation and comparisons were made with the losses from plots under conventional soil management. Cultivation, to produce a fine seedbed for <b>cover</b> <b>establishment,</b> encouraged soil to become hydrophobic and impeded drainage at depth. This aggravated soil losses under saturated conditions and impeded <b>cover</b> <b>establishment.</b> However, total sediment losses were reduced by the presence of a cover at both sites within the monitoring period. The results of a ‘Visual Soil Assessment’ showed that there was a measurable improvement in the physical condition of the soil of the vegetated plot {{three and a half years}} after the cover was sown. Controlled laboratory studies were conducted to identify the most suitable herbicide product and dose rate for inducing dormancy in a grass cover, whilst retaining its protective and stabilizing properties. Two products were tested: Paraquat and Glyphosate. At 21 days after treatment application, the treatment effects on plant and soil physical characteristics were assessed. Herbicide product and dose were found to indirectly influence a soil’s potential to erode but more detailed studies are required. Initial results suggest that Paraquat is the more suitable of the two products tested. The study concluded that herbicide managed permanent cover is a practical option for soil conservation in Mediterranean viticulture...|$|E

40|$|In Australia, {{the mining}} {{industry}} has major concerns for how mining practices {{can affect the}} wider community and environment. One particular aspect {{of this is the}} mining operation’s treatment of waste and runoff water before it runs from the mining ground. Waste materials from Bentonite mining can be highly sodic and infertile, which often has high Montmorillonite clay content. These materials are highly erodible due to the highly dispersive characteristics of the sodic soil when wet. High water velocity, particularly from concentrated flow of runoff water will lead to severe erosion problems on these soils. Sodium also provides unfavourable conditions for ground <b>cover</b> <b>establishment.</b> Field trials were conducted to determine the establishment of vetiver grass on very high exchangeable sodium (ESP) soils and the effectiveness of vetiver hedges in spreading concentrated flows and trapping sediment over major flow areas, in providing a support mechanism for other plant growth and in reducing signs of visible erosion. Results to date have shown that vetiver hedges will establish easily on extremely sodic soils when adequately supplied with fertilisers and water. Although not fully established (10 month old) the hedges are very effective in trapping both coarse and fine sediment (which will support other plant life) and have reduced visible signs of erosion. 1...|$|E

40|$|Cost {{effective}} {{strategies for}} Railway Batter Erosion Control are presented. Plot scale field trials {{were set up}} on a railway embankment batter on the Laleham branch near Blackwater as part of HEFRAIL Project. The embankment at this site exhibited considerable tunnel (piping) erosion on the top access road and the batters {{as a result of}} the formation being strongly sodic and moderately saline. Hence the shoulder of the embankment had to be reconstructed. The erosion control strategies on the plots were centred on control (doing nothing after surface preparation), limited use of erosion control blankets and waste ballast as mulch on seeded plots. It has been demonstrated that with a cost effective irrigation system, 100 % grass <b>cover</b> <b>establishment</b> on railway batters is achievable within 12 weeks. 100 % grass cover reduces erosion by over 90 % compared with the bare scenario. The cost of the 25 different treatments imposed at this site varied $ 2. 621 m² and $ 4. 11 /m², including an irrigation cost of $ 1. 68 /m². The shoulder reconstruction cost of $ 3. 27 /m² is additional. It is estimated that current conventional civil engineering remediation measures related to erosion on railway batters within Central Queensland coal network cost on average $ 11. 73 /m² Therefore, the treatments imposed are cost effective. The irrigation unit cost is expected to decrease with the larger scale of irrigated batter area and the refinement of the technologies, and installation procedures...|$|E

This expansion raises environmental concerns, not only regarding land-use change and its consequences, but also concerning potential impacts of losses of nitrogen such as ammonia volatilisation, nitrous oxide emission and nitrate leaching and runoff. The prerequisite to any work on the reduction of losses and identification of best practices is the development of an assessment tool. However, the available knowledge regarding nitrogen losses is limited for oil palm, which leads to high uncertainty in environmental assessment. In this context, we chose to develop an agri-environmental indicator, IN-Palm, which aims at estimating the risk of nitrogen losses in oil palm plantations, using the INDIGO® method. This kind of operational model is built to assess environmental risks as well as being used as a decision support tool. The development of indicators is particularly relevant in such contexts of data scarcity, as it allows for harnessing the most of readily accessible data from a whole range of sources, i. e. measured or modelled, qualitative or quantitative, empirical or expert knowledge. We adapted the indicator to characteristics of the oil palm system, such as the tropical climate, the long growth cycle of about 25 years and the high production of biomass. We designed it to be easily implementable with available data on climate and soil conditions, and sensitive to practices such as fertiliser application (type, rate and timing), legume <b>cover</b> <b>establishment,</b> and residue management. Future work will include a sensitivity analysis, a validation against experimental data of losses in Sumatra, and a validation by end-users in a plantation in Sumatra...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall induced erosion, {{and related}} {{sedimentation}} issue, on steep slopes (batters) of railway embankments in Queensland is causing increased maintenance costs. Grass <b>cover</b> <b>establishment</b> is being employed {{to combat the}} erosion problems as it slows down runoff, the roots increase infiltration and the foliage decreases the impact of raindrops on the soil surface. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate grass cover effects on runoff on railway formation steep slopes to help quantify the scale of the problems. Long-term monitoring of runoff and soil loss is an expensive exercise, so limited field trials have been carried out to calibrate a 1 -D distributed rainfall-runoff model that takes into account the initial moisture. It consists of the Saint Venant continuity and momentum equations for overland flow, and a modified Green-Ampt model for infiltration on steep slopes. The experimental batter plots, each 10 m wide and with different grass cover percentages, were established at the Gregory Erosion project field trials site near Blackwater, Queensland, Australia. Rainfall and runoff were monitored at 1 minute intervals. It is observed that the average values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) for 0 %, 50 % and 100 % grass cover are 0. 3, 5. 03 and 22. 56 mm/hr respectively, and in general runoff decreases exponentially with grass cover percentage. The model has successfully predicted runoff from the plots, with the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency values varying between 0. 50 and 0. 83. With the aid of an antecedent moisture parameter which varies with grass cover percentage, continuous simulation of runoff can be carried using long records of observed fine timescale rainfall or derived from a stochastic rainfall model...|$|E

40|$|In Poland, 82 % {{of forests}} are State-owned, and only 17 % of forests {{constitute}} private property. Each year, forests are converted to other land-use types, mainly for road construction. The afforestation rate on privately-owned low-productivity land is decreasing steadily. The owners and perpetual usufructuaries {{of this kind}} of land are eligible to government subsidies to <b>cover</b> <b>establishment</b> expenditures in whole or in part, provided that the afforestation scheme complies with the local zoning plan or an outline planning permission. The above creates a dilemma for farmers—is this a profitable option of managing low-productivity land? Owners of small farms particularly often face such dilemmas. Owners of small farms, which consist of low-yield agricultural land, can be regarded as investors operating on the real estate market, but those investors have features characteristic of agricultural producers. This study relied on the net present value (NPV) criterion, which is popularly used to assess the effectiveness of investments on the real estate market. A financial feasibility assessment performed with the use of such method in view of afforestation statistics and the 5 % discount rate on the Polish forest market revealed the highest increase in net cumulative cash flows in the first five years, followed by a gradual decrease in successive years. The first negative cash flow was reported in year 20. NPV would remain negative because farmers would be charged with periodic maintenance expenditures until the stand reaches harvestable age at approximately 40 years. The longer the investment period, the lower the profits, even if discount rate is excluded. Investments of the type are difficult to terminate because forests younger than 20 years are difficult to sell at a price that covers growing outflows. Afforestation projects are also influenced by other economic and non-economic factors. The paper validates the research hypothesis that afforestation is a long-term investment that delivers benefits for future generations...|$|E
40|$|It has {{repeatedly}} {{been reported that}} snow cover is a dominating factor in determining {{the presence or absence}} of permafrost in the discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions. The temperature at the snow-soil interface by the end of winter, known as the bottom temperature of winter snow (BTS) method, has been used to detect the existence of permafrost in European alpine regions when the maximum snow depth is about 1. 0 m or greater. A critical snow thickness of about 50 cm or greater can prevent the development of permafrost in eastern Hudson Bay, Canada. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of snow cover on {{the presence or absence of}} permafrost in cold regions through numerical simulations. A one-dimensional heat transfer model with phase change and a snow cover regime is used to simulate energy exchange between deep soils and the atmosphere. The model has been validated against the in situ data in the Arctic. The simulation results indicate that both snow depth and the onset date of snow <b>cover</b> <b>establishment</b> are important parameters in relation to the presence or absence of permafrost. Early establishment of snow cover can make permafrost disappear, even with a relatively thin snow cover. Permafrost may survive when snow cover starts after the middle of December even with a snow thickness > 1. 0 m. This effect of snow cover on the ground thermal regime can be explained with reference to the pattern of seasonal temperature variation. Early establishment of snow cover enhances the insulating impact over the entire cold season, thus warming and eventually thawing the permafrost. The insulating effect is substantially reduced when snow cover starts relatively late and snowmelt in the spring creates a huge heat sink, resulting in a favorable combination for permafrost existence...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of irrigation schedules {{depends on the}} understanding of the response of key plant traits to different water restriction characteristics with the aim to avoid physiological impairment. In this study, different timings (at tuber initiation and bulking) and intensities (four soil moisture levels) of water restriction were tested in the potato crop. The temporal patterns of mid-morning or maximum, light saturated stomatal conductance (gs_max), recovery of net photosynthesis (Arecovery), stem water potential (stem), carbon isotope discrimination in tubers (tuber), plant water concentration (PWC), photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were analyzed. Early-severe water restriction caused a drastic yield reduction, with low recovery of physiological responses (gs_max, tuber, stem, CWSI, Arecovery) after 15 days of post-restriction irrigation and even a continued reduction of some of them (PWC, PRI). It also caused a prolonged gs_max reduction below 0. 05 mol H 2 O m- 2 s- 1 (˜ 5 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 of net photosynthesis) suggesting that this value defines a physiological severity threshold in potato, under which a metabolic impairment occurs. CWSI and PRI showed a close linear (R 2 = 0. 76) and no linear (natural logarithm function, R 2 = 0. 67) relationship with gs_max respectively. In cloudless dry environments, irrigation schedules in potato should aim to avoiding CWSI values higher than 0. 4, especially until before of maximum canopy <b>cover</b> <b>establishment.</b> A close relationship between Arecovery at maximum stress moment and yield reduction was found.

Tennessee’s 4 -H Wildlife Project is in its 35 th year of growing quality stewardship by 1) teaching the basic principles of wildlife ecology and management, 2) helping students understand the importance of wildlife in our environment, and 3) promoting citizenship/leadership. These efforts may lead to informed participation in natural resource conservation and land-use decision making. The University of Tennessee has collaborated with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) to offer a more comprehensive wildlife curriculum, while also providing more engaging activities for our youth. The 4 -H Wildlife Project consists of a Wildlife Judging contest (known nationally as the Wildlife Habitat Evaluation Program), a Food and <b>Cover</b> <b>Establishment</b> (FACE) contest, and a Junior High Wildlife Conference (Wildlife Camp). The FACE contest is being revised, incorporating a variety of wildlife habitat management techniques as a continuation of what 4 -H’ers learn in Wildlife Judging. In addition, we are featuring the link between wildlife management and shooting sports by incorporating the 4 -H Shooting Sports Curriculum and activities into our “Wildlife Camp. ” This adds engaging activities and interest-related curriculum. These efforts teach 4 -H’ers how to manage our wildlife resources in a more hands-on manner, while grabbing their attention with fun activities.

40|$|This Draft Environmental Impact Statement {{documents}} {{the analysis of}} the No Action, Proposed Action, and three action alternatives developed for the Pretty Tree Bench Project area. The Proposed Action and action alternatives considered in detail, are consistent with current management direction. Each alternative responds differently to the issues associated with the Proposed Action. The Proposed Action prescribes disturbances within a number of different vegetation types throughout the project area. One disturbance practice uses prescribed fire. The acres of treatment by vegetation type through the use of prescribed fire are: Sagebrush (200 - 250 acres), Gambel Oak (450 - 500 acres), Pinyon/Juniper (3000 - 3500 acres), Ponderosa Pine underburn (7000 acres), Mixed conifer underburn (300 - 350 acres), and Aspen regeneration burn (700 acres). A second disturbance practice that is proposed will be the commercial and non-commercial cutting of trees. Where aspen is being invaded by conifer trees, the conifer trees will be cut and removed (1000 acres). Where aspen can be commercially harvested, the aspen will be sold by bid (302 acres). The Proposed Action will also seed burn areas within the sagebrush and pinyon/juniper vegetation types, if ground cover does not establish. Native plant seed will be emphasized, but non-native plant seed can be used. Seeding will be done by hand or by aerial application. Travel management is also a part of the Proposed Action. No road construction or reconstruction would occur. The overall travel management strategy provides for a variety of vehicle uses, and describes year long and seasonal use opportunities. An OHV trail starting from the Dry Lake Trailhead and looping around Haws Pasture would be provided. The overall management would follow a closed unless designated open philosophy. Alternative I uses prescribed fire rather than commercial cutting of aspen. Alternative 2 has reduced commercial and non commercial aspen cutting by only using chainsaw disturbance outside of previously inventoried roadless areas. Alternative 3 reduces commercial aspen harvest to those areas west of the allotment fence. All action alternatives include different travel management practices.

40|$|Revegetation of {{riparian}} {{tree species}} along the lower Colorado River {{is currently a}} major activity for federal and state agencies. Revegetation methods for Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii), and coyote willow (S. exigua) have historically consisted of cutting collection and vegetative propagation. If direct seeding could be implemented, large cost-savings could be realized while enhancing restoration results due to increased genetic and structural diversity. The following documents laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies conducted to establish seed storage practices, irrigation techniques, and seeding methods and rates which maximize germination and growth rates of these riparian tree species. Experimental seed storage study results indicated that seed viability was maintained {{for at least a}} two-year window by freezing, during which seed can be utilized for direct seeding or seedling production. Greenhouse study results include: (1) seed cleaning resulted in higher tree establishment; (2) adverse soil conditions reduced growth rates; (3) organic fertilizer amendment mitigated negative effects of sandy soil for Fremont cottonwood but not for willow; (4) mixed seeding resulted in cottonwood dominance, indicating that reduced rates or separate seeding of this species might be required to improve success of willow species seeding. Small-scale field study results include the following: (1) Fremont cottonwood establishment averaged 7 % of pure live seed rates, whereas willow species establishment was less than 1 %; (2) sprinkler irrigation did not affect establishment, and decreased tree growth rates; (3) hydroseeding resulted in higher canopy <b>cover,</b> <b>establishment,</b> and above-ground biomass compared to broadcast seeding for all three species; (4) furrow or border irrigation did not affect Fremont cottonwood or coyote willow establishment, but furrow irrigation resulted in higher Goodding's willow establishment. Volunteer species were abundant, with grasses dominating cover and biomass after one growing season despite application of grass specific herbicide. Saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) also established in abundance, but grew slower than Fremont cottonwood during the first growing season. Monitoring after three growing seasons indicated higher growth rates and survival of Fremont cottonwood compared to volunteer species.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} already {{demonstrated}} the usefulness and efﬁciency of catch crops to reduce nitrate leaching from cropping systems into groundwater. Catch crops must be sown in summer in a temperate climate, when {{the soil is}} often dry after the main crop harvest. This can lead to poor crop establish- ment. The present study uses a model to explore differences in the emergence rates of catch crops in summer {{for a wide range}} of soil and weather conditions that occur in France and identiﬁes the main causes of failure. The SIMPLE model predicts the emergence duration and rate of crops by considering species and seed characteristics in interaction with seedbed conditions (temperature, moisture, clods and surface crust). The model was previously validated for white mustard and seems appropriate for the present work of simulating ryegrass and vetch emergence under contrasted weather and water stress conditions. Simulations were performed {{for a wide range of}} pedoclimatic conditions and sowing prac- tices (dates, depth and seedbed structures). Soil water content and temperature in the upper layers of the soil were ﬁrst simulated with the STICS soil-crop model and were then validated in an initial step by comparing simulations with experimental data. These outputs were then used as input data for the SIMPLE emergence model. Results showed that, on average, the emergence rates of catch crops sown in summer were sufﬁcient (> 75 %), regardless of species and sowing technique. Simulations indicated that a poor emergence rate (< 50 %) occurred in less than one year in ten for northern sites, and two years in ten in south-western France. In regions with a Mediterranean climate, emergence varied greatly from year to year, with failures (< 25 %) approximately two years in ten and low emergence (< 50 %) in approx- imately four years in ten. In dry summer regions, poor emergence occurred more frequently with early sowing (mid-July) due to water stress, while later sowing (around September 15) was generally more successful. Predictions indicate that sowing date is the management choice with the most impact and that it must be carefully adapted to weather to maximise the potential of catch crops to trap nitrate and thus minimise nitrate leaching. This work illustrates the application of modelling as a tool for evaluating risks and optimising the management of catch crops for a wide range of conditions, which thus increases the success of emergence and <b>cover</b> <b>establishment</b> under ﬁeld conditions...|$|E
40|$|On-site {{running waters}} are often sources of diffuse {{contamination}} around industrial sites {{that need to}} be treated to prevent detrimental effect to the adjacent environment. Settling process, such as sedimentary channels, is one way to limit pollutant spreading. However, in these specific media, pollution may accumulate and sediments become depositories of toxic substances. This project deals with the management of a sedimentary channel highly contaminated by hydrocarbons with the additional difficulty of proposing a solution preserving the nearby environment located within a Natural resource protection area. The aims of the treatment were i) to prevent contaminants mobility by degradation and/or stabilization and ii) to preserve the natural resources of the site. Among remediation process, phytoremediation is an all-encompassing term that includes a variety of techniques and strategies using higher plants that lead to contaminant degradation, removal, or immobilization, by removing contaminant sources, breaking exposure pathways between the source(s) and receptor(s). Furthermore, phytoremediation can be considering as a landscaping action within the global management of the site. Since anaerobic conditions of the sediment compartment is unfavorable to plant growth and organic compounds biodegradation, we proposed a new approach combining phytoremediation and the use of a calcium peroxide (CaO 2) amendment to serve as an oxygen release product (ORP) in order to promote aerobic biodegradation and plant growth. Two experiments under controlled conditions in laboratory were performed: i) batch in vitro tests without plant in order to assess reactivity of the sediment with different ORP (ORP: IXPER 75 C, Solvay) levels and ii) plant growth assays with five selected species. The batch in vitro test showed a strong ORP-effect on physico-chemical parameters, with increasing pH and decreasing redox potential. Only the highest level of ORP enabled hydrocarbons degradation but resulted also in detrimental pH values for both microorganisms’ activity. pH increasing could also lead to strong negative effect on plant growth. Hydrocarbon dissipation was mainly attributed to oxidative processes. Lab plant growth experiments, with moderate levels of ORP to limit excessive pH increase, did not lead to any significant variation of hydrocarbon concentration. However, most of the tested species seemed to overcome the sediment detrimental growth conditions, confirming the phytoremediation feasibility for in situ application. Furthermore, ORP addition improved plant growth especially for Thalia dealbata and Scirpus lacustris. The absence of significant change in hydrocarbon content in sediments could be explained by the recalcitrant nature of the pollution a relative short term experiment. Organic chemistry characterization (GC analysis) revealed that hydrocarbon signature was marked by a large UCM (unresolved complex mixture) signal revealing an already aged and biologically stable pollution.

40|$|Soil {{degradation}} affects {{more than}} 52 million ha {{of land in}} countries of the European Union (Hueso-González et al., 2016). This problema is particularly serious in Mediterranean areas, where the effects of anthropogenic activities (tillage on slopes, deforestation, and pasture production) add to problems caused by prolonged periods of drought and intense and irregular rainfall (Martínez-Murillo et al., 2016). Depending {{on the scale of}} study, soil organic carbón (SOC) dynamics in Mediterranean forests {{have been found to be}} particularly sensitive to factors related to seasonal changes in temperature and soil moisture (Casals et al., 2000; Eaton et al., 2008; Hueso-González et al., 2014). During dry periods in theMediterranean area, the lack of water entering the soil matrix reduces organic contributions to the soil (Parras-Alcántara et al., 2016). These processes lead to reduced soil fertility and soil loss (García-Orenes et al., 2010). Restoring the native vegetation is one of the most effective ways to control soil degradation in Mediterranean areas, especially in very degraded areas. In the initial months after afforestation, vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>establishment</b> and soil quality could be better sustained if the soil was amended with an external extra source of organic matter (Hueso-González et al., 2016). The goal of this study was to test the effect of various organic amendments on select soil properties over a 54 -month period. Five amendments were applied in an experimental set of plots: straw mulching (SM), mulch with chipped branches of Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis L.; PM), sheep manure compost (SH), hydroabsorbent polymers (HP) and sewage sludge (RU). Plots were afforested following the same spatial pattern, and amendments were mixed with the soil at the rate 10 Mg ha- 1. Soil from the afforested plots was sampled in the following: (i) spring 2012 (6 months postafforestation); (ii) spring 2013 (18 months postafforestation); (iii) spring 2014 (30 months postafforestation); (iv) spring 2015 (42 months postafforestation) and; (v) spring 2016 (54 months postafforestation). The sampling strategy for each plot involved the collection of four disturbed soil samples taken from the surface (0 to 10 -cm depth). The soil properties analyzed were as follows: (i) soil organic carbon (SOC); (ii) pH; (iii) electrical conductivity (EC); (iv) aggregates stability (AS) and; (v) texture (TE). Regarding to soil aggregate stability, 54 month after the afforestation, the percentage of stable aggregates has increased slightly in all the treatments (HP, RU, PM, SM and SH) in relation to control. Specifically, the differences were recorded in the fraction of macroaggregates (0. 250 mm). The largest increases have been associated with SM, PM and RU treatments. Although the SM, PM and RU treatments helped to maintain the SOC at high levels in the 54 months following application. Conversely, not significant differences relative to the control plots were found for the pH, EC or texture, 54 months following afforestation. To conclude, these results showed an increase in the SOC and the stability of the macroaggregates when soil is amended with sludge, pinus mulch and straw much. This fact has been due to an increase in the number cementing agents due to: (i) the application of pinus, straw and sludge had resulted in the release of carbohydrates to the soil; and thus (ii) it has favored the development of a protective vegetation cover, which has increased the number of roots in the soil and the organic contribution to it.

The empirical analysis provides strong support for the second hypothesis. While pooled OLS estimates yield positive estimates of the rent-sharing coefficient in <b>covered</b> <b>establishments,</b> dynamic panel data estimates accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of rents point to a rent-sharing coefficient of zero...|$|R

40|$|Compared {{with the}} broad supply of {{theoretical}} approaches towards systemic risk in (international) banking systems empirical contributions measuring its degree or potential triggering factors are rather scarce. Kwast and de Nicolo (2002) put systemic risk and (conditional) stock price correlations into a unique relation. Adopting this perspective, we provide a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC, Engle, 2002) {{analysis for the}} European banking sector. Our sample period <b>covers</b> <b>establishment</b> and advent of the Euro. Apart from time variation of correlation measures we investigate the content of exogenous factor variables to explain correlation patterns. Overall, we find a moderate and stable average level of systemic risk in European banking. The advent of the Euro came along with a 1 -year period of short-run transition dynamics. Systemic risk is found to increase over states of high uncertainty in national stock markets and states of small-to-medium variation in European interest rates. ...|$|R

In searching for contamination, the FDA typically uses organoleptic inspection methods - investigators trained to distinguish contamination and decomposition by sight and smell. Upon completion of such an inspection, the FDA will generate an [...] "Establishment Inspection Report" [...] (EIR) detailing any problems found. Where problems are found, the FDA will instruct the owner of the inspected facility how to proceed in resolving those problems. FDA inspectors may take photographs of an establishment unless they are expressly told not to do so, and the owner of the establishment must provide an employee to answer questions that arise during the inspection. If the owner of an establishment refuses to permit FDA inspectors to enter a <b>covered</b> <b>establishment,</b> or any part of one, then the FDA may obtain a search warrant to enter.|$|R

40|$|The Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) is a {{cornerstone}} for European {{efforts to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions, and in its test phase will operate from 2005 - 2007. It is a cap-and-trade system where an aggregate cap on emissions is set by the respective government agencies to define {{the total number of}} emissions allowances. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one unit (usually one ton) of emissions. <b>Covered</b> <b>establishments</b> that exceeded the limits may buy emissions credits from entities with allowances they do not need to use themselves. One key feature of this system is that the amount of emissions is capped whereas the permit prices are uncertain. These permit prices are determined by economic conditions, generally, stronger economic growth means a higher permit price. The objective of this thesis is to understand uncertainty in permit prices under the system, by determining the likelihood that permit prices will fall within a given range. This is accomplishe...|$|R
