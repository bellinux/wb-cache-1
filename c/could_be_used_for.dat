5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> revolution—he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|North Korea's lack {{of large}} airstrips and {{aircraft}} meant it conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost {{no role in}} North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate {{with large numbers of}} ships.|$|E
5|$|Parker and Colesberry {{looked at}} {{locations}} near Jackson, Mississippi, where {{they set up}} production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. They also visited Canton, Mississippi before travelling to Vaiden, Mississippi, where they scouted more than 200 courthouses that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> filming. Parker and Colesberry had difficulty finding a small town for the story setting before choosing LaFayette, Alabama to act as scenes set in the fictional town of Jessup County, Mississippi, with other scenes being shot {{in a number of}} locales in Mississippi.|$|E

For {{this reason}} it is {{misleading}} {{to think of}} them as axes, they <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering.

50|$|The colonial {{aircraft}} {{were expected}} to have to use basic or unprepared strips, so needed a robust undercarriage. The R.16 had large 1150 mm diameter wheels, independently mounted and fitted with brakes that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> steering, enclosed under large fairings. Each wheel was on a cranked steel half axle from the lower fuselage with a trailing recoil strut and a vertical oleo leg to the engine mounting.|$|R
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} two-tier {{stand to}} the north and east were {{presented}} next. The plans had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.|$|E
5|$|The Camäleon {{class was}} based on the earlier s, though they were {{significantly}} larger. The Prussian Navy had determined that larger gunboats with more powerful engines would be more versatile for peacetime use; members of the Prussian House of Representatives suggested the vessels <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> commercial voyages. The Landtag authorized funds for the first four ships of the Camäleon class in 1859, and the design was prepared by Chief Constructor Carl Elbertzhagen. In 1860, the Landtag approved another four vessels of the class.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov design bureau (OKB) was ordered, in 1936, {{to begin}} {{development}} of a fast twin-engined aircraft that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> ground attack duties and as a heavy fighter. It delivered the ground attack version the following year for evaluation, although it could be modified as necessary for other roles. The VIT-1 was reasonably successful, but {{it was decided to}} give it more powerful engines and modify its structure. The improved aircraft was designated as the VIT-2.|$|E

5|$|The base also {{contained}} a Noncommissioned Officers Club and an Officers Club. The Noncommissioned Officers Club, or Club 42 {{as it was}} known, allowed in all military members and civilians up the GS-7. Many varieties of food were also offered there, and it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> live entertainment, {{in addition to the}} booking of parties. As the Visiting Officers Quarters and the Unaccompanied Officers Quarters were nearby, the club was also a convenient stopover for transient officers as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the electric fire engine system.|$|E
5|$|Troop {{hospital}} cars, {{also based}} on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Each had 38 berths for patients, 30 of which were arranged in the central section of the car in three tiers on each side. There was also a section with six berths which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases. Each unit was ice air-conditioned and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment.|$|E

5|$|A replica Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.|$|E
