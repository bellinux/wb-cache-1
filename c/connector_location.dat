40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an exact {{finite element model}} for the linear static analysis of shear-deformable two-layer beams with interlayer slip. The layers are connected in a discontinuous way and therefore the shear connection is modeled using concentrated spring elements at each <b>connector</b> <b>location.</b> The Timoshenko beam theory is adopted for each layer {{in order to take}} into account the transverse shear deformations. It is assumed that no uplift can occur. Both layers have, thus, the same transversal deflection but different rotations and curvatures. The effect of friction at the interface has been accounted for by assuming that the friction force is proportional to the normal force at the interface. Based on the above key assumptions, the governing equations of the problem are established and an original closed-form solution is derived. From the analytical expressions for the displacement and force fields, the exact stiffness matrix for a generic two-layer beam element is deduced, which can be incorporated in any displacement-based F. E. code for the linear static analysis of two-layer beams with interlayer slip and arbitrary loading and support conditions. Finally, a parametric study, dealing with a two-span layered composite beam subjected to the uniformly distributed load, is carried out to study the effects of varying material and geometric parameters, such as connector spacing, interlayer friction coefficient, the connector stiffness, flexural-to-shear moduli ratios and span-to-depth ratios. The results indicated that the deflection is a quasi-linear function of the flexural-to-shear ratio (E/G) and the shear deformation begins to affect significantly the deflection when the length-to-depth ratio (L/H) is below 8. Further, the effect of the interlayer friction on the deflection becomes significant if the connector is rigid. Furthermore, the shear deformation effect on the cross-section rotation is more pronounced in the layer with low flexural stiffness...|$|E

Free-breathing enclosures, on the other hand, allow ventilation, but can also admit moisture, insects and airborne contaminants.

25|$|The XLR {{connector}} {{was invented}} by James H. Cannon, founder of Cannon Electric in Los Angeles, California (now part of ITT Corporation), {{and for this reason}} it was sometimes colloquially known as a Cannon plug or Cannon connector. Originally manufactured as the Cannon X series, by 1950 a locking mechanism was added (Cannon XL) and by 1955 a version surrounding the female contacts with a synthetic rubber polychloroprene insulation using the part number prefix XLR. There was also an XLP series which used a hard plastic insulation, but was otherwise the same. ITT Cannon originally manufactured XLR <b>connectors</b> in two <b>locations</b> Kanagawa, Japan and Melbourne, Australia. The Australian operation was sold to Alcatel Components in 1992 and then acquired by Amphenol in 1998. ITT Cannon continues to manufacture XLR connectors in Japan.|$|R
40|$|In the modeling, {{simulation}} {{and control}} of power electronic circuits, {{it is important that}} the correct data of the components is available. Often, simplified models are used which ignore the parasitics. This leads, in some cases, that in reality some effects occur that were not predicted by the simulations. Especially when the switching frequencies in a power electronic converter is of the order megahertz and the components are getting smaller and smaller, a good knowledge about the parasitics is important. This thesis examines the following:- What ways are there to measure the parasitics in a power electronic circuit? This can be examined for the important components in a circuit: a coil, capacitor, transformer, PCB lines. It is not easy to measure small inductances and capacities. The choice of the probe, <b>connectors,</b> conductors, <b>location</b> of measurement [...] . will all affect the measurement result for small components. A measuring device for measuring nH-inductances has been developed by Electa [1]. Development of methods for accurate measurements of small parasitics is a first part of the thesis. - Most of the time the measurements are done first. Then, using a model for an electronic component, these measurements are fit on model parameters. A simple example is: a coil can be modeled by an inductance, resistance and capacity.

30|$|One process {{based on}} phase {{inversion}} of fillers in microstructures for the fabrication of multi-level three-dimensional (3 -D) microstructures is described using SU- 8, {{a kind of}} epoxy photoresist, as the model constructing materials. This process is depicted by use of the routine photolithography technique to construct {{the top layer of}} 3 -D microstructures on the bottom layer of 3 -D microstructures layer by layer. This process makes it possible to fabricate multi-level 3 -D microstructures with <b>connectors</b> at desired <b>locations,</b> and to seal long span microstructures (e.g. very shallow channels with depth less than 50 μm and width more than 300 μm) without blockage. In addition, this process can provide a sealing layer by the solidification of a liquid polymer layer, which can be as strong as the bulk constructing materials for microstructures due to a complete contact and cross-linking between the sealing layer and the patterned layers. The hydrodynamic testing indicates that this kind of sealing and interconnection can endure a static pressure of more than 10 MPa overnight and a hydrodynamic pressure drop of about 5.3 MPa for more than 8 hours by pumping the tetrahydrofuran solution through a 60 μm wide micro-channels.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. January 2016. Major: Biomedical Engineering. Advisors: Victor Barocas, Joan Bechtold. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 36 pages. Background: Early onset scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity {{of the spine}} and trunk – diagnosed {{before the age of}} 10 – and occurs in 3 to 5 out of 100, 000 infant and juvenile populations. Surgical intervention is often necessary for pediatric patients with severe curvatures. During thesis procedures, spinal rods – known as pediatric non-fusion devices (i. e. growing rods) – are placed in the patients to allow for spinal growth. ASTM standards exist for fusion constructs. Growing-rod constructs place greater demands on the rods as no fusion is performed and the rods are continually loaded. Also, the constructs are serially lengthened at 6 -month intervals placing additional demands on the construct. Currently, there are no standards on how to develop and utilize a finite element model – to predict durability of commonly used constructs within the patient. Methods: Finite element models representing static compression bending were implemented using Abaqus CAE (Dassault Systemés Simulia Corporation, Providence, Rhode Island). The model geometry and loading was based on ASTM standard 1537 and 136. The models were created with C 3 D 8 R type elements. The model applied a controlled displacement until failure or contact occurred between the superior and inferior UHMWPE blocks. Failure was defined as the point at which permanent deformation of the construct occurs, due to fracture, plastic deformation, or slip. Eight constructs were analyzed based on the rod material (titanium and cobalt chrome), active length (76 -mm and 376 -mm), and construct type (F 1717 and growing-rod). Results: The force-displacement curves and maximum principle stress for each whole model were evaluated. The longer active lengths required a smaller force for failure. Failure at the pedicle screw head was found on each model. Conclusions: A new ASTM standard for growing-rod constructs should be created based off of a longer active length, the overlap of the rod <b>connectors,</b> and <b>location</b> of the rod connectors...|$|R
40|$|Slab–girder {{structures}} {{composed of}} steel girder and reinforced concrete slab {{are widely used}} in buildings and bridges in the world. Their advantages are largely based on the composite action through the shear connection between slab and girder. In order to assess the integrity {{of this kind of}} structures, numerous vibration-based damage identification methods have been proposed. In this study, a scaled composite slab–girder model was constructed in the laboratory. Some removable shear connectors were specially designed and fabricated to connect the girder and slab that were cast separately. Then, a two-stage experiment including both static and vibration tests was performed. In the first stage, vibration tests were conducted under different damage scenarios, where a certain number of shear <b>connectors</b> at certain <b>locations</b> were removed step by step. In the second stage, two sets of hydraulic loading equipment were used to apply four-point static loads in the test. The loads are increased gradually until concrete slab cracked. The loading histories as well as deflections at different points of the beam are recorded. Vibration test was carried out before and after concrete cracking. Experimental results show that the changes of mode shapes and relative displacement between slab and girder may be two promising parameters for damage identification of slab–girder structures...|$|R
