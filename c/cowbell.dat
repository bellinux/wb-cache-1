5000|$|One of the Bulldogs' proudest and longest traditions is {{the ringing}} of <b>cowbells.</b> From 1977 to 2009, [...] "artificial noisemakers" [...] were banned by the SEC, {{including}} <b>cowbells,</b> but fans continued to bring them in even though administrators encouraged fans not to use <b>cowbells</b> and security guards [...] "search" [...] you upon entry. There could {{be as many as}} 40,000 <b>cowbells</b> in the stadium during a big game. In the 2010 season, a compromise was reached on a trial basis allowing fans to legally bring <b>cowbells</b> under SEC rules to games at Davis Wade Stadium as long as the <b>cowbells</b> were only used at sanctioned times: Pregame, quarter breaks and Half-time, Time Outs, and when Mississippi State scores. [...] Prior to the 2014 season the SEC adopted a new policy stadium sound policy that gave MSU fans even more leeway to use the <b>cowbells.</b> The new policy [...] "allows schools to play music and use their sound systems at any time during a game, with except from the time the center stands over the football to when the ensuing play is whistled dead. The new rule also includes traditional institutional noisemakers, including MSU fans' cowbells".|$|R
