5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

25|$|After an {{argument}} between Mercy and Fatboy, she pushes {{him and he}} falls onto a tree planted in memory of Trina Johnson (Sharon Duncan Brewster), breaking it. Worried that Trina's ex-husband Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) will be angry with them, they enlist Leon and Zsa Zsa's help to replace the tree. However, as they dig up the tree, they discover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy when she says it is all she can see when she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She attends Lucas's Bible class and questions him about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to make an excuse to leave because he cannot answer her. Grace asks Mercy {{to write a letter}} of apology to Lucas, but Mercy throws it away. Mercy and Fatboy play rounders but smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window, which Fatboy repairs. Mercy asks Dot if she can attend her church. When Zsa Zsa is left homeless, she asks to move in with Mercy and her grandmother.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore {{appears in}} {{an episode of}} Icons of Teen from the YouTube channel, Shut Up Cartoons voiced by Justin Roiland. As a teenager, Dumbledore liked to do magic and make robotic copies of himself. One day, he went scuba diving to earn his scuba diving badge for scouts. Dumbledore gets scared and stays on the boat while his crush Charlene and the scoutmaster go diving. They run into a giant sea monster and Charlene <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and says Dumbledore, a trick he taught her. Dumbledore {{receives}} her distress signal and dives in after them. He meets a talking dolphin who agrees to help Dumbledore if he can eat him in the end. Dumbledore suggests he eat the scoutmaster and the dolphin takes him to his friends. Dumbledore makes a robotic copy and sends it into the creature's stomach, distracting the creature long enough for Dumbledore, Charlene and the scoutmaster to escape. Charlene thanks Dumbledore for saving them. Dumbledore makes a sexual comment but plays it off like she said it. Charlene asks where the scoutmaster is; Dumbledore says he's gone somewhere, when really the dolphin ate him. Dumbledore then decides to build a robot copy of the scoutmaster to prevent anyone from finding {{out what happened to}} him.|$|E
500|$|After she {{is finally}} able to parry the Waif's hits, Jaqen H'ghar takes Arya into the main chamber and offers Arya her sight back if she says her name. When she replies, [...] "a girl has no name," [...] Jaqen offers her a drink from the {{poisonous}} well in the temple's entrance chamber. Arya drinks and <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> reopening them to reveal that her sight has been restored.|$|E

2500|$|When Dorothy leaves Oz {{after having}} several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert {{by means of}} the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her {{unexpected}} arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and says: [...] "Theres no place like home". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.|$|E
2500|$|Pe'er {{originally}} {{played with}} a [...] "counter-puncher" [...] style, but by 2010 she had adopted a more attacking style of play. Her forehand uses a semi-western grip, which makes her good in facing big top-spin opponents. Her backhand is two-handed {{and is one of}} the best on the women's tour. It is consistent and finds various angles throughout the court. She loves to take lots of points with the inside out shot on her backhand. She originally used a kick serve that lacked the drive needed to penetrate deep, but she changed it to more of a slice serve, which works great for her now and even generates aces. She has a good volley and doesn't have a problem going to the net. During matches, she often turns her back to her opponent between points, faces the back of the court, <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and tries to wipe the mental slate clean.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E

6000|$|She <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> faintly--she hears {{nothing but}} those words--feels nothing but his arm round her--forgets Mrs. Crayford's warning--forgets Richard Wardour himself--turns suddenly, with a loving woman's desperate {{disregard}} of everything but her love--nestles {{her head on}} his bosom, and answers him in that way, at last! ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (concealing his doubt). Yes, {{of course}} you are. Only I'd a darn sight rather see you up and about. We could take a walk, then--through the woods.

6000|$|MISS HOWARD. Mr. Murray. (Eileen <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> wincingly for {{a moment}} and a shadow of pain comes over her face.) He just came about the time your folks did. I saw him {{for a moment}}, not to speak to. He was going to the main building--to see Doctor Stanton, I suppose. (Beaming--with a certain curiosity.) What {{do you think of that}} for news? ...|$|E
60|$|She drank a little, {{and then}} <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> moved <b>her</b> lips silently {{for a few}} seconds.|$|R
60|$|She half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> for a moment. When {{she looked}} at me again she was laughing.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Bagnet {{shows her}} white teeth cheerfully, {{but to the}} {{perception}} of her son, betrays so much uneasiness of spirit that he is impelled by the dictates of affection to ask her, with his eyes, what is the matter, thus standing, with his eyes wide open, more oblivious of the fowls than before, and not affording the least hope {{of a return to}} consciousness. Fortunately his elder sister perceives the cause of the agitation in Mrs. Bagnet's breast and with an admonitory poke recalls him. The stopped fowls going round again, Mrs. Bagnet <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in the intensity of her relief.|$|E
60|$|There ensued a {{struggle}} that Honora will never forget. And although she never again saw that farm-house, its details and surroundings {{come back to}} her in vivid colours when she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The great horse in every conceivable pose, with veins standing out and knotty muscles twisting in his legs and neck and thighs. Once, when he dashed into the apple trees, she gave a cry; a branch snapped, and Chiltern emerged, still seated, with his hat gone and the blood trickling from a scratch on his forehead. She saw him strike with his spurs, and in a twinkling horse and rider had passed over the dilapidated remains of a fence and were flying down the hard clay road, disappearing into a dip. A reverberating sound, like a single stroke, {{told them that the}} bridge at the bottom had been crossed.|$|E
6000|$|The doctors of {{medicine}} have discovered that certain dreams of the night, for I do not grant them all, are the day's unfulfilled desire, and that our terror of desires condemned by the conscience has distorted and disturbed our dreams. They have only studied the breaking into dream of elements that have remained unsatisfied without purifying discouragement. We can satisfy in life {{a few of our}} passions and each passion but a little, and our characters indeed but differ because no two men bargain alike. The bargain, the compromise, is always threatened, and when it is broken we become mad or hysterical or are in some way deluded; and so when a starved or banished passion shows in a dream we, before awaking, break the logic that had given it the capacity of action and throw it into chaos again. But the passions, when we know that they cannot find fulfilment, become vision; and a vision, whether we wake or sleep, prolongs its power by rhythm and pattern, the wheel where the world is butterfly. We need no protection, but it does, for if we become interested in ourselves, in our own lives, we pass out of the vision. Whether it is we or the vision that create the pattern, who set the wheel turning, it is hard to say, but certainly we have a hundred ways of keeping it near us: we select our images from past times, we turn from our own age and try to feel Chaucer nearer than the daily paper. It compels us to cover all it cannot incorporate, and would carry us when it comes in sleep to that moment when even sleep <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and dreams begin to dream; and we are taken up into a clear light and are forgetful even of our own names and actions and yet in perfect possession of ourselves murmur like Faust, [...] "Stay, moment," [...] and murmur in vain.|$|E
