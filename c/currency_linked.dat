An example of this is the discourse of 'equivalence' in education arising from the converting of experience into academic <b>currency</b> <b>linked</b> to employability. An adjunct to the commodification and marketization of education is the growing role of academic credit awarded for work experience in HE in which work becomes part of commodified learning valued in terms of its exchange value in academia and ultimately employment. The discourse of equivalence conflates parity of this exchange value with parity of use value of the learning and serves to obfuscate the distinctiveness of learning and student engagement in different contexts and the inherent contradictions therein, yet it is these contradictions which could create scope and spaces for resistance.

Fixing the exchange rate of all countries on the gold standard ensured that the market for foreign exchange can only equilibrate through interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} merits of policy rules with escape clauses, {{analysing}} as an example fixed exchange rate systems that allow member countries the freedom to realign in periods of stress. Motivating this example is the debate within the European Monetary System over how quickly {{to move from the}} current regime of national <b>currencies,</b> <b>linked</b> by pegged but adjustable exchange rates, to a single European currency. The paper's main point is that while well-designed rules with escape clauses can raise society's welfare in principle, limited credibility makes it difficult for governments to implement such rules in practice. An EMS-type institution which presumably imposes a political cost on policy-makers who realign may lead to an optimal escape-clause equilibrium, but may just as well lead to alternative equilibria far inferior to an irrevocably fixed exchange rate. Countries can suffer periods in which no realignment occurs, yet unemployment, real wages, and ex post real interest rates remain persistently and sub-optimally high.

The finding has been large estimates: Trade among members seems to double or triple, that is, to increase by 100 - 200 %. After the advent of EMU in 1999, Micco, Ordoñez and Stein and others used the gravity model on a much smaller data set to estimate {{the effects of the}} euro on trade among its members. The estimates tend to be statistically significant, but far smaller in magnitude: on the order of 10 - 20 % during the first four years. What explains the discrepancy? This paper seeks to address two questions. First, do the effects on intra-euroland trade that were estimated in the euro’s first four years hold up in the second four years? The answer is yes. Second, and more complicated, what is the reason for the big discrepancy vis-à-vis other currency unions? We investigate three prominent possible explanations for the gap between 15 % and 200 %. First, lags. The euro is still very young. Second, size. The European countries are much bigger on average than most of those who had formed currency unions in the past. Third, endogeneity of the decision to adopt an institutional <b>currency</b> <b>link.</b> Perhaps the high correlations estimated in earlier studies were spurious, an artefact of reverse causality. Contrary to expectations, we find no evidence that any of these factors explains a substantial share of the gap, let alone all of it. federalism; trade policy; EMU; EMU...|$|R
