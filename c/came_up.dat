5|$|Mark <b>came</b> <b>up</b> {{with the}} music first, then I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the words and we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers {{are very important to}} me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E

5|$|Baby Connor was a {{main focus}} of season three, but the creators {{were well aware of}} the {{limitations}} of a baby character. With Connor’s initial role in plot decided, they <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the concept of a 'teenage' version for further appearances.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E

5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with an old man. When {{the thought of a}} scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes <b>came</b> <b>up,</b> he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} commandos <b>came</b> <b>up</b> against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E

50|$|A certain {{detail that}} <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> {{in the novel}} is whether we are limited to certain realities, such as 2+2=4, a theme that also <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> in Yevgeny Zamyatin's We and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|R

5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time.
