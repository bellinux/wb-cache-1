40|$|AbstractLamongan Municipality {{suffered}} from drought which damaged 12, 519 hectares/year from 2004 to 2011. The drought caused failure to paddy harvesting and limited clean water supply. The <b>Current</b> <b>adaptations</b> are only prioritizing and reducing water use. In addition, changing on farming method {{is one of}} the adaptations as well. These adaptations are inadequate to decrease the impacts of drought. Thus, this paper proposes effective adaptations to drought in Lamongan. To propose effective adaptations, we analyze potential drought areas in the municipality by using overlay and a raster calculator in ArcMap based on SPI Value. Afterward, we assess <b>current</b> <b>adaptations</b> by using Guttman scale to 100 respondents. Finally, we propose effective adaptations for every stage of disaster risk management cycle by using descriptive analysis. 15 out of 27 regencies in Lamongan Municipality suffer from the moderate drought. In total, those areas cover 15, 107. 9 hectares. The analysis of Guttman scale identifies that the <b>current</b> <b>adaptations</b> are in a reactive form of responses. As a result, we propose some effective adaptations which include selecting paddy seeds, providing economic incentives for water use reductions, and activating community savings as well as community friendly EWS (Early Warnig System) ...|$|R

The majority of analysed phenotypic traits showed regional differentiation and all traits showed indications of past selection. Flowering duration decreased with latitude and elevation, suggesting adaptation to growing season length. The Central European populations performed best, indicating home-site advantage. Selection analysis showed positive selection on fitness-related traits whereas phenological traits showed less clear patterns. Trait–trait correlations were mostly neutral or favourable to selection.

40|$|Spike-frequency {{adaptation}} is {{a prominent}} aspect of neuronal dynamics that shapes a neuron’s signal processing properties on timescales ranging from about 10 ms {{to more than}} 1 s. For integrate-and-fire model neurons spike-frequency adaptation is incorporated either as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> or as a dynamic firing threshold. Whether a physiologically observed adaptation mechanism should be modeled as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> or a dynamic threshold is, however, not known. Here we show that a dynamic threshold has a divisive effect on the onset f-I curve (the initial maximal firing rate following a step increase in an input current) measured at increasing mean threshold levels, i. e. adaptation states. In contrast, an <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> subtractively shifts this f-I curve to higher inputs without affecting its slope. As a consequence, an <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> acts essentially linearly, resulting in a high-pass filter component of the neuron’s transfer function for current stimuli. With a dynamic threshold, however, the transfer function strongly depends on the input range, because of the multiplicative effect on the f-I curves.

Due to the heterogeneous nature of the access networks and the range of end terminal devices that will connect with NGNs, video services will be required to adapt video content to suit the needs of individual clients. <b>Current</b> <b>adaptation</b> techniques such as transcoding and redundant storage of video files are inefficient and not easily scalable. A solution that overcomes the limitations of these current solutions is clearly desirable. The recently completed H. 264 /MPEG 4 -AVC Scalable Video Coding (SVC) amendment allows for extraction of multiple quality layers with varying spatial, temporal and quality attributes from a single encoding.

40|$|Neural mass {{signals from}} in-vivo {{recordings}} often show oscillations with frequencies ranging from < 1 Hz to 100 Hz. Fast rhythmic {{activity in the}} beta and gamma range can be generated by network based mechanisms such as recurrent synaptic excitation-inhibition loops. Slower oscillations might instead depend on neuronal <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> whose timescales range from tens of milliseconds to seconds. Here we investigate how the dynamics of such <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> contribute to spike rate oscillations and resonance properties in recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Based on a network of sparsely coupled spiking model neurons with two types of <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> and conductance based synapses with heterogeneous strengths and delays we use a mean-field approach to analyze oscillatory network activity. For constant external input, we find that spike-triggered <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> provide a mechanism to generate slow oscillations {{over a wide range}} of adaptation timescales as long as recurrent synaptic excitation is sufficiently strong. Faster rhythms occur when recurrent inhibition is slower than excitation and oscillation frequency increases with the strength of inhibition. Adaptation facilitates such network based oscillations for fast synaptic inhibition and leads to decreased frequencies. For oscillatory external input, <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> amplify a narrow band of frequencies and cause phase advances for low frequencies in addition to phase delays at higher frequencies. Our results therefore identify the different key roles of neuronal adaptation dynamics for rhythmogenesis and selective signal propagation in recurrent networks...|$|R

We investigate how adaptation, due to calcium-dependent potassium current, affects {{the dynamics of the}} depolarization, as well as the stationary f-I curves of a white noise driven, integrate-and-fire model neuron. In addition to decreasing the slope of the f-I curves, adaptation of this type preserves the sensitivity of the neuron to the fluctuations of the input. ...|$|E

40|$|Author summary: Synchronization of {{neuronal}} spiking in {{the brain}} is related to cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and memory. It is therefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their collective behavior in a network and to understand how. A prominent feature of many cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation, which is caused by slow transmembrane currents. We investigated how these <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> affect the synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically detailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike frequencies, {{as long as the}} conduction delays between the neurons are negligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of conduction delays, with or without <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents.</b> Our results emphasize the utility of the aEIF model for computational studies of neuronal network dynamics. We conclude that <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> provide a mechanism to generate low frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons, while faster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation.

40|$|Many {{types of}} neurons exhibit spike rate adaptation, {{mediated}} by intrinsic slow K^+-currents, which effectively inhibit neuronal responses. How these <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> change {{the relationship between}} in-vivo like fluctuating synaptic input, spike rate output and the spike train statistics, however, is not well understood. In this computational study we show that an <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> which primarily depends on the subthreshold membrane voltage changes the neuronal input-output relationship (I-O curve) subtractively, thereby increasing the response threshold. A spike-dependent <b>adaptation</b> <b>current</b> alters the I-O curve divisively, thus reducing the response gain. Both types of <b>adaptation</b> <b>currents</b> naturally increase the mean inter-spike interval (ISI), but they can affect ISI variability in opposite ways. A subthreshold current always causes an increase of variability while a spike-triggered current decreases high variability caused by fluctuation-dominated inputs and increases low variability when the average input is large. The effects on I-O curves match those caused by synaptic inhibition in networks with asynchronous irregular activity, for which we find subtractive and divisive changes caused by external and recurrent inhibition, respectively. Synaptic inhibition, however, always increases the ISI variability. We analytically derive expressions for the I-O curve and ISI variability, which demonstrate the robustness of our results.
