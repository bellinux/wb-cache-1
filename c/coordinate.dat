5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, <b>coordinate</b> {{compounds}} and repetitive compounds. <b>Coordinate</b> compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. <b>Coordinate</b> compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the <b>coordinate</b> system in space, space inversion, and in time, time {{reversal}}. In the first case, the space <b>coordinate</b> axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E

5000|$|Often the Routhian {{approach}} may offer no advantage, but one notable case {{where this is}} useful is when a system has cyclic <b>coordinates</b> (also called [...] "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those <b>coordinates</b> which do {{not appear in the}} original Lagrangian.

However, if cyclic <b>coordinates</b> occur there will still be equations to solve for all the <b>coordinates,</b> including the cyclic <b>coordinates</b> despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because <b>coordinates</b> and momenta are related together in the solutions - after solving the equations the <b>coordinates</b> and momenta must be eliminated from each other.
