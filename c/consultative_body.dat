5|$|The {{struggle}} for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for internal administration. All parties tried to satisfy the army {{in order to avoid}} interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a free hand to pursue ever larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy—or lack of policy—was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At home, because power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A <b>consultative</b> <b>body</b> of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the King's Council, the consultative governing of the country also depended on other intermittent and permanent institutions, such as the States General, the Parlements (Parliament) and the Provincial Estates. The Parliament of Parisas indeed all of the sovereign courts of the realmwas itself born out of the King's Council: originally a <b>consultative</b> <b>body</b> of the Curia Regis, later (in the thirteenth century) endowed with judicial functions, the Parliament was separated from the King's Council in 1254.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the formation of a Korean Economic Community could be a way to ease in unification of the Korean peninsula. Lee Myung-bak, departing from the Saenuri Party's traditional hardline stance, has outlined a comprehensive diplomatic package on North Korea that includes setting up a <b>consultative</b> <b>body</b> to discuss economic projects between the two Koreas. He proposed seeking a Korean economic community agreement to provide the legal and systemic basis for any projects agreed to in the body.|$|E

The new water law will also create a Water Authority, and the National Council of Water Resources which will serve as an advising and <b>consultative</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
25|$|As time passed, {{it became}} clear that Lozano Díaz had ambitions to replace the {{traditional}} parties with one that he controlled and could use to help prolong his hold on power. He reduced the Council of State to a <b>consultative</b> <b>body,</b> postponed elections, and set about forming his own party, the National Unity Party (Partido de Unidad Nacional, PUN). The activities of other parties were limited, and, in July 1956, Villeda Morales and other PLH leaders were suddenly arrested and flown into exile. A few weeks later, the government crushed an uprising by 400 troops in the capital. Public opinion, however, was becoming increasingly hostile to the president, and rumors of his imminent fall had begun to circulate.|$|E
25|$|Kim put {{particular}} emphasis on the mobilisation of youth. Youth Minister Phan Anh, attempted to centralise and heavily regulate all youth organizations, which had proliferated immediately after the Japanese coup. On May 25, an imperial order decreed an inclusive, hierarchical structure for youth organizations. At the apex was the National Youth Council, a <b>consultative</b> <b>body,</b> which advised the minister. Similar councils were to be organised down to the district level. Meanwhile, young people were asked to join the local squads or groups, from provincial to communal levels. They were given physical training and were charged with maintaining security in their communes. Each provincial town had a training centre, where month-long paramilitary courses were on offer.|$|E

The Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) gives the tools for this by providing scores for countries on various domains of integration policies. The domain which is coined ‘political participation’ seems most relevant for this study. It is composed of several dimensions, namely: electoral rights (to vote and to stand as a political candidate), political liberties (whether they are the same for immigrants as for national citizens), <b>consultative</b> <b>bodies</b> (whether immigrants can be consulted through <b>consultative</b> <b>bodies),</b> and implementation policies (whether immigrants get funding for political activities). 2 [...]...|$|R

25|$|Although Hayashi was {{the head}} of JSDF in the {{capacity}} of Chairman of JSC, he had limited powers to assume command in joint operations as the JSC itself {{was no more than a}} <b>consultative</b> <b>body.</b> It was not changed until 1961, when the functions of the JSC were modified and the Chairman was empowered to give orders to the JSDF when there was an operation. The Chairman was also given greater command authority in joint operations with greater powers to execute orders from the Director-General of JDA. Hayashi retired from the JSC in August 1964 after ten years of service. He was not only the longest-serving Chairman, but was also the only Chairman with civilian civil service background. All of his successors were career military officers and their tenure was confined to around one to three years only.|$|E
25|$|Before Solon's reforms, the Athenian {{state was}} {{administered}} by nine archons appointed or elected annually by the Areopagus {{on the basis}} of noble birth and wealth. The Areopagus comprised former archons and it therefore had, in addition to the power of appointment, extraordinary influence as a <b>consultative</b> <b>body.</b> The nine archons took the oath of office while ceremonially standing on a stone in the agora, declaring their readiness to dedicate a golden statue if they should ever be found to have violated the laws. There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the Ekklesia) but the lowest class (the Thetes) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles. There therefore seemed to be no means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Firstly it is {{underlined}} {{that the}} MGK is a <b>consultative</b> <b>body,</b> {{now with a}} civilian majority.

The council has not anymore expanded executive and monitoring authorities, and has for instance not any more the authority on behalf of the president and the prime minister to follow up on the implementation of the MGK’s ‘recommendations’. In addition, the MGK no longer has unlimited access to all civil institutions. The MGK no longer has a representative in the Supervision Board of Cinema, Video and Music. It was however still represented in civil institutions such as the High Board for Radio and TV (RTÜK) and the Commission for Higher Education (YÖK), but after critics in the 2003 European Commission report this representation was withdrawn from both institutions in 2004.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which effective political participation can be achieved through minority <b>consultative</b> <b>bodies,</b> and what obstacles and shortcomings can potentially occur in practice. It explores the Kosovo case, where a variety of minority <b>consultative</b> <b>bodies</b> were established in recent years to ensure effective minority participation and representation at the highest decision-making levels. It will be argued that despite the prospects of the established legal and institutional framework, these bodies have fallen short in providing meaningful representation of minority interests and needs in Kosovo. This is largely affected by the intermeshed interests of elites among the majority and minority communities that prioritize their narrow interests to the expense of the developmental and emancipatory needs of marginalized minorities in Kosovo. Hence, higher commitment and cooperation between governmental authorities and minority representatives, together with adequate resources, are critical for ensuring effective minority participation in the public sphere...|$|R

It was also agreed between the two that the constitution be written by 2 December 1971. On that date, at the Dubai Guesthouse Palace, four other emirates agreed to enter into a union called the United Arab Emirates. Bahrain and Qatar declined their invitations to join the union. Ras al-Khaimah joined later, in early 1972. In February 1972, the Federal National Council (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member <b>consultative</b> <b>body</b> appointed by the seven rulers.

In 2003, UNA-USA's executive director of policy studies, Jeffrey Laurenti, wrote an article, An Idea Whose Time Has Not Come, arguing that there were important unresolved issues of inclusivity, authority, and efficiency with the UNPA. UNA's position seemed to reverse in November 2006, when the 38th plenary session of the World Federation of United Nations Associations issued a resolution stating that it [...] "Supports the establishment of a United Nations parliamentary Assembly as a <b>consultative</b> <b>body</b> within the United Nations system as a voice of the citizens; Calls upon the governments of the United Nations member states, parliamentarians and civil society representatives to jointly examine possible steps and options to create a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly." ...|$|E

[...] An article in the Asian-Pacific Law & Policy Journal notes that precedents for this idea include the British Parliament, French Estates-General, U.S. Congress, and Europarl, which are all systems in which, over time, power shifted to directly elected officials: [...] "In the past, fledgling democracy has always had to compromise {{with the realities of}} power and evolve step-by-step, where possible. This is often accomplished {{in the form of a}} 'non-democratic' additional house in the parliamentary structure. Thus, in Britain, the necessity of compromise of the 'common people' with the powers and interests of the armed and titled nobility necessitated a bicameral system incorporating the House of Lords, as well as the House of Commons.
