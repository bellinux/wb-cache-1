40|$|Abstract Introduction Sodium-N-chlorine-p-toluene sulfonamide, {{commonly}} known as <b>chloramine-T,</b> is a derivative of chlorine which is widely used as a disinfectant. For many years, <b>chloramine-T</b> {{has been described as}} a cause of immediate-type hypersensitivity, especially with regard to asthma and rhinitis, and as a cause of occupational dermatoses in cleaning personnel in hospitals, although no anaphylactic reaction has yet been reported. Hence, to the best of our knowledge we present the first case of anaphylaxis to <b>chloramine-T</b> with evidence of specific immunoglobulin E antibodies. Case presentation We describe the case of a 25 -year-old Caucasian woman who was in good health and with a negative history for atopy, including no respiratory symptoms of rhinitis or asthma, and with no professional exposure to <b>chloramine-T.</b> She, while showering, applied a <b>chloramine-T</b> solution to a skin area with folliculitis on her leg, and within a few minutes developed generalized urticaria and angioedema, followed by vomiting and collapse with loss of consciousness. A skin prick test with a <b>chloramine-T</b> solution at 10 mg/mL concentration was positive, and specific immunoglobulin E to <b>chloramine-T</b> was quantified at a value of 2. 9 optical density as measured by the enzyme allergosorbent test technique. Conclusion The strict cause-effect relationship and the results of the skin test and the in vitro test make certain the causative role of <b>chloramine-T</b> in this case of anaphylaxis. This suggests that <b>chloramine-T,</b> based on its wide use as a disinfectant, should be considered a possible cause in anaphylaxis of unknown origin. </p...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} {{pathophysiological}} effects of <b>chloramine-T</b> exposure on the respiratory, acid-base and ionoregulatory physiology of the rainbow trout gill. In particular, <b>chloramine-T</b> was used as a tool to probe the fundamental physiological processes of gas transfer, acid-base and ion regulation in response to branchial irritation. Exposure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations of <b>chloramine-T</b> (9 mg. L- 1 and 2 mg. L- 1, respectively) caused acute respiratory and acid-base disturbances. These consisted of an increase in ventilation frequency and arterial blood PCO 2 (PaCO 2); arterial PO 2 (PaO 2) was unaffected. Exposure of fish to <b>chloramine-T</b> under hyperoxic and moderately hypoxic conditions suggested that CO 2 excretion was being impaired due to the secretion of mucus in response to irritation by hypochlorite. To verify that the apparent impediment to excretion was diffusional and not due to a reduced functional surface area for gas exchange, direct measurements of cardiac output, O 2 uptake, CO 2 excretion, dorsal and ventral aortic blood pressures were made. There were no changes in dorsal or ventral aortic pressures or in branchial or systemic vascular resistance. The perfusion convection requirement for CO 2, but not O 2, increased during exposure to <b>chloramine-T</b> even though there were consistent increases in cardiac output. Thus a greater blood flow than was achieved would be required to excrete an equivalent amount of CO 2 during <b>chloramine-T</b> exposure as under non-exposed (control) conditions. However, there was sufficient blood flow to maintain and even increase O 2 uptake. Repeated intermittent exposure of fish to <b>chloramine-T</b> resulted in a reduction in the thickness of the gill epithelial diffusion barrier and a mucous cell hyperlasia. The consequences of these morphological changes on gas exchange were assessed using a graded hypoxic challenge. There was no effect of <b>chloramine-T</b> treatment on oxygen uptake rates but fish which had been pre-treated with <b>chloramine-T</b> maintained their PaO 2 at higher levels at 70 - 80 mmHg water PO 2 compared with controls. PaCO 2 levels were not significantly different between control and experimental animals even though <b>chloramine-T</b> treated animals had higher ventilation frequencies under pre-hypoxic conditions. Acute acid-base disturbances during <b>chloramine-T</b> exposure consisted of a metabolic alkalosis superimposed over a respiratory acidosis. A study of the net and unidirectional ionic and acid-base fluxes across the gill confirmed that <b>chloramine-T</b> exposure caused a reduction in the uptake of acidic equivalents. Acute Na+ and Cl- losses were also observed with <b>chloramine-T</b> exposure and were attributed to an increase in a transcellular rather than paracellular ionic efflux. <b>Chloramine-T</b> did not effect urine flow rate, glomerular filtration rate, renal Na+ and Cl- effluxes or renal clearance of Na+ and Cl-. Exposure of soft-water acclimated fish to <b>chloramine-T</b> did not cause increased ionic losses, consistent with the theory of transcellular rather than paracellular ionic losses. Ionic losses in both normal tap water and artificial soft water acclimated trout were eliminated by the addition of 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|Modification {{of sodium}} {{channels}} by <b>chloramine-T</b> was examined in voltage clamped internally perfused crayfish and squid giant axons using the double sucrose gap and axial wire technique, respectively. Freshly prepared <b>chloramine-T</b> solution exerted two major actions on sodium channels: (a) an irreversible {{removal of the}} fast Na inactivation, and (b) a reversible block of the Na current. Both effects were observed when <b>chloramine-T</b> was applied internally or externally (5 – 10 mM) to axons. The first effect was studied in crayfish axons. We found that {{the removal of the}} fast Na inactivation did not depend on the states of the channel since the channel could be modified by <b>chloramine-T</b> at holding potential (from - 80 to - 100 mV) or at depolarized potential of - 30 mV. After removal of fast Na inactivation, the slow inactivation mechanism was still present, and more channels could undergo slow inactivation. This result indicates that in crayfish axons the transition through the fast inactivated state is not a prerequisite for the slow inactivation to occur. During <b>chloramine-T</b> treatment, a distinct blocking phase occurred, which recovered upon washing out the drug. This second effect of <b>chloramine-T</b> was studied in detail in squid axons. After 24 h, <b>chloramine-T</b> solution lost its ability to remove fast inactivation but retained its blocking action. After removal of the fast Na inactivation, both fresh and aged <b>chloramine-T</b> solutions blocked the Na currents with a similar potency and in a voltage-dependent manner, being more pronounced at lower depolarizing potentials.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{externally}} applied <b>chloramine-T</b> on the excitability of single toad myelinated nerve fibres were studied. <b>Chloramine-T</b> is a mild oxidant which reacts specifically with the cysteine and methionine residues of proteins. <b>Chloramine-T</b> prolongs the action {{potential of a}} single myelinated fibre by more than 1000 -fold. This effect is concentration- and time-dependent; higher concentrations and longer incubation times increase prolongation. Under voltage-clamp conditions, sodium channel inactivation is markedly inhibited by <b>chloramine-T</b> while sodium channel activation remains normal. Prolonged depolarization of the membrane leads to a maintained sodium current. The maintained sodium currents show activation kinetics, dependence on membrane potential, and reversal potentials which {{are similar to those}} of normal, inactivating sodium currents in untreated fibres. Both the maintained and the peak sodium currents are equally inhibited by tetrodotoxin. After partial removal of sodium inactivation by brief exposures to <b>chloramine-T,</b> the voltage dependence of the steady-state sodium current inactivation (h infinity) is shifted in the depolarized direction by about 20 mV, even after correction for the non-inactivating component contributed by the maintained current. The phenomena described here imply that cysteine or methionine residues are critical for the sodium channel inactivation processes. The two different modifications of inactivation, its removal shown by the maintained current, and the shift in the voltage-dependence of the remaining inactivatable channels, reveal that at least two separate residues are modified by <b>chloramine-T...</b>|$|E

Arterial blood samples were repeatedly taken from a dorsal aortic catheter prior to exposure (0 h), immediately following exposure (1 h) and then at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h and various respiratory parameters measured. Results showed that there were no significant effects relating to <b>chloramine-T</b> exposure regardless of disease status.
