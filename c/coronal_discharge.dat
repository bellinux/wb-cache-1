40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The {{electrical}} properties of interfacial water [1] were explored {{to determine their}} capacity to deliver energy for practical applications.

All measurements were done under room temperature and standard laboratory conditions {{in the absence of any}} external energy or light source, except for the ubiquitous infrared emissions from the normal environment [2]. Additionally, we designed and investigated different microelectrode systems to upscale the harvest of energy from interfacial water. Studies were also extended to understand the biological effects of atmospheric ions on interfacial water. Positive atmospheric ions were created by the <b>coronal</b> <b>discharge</b> technique. Using micropipette electrodes, the distribution of electrical potential in the interfacial water was measured and it was observed that beyond a threshold, positive ions diminished the magnitude of the negative electrical potential in the interfacial water. Additionally, positive ions produced by an air conditioner were observed to generate similar effects. In fact, sometimes the positive ion effect from air conditioner was strong enough to destroy the structure of interfacial water by turning its potential decidedly positive. Thus, positive air ions can compromise interfacial water negativity, and may well explain the known negative impact of positive ions on health ([3]-[4]) ...|$|E

Cloud formation is a common phenomenon in ultra-cool atmospheres such as in Brown Dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Cloud particles {{can be expected to}} carry considerable charges which may trigger discharge events via small-scale processes between individual cloud particles (intra-cloud discharges) or large-scale processes between clouds (inter-cloud discharges). We investigate electrostatic breakdown characteristics, like critical field strengths and critical charge densities per surface, to demonstrate under which conditions mineral clouds undergo electric discharge events which may trigger or be responsible for sporadic X-ray emission. We apply results from our kinetic dust cloud formation model {{that is part of the}} Drift-Phoenix model atmosphere simulations. We present a first investigation of the dependence of the breakdown conditions in Brown Dwarf and giant gas exoplanets on the local gas-phase chemistry, the effective temperature and primordial gas-phase metallicity. Our results suggest that different intra-cloud discharge processes dominate at different heights inside mineral clouds: local <b>coronal</b> (point <b>discharges)</b> and small-scale sparks at the bottom region of the cloud where the gas density is high, and flow discharges and large-scale sparks near, and maybe above, the cloud top.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is, on top of the {{investigation}} of an overall PMAD system capable to fulfil the requirements of both solar and nuclear energy sources, to define a solar based power system able to feed high power electric thrusters. This kind of propulsion system could play a very important role in future space exploration programmes by enabling more affordable and sustainable space-to-space missions. HiPER is a project partly funded by the EU aimed at laying the technical and programmatic foundations for the development of technologies to fulfil these future needs. The abstract presents results of development and prototyping of solar generation technologies and gives indications on the optimal PMAD architectures. The power demand of next generation spacecraft will overcome the limits of existing state of the art solar generation systems. Today the multi panel deployable solar array is the most common system utilized for medium and high power applications. Its ability to provide accommodation for power growth up to tens of kW), high reliability, competitive weight and low cost, lead to world wide success but we need something more. Light concentration techniques, thin solar cells and light/flexible substrates are going towards this direction. Starting from our previous experience in lightweight photovoltaic systems, we all initiated the development activities. The main topics addressed in this study are: light concentration (up to 10 times the nominal flux) system design, inflatable substrate and flexible electrical network structural design, prototyping and verification; The solar cell trades started from the very latest achievements in crystalline solar cells. Based on that, a component suitable for light concentration has been identified. This component has been integrated on top of a flexible structure in combination with the concentrating lenses and with an innovative "smart" deployment mechanic based, also, on Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) performances. The PMAD is a critical aspect of the whole system design which can undermine all the other technical advances. A direct drive approach is the most suitable solution and an architecture based on solar DC voltage level of about 300 V and a current level of about 800 A has been extensively simulated. Of course there are risks associated with the operation at high current and voltage and this are mainly related to <b>coronal</b> <b>discharge</b> effects.

40|$|Orthopedic {{implants}} {{might not}} directly unite with bones especially in compromised patients {{even if they}} have been appropriately fixed. The lack of early osseointegration would lead to the failure of the orthopedic implant. A “bone-like” implant surface is urgently needed to accelerate osseointegration. Electrospun nanofiber (NF) is a promising implant coating due to its highly porous nanoscale structure. It mimics the collagen I nanofibrous network of bone tissue; meanwhile it has been widely used as a drug delivery device. However, its compact and dense structure is not ideal for cell growth. Our strategy was to develop a functional three-dimensional (3 D) NF implant coating to enhance osseointegration. Firstly, based on a <b>coronal</b> <b>discharge</b> effect 3 D polycaprolactone (PCL) NF-zero, -low, -mid, and –high were fabricated by a self-developed automatic 3 D NF collector with different collector movement speeds. Simply, the properties of the 3 D PCL NFs were altered by the different speeds of the collector movement. The thickness, pore sizes/volumes, porosity and surface roughness of NFs were proportional to the moving speeds; and the fiber stiffness was increased by a faster movement due to higher fiber crystallinity. Cells should be very sensitive to the changes of living environments. With the aim to investigate how cells choose their preferred environments and to define the optimal NFs for drug release, we cultured pre-osteoblast MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells, pre-osteoclast RAW cells and rat adipose derive stem cells (ASCs) on the four types of NFs and studied the proliferation, distribution and differentiation of these cells. The looser structure, higher surface roughness and stiffness of the NF-high enhanced the proliferation and distribution of preosteoblasts and ASCs. Additionally, they had a positive effect on the differentiation of pre-osteoblast cells. Interestingly, the RAW cells preferred the dense NFs and had a higher proliferation. Combining the results above, we chose NF-high as the optimal NF for the drug delivery device study. Finally, we imported PLGA to the previously developed PCL/PVA coaxial system to accelerate degradation and developed strontium doped coaxial 3 D PCL/PLGA (1 : 1) -PVA nanofibers. The coaxial NFs enabled the control of strontium release. The Sr 2 + was released from the coaxial NFs over 2 months and the concentration was relatively constant. The released Sr 2 + had a positive effect on the proliferation and differentiation of preosteoblast cells in both indirect cell contact and direct cell contact studies. We believe these coaxial NFs have a great potential as implant coatings. We will test the osseointegration efficiency of NF coated Titanium implants in a rat tibia defect model in the future...|$|E
