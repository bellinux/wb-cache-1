50|$|Both {{versions}} of the Megaminx have 20 <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> 30 edges. In both cases, only even permutations are possible, regardless {{of the position of}} the other set of pieces. Thus, while it is possible to have a single pair of <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> a single pair of edges swapped on a Rubik's Cube, this is impossible on the Megaminx. There are 20!/2 ways to arrange the <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> 319 ways to orient them, since the orientation of the last corner depends on that of the preceding ones. There are 30!/2 ways to arrange the edges and 229 ways to flip them.|$|R
