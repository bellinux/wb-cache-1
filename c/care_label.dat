40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines inter-generational {{families in}} the contemporary Korean cultural context and their connections with health and well-being. The dissertation is comprised of two studies. The first study investigates the changes in patriarchal kinship structure centered on the eldest son across periods and cohorts. The second study explores the association between caring for grandchildren and grandparents’ health over time. Using the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA), the first study compares parent-child co-residence in the Korean War after Liberation Day (KWALD) cohort born between 1945 and 1953 and the Korean Baby Boomer (KBB) cohort born between 1954 and 1962 at Waves 1 (in 2006) and 5 (in 2014). The results show that parent–child co-residence is predicted by the oldest son status, and suggests that the patriarchal family norm has been maintained. One notable finding is {{that the effect of}} the oldest son status on co-residence with parents in the KBB cohort varies over time. In other words, in the younger cohort, the family structure based on the oldest son status has been weakened. In the second study, using latent class analysis grandparents who are the KLoSA respondents at Waves 1 - 5 are classified into four groups according to the transition and duration of caring for grandchildren: continuous grandchild <b>care</b> (<b>labeled</b> continuous <b>care),</b> initiated grandchild <b>care</b> (<b>labeled</b> started <b>care),</b> ended grandchild <b>care</b> (<b>labeled</b> stopped <b>care)</b> and did not engage in grandchild <b>care</b> (<b>labeled</b> no <b>care).</b> Using growth curve modeling analysis the differences in initial physical and mental health of grandparents and changes over time were analyzed. The main results of the second study are that the initial physical and mental health of the grandparents were different among the grandchild care classes, but there was little difference in the changes in health over time between the classes. However, grandparents with a lower degree of physical pain were more likely to begin grandchild care, and grandparents who experienced increased pain over time were more likely to stop caring for their grandchildren. In addition, the subjective health of grandparents who continuously have taken care of their grandchildren improved when they stopped caring for their grandchild. This dissertation is significant in that it contributes to an emerging body of research on intergenerational family dynamics and the influence of family relationships on health in later life in an Asian country. The results of the two studies indicate the importance of middle-aged and older adults in Korea who play a pivotal role in the family as caregivers for both older and younger family members...|$|R

The questionnaire consisted of twenty-one items. The first section consisted of five questions concerned with personal data. The second section consisted of sixteen questions concerned with preferences and habits of the consumer with regard to purchasing and laundering children's sleepwear. The population tested consisted of parents of children presently enrolled in one of four preschools: a preschool for children of university students, a university preschool laboratory, a private preschool, and a church preschool. A total of 203 questionnaires were distributed with 120 responses. Both numerical and percentage results are presented. Results of the study show that: (1) consumers are aware that children???s sleepwear is fire-retardant; (2) consumers want fire-retardant sleepwear for their children; (3) consumers want to see other items of children's clothing given a fire-retardant:finish; (4) consumers have not noticed changes in sleepwear with fire-retardant finishes; (5) consumers do not follow <b>care</b> <b>label</b> instructions when laundering fire-retardant sleepwear and <b>care</b> <b>label</b> instructions are not adequate; and (6) most consumers who sew do not purchase fire-retardant yardage...|$|E

40|$|As {{substitutes}} for chlorinated hydrocarbons water and hydrocarbon solvents are investigated. The application {{of water and}} detergents in special machines is defined as wet cleaning. The research work included fibre protection agents, impact of mechanical action of the wet cleaning machines on the dimension stability of the fabrics {{and the removal of}} dirt. In a classification system the properties of fibres, fabrics and combinations of different materials are defined. The limits of the applicability of wet cleaning processes depend mainly on the properties of the garments. In order to extend the amount of wet cleanable textiles, a new <b>care</b> <b>labelling</b> symbol was proposed (W) and after a period of discussions accepted by the European <b>care</b> <b>labelling</b> authority. Hydrocarbon solvent was investigated in two directions: firstly as a solvent for cleaning garments and secondly for cleaning apparel of industrial workers. The cleaning efficiency of hydrocarbon solvents in addition with detergents and water below than 2 % is lower than of perchloroethylene with adequate auxilaries. By introducing prespotting procedures the cleaning efficiency of hydrocarbon solvents can be improved dramatically up to about 95 % of perchloroethylene. By improving the distillation equipment, it is possible to separate entirely the water, dirt, auxiliaries from hydrocarbon solvents. Cleaning of apparel in hydrocarbon solvents with addition of water above 10 % a good to very good soil removal was achieved. Separation of the different components as water, dirt, auxiliaries and hydrocarbon solvent was realized by fractional distillation/condensation. Transfer of research results into the industry was already done during the research period. (orig.)

30|$|The recent <b>care</b> <b>labels</b> {{are printed}} or woven labels storing a limited {{information}} (Nayak and Padhye 2014, 2015 b). The electronic labels use RFID tags for storing information electronically on a garment. The same RFID tag used for containing the product details {{at the point}} of sale cannot be used for storing the wash care instructions, due to the privacy concerns. Hence, additional tags are needed for the wash care instructions, which will increase the cost of the garment. In addition, the consumers need special readers to extract the information stored in the RFID tag. Hence, they will prefer the physical label instead of an electronic label. Furthermore, the use of RFID tags in the garment, may pose health risks to the consumers due to the exposure to radiation.|$|R

A face-to-face survey was employed among respondents (n[*]=[*] 120) recruited at selected public locations in Potchefstroom, North-West Province, South Africa, according to predetermined inclusion criteria. The majority of respondents were able to correctly locate specific information (such as country of origin, size and fibre content; 75 %) and identify textile and care symbols (78 %) on the label, but were less knowledgeable about synthetic fibres (41 %) and certain care symbols (53 – 58 %). More educated, younger respondents speaking Eurocentric languages (Afrikaans and English) appeared to be more knowledgeable about textile label information than respondents speaking an African language. Even though respondents had excellent label knowledge in most instances, a lack of practical application of this knowledge was evident in their reading of <b>care</b> <b>labels</b> pre- and post-purchase, as well as in their use of textile labels to make purchasing decisions.
