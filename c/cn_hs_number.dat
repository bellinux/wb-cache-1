40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{motivated}} by previous work on estimating lower bounds for {{the norms of}} homogeneous polynomials which are products of linear forms. The purpose of this work is to investigate the so-called nth (linear) polarization constant c(n) (X) of a finite-dimensional Banach space X, and in particular of a Hilbert space. Note that c(n) (X) is an isometric invariant of the space. It has been proved by J. Arias-de-Reyna [Linear Algebra Appl. 285 (1998) 395 - 408] that if H is a complex Hilbert space of dimension at least n, then <b>c(n)</b> (<b>H)</b> = n(n/ 2). The same value of <b>c(n)</b> (<b>H)</b> for real Hilbert spaces is only conjectured, but estimates were obtained in many cases. In particular, {{it is known that}} the nth (linear) polarization constant of a d-dimensional real or complex Hilbert space H is of the approximate order d(n/ 2), for n large enough, and also an integral form of the asymptotic quantity c(H), that is the (linear) polarization constant of the Hilbert space H, where dim H = d, was obtained together with an explicit form for real spaces. Here we present another proof, we find the explicit form even for complex spaces, and we elaborate further on the values of <b>c(n)</b> (<b>H)</b> and c (H). In particular, we answer a question raised by J. C. Garcia-Vazquez and R. Villa [Mathematika 46 (1999) 315 - 322]. Also, we prove the conjectured <b>c(n)</b> (<b>H)</b> = n(n/ 2) for real Hilbert spaces of dimension n {{less than or equal to}} 5. A few further estimates have been also derived.

The kinetics of the {{reaction of}} CN with Fe III (TMPS) - (<b>CN)</b> (<b>H</b> 2 O) was studied {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure. The positive value of the activation volume for the formation of Fe III (TMPS) (CN) 2 is consistent with the opera- tion of a dissociatively activated mechanism and con fi rms the six-coordinate nature of the monocyano complex. A good agreement between the rate constants at pH 8 and 9 for the formation of the dicyano complex implies the presence of water in the axial position trans to coordinated cyanide in the monocyano complex and eliminates the existence of Fe III (TMPS) (CN) (OH) under the selected reaction conditions.

By {{analyzing}} (sub-) mm molecular-line and -continuum we study the detailed morphology of the gas and dust, {{as well as their}} physical parameters and their variation across the PDR. We observed various molecules and transitions to derive the physical properties of the molecular gas through line ratios, and both LTE and non-LTE analyses. The physical properties of the gas were derived with a Bayesian approach for the non-LTE analysis. Based on the continuum data at 870 micron, we derived the dust mass and the column density of H 2, and thus the molecular abundances. The total mass of the gas in the region is ca. 2000 Mo, while that of the dust is ca. 21 Mo. A velocity gradient in the region suggests that the expansion of the ionized gas is pushing the molecular gas away from the observer. We unambiguously identify the ionization front, at the location of which we detect an increase in gas density and temperature. We find at least 14 clumps at different positions and LSR velocities.

High-pressure NMR {{monitoring of the}} catalytic reaction in non-acidic methanol shows that the observable intermediate is a formate complex resulting from CO 2 insertion into the Ru-H bond and is stabilized by the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the formato ligand and a methanol molecule. However, {{in the case of}} the acidic alcohol, CF 3 CH 2 OH, the observable intermediates are [TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 CN) 2] +CF 3 CH 2 O - and the alkyl carbonate complex, TpRu(PPh 3) (η 2 O 2 COCH 2 CF 3), which are formed by the reaction of CO 2 with the alkoxide species, TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 CN) (OCH 2 CF 3), generated by a very facile reaction between TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 <b>CN)</b> <b>H</b> and CF 3 CH 2 OH. We propose that the productive catalytic cycles of the reactions conducted in a variety of alcohols are similar to the one we formulated for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 in hydrous THF. The formic acid is produced by the transfer of a hydride and a proton from the transient alcohol hydride intermediate, TpRu(PPh 3) (ROH) H, to an approaching CO 2 molecule. The activity of TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 <b>CN)</b> <b>H</b> is higher in CF 3 CH 2 OH than in methanol and other non-acidic alcohols and it is probably due to the enhanced electrophilicity of the carbon atom of CO 2, which results from the strong interaction between the proton of the highly acidic alcohol in TpRu(PPh 3) (CF 3 CH 2 OH) H and an oxygen atom of CO 2.

Preferential cleavage of the α-C-D and the β-C-D bonds of THF-d 8 and diethyl ether-d 10, respectively, is observed. The H/D exchange processes {{have been investigated}} by density functional theory calculations at the B 3 LYP level. Theoretical study on the reaction mechanism suggests that σ-complexes TpRu(PPh 3) (η 2 -H-R) H are active species in the exchange processes. During the exchange processes, the reversible transformations of TpRu(PPh 3) (η 2 -H-R) H to TpRu(PPh 3) (η 2 -H 2) R are the crucial steps. The barriers for the transformations {{are in the range}} 10 - 13. 4 kcal/mol. Interestingly, the transition states for the transformations correspond to the seven-coordinate TpRu(PPh 3) (R) (H) (H), which are species derived from the oxidative addition of H-R to the metal center. The exchange processes involve transformations of the (η 2 -H-R) species to the (η 2 -H 2) species followed by H-H rotation in the latter. The rotation barriers are calculated to be in the range 2 - 4 kcal/mol. The exchange process having an aromatic R group is found to be most favorable due to the strong Ru-C(sp 2) bonding, which stabilizes the (η 2 -H 2) species and lowers the transformation barrier.

40|$|Deuteration {{of organic}} {{molecules}} using D 2 O as the deuterium source is affected with catalytic systems {{based on the}} ruthenium solvente hydride complex TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 <b>CN)</b> <b>H.</b> The deuteration reactions can be performed under Ar or H 2. In the former case, the hydride ligand is rapidly deuterated by D 2 O, {{and in the course}} of the catalysis, D 2 O converts TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 CN) D into the acetamido complex TpRu-(PPh 3) (D 2 O) (NDC(O) CH 3), which at the later stage of the reaction generates two additional minor species, one of which is the partially deuterated carbonyl hydride species TpRu(PPh 3) (CO) H(or D). All of these complexes are, however, found to be inactive for the H/D exchange reactions between the organic molecules and D 2 O. In the exchange reactions under H 2, a mixture of the HD isotopomers, TpRu(PPh 3) H 3 -xD x, of the dihydrogen hydride complex TpRu(PPh 3) (H 2) H are the active species. On the basis of our previous work on the TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 CN) H-catalyzed H/D exchange reactions between deuterated organic molecules and CH 4, it is proposed that TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 CN) D and TpRu(PPh 3) (H 3 -x) Dx exchange their deuteride ligands Ru-D with R-H via the intermediacies of the η 2 -R-H(or D) and η 2 -H- H(or D) σ-complexes; the Ru-H bonds thus formed after the exchange are deuterated by D 2 O to regenerate the metal deuterides. The solvento complex TpRu(PPhs) (CH 3 CN) D under Ar is suggested to be more active than TpRu(PPh 3 H 3 -Dx under H 2 for the H/D exchange reactions because the former reacts more readily with the organic molecule R-H to generate the η 2 -R-H σ-complex due to higher lability of the CH 3 CN ligand in comparison with the dihydrogen or hydrogen-deuterium ligand of TpRu(PPh 3) (H 3 -x) D x. The acetamido complex TpRu(PPh 3) (H 2 O) (NHC(O) CH 3) was independently prepared by refluxing a THF solution of TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 <b>CN)</b> <b>H</b> containing excess water for 24 h, and its molecular structure was determined by X-ray crystallography.

40|$|A strong {{promoting}} {{effect of}} water in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 to formic acid with the solvento metal hydride species TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 <b>CN)</b> <b>H</b> is observed. High-pressure NMR monitoring of the catalytic reaction shows that CO 2 readily inserts into Ru-H to form the metal formate TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 CN) (eta (1) -OCHO). H 2 O, in which the formate ligand is intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule. Theoretical calculations carried out at the B 3 LYP level show that reaction barrier of the CO 2 insertion is significantly reduced in the presence of water. In the transition state of the process, electrophilicity of the carbon center of CO 2 is enhanced by the formation of hydrogen bonds between its oxygen atoms and H 2 O. The metal formato species comes into equilibrium with another metal formate rapidly; the second formato species TpRu(PPh 3) (H 2 O) (eta (1) -OCHO) contains a coordinated H 2 O, which is intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded with the formate ligand. In view of the stability of these two metal formates under catalytic conditions, it is very likely that they are not within the major catalytic cycle of the reaction. A catalytic cycle, which accounts for the promoting effect of water, is proposed. The key species in the cycle is the aquo metal hydride species TpRu(PPh 3) (HzO) H, which could be generated by a ligand displacement reaction of TpRu(PPh 3) (CH 3 <b>CN)</b> <b>H</b> with H 2 O.

40|$|The {{conformational}} {{dynamics of}} alkyl chains is usually analysed {{within the framework}} of the rotational isomeric state (RIS) approximation, where only the conformers corresponding to the configurational potential minima are considered, and torsional fluctuations about the minima are ignored.

The experimental behaviour reveals that deviations from RIS results appear for chains with more than ten carbon atoms...|$|R

50|$|HCN is {{destroyed}} in interstellar clouds {{through a number}} of mechanisms depending on the location in the cloud. In photon-dominated regions (PDRs), photodissociation dominates, producing CN (HCN + ν → <b>CN</b> + <b>H).</b> At further depths, photodissociation by cosmic rays dominate, producing CN (HCN + cr → <b>CN</b> + <b>H).</b> In the dark core, two competing mechanisms destroy it, forming HCN+ and HCNH+ (HCN + H+ → HCN+ + H; HCN + HCO+ → HCNH+ + CO). The reaction with HCO+ dominates by a factor of ~3.5. HCN has been used to analyze a variety of species and processes in the interstellar medium. It has been suggested as a tracer for dense molecular gas and as a tracer of stellar inflow in high-mass star-forming regions. Further, the HNC/HCN ratio {{has been shown to be}} an excellent method for distinguishing between PDRs and X-ray-dominated regions (XDRs).|$|R

40|$|Very few {{molecular}} {{species have been}} detected in circumstellar disks surrounding young stellar objects. We are carrying out an observational study of the chemistry of circumstellar disks surrounding T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars. First {{results of this study}} are presented in this note. We used the EMIR receivers recently installed at the IRAM 30 m telescope to carry a sensitive search for molecular lines in the disks surrounding AB Aur, DM Tau, and LkCa 15. We detected lines of the molecules HCO+, <b>CN,</b> <b>H</b> 2 CO, SO, CS, and HCN toward AB Aur. In addition, we tentatively detected DCO+ and H 2 S lines. The line profiles suggest that the <b>CN,</b> HCN, <b>H</b> 2 CO, CS and SO lines arise in the disk. This makes it the first detection of SO in a circumstellar disk. We have unsuccessfully searched for SO toward DM Tau and LkCa 15, and for c-C 3 H 2 toward AB Aur, DM Tau, and LkCa 15. Our upper limits show that contrary to all the {{molecular species}} observed so far, SO is not as abundant in DM Tau as it is in AB Aur. Our results demonstrate that the disk associated with AB Aur is rich in molecular species. Our chemical model shows that the detection of SO is consistent with that expected from a very young disk where the molecular adsorption onto grains does not yet dominate the chemistry.
