Isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were exposed to bleomycin at a dose of 40 [*]µg/mL for 2 [*]hrs in {{the presence or absence}} of different doses of the decoction (100, 300, and 600 µg/mL). Modulatory effect of the decoction on bleomycin induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> was evaluated by (a) degree of chromosomal aberrations (CA), (b) formation of micronuclei (MN), and (c) induction of γH 2 AX foci in lymphocytes exposed to bleomycin. Lymphocytes pretreated with the decoction showed that a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in bleomycin induced (a) stable and unstable chromosome aberrations (CA), (b) MN formation, and (c) formation of γH 2 AX foci, when compared to lymphocytes treated only with bleomycin. The decoction by itself did not induce any significant <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in PBLs.

This paper presents preliminary results of the studies on occupational exposure to mercury vapours influence on lymphocytes susceptibility to the induction of genetic damage. In order to estimate <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage,</b> the analysis of chromosomal aberration (CA) and sister chromatid exchange frequency (SCE) were used. In the present study, results do not show any statistically significant differences between the examined groups, either in the levels of DNA damage of untreated lymphocytes or in the sister chromatid exchanges. Neither the levels of DNA damage detected in lymphocytes after UV-C exposure and 2 h incubation, without or in the presence of a cell- division stimulating agent, nor the repair efficiencies of the DNA damage induced by UV-C exposure, differed significantly between the unexposed group and that occupationally exposed to mercury vapours.

We demonstrated through controlled studies the ability of ultra-highly diluted homoeopathic drugs in rendering protection/repair of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> inflicted by whole-body X-irradiation in mammalian model mice in vivo. We examined <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> in arsenic, cadmium, mercury and stannum intoxicated mice and their remediation by homoeopathic drugs derived from agitated ultra-high dilutions of their respective salt, deploying many scientific protocols. We made a human trial on efficacy of Arsenicum album against groundwater arsenic-contaminated victims. We tested efficacy of some homoeopathic remedies in cancer of mice and thalassemia in human. We produced nano-capsules of homoeopathic mother tinctures and their bioactive components and induced nano-precipitation of silver from silver nitrate by homoeopathic mother tinctures and characterised them for their physicochemical properties and biological action. We studied tissue distribution of nanoparticles, precise mechanism and pathways of their action that involved certain signal proteins and their pathways, both in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|The {{percentage}} of cells with chromosome aberrations or micronuclei induced by low doses of acute (dose rate of 47 cGy/min) or chronic (dose rate of 0. 01 cGy/min) gamma-irradiation was studied in vitro in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, human lymphocytes, and Vicia faba seeds and seedlings. The {{sensitivity of the}} indicated biological entities to low doses was greater than expected based on linear extrapolation from higher doses. The dose-response curves for <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> that were obtained were nonlinear when evaluated over {{the full range of}} the doses used. At very low doses, the dose-response curves appeared linear, followed by a plateau region at intermediate doses. At high doses the dose response curves again appeared linear with a slope different from that for the low-dose region. There was no statistically significant difference between the yields of cells with micronuclei induced by low doses of acute versus chronic irradiation. Similar data were obtained both for human lymphocyte culture and for roots and seeds of Vicia faba. Our experiments revealed that the dose range over which the plateau occurs depends on the type of cells irradiated. We have also shown that the modifying effects of the repair inhibitor caffeine and the radioprotector mercaptoethylenamine (MEA) are absent at low doses of gamma irradiation and that caffeine increased the number of cells with <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> when evaluated over the plateau region. In the presence of MEA, {{the upper end of the}} plateau region was extended from just above 1 Gy to about 2 Gy. We therefore provide direct evidence that a plateau exists in the dose-response curve for the indicated radiation-induced stochastic effects. Furthermore, our results suggest that, for low linear energy transfer radiation, the induction of DNA repair occurs only after a threshold level of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> and that the higher yield of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> per unit dose at low radiation doses is attributable to an insignificant contribution or the absence of DNA repair processes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to establish a baseline value of micronucleus frequency in buccal cells and to estimate {{the impact of the}} most common factors (sex and age, and smoking) on micronucleus and degenerative nuclear alteration frequencies in the sample of healthy Bosnian subjects. Methods: The Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay, based on scoring not only micronucleus frequency but also other genome damage markers, dead or degenerated cells, provides a measure of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. Results: Our results showed the baseline buccal micronucleus frequency was 0. 135 % or 1. 35 ‰, as well as positive correlations between micronucleus frequencies and formations of degenerative nuclear alterations (nuclear buds, karyolytic and karyorrhectic cells). The number of micronuclei in buccal cells was significantly higher in females than in males. There was positive association between the age and frequency of analysed cytogenetic biomarkers. Buccal cell micronuclei and degenerative nuclear alternations were more frequent among cigarette smokers than non-smokers and significantly higher in female smokers than in male smokers. <b>Cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> showed significantly positive correlation between intensity of smoking and the number of nuclear alterations. The years of smoking had a significant influence not only on the number of nuclear alterations but also in micronuclei and nuclear buds in buccal cells. Conclusions: The sex influences the number of micronuclei in human buccal cells. The ageing increased the number of micronuclei and other biomarkers of DNA damage.

40|$|Cellular {{responses}} to damages from ionizing radiation (IR) exposure are influenced {{not only by}} the genes involved in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, but also by non- DSB repair genes. We demonstrated previously that suppressed expression of several non-DSB repair genes, such as XPA, elevated IR-induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages.</b> In the present study, we exposed human fibroblasts that were treated with control or XPA targeting siRNA to 250 MeV protons (0 to 4 Gy), and analyzed chromosome aberrations and expressions of genes involved in DNA repair. As expected, after proton irradiation, cells with suppressed expression of XPA showed a significantly elevated frequency of chromosome aberrations compared with control siRNA treated (CS) cells. Protons caused more severe DNA damages in XPA knock-down cells, as 36 % cells contained multiple aberrations compared to 25 % in CS cells after 4 Gy proton irradiation. Comparison of gene expressions using the real-time PCR array technique revealed that expressions of p 53 and its regulated genes in irradiated XPA suppressed cells were altered similarly as in CS cells, suggesting that the impairment of IR induced DNA repair in XPA suppressed cells is p 53 -independent. Except for XPA, which was more than 2 fold down regulated in XPA suppressed cells, several other DNA damage sensing and repair genes (GTSE 1, RBBP 8, RAD 51, UNG and XRCC 2) were shown a more than 1. 5 fold difference between XPA knock-down cells and CS cells after proton exposure. The possible involvement of these genes in the impairment of DNA repair in XPA suppressed cells will be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently {{published}} works {{showed that}} occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs (ANPD) is still frequent in hospital settings, despite significant safety policy improvements. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the current level of occupational exposure to ANPD and any potentially associated <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> in hospital nurses routinely handling ANPD. METHODS: Occupationally ANPD-exposed (n = 71) and ANPD-unexposed (n = 77; control) nurses were recruited on a voluntary basis from five hospitals in Northern and Central Italy. Evaluation of surface contamination and dermal exposure to ANPD was assessed by determining cyclophosphamide (CP) on selected surfaces (wipes) and on exposed nurses' clothes (pads). The concentration of unmetabolized CP—as a biomarker of internal dose—was measured in end-shift urine samples. Biomonitoring of genotoxic effects (i. e., biological effect monitoring) was conducted by analyzing micronuclei (MN) and chromosome aberrations (CA) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Genetic polymorphisms for enzymes involved in metabolic detoxification (i. e., glutathione S-transferases) were analyzed as well. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in MN frequency (5. 30 ± 2. 99 and 3. 29 ± 1. 97; mean values ± standard deviation; p < 0. 0001) in exposed nurses versus controls, as well as in CA detection (3. 30 ± 2. 05 and 1. 84 ± 1. 67; p < 0. 0001), exposed subjects versus controls. Our results provide evidence that, despite safety controlled conditions, ANPD handling still represents a considerable genotoxic risk for occupationally exposed personnel. CONCLUSIONS: Because both MN and CA have been described as being predictive of group-increased cancer risk, our findings point to a need for improving specific safety procedures in handling and administering ANPD...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{cellular}} DNA repair {{efficiency and}} suppression of genomic instability {{have been proposed}} as mechanisms underlying radio-adaptive responses following low-dose radiation exposures. We previously showed that low-dose γ irradiation does not generate radio-adaptation by lowering radiation-induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in mouse spleen. Since radiation may exert tissue-specific effects, we extended these results here by examining the effects of γ radiation on <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> and proliferative index in bone marrow erythrocytes of C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, the induction of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) was observed at radiation doses of 100 mGy and greater, and suppression of erythroblast maturation occurred at doses of > 500 mGy. A linear dose–response relationship for MN-PCE frequencies in C 57 BL/ 6 mice was established for radiation doses between 100 mGy and 1 Gy, with departure from linearity at doses of > 1 Gy. BALB/c mice exhibited increased MN-PCE frequencies above baseline following a 20 mGy radiation exposure but did not exhibit radio-sensitivity relative to C 57 BL/ 6 mice following 2 Gy exposure. Radio-adaptation of bone marrow erythrocytes was not observed in either strain of mice exposed to low-dose priming γ irradiation (single doses of 20 mGy or 100 mGy or multiple 20 mGy doses) administered at various times prior to acute 2 Gy irradiation, confirming the lack of radio-adaptive response for induction of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> or suppression or erythrocyte proliferation/maturation in bone marrow of these mouse strains...|$|E

Garlic bulbs were extracted using ethanol and water separately followed by assays on antioxidant activities to assess the efficiency of radical scavenging capacity of various extracts. Lymphocytes were treated with different concentrations of GE for 2, 4, 6 and 24 hr periods. Cell survival was determined by tryphan blue dye exclusion assay, single strand DNA damage by alkaline comet assay and in vitro <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> were evaluated by micronucleus assays. Ethanol boiled GE showed highest radical scavenging capacity and reducing property. Treatment of GE to lymphocytes before and after exposure to 4 Gy of electron beam radiation (EBR) the percentage of tail DNA was reduced from 24. 06 ± 3. 92 to 2. 87 ± 0. 18.

40|$|Problems statement: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the effect of laser therapy on regeneration of traumatized skeletal muscles and on dynamics of immune responses in thymus and bone marrow under ionizing radiation. Approach: After local X-ray radiation of both rat gastrocnemius muscles at a dose 20 Gy or after total &# 947;-irradiation of animals at a semiletal dose 6 Gy, the muscles were damaged considerably as contractile organ (full cut across muscle). Then laser therapy was carried out with a helium-neon laser (632. 8 nm) or infrared pulsed laser (890 nm), 10 treatments by 3 min during the first 15 or 30 days after trauma. The investigations were performed using histological, biochemical, cytological, cytogenetic and morphometric methods. Results: The received data showed that under ionizing radiation, He-Ne and IR laser irradiation stimulated the regeneration of skeletal muscles, improved the healing of skin-muscle wound and stimulated the prosesses of postradiation recovery in cells of the thymus and bone marrow. The regenerative activity of radiated traumatized muscles and the level of reduction of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> in bone marrow and the thymus varied depending on the period for which regenerative muscles were exposured to laser light, as well as the optical characteristics of lasers and the degree of radiation damages. The early appearance of reactive changes in structure of the thymus and the display them during 60 days point to increasing function of organ. Conclusion: Under local and total ionizing radiation and laser therapy of solely damaged skeletal muscles, positive dynamics of regeneration processes and improvement of cytological and cytogenetic indexes for main immune organs (the thymus and bone marrow) were observed. Herewith, the functional loading on thymus increased. We suggest that the findings should be considered in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Non-ionizing {{radiation}} has {{a significant}} and positive impact on modern society {{through a number of}} uses. There is increasing public concern regarding the health risks of radio-frequency (RF) radiation, particularly that produced by mobile phones. Concern regarding the potential risks of exposure to EMFs has led to many epidemiological investigations, but the effects of EMF exposure on human and other mammalian cells are still unclear. One of the most frequently asked questions about the effects of microwave radiation on biological systems is whether they produce genotoxic effects and could be there a possible link with oncogenic processes. It is most difficult to get accurate and reproducible results for the studies that tell us most about the effects of EMF on humans. Based on some “weak” evidence suggesting an association between exposure to radiofrequency fields (RF) emitted from mobile phones and two types of brain cancer, glioma and acoustic neuroma, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified RF as ‘possibly carcinogenic to humans’ in group 2 B. Literature results suggest that pulsed microwaves from working environment can be the cause of genetic and cell alterations. Taken together, the increased frequency of DNA damages, increased intensity of oxydative stress and production of reactive oxygen species as well as prolonged disruption in DNA repair mechanisms could be possible mechanisms for microwave induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damages</b> even at low-level electromagnetic fields. Although there were contradictory results about harmful effects of electromagnetic fields we recommend that the mobile phone should be kept as far as possible from the body during conversations and also during usual daily activities to reduce the absorption of radiation by cells.

The cytogenetic effects of this aggressive therapy on skin fibroblasts were studied. Skin biopsies were cytogenetically analysed from 38 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT and who received conditioning with TBI (exceptions: patients 204 and 207). One group consisting of 20 patients was studied prospectively at three different points of time (before, 3 - 6 and 12 months after SCT), another patient cohort consisting of 18 patients was studied retrospectively 23 - 216 months after SCT. We could show that the intensive conditioning regimens used for SCT induce stable, structural chromosomal aberrations of clonal character in skin fibroblasts which can persist for up to 18 years after SCT. The performed breakpoint analysis revealed a non-random distribution of the breakpoints. Interestingly, some of the observed hot spots were located at bands where genes for the chromosome instability syndromes have been mapped. The analysis of {{the time course of}} the cytogenetic aberrations indicated that the <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in the skin fibroblasts stays relatively stable throughout the first year after SCT and afterwards increases with time. This can be interpreted as an indication of in vivo radiation-induced chromosomal instability, supporting the results of the breakpoint analysis. When comparing different clinical groups, we found that the extent of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> was especially high in patients with acute leukemias.

A direct {{assessment of the}} radiation damage to the lymphocytes after a labeling procedure of leukocytes separated from 46 ml blood with 740 MBq of Tc- 99 m-HMPAO was not possible due to an almost complete impairment of the proliferative capacity. By starting with isolated lymphocytes, the number of micronuclei was studied versus the intracellular activity concentration in the range 0 - 3 MBq/ 10 (7) lymphocytes for three donors. A comparison of these results with the dose response of the micronucleus incidence in lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation with x-rays allowed an individual assessment of the x-ray dose, inducing the equivalent amount of clastogenic damage as the intracellular activity after Tc- 99 m-HMPAO labeling. Based on an extrapolation of these data, the radiation damage of the lymphocytes due to self-irradiation in a labeling procedure of leukocytes with 740 MBq of Tc- 99 m-HMPAO {{was estimated to be}} equivalent to 26 Gy of x-rays.

Both cell lines were more sensitive to the cytotoxic and clastogenic effects of (56) Fe particles than to those of gamma rays. However, the mutagenicity of (56) Fe particles and gamma rays at the TK locus was the same per unit dose and was higher for gamma rays than for (56) Fe particles at isotoxic doses. The respective RBEs for TK 6 and WTK 1 cells were 1. 5 and 1. 9 for cytotoxicity and 2. 5 and 1. 9 for clastogenicity, but only 1 for mutagenicity. The results indicate that complex lesions induced by (56) Fe particles are repaired less efficiently than gamma-ray-induced lesions, leading to fewer colony-forming cells, a slightly higher proportion of aberrant cells at the first division, and a lower frequency of viable mutants at isotoxic doses. WTK 1 cells (mutant TP 53) were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of both gamma rays and (56) Fe particles, but showed greater <b>cytogenetic</b> and mutagenic <b>damage</b> than TK 6 cells (TP 53 (+)).

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> associated with occupational exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) among automobile mechanics by using Micronuclei (MN) and other Nuclear Abnormalities (NA) as a biomarker. Methods: The study population composed of 110 occupationally exposed automobile mechanics and 100 unexposed controls. All the study participants were males. Both the exposed and control individuals were selected from automobile garages located in the urban area of Coimbatore City, South India. Exfoliated buccal cells were collected from 110 automobile mechanics and 100 age and sex matched controls. Further, cells were examined for MN frequency and Nuclear Abnormalities (NA) other than micronuclei, such as binucleates, broken eggs and karyolysis. Results: Results showed a statistically significant difference between occupationally exposed automobile mechanics and control groups. MN and NA frequencies in automobile mechanics were significantly higher than those in control groups (p < 0. 05) and also significantly related to smoking habit (p < 0. 05). In addition, a higher degree of NA was observed among the exposed subjects with smoking, drinking, tobacco chewing, which is an indicative of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in these individuals.

We have also shown that expression of both the major E 1 A gene products, the 243 amino acid and the 289 amino acid proteins, is required for induction of damage at wild-type levels, although the 289 amino acid protein appears to retain detectable activity on its own. Lastly, we have observed that deletions in the amino-terminal region of the E 1 A proteins and in the transactivating domain of the 289 amino acid protein prevent the occurrence of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage,</b> whereas mutations elsewhere in the proteins do not affect this process...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous Melanoma (CM) is {{a leading}} cause of cancer deaths, with reports {{indicating}} a rising trend in the incidence rate of melanoma among Hispanics in certain U. S. states. The level of melanin pigmentation in the skin is suggested to render photoprotection from the DNA-damaging effects of Ultraviolet Radiation (UVR). UVR-induced DNA damage leads to cytogenetic defects visualized as the formation of micronuclei, multinuclei and polymorphic nuclei in cells, and a hallmark of cancer risk. The causative relationship between Sun exposure and CM is controversial, especially in Hispanics and needs further evaluation. This study was initiated with melanocytes from White, Hispanic and Black neonatal foreskins which were exposed to UVR to assess their susceptibility to UVR-induced modulation of cellular growth, <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage,</b> intracellular and released melanin. Our results show that White and Hispanic skin melanocytes with similar levels of constitutive melanin are susceptible to UVR-induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage,</b> whereas Black skin melanocytes are not. Our data suggest that the risk of developing UVR-induced CM in a skin type is correlated with the level of cutaneous pigmentation and its ethnic background. This study provides a benchmark for further investigation on the damaging effects of UVR as risk for CM in Hispanics...|$|E
40|$|To date, <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> {{has been}} {{assessed}} in blood lymphocytes {{from more than}} 30 astronauts before and after they participated in long-duration space missions of three months or more on board the International Space Station. Chromosome damage was assessed using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} whole chromosome analysis techniques. For all individuals, the frequency of chromosome damage measured within a month of return from space was higher than their preflight yield, and biodosimetry estimates were within the range expected from physical dosimetry. Follow up analyses have been performed on most of the astronauts at intervals ranging from around 6 months to many years after flight, and the cytogenetic effects of repeat long-duration missions have so far been assessed in four individuals. Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes have been validated as biomarkers of cancer risk and <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> can therefore be used to characterize excess health risk incurred by individual crewmembers after their respective missions. Traditional risk assessment models are based on epidemiological data obtained on Earth in cohorts exposed predominantly to acute doses of gamma-rays, and the extrapolation to the space environment is highly problematic, involving very large uncertainties. <b>Cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> could {{play a key role in}} reducing uncertainty in risk estimation because it is incurred directly in the space environment, using specimens from the astronauts themselves. Relative cancer risks were estimated from the biodosimetry data using the quantitative approach derived from the European Study Group on Cytogenetic Biomarkers and Health database. Astronauts were categorized into low, medium, or high tertiles according to their yield of chromosome damage. Age adjusted tertile rankings were used to estimate cancer risk and results were compared with values obtained using traditional modeling approaches. Individual tertile rankings increased after space flight and analysis of follow up samples indicated that the tertile rankings remained in the high category for more than 50 % of the individuals assessed so far. Crewmembers that shift and remain in the high category are projected to have increased life-time cancer risk...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the utility of}} human blood micronucleated reticulocyte (MNCD 71 +) frequency measurement as a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> biomarker. The analytical methodology was flow cytometry {{in conjunction with a}} previously described three color fluorescence labeling technique that includes anti-CD 71 to focus analyses on the most immature fraction of reticulocytes [Dertinger et al., Environ. Molec. Mutagen., 44 : 427 – 435 (2004) ]. Blood specimens from fifty self-reported healthy adult volunteers were studied. In addition to MNCD 71 + measurements, blood plasma folate and B 12 levels were assessed, since these variables tend to influence other indices of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage.</b> Time-course data are also provided for ten cancer patients undergoing treatment. For these subjects, frequency of MNCD 71 + was measured immediately before therapy, and daily {{during the first week of}} chemotherapy and/or fractionated radiotherapy. For the group of healthy volunteers, the variables of age, and folate and B 12 levels demonstrated no significant effect on MNCD 71 + frequency. In addition, no difference was observed between pre-treatment MNCD 71 + values for cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers. Regarding chemotherapy and/or partial body radiotherapy, elevated frequencies were observed upon initiation of treatment for 9 of the 10 patients studied...|$|E
40|$|For years mercury {{has been}} {{considered}} to be dangerous for human health. It was shown in vitro studies that mercury ions produce various types of DNA damage: single strand breaks as well as alkali labile lesions. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare levels of the DNA damage and <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> induced in vivo, DNA’s susceptibility to radiation, as well as repair capabilities of DNA damage induced in vitro by UV-exposure or X-rays, in lymphocytes from unexposed donors and from persons occupationally exposed to mercury vapours. In order to estimate <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage,</b> the analysis of sister chromatid exchange frequency (SCE) was used, while to detect DNA damage alkaline version of the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) was applied. To analyse in vitro susceptibility of cells to genotoxic factors such as UV-C or X-rays, lymphocytes were exposed to 6 J/m 2 of UV or irradiated with 2 Gy of X-rays. After exposure the cells were incubated for 2 hours with or without the presence of phytohemagglutinin (agent stimulating cell divisions). In the present study, results do not show any statistically significant differences between the examined groups, either in the levels of DNA damage of untreated lymphocytes or in the sister chromatid exchanges.

40|$|Background: Biomonitoring {{provides}} a useful tool to estimate the genetic risk from exposure to genotoxic agents. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the potential <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> associated with occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium by using micronuclei (MN) as a biomarker. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study and all participants were males. Both the exposed and control individuals were selected from Coimbatore, Southern India. Exfoliated buccal cells from 44 chrome plating workers and 40 age and sex matched control subjects were examined for MN frequency and nuclear abnormalities (NA) other than micronuclei, such as binucleates, broken eggs, karyorrhexis, karyolysis and pyknosis. Results: Results showed statistically significant difference between chrome plating workers and control groups. MN and NA frequencies in chrome plating workers were significantly higher than those in control groups (p < 0. 05) and also significantly related to smoking habit (P < 0. 05). A significant difference in NA was observed in workers exposed to chromium for longer duration. In addition to this, a higher degree of NA was observed among smokers. Conclusion: MN and other NA reflect genetic changes, events associated with carcinogenesis. Therefore the results of this study indicate that chrome plating workers are under risk of significant <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage.</b> Therefore, there is a need to educate those who work with heavy metals about the potential hazard of occupational exposure and the importance of using protective measures...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims. The role {{of genetic}} factors and {{oxidative}} {{damage in the}} etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease is well documented in the literature. The micronucleus test is a sensitive method that indicates DNA damage. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the micronuclei frequency in different forms of periodontitis in comparison with healthy controls. Materials and methods. Micronuclei frequency was analyzed in the peripheral lymphocytes of 10 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), 10 patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) and 10 healthy controls. Various clinical parameters like the probing depth, clinical attachment level, and percentages of sites with bleeding and plaque were recorded. After the slides were processed, they were stained with 5 % Geimsa solution and 1000 cells per sample were counted for the presence of micronuclei. Results. The mean micronuclei observed in the control group, CP group, and GAP group were 9. 8, 10. 1 and 9. 9, respectively. The differences between the groups were not significant (P= 0. 978). Conclusion. The results indicated that the cytogenetic damages in the periodontitis groups were not different from those in the control group. The role of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in peripheral blood cells may have a limited prognostic value in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal tissues and further studies are necessary to assess <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in periodontal tissues to clarify local tissue destruction in periodontal disease...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cytogenetic {{biomarkers}} {{are essential}} for assessing environmental exposure, and reflect adverse human health effects such as cellular damage. Arsenic is a potential clastogen and aneugen. In general, {{the majority of the}} studies on clastogenic effects of arsenic are based on frequency of micronuclei (MN) study in peripheral lymphocytes, urothelial and oral epithelial cells. To find out the most suitable cell type, here, we compared <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> through MN assay in (a) various populations exposed to arsenic through drinking water retrieved from literature review, as also (b) arsenic-induced Bowen's patients from our own survey. Results For literature review, we have searched the Pubmed database for English language journal articles using the following keywords: "arsenic", "micronuclei", "drinking water", and "human" in various combinations. We have selected 13 studies consistent with our inclusion criteria that measured micronuclei in either {{one or more of the}} above-mentioned three cell types, in human samples. Compared to urothelial and buccal mucosa cells, the median effect sizes measured by the difference between people with exposed and unexposed, lymphocyte based MN counts were found to be stronger. This general pattern pooled from 10 studies was consistent with our own set of three earlier studies. MN counts were also found to be stronger for lymphocytes even in arsenic-induced Bowen's patients (cases) compared to control individuals having arsenic-induced non-cancerous skin lesions. Conclusion Overall, it can be concluded that MN in lymphocytes may be superior to other epithelial cells for studying arsenic-induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: 2 -Deoxy-D-glucose (2 -DG), a {{structural}} analog of glucose {{is an effective}} inhibitor of glucose metabolism and ATP production. It selectively accumulates in cancer cells and interferes with glycolysis leading to cell death. 2 -DG is shown to differentially enhance the radiation-induced damage in cancer cells both under euoxic and hypoxic conditions. A combination of 2 -DG and ionizing radiation selectively destroys tumors while protecting the normal tissue. 2 -DG is being advocated as an adjuvant in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cancer. Objective: The present investigation focuses on the modulatory effect of 2 -DG on mitomycin C- (MMC) and 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 -NQO) -induced <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage</b> in bone marrow cells of Swiss albino mice in vivo. Materials and Methods: Experimental animals were pretreated with 2 -DG (500 mg/kg, i. p.) for five consecutive days followed by MMC (2 mg/kg, i. p) or 4 -NQO (15 mg/kg, i. p.), 24 h prior to sacrifice. Control animals were given either the mixture of olive oil and acetone (3 : 1) or distilled water. Bone marrow cells were processed for the micronucleus assay and metaphase analysis for estimating <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>damage.</b> Results: 2 -DG significantly (P < 0. 001) reduced the frequency of aberrant cells induced by MMC (~ 90 &#x 0025;) and 4 -NQO (~ 74 &#x 0025;). Incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCEs) induced by the mutagens were reduced up to 68 &#x 0025;.
