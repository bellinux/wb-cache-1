30|$|Recently, e-textiles {{have been}} {{receiving}} significant interest {{in terms of}} their applicability to wearable smart devices, because textiles are breathable, flexible and lightweight, yet strong and robust (Åkerfeldt et al. 2014; Asghar et al. 2016). Wearable smart devices incorporating e-textiles are used in healthcare, sports, military, wearable displays, bio-monitoring and power storage devices and so on. For these various applications, efforts are continuing to integrate functional nanomaterials with common textiles to provide flexible, lightweight materials and to improve electrical properties. The fabric heating element is one of the application fields of e-textiles used for the maintenance of body temperature such as work clothes used in extreme environments, protective clothing, military, immersion suit for winter season, etc. Preparation methods for heating elements include methods for making a fiber or fabric (Ilanchezhiyan et al. 2015; Park and Lee 2015; Roh and Kim 2016), forming a film (Jee et al. 2013; Park et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015; Wang and Ruan 2016) and <b>coating</b> <b>fabric</b> (Kang and Lee 2015; Pahalagedara et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2016).|$|E

In addition to the CTGs are New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for many of the same operations. Confusion arises when the emissions from these sources are calculated, because the calculation is on a solids-applied basis and excludes both water and negligibly photochemically reactive materials (NPR). An additional calculation problem involves the use of improved transfer efficiency (TE) in coating operations. This article attempts to reduce the confusion some environmental managers may have by providing a computer program based on the various guidances provided by USEPA. It can be used with any spreadsheet program such as Lotus. (As an alternative to calculating the emissions, USEPA has developed Reference Method 24 to test the actual emission).

40|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the water vapor permeability of shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) <b>coated</b> cotton <b>fabrics.</b> The SMPUs were tailor made {{in order to obtain}} the phase transition temperature (soft segment crystal melting temperature) in the room temperature range. SEM studies were carried out in order to investigate the surface structure of <b>coated</b> and uncoated <b>fabrics.</b> The temperature sensitive water vapor permeability at soft segment crystal melting point was observed for SMPU <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> When the experimental temperature reached the soft segment crystal temperature of SMPU, an abrupt change of water vapor permeability of SMPU <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics</b> were observed. The significant change of water vapor permeability of SMPU <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics</b> is due to the phase change of SMPU which causes density changes inside the membranes due to micro-Brownian motion of soft segment, therefore, enhanced the water vapor permeability through the <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The water vapor permeability of <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics</b> was also dependent on the primary structure of SMPU. When polycaprolactone glycol (PCL, Mn 3000 g mol- 1) was introduced in the polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG, Mn 2900 g mol- 1) based SMPU, the water vapor permeability decreases due to the increased interaction between the polymer chains due to presence of ester groups.
