40|$|This study {{explored}} the current levels and challenges/barriers facing teacher participation in school decision-making in the Cape Coast Metropolitan area and Mfantseman Municipality in the Central Region of Ghana. The study employed the explanatory sequential mixed method design involving semi-structured interviews with 11 teachers, 4 head teachers and 4 <b>circuit</b> <b>supervisors.</b> Furthermore, questionnaires {{were administered to}} 209 teachers, 26 head teachers and 11 <b>circuit</b> <b>supervisors.</b> The SPSS version 20 and the Nvivo software version 10 were used to analyse the questionnaire survey and the semi-structured interview. In a micro ethnographic study, teachers and head teachers from 2 schools that recorded the highest and lowest teacher participation in school decision-making were subsequently observed during staff and Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meetings. In addition, their documents such as staff and PTA minutes books were also analysed. Classroom, committee/group and school levels emerged as the levels of teacher participation in school decision-making. However, few teachers were found participating at the school level, while the majority participated at the classroom level, with some at the committee/group level. The study found that unilateral decisions by head teachers, unimplemented decisions and insufficient funds were the challenges/barriers to teacher participation in school decision-making. Nevertheless, almost all the teachers, head teachers and <b>circuit</b> <b>supervisors</b> agreed {{that there should be}} regular training for head teachers with regard to the tenets of school decision-making and leadership to enable them fully involve teachers in all issues concerning the school. The study concludes that for teachers to participate fully in all school decision-making and for schools to improve, head teachers need to motivate teachers, consult them, trust and be transparent to them in all school related issues. Furthermore, the researcher recommends a nationwide training of head teachers and decentralisation of power in schools. At the school level, teacher empowerment, creating instruction-oriented structures and teacher motivation are the key to effective teacher in PSDM...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the challenges for Junior Secondary School headteachers (both male and female) in the Sunyani municipality of Ghana and their professional development needs. Ghana is a developing country in West Africa facing the challenge of improving educational provision at different levels. This was a qualitative study underpinned by interpretive philosophical thought. It employed a case study approach and collected data in two phases using semi-structured questionnaire and semi-structured interview. In the first phase, a questionnaire was distributed to all headteachers and <b>Circuit</b> <b>Supervisors</b> (school inspectors) in the municipality, while the second phase involved semi-structured interviews with a purposive maximum variation sample of headteachers and <b>Circuit</b> <b>Supervisors</b> who had already responded to the questionnaire. The study highlighted that the headteachers faced multiple challenges. These included teachers’ lack of commitment and uncooperative attitude; non-involvement of the headteachers in making decisions that affected their professional practice; the complexity and multiplicity of their roles and responsibilities; and insignificant responsibility allowances. The study identified the factors responsible for these problems. The study also identified ways of preparing aspiring headteachers for meeting the demands in the educational context. Specifically, it identified the skills and competences they required and the training opportunities {{for the provision of}} those competences as well as strategies for meaningful selection/ appointment of headteachers and their induction. The findings suggested that the in-service training /continuing professional development programmes organised in Sunyani municipality for practising headteachers were inappropriate for enhancing their professional growth and development. The study proposed ways/strategies for improving some aspects of the programmes for meaningful professional development of the headteachers. This research also unveiled additional in-service training/continuing professional development opportunities for the headteachers in that context, including regional-based courses and a cluster-based collaborative headship scheme.

INTRODUCTION In recent years, devising effective control mechanisms for managing IC projects has become an important issue in VLSI design. Automatic design methodology control is necessitated both by the increasing size and complexity of VLSI designs, as well as by the number of software tools available for performing various tasks of IC design. Some representative work in the area of design management is listed in [2 [...] 13]. This paper presents a simple yet eff [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{explored}} principal-teacher {{relationships in}} four Junior High {{schools in the}} Sekyere South District of Ashanti in Ghana. One {{of the things that}} government, policy-makers and educators in Ghana rarely or never discuss is the value and significance of human connections - the relationships in schools. The focus {{of the study was to}} uncover the significance of developing and sustaining a high-quality relationship between principals and teachers for effective leadership and performance. Again, the study projects a broader conception of leadership, one that shifts away from the traditional thinking approach where the figure-head is seen as ultimately responsible for the school outcomes, to involve all staff members as a collective responsibility pro-cess. The qualitative case study adopted semi-structured one-to-one interviews to collect data from one principal and a teacher from each of the four schools selected. The data was analyzed through a content analysis approach. The results revealed that a quality exchange relationship between principals and teachers has a significant influence on cooperation, commitment and performance to both principals and teachers. The results also showed that working together in a cordial relationship and in a more democratic environment brings long-lasting dividend for the school and the learners. But these vital elements are mostly hampered by the mundane procedures, dictatorial decisions, strict supervision of the directorate of education and some principals. This had not only negatively affected the principals’ and teachers’ work roles and exchange relationship, but teaching and learning as well. These traditional behaviors have also created fear, pressure and resentment in teachers, and prevent them from sharing innovative ideas and being committed to school activities. The interpretation of this study was purely engrained in the respondents’ context. The study recommends a further study in a larger scale to ascertain the affect and effect of the results or the hypothesis revealed. Perhaps it might be good if further discussion can be done on enhancing a quality exchange relationship among principals, teachers, <b>circuit</b> <b>supervisors</b> and the directorate of education. Effective leadership occurs as a result of building a quality relationship with the leader and the led...|$|R
40|$|All {{too often}} {{knowledge}} transfer {{is assumed to}} move in a rational and predictable fashion through formal professional development experiences and trainings (Borko, 2004; Desimone, 2009). The last two decades has seen a shift in terminology associated with headteacher development with many focusing on professional ‘learning’ rather than professional ‘training’. This paradigm shift {{is partly due to}} the refined focus on headteacher professional development, where passive modes of development and trainings have been replaced with constructivist approaches. In the latter, the headteacher is actively responsible for their learning and does so by seeking and engaging in activities that are relevant and readily applicable to their everyday practice. Arguably, this shift in conceptualisation reflects a much earlier shift in classroom practice from transmission approaches to teaching to constructivist approaches to learning, and has led to a corresponding change in the structure of professional learning models for headteachers. Networks and more recently educational networks have been cited as potential outlets for professional development through formal and informal associations of headteachers and teachers. Through an ethnographic approach this study sought to investigate networking practices of basic school headteachers in Ghana {{and the extent to which}} they perceive the social ties formed with other headteachers and education professionals contributed to their professional learning. Data was collected from headteachers, <b>circuit</b> <b>supervisors,</b> and district education officers through a number of interviews, personal accounts and descriptive analysis of social episodes. Analysis of social episodes described by headteachers suggest that homophily remains a key factor for their choice of whom to associate with. The paper argues that networking as a social practice has huge potential as an outlet for leadership learning for headteachers in the first five years of their appointment. These headteachers perceived their ties with other headteachers and education professionals as fundamental to their career development. However, this was less so for mid career headteachers who believed that their involvement in networks was mainly to contribute to knowledge creation rather than learn from the network. This study is very important for the government of Ghana in its decentralisation of educational administration and management and the on-going search for most effective ways of developing the professional capacities of headteachers. This paper therefore highlights the need for further studies on the extent to which the social and professional capital generated through these networks can be used to good effect...|$|R
40|$|Drop {{out among}} school {{children}} {{especially at the}} basic school level has over the years gained the attention of many ministries of education, international organizations and scholars in the academia. It is said to inhabit threat to achieving universal primary education (UPE) everywhere, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To some recent studies, the phenomenon of drop out {{is said to be}} somewhat responsible for increased crime in some parts of Africa. It is the goal of this study to understand why students drop out of school in Ghana and also what strategies there are to mitigate it. The study does so by comparing rural drop out to that of the urban as it carried out field work in four schools in five different communities. The study used the qualitative research approach to address what factors there were in causing children {{to drop out of school}} and what strategies are laid down by the government, better still the Ghana Education service in reducing drop out. The study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data from the various stake holders- directors of education, <b>circuit</b> <b>supervisors,</b> head teachers, teachers, parents and most importantly the drop outs themselves. Such data was collected from the four schools in the five communities in both the rural and urban areas chosen for this study. The study investigated six factors as influencing drop out among school children in the selected areas. It also identified both macro and micro- level strategies for mitigating drop out in the rural and urban schools. The study shows how the contextual differences of children, among others can influence their decision to drop out of school. The study indicates that drop out among school children in both rural and urban areas is predominantly caused by poverty, child labour, academic performance, pregnancy, corporal punishment (CP) and school context. The study makes clearer that such factors that cause children to drop out of school are not adequately independent but there are cases where one factor may coincide with the other to bring about drop out decision. It makes explicit that that the individual and institutional related factors of drop out sometimes work in connection with one another culminating in drop out. Like it has been said earlier, macro and micro level strategies are found for mitigating drop out in rural and urban schools in Ghana. The macro strategies identified include, school feeding programme, free school uniform distribution and free education. The micro strategies include effective teaching, child safety, child friendly school environment, scholarship, guidance and counseling, introduction of kindergarten, role of NGOs, role of the family, communal by laws, among others.

40|$|Reward-based {{learning}} in neural systems is challenging because {{a large number}} of parameters that affect network function must be optimized {{solely on the basis of}} a reward signal that indicates improved performance. Searching the parameter space for an optimal solution is particularly difficult if the network is large. We show that Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity applied to synapses between a <b>supervisor</b> <b>circuit</b> and the network it is controlling can effectively reduce the dimension of the space of parameters being searched to support efficient reinforcement-based {{learning in}} large networks. The critical element is that the connections between the supervisor units and the network must be reciprocal. Once the appropriate connections have been set up by Hebbian plasticity, a reinforcement-based learning procedure leads to rapid learning in a function approximation task. Hebbian plasticity within the network being supervised ultimately allows the network to perform the Learning often takes place solely through the reinforcement of improved performance.

40|$|The {{performance}} of mineral grinding circuits strongly affects downstream {{processes such as}} flotation and cyanidation, and grinding is often the single most expensive unit operation. Hence, optimization efforts must be made {{on a regular basis}} to maintain and improve its technical and economic efficiency. The focus of this thesis, off-line optimization of grinding circuits, is based on the mathematical modelling of process units such as ball mills and hydrocyclones. To complete an optimization task, a mineral process engineer must possess skills and knowledge pertaining to the different stages involved in such effort, available software tools and interpretation of results. A prototype knowledge-based system, Grinding <b>Circuits</b> Optimization <b>Supervisor</b> (GCOS), has been developed in CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) to assist a non-expert mineral process engineer to do off-line optimization studies. Due to the importance of the correct estimation of back-calculated mill selection function in grinding optimization studies, a spline curve fitting algorithm has been used to improve their quality. The linkage of the algorithms for the selection function estimation, spline curve fitting, selection function scaling for different ball sizes and single ball mill simulation has provided a useful tool, Numerical Grinding Optimization Tools in C (NGOTC) for circuit analysis and grinding media size optimization. The smoothed estimated or scaled selection functions can be used subsequently in Ball Milling Circuits Simulator (BMCS) to perform full circuit simulations. Data from a number of mineral processing plants including Agnico Eagle (La Ronde Division), Les Mine Selbaie, Les Mines Casa Berardi, Lupin Mine, Dome Mine and Louvicourt Mine were used to develop and test NGOTC, BMCS and GCOS. The results of data analysis and circuit simulations of some of these plants are presented, and the impact of some suggested actions is given and discussed...|$|R
