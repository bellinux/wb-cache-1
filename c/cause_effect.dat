As medieval scholars discovered that in practice the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this <b>cause</b> <b>effect</b> relationship. Weight was split into a [...] "still weight" [...] or pondus, which remained constant, and the actual gravity or gravitas, which changed as the object fell. The concept of gravitas was eventually replaced by Jean Buridan's impetus, a precursor to momentum.|$|E
60|$|Relative {{names are}} such as father, son; ruler, subject; like; equal; unlike; unequal; longer, shorter; <b>cause,</b> <b>effect.</b> Their {{characteristic}} property is, {{that they are}} always given in pairs. Every relative name which is predicated of an object, supposes another object (or objects), of which we may predicate either that same name or another relative name which {{is said to be}} the correlative of the former. Thus, when we call any person a son, we suppose other persons who must be called parents. When we call any event a cause, we suppose another event which is an effect. When we say of any distance that it is longer, we suppose another distance which is shorter. When we say of any object that it is like, we mean that it is like some other object, which is also said to be like the first. In this last case both objects receive the same name; the relative term is its own correlative.|$|E

50|$|The NEP {{recognizes the}} {{innovative}} capacity of humans, but says {{that humans are}} still ecologically interdependent as with other species. The NEP notes the power {{of social and cultural}} forces but does not profess social determinism. Instead, humans are impacted by the <b>cause,</b> <b>effect,</b> and feedback loops of ecosystems. The Earth has a finite level of natural resources and waste repositories. Thus, the biophysical environment can impose constraints on human activity. They discussed a few harbingers of this NEP in 'hybridized' theorizing about topics that were neither exclusively social nor environmental explanations of environmental conditions. It was additionally a critique of Malthusian views of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

5000|$|After {{consultation}} with ECMT, a combined approach was developed called the ALERT C Protocol that aimed {{to combine the}} best features of each approach. ALERT A and C replaced the CARMINAT message categories <b>cause,</b> <b>effect</b> and advice by a single 11-bit basic message code. This permits up to 2048 basic message phrases to be broadcast. The new ALERT protocols significantly increased the efficiency of message coding, shortening the basic message content from 18 to 11 bits. In conjunction with the revised location codes, which saved 17 of the 33 bits previously assigned, this allowed {{the great majority of}} traffic messages to be broadcast using a single TMC data sequence. In 1991, ECMT recommended moving forward with further testing of the protocols. [...] The work continued with a larger consortium including Volvo and Ford in the European Commission's DRIVE II project ATT-ALERT.|$|E
5000|$|When {{experimental}} {{interventions are}} infeasible or illegal, the derivation of <b>cause</b> <b>effect</b> relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually {{expressed in the}} form of missing arrows in causal graphs such as Bayesian networks or path diagrams. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between conditional probabilities, as in , and interventional probabilities, as in [...] The former reads: [...] "the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past", while the latter reads: [...] "the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of quantal phenomena that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In classical thermodynamics, processes are initiated by interventions called thermodynamic operations. In other branches of science, for example astronomy, the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.|$|E

40|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} regarding how causal relations among features of objects affect how those objects are classified. The assumptions of these theories were tested in 3 experiments that manipulated the causal knowledge associated with novel categories. There were 3 results. The 1 st was a multiple <b>cause</b> <b>effect</b> in which a feature’s importance increases with its number of causes. The 2 nd was a coherence effect in which good category members are those whose features jointly corroborate the category’s causal knowledge. These 2 effects can {{be accounted for by}} assuming that good category members are those likely to be generated by a category’s causal laws. The 3 rd result was a primary <b>cause</b> <b>effect,</b> in which primary causes are more important to category membership. This effect can also be explained by a generative account with an additional assumption: that categories often are perceived to have hidden generative causes...|$|E
