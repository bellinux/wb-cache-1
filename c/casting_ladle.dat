40|$|The article {{presents}} chosen aspects of foundry engineering {{of the settlement}} dwellers, including the archaeometric characteristics and metal science analysis of the artefacts, {{as well as an}} attempted reconstruction of the production organization. Discovered in Szczepidło (Greater Poland), the foundry workshop is unique in Central European Bronze Age. This workshop foundry operated roughly XIV-XII Century BC. Its production is evidenced by the presence of markers of the whole production cycle: semi-finished and finished products, production waste, fragments of crucibles and <b>casting</b> <b>ladles</b> with traces of usage, and tools. On this basis the alloys and foundry technologies used have been described. The analysis of foundry technology of copper alloys in the settlement area was carried out by observing the surface and structure of the products, semi-finished artefacts and fragments of crucibles by applying optical microscopy (OM), confocal microscopy (CLSM) and Xray radiography (RT). The investigations of compositions were made by means of the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (ED-XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis system (EDS) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the foundry, it's {{difficult}} to measure the level of molten iron in pouring package and the flow of molten iron each pouring during casting control process, which {{will result in the}} control problem of over-pouring and under-pouring. So,a new measurement method about molten iron level and dynamic detection of vertical flow rate has been developed in this paper. The method is based on infrared radiation and time intervals under the state of vertical flow rate of molten iron. By analysing the flow rate of molten iron in the <b>casting</b> <b>ladle</b> taphole theoretically, building field experimental device and analysing experimental results, it shows that the proposed iron level measurement and dynamic detection of vertical flow rate based on infrared radiation and time intervals are feasible. And then it lays a foundation for controlling the flow of molten iron...|$|E

40|$|Generally speaking, sulphur is {{considered}} a harmful element for steel quality, reason why all the technological steps are being taken in order to eliminate it from the metal bath. This paper deals with {{the influence of the}} chemical composition, on the slag quantity and of the bath stirring condition upon the desulphurization process in the <b>casting</b> <b>ladle</b> by treatment with synthetic slag. The experiments were made at an open-hearth plant with the steel tapping in two ladles (the desulphurization was made with synthetic slag at one ladle while the other one was considered standard) and at the electric steel plant and for the synthetic slag formation a mix was used, made, according to several receipts, of: lime (50 - 75 %), fluorine (0 - 17 %), bauxite (0 - 32 %) and aluminous slag (8 - 22 %). The data were processed in the calculation programs EXCEL and MATLAB, which resulted in a series of correlations between the desulphurization degree and the chemical composition of the slag, respectively the slag quantity both for the charges bubbled with Argon and the unbubbled ones. En general, el azufre es considerado un elemento nocivo para la calidad del acero y, por eso, en la pr&aacute;ctica, se toman todas las medidas de orden tecnol&oacute;gico para su eliminaci&oacute;n del ba&ntilde;o met&aacute;lico.

50|$|Firearms {{projectiles}} {{were being}} {{cast in the}} 14th century. Iron was used for cannon, while lead was the preferred material for small arms. Lead was more expensive than iron, but it was softer and less damaging to the relatively weak iron barrels of early muskets. Lead could be <b>cast</b> in a <b>ladle</b> over a wood fire used for cooking or home heating, while casting iron required higher temperatures. Greater density of lead allowed lead bullets to retain velocity and energy better than iron bullets of the same weight and initial firing velocity.|$|R
50|$|In metal casting, a tundish is a broad, open {{container}} {{with one or}} more holes in the bottom. It is used to feed molten metal into an ingot mould so as to avoid splashing and give a smoother flow. The tundish allows a reservoir of metal to feed the <b>casting</b> machine while <b>ladles</b> are switched, thus acting as a buffer of hot metal, as well as smoothing out flow, regulating metal feed to the moulds and cleaning the metal. Metallic remains left inside a tundish are known as tundish skulls and need to be removed, typically by mechanical means (scraping, cutting). A casting tundish is lined with refractory bricks specific to the liquid metal which is being cast.|$|R
40|$|For further {{research}} on the precondition and interoperability model of interaction ladles among continuous caster, this article takes steel ladle of Y steel works {{as the object of}} research. On the basis of turnover number calculation model of single <b>cast</b> steel <b>ladle,</b> the relationship between cast number and the turnover number and turnover times and last turnover number are further analyzed. The simulation of steel ladle turnover rules was taken on the 2 continuous casters with Gantt chart. After that, the relationships between turnover number and last turnover number and non-turnover number are researched deeply. Combining with the Gantt chart, the expressions of start casting time and empty ladle ending time and heavy ladle starting time were put forward. The precondition of steel ladle interaction is obtained, which means the exchange ladle should not undertaking transport task in first stop continuous caster, and the empty ladle end time of exchange ladle of first stop continuous caster should early than the heavy ladle start time of last stop continuous caster. After applying the model to practice, 3 steel ladles of No. 2 continuous caster can be reduced.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} ultrasound-assisted mineral {{carbonation}} were investigated in this work. The objectives were to intensify the CO 2 sequestration process to improve reaction kinetics and maximal conversion. Stainless steel slags, {{derived from the}} Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) and Continuous <b>Casting</b> / <b>Ladle</b> Metallurgy (CC/LM) refining steps, were used for assessing the technical feasibility of this concept, as they are potential carbon sinks and can benefit from reduction in alkalinity (pH) by mineral carbonation. Ultrasound was applied by use of an ultrasound horn into the reaction slurry, where mineral carbonation reaction took place at 50 oC for up to four hours; comparison was made to solely mechanically mixed process. It was found that sonication increases the reaction rate after the initial stage, and permits achieving higher carbonate conversion and lower pH. AOD slag conversion increased from 30 % to 49 %, and pH decreased from 10. 6 to 10. 1; CC slag conversion increased from 61 % to 73 % and pH decreased from 10. 8 to 9. 9. The enhancement effect of ultrasound was attributed to the removal of passivating layers (precipitated calcium carbonate and depleted silica) that surround the unreacted particle core and inhibit mass transfer. Significant particle size reduction was observed for sonicated powders, compared to particle size growth {{in the case of}} stirring only; D[4, 3] values increased without sonication by 74 % and 50 %, and decreased with sonication by 64 % and 52 %, respectively for AOD and CC slags. Considerations on scale-up of this technology, particularly with regards to energy efficiency, are also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} of spent moulding sands {{taken from the}} mould at various distances {{from the surface of}} the produced casting, are presented in the paper. The casting mould was made with an application of the cooling system of the metal core in order to increase the cooling rate of the <b>ladle</b> <b>casting.</b> As temperature measurements in the mould indicated the heat flow from the metal did not create conditions for the complete burning of a moulding sand. The analysis was performed to find out changes of spent moulding sands caused by degradation and destruction processes of organic binders. Conditions occurring in the casting mould were discussed on the bases of testing: ignition losses, dusts contents, pH reactions and the surface morphology of the moulding sand samples. Factors limiting the effective mould degassing were pointed out. Operations, possible for realization, which can limit the reasons of a periodical occurrence of increased amounts of casting defects due to changing gas evolution rates being the result of the technological process, were also indicated...|$|R
40|$|The {{sliding gate}} plate that {{controls}} steel {{flow through the}} tundish nozzle sometimes cracks leading to air aspiration and safety concerns. To evaluate possible mechanisms for crack formation, this research applies a 3 -D finite-element model of the thermal and mechanical stress in a sliding-gate plate during preheating and casting induced by thermal expansion and/or mechanical movement. The thermal model is first validated with previous temperature histories measured during preheating and <b>casting</b> in a <b>ladle</b> plate. The model of a tundish sliding gate nozzle is then used to investigate thermal-mechanical behavior and cracking due to the temperature variations during preheating and casting. The model predictions of the maximum stress location and orientation match well with the crack location observed in used plates from POSCO. Different mechanisms {{for the formation of}} two different types of common through-thickness cracks are identified and explained. The first involves exterior tensile stress during heating stages, and the second is due to excessive compression from non-optimal placement of guide points on the steel cassette...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} of spent moulding sands {{taken from the}} mould in which the metal core cooling system - to increase the cooling rate of the <b>ladle</b> <b>casting</b> - was applied, are presented in the hereby paper. The changes of the spent moulding sand at the casting external side being the result of degradation and destruction processes of organic binder, were analysed in this publication. Since the reclaimed material, obtained {{as a result of}} the mechanical reclamation of spent sands of the same type, is used as a grain matrix of the moulding sand, the amount of a binder left from the previous technological cycle is essential for the sound castings production. On the bases of investigations of the thermal analysis, ignition losses, dusts contents and pH values of the samples taken from the spent sand the conditions under which the process of gases displacing in the casting mould was realised as well as factors limiting the efficient mould degassing - were considered in this study. The possible reason of a periodical occurrence of an increased number of casting defects due to changing gas volume emission, being the reason of the realised technological process, was indicated...|$|R
40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held. Spheroidizing treatment of melt was realized with magnesium containing alloying alloy FeSiMg 7 by means of ladle method. Secondary treatment of high strength cast iron was carried out by addition of alloying alloy-modifier in an amount of 0. 1 % {{to the bottom of the}} pouring <b>ladle.</b> <b>Cast</b> samples for chemical composition analysis, study of microstructure, technological and mechanical properties of the resultant alloy were made. Studies have shown that the secondary treatment of high strength cast iron with developed modifier-alloying alloy results in formation of the perlite metallic base due to the tin impact and nodular graphite with regular shape under the influence of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes. The tendency of high strength cast iron to «white cast iron» formation has been minimized, and the mechanical properties of the alloy produced correspond to HSCI 80. </p...|$|R
