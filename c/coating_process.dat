25|$|A second {{advantage}} is {{the ease of}} application of the polymers as coatings versus conventional coating processes. While coating a substrate with conventional polymers requires a number of steps, plasma polymerization accomplishes all these in essentially a single step. This leads to a cleaner and ‘greener’ synthesis and <b>coating</b> <b>process,</b> since no solvent is needed during the polymer preparation and no cleaning of the resultant polymer is needed either. Another ‘green’ aspect of the synthesis is that no initiator is needed for the polymer preparation since reusable electrodes cause the reaction to proceed. The resultant polymer coatings also {{have a number of}} advantages over typical coatings. These advantages include being nearly pinhole free, highly dense, and that the thickness of the coating can easily be varied.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{rainwater}} catchment tanks {{used throughout}} the world are composed of virgin polyethylene, a substance which in the USA is both FDA and NSF approved for potable water storage. [...] Other types of tanks used for rainwater storage include fiberglass, galvanized metal, stainless steel, and concrete. [...] Each type of tank has positive and negative aspects. [...] Polyethylene tanks, when placed above ground, can be subject to algae growth {{as well as the}} possibility of a short life (@20 years) due to normal UV exposure in sunlight. The very strong fiberglass tanks must undergo a specific <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> to be brought up to potable grade. [...] Galvanized tanks must either be lined or coated both for potability as well as to prevent the inevitable rusting at any welded seams. [...] Uncoated galvanized tanks will leach zinc into the stored water and are not recommended in most instances - certainly not for water stored for human consumption. Concrete tanks leach a more benign substance - lime - into stored water and many are used around the world for rainwater storage.|$|E

40|$|The final goal of most coating flows is {{to produce}} uniform coating liquid layers of {{specified}} thickness at high speeds. The study on the dynamics and optimal coating windows in <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> is quite important industrially as well as academically, because it {{is closely related to}} productivity and high quality control of coating products, especially, in films, flat panel displays, batteries, and steel products. Recently, rheological aspects of viscoelastic coating liquids on the coating dynamics have attracted researchers' interest, since non-Newtonian behavior in coating flows can change the performance of a coater (Dontula, 1999). Among many <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> (e. g., roll; slide; slot; curtain coatings, etc.), in this study, forward and reverse roll <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> have been experimentally investigated, which are distinguished by the use of one or more gaps between rotating rolls to meter and apply a liquid to web or substrate (Benkreira, 2002; Coyle et al., 1990; Tiu et al., 1999).

40|$|Plasma-enhanced <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> {{together}} form a {{key element}} in the manufacture of functional components {{in a wide range of}} technologies. Typical examples are thermal barrier coatings in architectural glazing, scratch-resistant coatings, precision optical filters and also functional coatings e. g. in semiconductor technology, photovoltaics, display technology and in the battery industry. In the case of most of these technologies, there is a trend to increased productivity while at the same time increasing demands in terms of complexity, precision and reproducibility of these <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> Experimental developments in new <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> emphasise in particular large and complex reaction chambers and this is associated with high costs, risks and unplanned downtime. For these reasons, simulation of plasma enhanced <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> is increasingly important in that it reduces the number of trials and prototypes required. At the Fraunhofer IST, a stand-alone software package was developed to address this requirement. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) process models gas fl ows at low pressures, also using the "Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo" (PIC-MC) approach to describe the gas discharge reaction. This strategy, based on modelling of particles, is ideal for characterising the overall multi-particulate dynamics taking place at low pressures. The widely used, commercially-available continuum dynamics software programs are not applicable in this situation. In this article, application examples will be presented of DSMC/PIC-MIC simulations for a range of vacuum coating and magnetron sputtering technologies and compared with experimental results, as well as the use of this approach for process optimisation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{correlation}} between the thermo-rheological properties of a thermosetting powder coating system with its surface structure build-up. Epoxy powder coating systems, which displayed surface matting and surface wrinkling, were examined. Firstly, the evolution of the complex viscosity was correlated with the cure kinetic. Secondly, the structure build-up {{on the surface of the}} coatings was investigated with a combined SEM-CLA profilometry analysis at different stages of curing process for both EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> Different finishes were found to characterize the films applied by using EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> as a result of the different way the film is heated by. Finally, a strict relationship of film morphology to the degree of conversion and to the evolution of the complex viscosity was found out for both EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> The surface structure is built up after gelation point and continues to evolve after gelation with a full development of the film fine structure. Differences were observed in the surface structure build-up when different curing temperature was used, thereby indicating an influence of minimum viscosity on achievable finishing. These experimental results lead to further advances in a better understanding of the formation of surface topography and morphology of polymeric films. They also provide important indications for the settings of curing parameters in both EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> as well as for the development of new powder coating formulations. © 2007 Elsevier B.
