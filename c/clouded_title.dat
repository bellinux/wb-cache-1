Because of the <b>clouded</b> <b>title</b> issues, {{he could not find}} a buyer at the time. Deciding instead to develop the property for coal mining, in March 1868 he leased [...] to two independent coal companies. It was a 15-year term, with a rental of $.30 for each ton of coal mined. The companies placed two collieries on the land, the Tower and the Brookside. Near the collieries, Tower began to develop a small town, which was named Tower City when first surveyed. Tower laid out the town, and he also rented lots to settlers.|$|E

There was serious concern regarding {{the possibility of}} a <b>clouded</b> <b>title.</b> The Reverend James Maxwell resolved this issue by personally warranting the title against all claims except that of the United States government. Thus, by March 1808, the way was finally cleared for breaking ground.|$|E
5000|$|Bromell {{decided on}} {{graduate}} studies, {{becoming the first}} African-American woman to earn an MS in Agricultural Economics (December 1977) from Clemson University. Her master's thesis addressed {{the problems associated with}} <b>clouded</b> <b>title</b> property, known as [...] "heirs property". Her study was the first scientific documentation and measurement of the problem in South Carolina. Her findings were published in Progressive Farmer Magazine (1978), carried by many local newspapers throughout the State, presented at the American Agricultural Economics Association's annual meeting, and submitted to the South Carolina Legislature. The Honorable Herbert Fielding submitted a bill to correct problems identified by Bromell Tinubu.|$|E
5000|$|In the 17th century, {{there was}} a push to {{regularize}} land titles via the composición, in which for a fee paid to the crown <b>clouded</b> <b>titles</b> could be cleared, and indigenous communities had to prove title to land that they had held [...] "since time immemorial," [...] as the legal phrase goes. [...] This was the period when Spaniards began regularizing their titles via composición.|$|R
5000|$|Coke made {{a fortune}} from {{purchasing}} estates with <b>clouded</b> <b>titles</b> at a discount, whereupon, through {{his knowledge of the}} intricacies of property law, he would clear the titles on the acquired properties to his favor. About the year 1615, his amassed property acquisitions attracted the attention of the government. James I claimed that Coke [...] "had already as much land as it was proper a subject should possess." [...] Coke requested the King's permission to just [...] "add one acre more" [...] to his holdings and upon approval proceeded to purchase the fine estate of Castle Acre Priory in Norfolk, {{one of the most expensive}} [...] "acres" [...] in the land.|$|R

5000|$|In United States {{property}} law, cloud on title or {{title defect}} refers to any irregularity {{in the chain}} of title of property (usually real property) that would give a reasonable person pause before accepting a conveyance of title. According to Investopedia, a cloud can be defined as: [...] "Any document, claim, unreleased lien or encumbrance that might invalidate or impair the title to real property or make the title doubtful. Clouds on title are usually discovered during a title search." [...] <b>Clouded</b> <b>title</b> can thus be contrasted with a clear title, which indicates that a property is unencumbered.|$|E

40|$|The {{mortgage}} foreclosure process is beset {{by a variety}} of problems. These range from procedural defects (including, but not limited to robosigning) to outright counterfeiting of documents to questions about the validity of private-label mortgage securitizations that could mean that these mortgage-backed securities are not actually backed by any mortgages whatsoever. While the extent of these problems is unknown at present, the evidence is mounting that it is not limited to one-off cases, but that there may be pervasive defects throughout the foreclosure and securitization processes. The problems in the mortgage market are highly technical, but they are extremely serious. At best they present problems of fraud on the court, <b>clouded</b> <b>title</b> to property, and delay in foreclosures that will increase the shadow housing inventory and drive down home prices. At worst, they represent a systemic risk of liabilities in the trillions of dollars, greatly exceeding the capital of the US’s major financial institutions. Congress would do well to ensure that federal regulators are undertaking a thorough investigation of foreclosure problems and to consider the possibilities for a global settlement of foreclosure problems, loan modifications, and the housing debt overhang that stagnate the economy and pose potential systemic risk...|$|E
5000|$|Speculation {{in western}} New York lands and <b>clouded</b> <b>titles</b> {{resulted}} in many unscrupulous transactions. In 1786 William Cooper {{and his partner}} Andrew Craig [...] "by questionable methods [...] [...] [...] purchased the Otsego lands of Croghan's acres for only £2,700." [...] Cooper laid out the town of Cooperstown, New York and built his mansion, Otsego Hall, on the former site of Croghan's residence. William Franklin and the Prevost heirs watched bitterly as the property increased in value twentyfold. [...] "Andrew Prevost, Jr., wrote Franklin on December 12, 1812: 'We have lost an immense property from the infamous advantage taken by Cooper and others without your knowledge by a forced Sale under your Title.'" [...] William Cooper's son, the author James Fenimore Cooper, presented his family's side of the dispute in his Chronicles of Cooperstown (1838).|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} literature identifies heir property, land held communally by heirs {{of someone who}} has died without a will, as a primary cause of land loss among African Americans and a major factor contributing to persistent poverty in the South’s demographically-defined Black Belt. Despite the importance of this form of property, little systematic research has been done to quantify the extent of heir property or the potential wealth tied up in <b>clouded</b> <b>titles.</b> This study documents the presence of more than 1, 500 heir property parcels in one Alabama Black Belt county (Macon) and describes the methodological challenges involved in such research. Our analysis identified distinctive characteristics of and significant relationships between a set of key ownership variables (taxpayer location, size and value of land, structural improvements, and municipal incorporation). We argue the need to document the extent and consequences of heir property to spur action by legislators, Extension Systems across the region, and pro-bono attorneys, among others, to address the personal and economic costs associated with this form of insecure ownership. When a landowner dies intestate (without a probated will), state laws of descent and distribution regulate what happens to the property, which usually gets passed as an undivided unit to the decedent’s heirs. Because there is no right o...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortgage}} foreclosure crisis raises legal questions {{as important as}} its economic impact. Questions that were straightforward and uncontroversial a generation ago today threaten the stability of a 13 trillion mortgage market: Who has standing to foreclose? If a foreclosure was done improperly, what is the effect? And what is the proper legal method for transferring mortgages? These questions implicate the clarity of title for property nationwide and pose a too-big-to-fail problem for the courts. The legal confusion stems from the existence of competing systems for establishing title to mortgages and transferring those rights. Historically, mortgage title was established and transferred through the 2 ̆ 2 public demonstration 2 ̆ 2 regimes of UCC Article 3 and land recordation systems. This arrangement worked satisfactorily when mortgages were rarely transferred. Mortgage finance, however, shifted to securitization, which involves repeated bulk transfers of mortgages. To facilitate securitization, deal architects developed alternative 2 ̆ 2 contracting 2 ̆ 2 regimes for mortgage title: UCC Article 9 and MERS, a private mortgage registry. These new regimes reduced the cost of securitization by dispensing with demonstrative formalities, but {{at the expense of}} reduced clarity of title, which raised the costs of mortgage enforcement. This trade-off benefitted the securitization industry at the expense of securitization investors because it became apparent only subsequently with the rise in {{mortgage foreclosure}}s. The harm, however, has not been limited to securitization investors. <b>Clouded</b> mortgage <b>title</b> has significant negative externalities on the economy as a whole. This Article proposes reconciling the competing title systems through an integrated system of note registration and mortgage recordation, with compliance as a prerequisite to foreclosure. Such a system would resolve questions about standing, remove the potential cloud to real-estate title, and facilitate mortgage financing by clarifying property rights...|$|R
