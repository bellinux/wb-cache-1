40|$|Abstract. In {{cases where}} an {{investigator}} has no {{prior knowledge of}} a computer system to be investigated, the significant investment of time and resources required to undertake a detailed <b>computer</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> may deter investigators, given {{it is not known}} whether it will yield any relevant evidence. This problem is particularly acute in cases involving acceptable usage monitoring or intelligence operations, where an investigator has no particular expectations about the digital evidence which might be found on a collection of computer systems, or no prior knowledge of their usage. Computer profiling is a process by which a computer system is automatically examined, without direction, to determine whether the computer system is of interest to a human investigator. This paper proposes a new technique for automated computer forensic investigations which provides a computer profile with historical time-lining of user and application activity. A prototype software implementation of the technique is described and experimental results are provided and discussed which demonstrate the feasibility and value of incorporating activity traces into a computer profile...|$|E

40|$|Session 1 : Forensic Modeling and Framework: no. 3 Privacy is a {{fundamental}} human right defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To enable the protection of data privacy, personal data that {{are not related to}} the investigation subject should be excluded during <b>computer</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>examination.</b> In the physical world, protection of privacy is controlled and regulated in most countries by laws. Legislation for handling private data has been established in various jurisdictions. In the modern world, the massive use of computers generates a huge amount of private data and there is correspondingly an increased expectation to recognize and respect human rights in digital investigation. However, there does not exist a forensically sound model for protecting private data in the context of digital investigation, and it poses a threat to privacy if the investigation involves the processing of such kind of data. In this paper, we try to address this important issue and present a cryptographic model designed to be incorporated into the current digital investigation framework, thereby adding a possible way to protect data privacy in digital investigation. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{forensics}} is {{the process}} of gathering and analysing evidence from computer systems to aid in the investigation of a crime. Typically, such investigations are undertaken by human forensic examiners using purpose-built software to discover evidence from a computer disk. This process is a manual one, and the time it takes for a forensic examiner to conduct such an investigation is proportional to the storage capacity of the computer's disk drives. The heterogeneity and complexity of various data formats stored on modern computer systems compounds the problems posed by the sheer volume of data. The decision to undertake a <b>computer</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> of a computer system is a decision to commit significant quantities of a human examiner's time. Where there is no prior knowledge of the information contained on a computer system, this commitment of time and energy occurs with little idea of the potential benefit to the investigation. The key contribution of this research is the design and development of an automated process to describe a computer system and its activity for the purposes of a computer forensic investigation. The term proposed for this process is computer profiling. A model of a computer system and its activity has been developed over the course of this research. Using this model a computer system, which is the subj ect of investigation, can be automatically described in terms useful to a forensic investigator. The computer profiling process IS resilient to attempts to disguise malicious computer activity. This resilience is achieved by detecting inconsistencies in the information used to infer the apparent activity of the computer. The practicality of the computer profiling process has been demonstrated by a proof-of concept software implementation. The model and the prototype implementation utilising the model were tested with data from real computer systems. The resilience of the process to attempts to disguise malicious activity has also been demonstrated with practical experiments conducted with the same prototype software implementation...|$|E

40|$|Like the {{traditional}} <b>forensics,</b> <b>computer</b> <b>forensics</b> involves formulation of hypotheses grounding on {{the available evidence}} or facts.

40|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>examination</b> of logs plays a {{big role}} in modern {{computer}} security. Due to the sheer amount of data involved and the evolving complexity of <b>computer</b> systems, the <b>forensic</b> <b>examination</b> of logs is a time consuming and daunting task. Information stored in logs of a computer system is of crucial importance to gather forensic evidence of investigated actions or attacks against the system. Analysis of this information should be rigorous and credible, hence it lends itself to formal methods. In this thesis, we propose a model checking approach to the formalization of the forensic log analysis. In order to provide a structure to the log events, we express each event as a term of a term algebra. The signature of the algebra is carefully chosen to include all relevant information necessary to conduct the analysis. Properties of the model are expressed as formulas of a logic having dynamic, linear, temporal, and modal characteristics. A tableau-based proof system is provided for this logic upon which a model checking algorithm can be developed. In order to illustrate the proposed approach, the Windows XP auditing system is utilized. The properties that we capture in our logic include invariant properties of a system, forensic hypotheses, and generic or specific attack signatures. Moreover, we discuss the admissibility of forensics hypotheses and the underlying verification issues. Throughout our research we realized the significance the Windows registry can provide when correlated with the logs. The registry, being a source of system and application information, provides a reference point when detecting anomalies in the logs. Correlating the registry with the logs leverages the forensic analysis adding evidence to the investigation. We present the method of the correlation as well as a proof-of-concept implementation of the correlation of logs with the registry...|$|R
