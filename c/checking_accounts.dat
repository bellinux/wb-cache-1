5|$|While early {{efforts to}} legalize {{same-sex}} marriage failed, the legislature approved two bills in 2008 that granted all unmarried couples certain domestic partnership rights, including {{the ability to}} make hospital and nursing home visits, end-of-life choices and other medical decisions, in addition to rights to joint property ownership. Domestic partners must be at least 18 years old and be able to provide an affidavit attesting to their relationship along with two documents, such as joint <b>checking</b> <b>accounts,</b> mortgages or car leases; coverage on health insurance policies or the designation as a primary beneficiary in a will.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} controversial bank policy of paying - rather than bouncing - overdrawn checks, debits or ATM withdrawals. We {{argue that it}} should fall under lending regulations only if consumers use the program to get intentional loans. In contrast, if the program primarily applies to <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> activity then it should fall under <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> regulations. A model of precautionary balance holding and <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> customer data are used to estimate the likelihood of overdrafting.

25|$|The {{influence}} of earlier Greek and Hellenistic thought on the Muslim world began largely with Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun, who sponsored {{the translation of}} Greek texts into Arabic in the 9th century by Syrian Christians in Baghdad. But already by that time numerous Muslim scholars had written on economic issues, and early Muslim leaders had shown sophisticated attempts to enforce fiscal and monetary financing, use deficit financing, use taxes to encourage production, the use of credit instruments for banking, including rudimentary savings and <b>checking</b> <b>accounts,</b> and contract law.|$|E
25|$|Customer {{attrition}} is a {{major concern}} for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free <b>checking</b> <b>accounts,</b> online banking and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.|$|E
25|$|In shaping legislation, Rayburn {{preferred}} working {{quietly in}} the background to being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity. In his years in Congress, Rayburn always insisted on paying his own expenses, even {{going so far as}} to pay for his own travel expenses when inspecting the Panama Canal when his committee was considering legislation concerning it, rather than exercising his right to have the government pay for it. After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> was just over $26,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to these complex economic conditions, thrift managers resorted to several innovations, such as alternative mortgage instruments and interest-bearing <b>checking</b> <b>accounts,</b> {{as a way to}} retain funds and generate lending business. Such actions allowed the industry to continue to record steady asset growth and profitability during the 1970s even though the actual number of thrifts was falling. Despite such growth, there were still clear signs that the industry was chafing under the constraints of regulation. This was especially true with the large S in the western United States that yearned for additional lending powers to ensure continued growth. Despite several efforts to modernize these laws in the 1970s, few substantive changes were enacted.|$|E
25|$|Credit unions offer many of {{the same}} {{financial}} services as banks, but often using a different terminology; common services include share accounts (savings accounts), share draft accounts (<b>checking</b> <b>accounts),</b> credit cards, share term certificates (certificates of deposit), and online banking. Normally, only a member of a credit union may deposit or borrow money. Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown a significantly higher customer satisfaction rate with the quality of service at credit unions. Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of financial inclusion credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions.|$|E
25|$|City Bank of New York was {{chartered}} by New York State on June 16, 1812, with $2million of capital. Serving a {{group of}} New York merchants, the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company. The company's name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry. The 1918 purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets, and it became the largest commercial bank {{in the world in}} 1929. As it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer <b>checking</b> <b>accounts</b> (1936) and the negotiable certificate of deposit (1961).|$|E
