5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his hand is <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> the shape of the gun.|$|E
25|$|Pangolins, {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. Pangolins have been {{reported}} to roll away from danger, by both gravity and self-powered methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran {{to the edge of a}} slope and <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> a ball to roll down the slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{most memorable}} match in Ronaldinho's World Cup career {{took place in}} the quarter-final against England on 21 June. With Brazil {{trailing}} after Michael Owen's 23-minute strike, Ronaldinho turned the game around. Having received the ball inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran at the England defence and wrong footed star defender Ashley Cole with a trademark step over before passing the ball to Rivaldo {{on the edge of the}} penalty area to score the equalising goal just before half-time. Then, in the 50th minute, Ronaldinho took a free-kick from 40 yards out which <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> the top left corner of the net, completely surprising England's goalkeeper David Seaman, giving Brazil a 2–1 lead. Seven minutes later, however, he was controversially sent-off for a foul on England's defender Danny Mills. Ronaldinho was suspended for the semi-final, but returned to Brazil's starting lineup for the 2–0 victory over Germany in the final as Brazil won its record fifth World Cup title.|$|E

2500|$|He {{began the}} 1924–25 {{season in the}} reserves, Walter Creasor being {{preferred}} at outside left, but soon returned to first-team duties. In September, he [...] "played a great game" [...] in a losing cause at Tranmere Rovers, and scored with a [...] "swinging shot which <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> the net" [...] to open the scoring at home to Bradford. Darlington soon established a lead {{at the top of}} the division which they were to hold for the rest of the season, despite their team containing numerous [...] "real old stagers", players who were well known before the war. Winship himself was still [...] "nippy", despite his veteran status, though not as quick as the outside-right Mark Hooper.|$|E
2500|$|The hammer {{heads in}} Cristofori's mature pianos (A) {{are made of}} paper, <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> a {{circular}} coil and secured with glue, and surmounted by a strip of leather at the contact point with the string. According to harpsichord maker and scholar Denzil Wraight, such hammers {{have their origin in}} [...] "15th-century paper organ pipe technology". The purpose of the leather is presumably to make the hammers softer, thus emphasizing the lower harmonics of string vibration by maintaining a broad area of contact at impact. The same goal of softness was achieved in later 18th-century pianos by covering the wooden hammers with soft leather, and in mid-19th-century and later instruments by covering a wooden core with a thick layer of compressed felt.|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2016, Bermúdez Zacarías went on {{a morning}} jog nearby his home in Metepec, an upscale exurb [...] outside of Mexico City. As he was {{crossing}} a side {{street in front of}} a private residential neighborhood entrance, a man dressed in black ran up to him from behind and shot him at point-blank range {{in the head with a}} 9 mm pistol. Bermúdez Zacarías was able to turn his head briefly before the gunman delivered the shot in the back of his head. The judge fell to the ground bleeding and <b>curled</b> <b>into</b> fetal position before rolling on his back and spreading his legs and arms. The assassin then ran back and startled a cyclist and a pedestrian before catching up with his accomplice, who was waiting for him from a distance, before fleeing the scene. While Bermúdez Zacarías was on the ground, a car stopped next to him for a few seconds before continuing its course. A second vehicle turned towards the street Bermúdez Zacarías was on, but continued driving inside the residential neighborhood after stopping momentarily. The security guards from the residential neighborhood then called an ambulance. He was transported to Regional Hospital 251 of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Metepec, but doctors confirmed that he died before reaching the hospital. The murder scene was cordoned by the Metepec municipal police, the State of Mexico police, and members of the State of Mexico Attorney General Office. All three law enforcement agencies conducted an investigation at the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was gunned down.|$|E

60|$|She {{made her}} way about the first few blocks below Water street, looking for Dr. Herrick's address. It was ten o'clock, and the streets were {{in a frenzy of}} exchange.
