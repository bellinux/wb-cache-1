5|$|The department's origins lie in {{the royal}} collection, but it was {{augmented}} by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant, the future director of the Louvre. After Jean-François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, CharlesX decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by Edmé-Antoine Durand, Henry Salt and Bernardino Drovet; these additions added 7,000works. Growth continued via acquisitions by Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Mariette, after excavations at Memphis, sent back <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> archaeological finds including The Seated Scribe.|$|E
5|$|One of the zoo's famous {{inhabitants}} {{during the}} post-war period was Voytek, a Syrian brown bear. Voytek {{had been sold}} {{to a group of}} Polish soldiers during the war. He learned to help the soldiers by carrying <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> ammunition, and became an unofficial mascot. In 1944 the Polish II Corps sailed to Italy to join the British 8th Army. Voytek had to be officially drafted into the Polish army in order to secure his passage on a British transport ship. In 1946 the II Corps were demobilised and settled in Scotland, at Winfield Camp near Hutton, Berwickshire. Voytek retired to Edinburgh Zoo in 1947 and lived there until his death in 1963. During his time in the army Voytek had developed a liking for cigarettes, and this may have contributed to his popularity as an attraction at the zoo.|$|E
5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by <b>Crates</b> <b>of</b> Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
25|$|The trawler Casamara took on ten tonnes {{of weapons}} in September 1985 off the Maltese island of Gozo.

25|$|Though unnecessary, the Portuguese Government {{paid the}} United States US$20,000 {{for each of}} these interned {{aircraft}} as well as for one interned Lockheed P-38 Lightning. The U.S. accepted the payment, and gave as a gift four additional <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> aircraft, two of which were not badly damaged, without supplying spares, flight manuals or service manuals. Without proper training, incorporation of the aircraft into service was plagued with problems, and the last six Portuguese Airacobras that remained in 1950 were sold for scrap.|$|E
25|$|Beetles that {{successfully}} {{survived and}} reproduced were despatched by air or road to cooperating farmers or CSIRO staff. They were packed into ventilated <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> damp peat and thousands {{at a time}} were simply tipped onto fresh dung pads at the chosen release sites. Most beetles were observed to instantly bury themselves into the dung. From then on, farmers helped to monitor beetle distribution and activity and carried identification cards in their vehicles {{so that they could}} monitor beetle activity.|$|E
25|$|Along with Antisthenes and <b>Crates</b> <b>of</b> Thebes, Diogenes is {{considered}} one of the founders of Cynicism. The ideas of Diogenes, like those of most other Cynics, must be arrived at indirectly. No writings of Diogenes survive even though he is reported to have authored over ten books, a volume of letters and seven tragedies. Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice; therefore what we know about Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{tradition}} during Berg is {{the so-called}} Kastenlauf (crate walk). In this one buys a <b>crate</b> <b>of</b> beer (20 bottles each 1/2 litre) {{and walks to the}} Berg carrying it. At the end of the walk the crate must be empty. This is related to the tradition of [...] "vorglühen" [...] (a certain consumption of alcoholic beverages before the actual partying). This is usually done to lower the cost of attending the Berg as a <b>crate</b> <b>of</b> beer costs around €15 for 10 litres while a Maß (1 litre) at the Berg cost €8.50 in 2015.|$|R

25|$|Pytheas was {{a central}} source of {{information}} on the North Sea and the subarctic regions of western Europe to later periods, and possibly the only source. The only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw Pytheas' original text were Dicaearchus, Timaeus, Eratosthenes, <b>Crates</b> <b>of</b> Mallus, Hipparchus, Polybius, Artemidorus and Posidonius. Notably the list does not include Strabo or Tacitus, though Strabo discusses him and Tacitus may likely have known about his work. Either of the two could have known him through other writers or have read his work in the original.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, Siebold was not {{the easiest}} man to deal with. He was in {{continuous}} conflict with his Dutch superiors who felt he was arrogant. This threat of conflict resulted in his recall in July 1827 back to Batavia. But the ship, the Cornelis Houtman, sent to carry him back to Batavia, was thrown ashore by a typhoon in Nagasaki bay. The same storm badly damaged Dejima and destroyed Siebold's botanical garden. Repaired, the Cornelis Houtman was refloated. It left for Batavia with 89 <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> Siebold's salvaged botanical collection, but Siebold himself remained behind in Dejima.|$|E
25|$|In the fall, Polly's husband Dick {{moved back}} home. His parents {{supplied}} a small living allowance and Dick, Polly, {{and the two}} children moved into a three-story tenement building. Crosby lived with his father while Dick continued his studies at Harvard. While Dick worked at the bank, Harry Crosby sent <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> flowers from his mother's garden to Polly's apartment and brought over toys for the children. They drove to the shore together. Dick volunteered to join the fire department and persuaded the fire chief to wire a fire alarm bell to his home, so he could turn out at any hour. The fire chief soon let Dick go, and Dick retreated into drink again.|$|E

25|$|Dominion Monarch {{was laid}} up {{for six weeks}} in Tilbury but then resumed her route, sailing on 9 January 1940 via Cape Town, Fremantle and Melbourne to Sydney, where she arrived on 12 February. This time she did not {{continue}} to New Zealand, but spent 11 days at Sydney before starting her return voyage on 23 February. Because of the German submarine threat she attracted few passengers in either direction, so on her return voyage from Australia much of her passenger accommodation carried extra cargo. Her public rooms were stacked with <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> fruit and vegetables, and bales of wool were stowed on her games deck. She called at Melbourne and Cape Town, and reached The Downs on 1 April.|$|E
25|$|But it was {{the site}} where that second piece of {{information}} led us that contained dynamite. From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|Of the 150 or 160 <b>crates</b> <b>of</b> silver {{known to}} be on board the vessel, 70 were {{retrieved}} by a merchant of Hirado in 1617. Later salvage efforts only turned up three bars of silver and a few trinkets in 1653, and a cannon and some silver in 1658. Modern attempts from 1928 to 1933 found another cannon (now placed {{at the front door}} of the Tenri Central Library in Nara), two iron helmets, an anchor, some oyster-shell window panes, an astrolabe, among others. A suspected wreck of the Nossa Senhora da Graça was discovered by the local carpenter and amateur underwater archaeologist Matsumoto Shizuo in the period of 1987–2000, 600 m from Fukuda and 45 m underwater. Matsumoto erected a life-sized Virgin Mary statue in the nearest island of Matsushima (松島) to commemorate the occasion.|$|E
