30|$|Droplet {{microfluidics}} {{has emerged}} as a promising technique to perform high-throughput, massively-parallel chemical and molecular biological reactions. Droplet microfluidic operations such as droplet generation, sorting, and fluid addition are well established; however, fluid exchange (i.e. washing) at high-throughput is challenging to implement. Here we present a microfluidic device architecture that utilizes wash buffer injection preceding a splitting junction in proximity to a magnetic field to transfer paramagnetic microparticles across a concentration gradient within a single droplet. The device can operate at high throughput (50  Hz) while preserving input droplet volume at the <b>collection</b> <b>outlet</b> as verified using high speed imaging. Using a two-stage device, combined microparticle retention rates (up to 97.5 %) and high wash efficiency (92.9 %) is demonstrated using dye absorbance and fluorescence. This method can be performed in a serial array to obtain an arbitrary degree of wash efficiency and integrated into lab-on-a-chip systems for use in multi-step microfluidic bioassays or single-cell genomic applications requiring high-fidelity washing steps within droplets.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in inertial microfluidics designs have enabled high throughput, label-free separation of cells {{for a variety}} of bioanalytical applications. Various device configurations have been proposed for binary separation with a focus on enhancing the separation distance between particle streams to improve the efficiency of separate particle collection. These configurations have not demonstrated scaling beyond 3 particle streams either because the channel width is a constraint at the collection outlets or particle streams would be too closely spaced to be collected separately. We propose a method to design collection outlets for inertial focusing and separation devices which can collect closely-spaced particle streams and easily scale to an arbitrary number of collection channels without constraining the outlet channel width, which is the usual cause of clogging or cell damage. According to our approach, collection outlets are a series of side-branching channels perpendicular to the main channel of egress. The width and length of the outlets can be chosen subject to constraints from the position of the particle streams and fluidic resistance ratio computed from fluid dynamics simulations. We show the efficacy of this approach by demonstrating a successful collection of upto 3 particle streams of 7 μm, 10 μm and 15 μm fluorescent beads which have been focused and separated by a spiral inertial device with a separation distance of only 10 μm - 15 μm. With a throughput of 1. 8 mL/min, we achieved collection efficiency exceeding 90 % for each particle at the respective <b>collection</b> <b>outlet.</b> The flexibility to use wide collection channels also enabled us to fabricate the microfluidic device with an epoxy mold that was created using xurography, a low cost, and imprecise fabrication technique...|$|E

40|$|Acoustofluidics {{has been}} an {{emerging}} technology that combines fluidic control of microfluidics technology and particle handling of acoustics technology. This integrative approach provides non-contact and efficient particle and cell manipulation inside microfluidic channels. In this work, two acoustofluidic platforms have been developed, one for environmental monitoring application and one for medical application. The first platform was developed that enabled trapping and quantification of crude oil droplets for environmental monitoring application. Crude oil spills have serious ecological and economic impacts. Detecting low concentrations of oil after dispersion into small oil droplets is challenging and has immense importance in marine environment monitoring, {{such as in the}} case of large-scale oil spill as well as chronic oil discharge. Current fluorescence-based oil detectors have trade-offs between detection sensitivity and portability. In this research an acoustic radiation force based microfluidic device was developed to trap and concentrate oil droplets in water, which facilitated highly sensitive fluorescence detection of concentrated oil droplets as well as sampling for further off-chip analysis. The developed system successfully trapped low concentration crude oil droplets utilizing a circular acoustic resonance cavity, detected the accumulated oil droplets with a compact fluorescence detector, and separated the concentrated oil droplets to a downstream <b>collection</b> <b>outlet</b> for further off-chip analysis. The second platform was developed to analyze the biophysical properties of cells such as their density and compressibility for differentiating cancer cells of different stages. It has been reported that biophysical properties of cells are related to cancer progression, where benign cells are less deformable and malignant cells are more deformable. This change has been generally interpreted as metastatic cancer cells being more capable to translocate through the narrow gaps of adjacent tissue and the epithelial cell layers of blood vessels. Therefore measuring biophysical properties of cells such as compressibility is of great importance to differentiate cancer cells having different metastatic potential. However current methods are low throughput, costly, and usually require expertise for operation. In this work, an acoustic radiation force based system was developed that allowed non-contact measurement of cell biophysical properties. The developed system utilized multi-frequency acoustic resonance simultaneously to allow highly accurate measurement of cell density and compressibility of cancer cells at high throughput using simple instrumentation. In summary, advancements in acoustofluidic technology enabled solving real world challenges in a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, cell biophysics, and cancer metastasis...|$|E
30|$|We {{assessed}} the microparticle recovery {{as a function}} of three paramagnetic microparticle sizes 1, 5, and 22  µm in diameter. For the optimal flow rates determined the observed recovery (fraction of magnetic microparticles recovered in the final <b>collection</b> <b>outlet</b> compared to the combined waste channels) was most efficient (97.5 %) for the largest diameter microparticles (22  µm) (Fig.  3 b). This is due to the larger magnetic core and resulting higher velocity in the magnetic field. Smaller diameter (~[*] 1  µm) superparamagnetic particles were also tested, but due to higher net magnetic susceptibilities and resulting higher velocities, the injection channel required modifications to achieve efficient recovery (Additional file 2 : Video S 1). This represents a limitation of the current device design, which may need to be tailored to the properties of the magnetic particles used in the droplet based assay. Because high speed imaging and tracking of larger diameter particles is less challenging than for smaller particles, the 22  µm diameter magnetic microparticles were used for the remainder of proof-of-principle experiments in this study. In the absence of a magnetic field adjacent to the injection channels, collective recovery for all microparticles was approximately 40 % presumably due to the force imparted through injection (Fig.  3 b) which biases additional microparticles to the waste outlet channels during splitting. Using high-speed imaging the trajectories of individual 22  µm microparticles were tracked using the DMV software [24] and superimposed (Fig.  3 c). The injection induced Y-axis deflection is typically less than 70  µm and particles return to the top portion of the droplet within about 500  µm distance travelled in the X direction. The distance between the injection channel and the splitting junction is 1  mm for the proof-of-principle devices used in this study indicating that higher throughput is achievable. Using high speed imaging the velocity of the particles was tracked just after injection. Typically maximum velocities did not exceed 2500  µm/s in fair agreement with the expected value (Eq.  4). Slight deviations from the expected velocity may be due to microparticle and magnetic core size dispersity. In addition, the placement of the stationary magnet varies slightly from device to device causing small variations in the magnetic field gradient experienced by the microparticles. In order to verify preservation of droplet volume after splitting, high-speed video of the injection and splitting cycle was acquired. Droplet area was tracked prior-to and during injection and after the bifurcation channel. Droplet area is seen to increase linearly during injection followed by an abrupt decrease at the splitting junction as the two daughter droplets are tracked separately. The area was integrated along the channel height to obtain the volume change for the injection-splitting cycle. Injection and splitting cycle traces were superimposed and compiled into a histogram. The histogram was best fit by two Gaussian distributions indicating identical input droplet and output daughter droplet volumes of 2.2  nl upon injection of 2.1  nl and equal volume splitting (Fig.  3 d).|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} flow, passive {{separation device}} was designed using an equivalent circuit to create variable flow rates for hydrodynamic focusing to drain channels and <b>collection</b> <b>outlets.</b> By varying {{the diameter of}} the sample inlet connection into the reservoir, the particle position was influenced significantly, which enabled desired separations. Additionally it was noted that the relative, horizontal position of the inlet also had a significant influence on particle position within the device. A dimensionless number, the Characteristic Sample Inlet, was developed to relate geometric properties of the inlet reservoir to downstream particle distribution. It was found that a 2 : 1 ratio between inlet reservoir and sample inlet diameter, and placed {{at the top of the}} reservoir yielded the best separation results. Fluid velocity profiles in the reservoir were explored using Comsol Multyphysics. The experimentally observed particle trajectories and COMSOL predictions were in good agreement. Based on Comsol models a dimensionless parameter to relate the unique velocity profiles within the inlet reservoir to downstream separation of particles was also developed. A mixture of 10, 5. 5, and 3. 0 µm particles were separated to three distinct <b>collection</b> <b>outlets</b> at 73. 4 %, 64. 7 %, and 52. 8 % respectively. Therefore this project shows that passive separations of particles can be achieved simply by alerting the ratio of inlet hole relative to inlet reservoir diameter, and by placing the inlet hole at the top of the reservoir...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{separation}} {{is of great}} interest in many biological and biomedical applications. Flow-based methods {{have been used to}} sort particles and cells. However, the main challenge with flow based particle separation systems is the need for a sheath flow for successful operation. Existence of the sheath liquid dilutes the analyte, necessitates precise flow control between sample and sheath flow, requires a complicated design to create sheath flow and separation efficiency depends on the sheath liquid composition. In this paper, we present a microfluidic platform for sheathless particle separation using standing surface acoustic waves. In this platform, particles are first lined up {{at the center of the}} channel without introducing any external sheath flow. The particles are then entered into the second stage where particles are driven towards the off-center pressure nodes for size based separation. The larger particles are exposed to more lateral displacement in the channel due to the acoustic force differences. Consequently, different-size particles are separated into multiple <b>collection</b> <b>outlets.</b> The prominent feature of the present microfluidic platform is that the device does not require the use of the sheath flow for positioning and aligning of particles. Instead, the sheathless flow focusing and separation are integrated within a single microfluidic device and accomplished simultaneously. In this paper, we demonstrated two different particle size-resolution separations; (1) 3 µm and 10 µm and (2) 3 µm and 5 µm. Also, the effects of the input power, the flow rate, and particle concentration on the separation efficiency were investigated. These technologies have potential to impact broadly various areas including the essential microfluidic components for lab-on-a-chip system and integrated biological and biomedical applications.
