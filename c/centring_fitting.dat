40|$|The Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) {{has been}} {{developed}} specifically to enable the broadbased evaluation of hand function irrespective of the disability, thereby allowing assessment of both natural and prosthetic hands. This technique enables a contextual result to be formed (relative to normal hand ftxnction), hence providing a quantifiable index of functionality rather than the more conventional subjective measures. The establishment of normative data trials and subsequent statistical analysis demonstrates the procedure to be both reliable and r epeatable. The procedure has been undergoing evaluation at hand rehabilitation and prosthetic <b>fitting</b> <b>centres.</b> The subject group consists of those with impaired natural hand fimction (ranging fiom traumatic injury to diseased joints), as well as unilateral amputees and those with congenital deficiencies ofthe upper limb.

Quantification of functionality is of clinical importance to allow surgeons and therapists to monitor rehabilitation, and preliminary results suggest that the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure provides a critical contribution to this process...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis was undertaken of reports of possible pelvic infection {{in relation to}} the use of four commonly fitted intrauterine contraceptive devices during 1971 to 1978 in the United Kingdom. The four devices were the Dalkon shield, Lippes loops 3 C and 2 D, and the Gravigard (copper 7), and data used were those collected systematically through the UK intrauterine device research network. Prospective reports that the Dalkon shield was uniquely related to high levels of infection when compared with other intrauterine devices were not substantiated in this prospective study among 13 349 users. Though some factors such as social class and previous experience of abortion appeared to influence the rate of infection, the type of intrauterine device being worn {{did not appear to be}} a significant factor. Various methods of analysis were used including life table, regression, and discriminant analysis, using information relating to the type of intrauterine device worn, the characteristics of the user, the <b>fitting</b> <b>centre,</b> and the pattern of diagnosis and treatment of reported or suspected pelvic infection. The results of this study suggest that fears that the Dalkon shield may be associated with a higher incidence of pelvic infection than other intrauterine devices may have been unjustified...|$|R
40|$|Most {{lower limb}} amputations in the United Kingdom (UK) are camed out within general surgical, {{orthopaedic}} and plastic surgical units of district hospitals. This study of patients referred for rehabilitation was undertaken {{to determine the}} number and specialty interests of surgeons refemng amputees, the numbers referred by each and, as one of several possible measures of appropriateness for rehabilitation, the amputation levels in patients referred {{for the first time to}} one sub-regional Disablement Services (limb <b>fitting)</b> <b>Centre</b> (DSC) over a 14 month period. Thirty nine surgeons, referred 263 amputees. The majority (61 %) of surgeons referred 5 or fewer: a nucleus of 11 vascular surgeons (28 %) referred 64 % of the patients. The underlying pathology, speciality interest of the surgeon or numbers referred by individual surgeons had no relation to final healed level which was below the knee in 55 % of cases compared to national figures for all other DSC‘s ranging between 39 % and 48 % below-kneebetween 1981 and 1988. Since current practice in the UK is to refer all but the frailest patients for consideration of prosthetic rehabilitation, this study suggests that, nationally, more patients could be suited for the functionally superior below-knee level of amputation than are currently benefiting from it...|$|R
40|$|CERN {{has signed}} a Cooperation Agreement with the Department of Atomic Energy of India (DAE) in 1991, {{followed}} in 1996 by a Protocol for collaboration {{within the framework of}} the LHC project. The work by way of Indian in-kind contributions to the LHC was coordinated by the DAE, and was compensated by CERN through payments into the 'LHC India Fund'. These payments were calculated at the level of half of the estimated European value of the in-kind contributions received. The collaboration was highly successful and was extended in 2003. In the previous year India had been granted Observer Status by the CERN Council. As the LHC Project approaches completion, the collaborations under the 1996 Protocol and the 2003 Extension are now coming to an end. With India rapidly developing into one of the world's most active and advanced accelerator <b>centres,</b> it seems <b>fitting</b> that CERN and India should continue their collaborative efforts in other accelerator areas of mutual interest.

40|$|This {{investigation}} comprises {{a comparison}} of experimental and theoretical dechanneling of MeV protons in copper single crystals. Dechanneling results when an ion's transverse energy increases to the value where the ion can undergo small impact parameter collisions with individual atoms. Depth dependent dechanneling rates were determined as functions of lattice temperature, ion beam energy and crystal axis orientation. Ion beam energies were IMeV and 2 MeV,temperatures ranged from 35 K to 280 K and the experiment was carried out along both the (lOa) and < 110) axes. Experimental data {{took the form of}} aligned and random Rutherford backscattered energy spectra. Dechanneling rates were extracted from these spectra using a single scattering theory that took explicit account of the different stopping powers experienced by channeled and dechanneled ions and also included a correction factor to take into account multiple scattering effects along the ion's trajectory. The assumption of statistical equilibrium and small angle scattering of the channeled ions allows a description of dechanneling in terms of the solution of a diffusion like equation which contains a so called diffusion function. The diffusion function is shown {{to be related to the}} increase in average transverse energy. Theoretical treatments of increase in average transverse energy due to collisions of projectiles with channel electrons and thermal perturbations in the lattice potential are reviewed. Using the diffusion equation and the electron density in the channel <b>centre</b> as a <b>fitting</b> parameter dechanneling rates are extracted. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment has been demonstrated. Electron densities determined in the fitting procedure appear to be realistic. The surface parameters show themselves to be good indicators of the quality of the crystal...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Lower limb {{amputation}} is {{an increasingly}} prevalent surgical procedure in the Western world {{due to the}} increase of peripheral vascular disease. Not everyone who receives a prosthetic limb will benefit from its use and may abandon this expensive technology, a move which may negatively effect their adjustment to the amputation and also impact on their quality of life. There is currently no consensus {{on the most important}} outcomes to measure in lower limb prosthetic rehabilitation, or on the specific outcome measures to be consistently used in prosthetic rehabilitation. The aim of this research is to explore ways to optimise lower limb prosthetic prescription by identifying and gaining a consensus on 1) the most important outcomes of prescription, 2) the most important predictors of prosthetic use, and 3) the most important factors which have an effect on optimising use of the prosthesis. Method: This is a mixed methods study. Repertory grid interviews were conducted with 2 lower limb prosthesis users to explore the values and preferences that prosthetic users have of their prosthetic devices; to investigate users’ perceptions of alternative prosthetic options and to demonstrate a novel method for exploring the values and preferences of lower limb prosthetic users. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 12 multidisciplinary service-providers within the amputation rehabilitation setting, and 6 focus groups were completed with 24 prosthesis users to identify the outcomes and predictors of prosthetic prescription from both the patient and professional perspective. This data was then used to create a Delphi survey of 23 experts within the amputation and prosthetic field, including users, service providers and academics, to develop a consensus on the most important factors to address within the prosthetic prescription process. Findings: The repertory grid interviews highlighted the need to include patient choice and opinion in the prosthetic prescription process, while the focus groups and interviews identified the outcomes and predictors of prosthetic prescription while ascertaining what other factors affect optimal use of the prosthesis. These factors were physical, psychological and social in nature, and in particular, showed how service provision affects optimal use. A consensus on the most important factors to address in the fitting process and service was then established in the Delphi study. Conclusion: By combining user and practitioner knowledge throughout the study, this research has developed a list of the essential elements to be monitored and improved in prosthetic prescription to improve outcomes, as well as highlighting the importance of patient inclusion and choice within the rehabilitation setting. This research indicates how <b>fitting</b> <b>centres</b> can potentially improve the service with the hope of improving fitting rates and user satisfaction and reducing the waste of medical resources...|$|R
