Although these engines were not wholly <b>compression-ignition</b> derived, later in 1892 a prototype high-pressure version was built at Hornsby's, developed by Thomas Henry Barton OBE – later to be the founder of Nottingham's Barton Transport, whereby ignition was achieved solely (100%) through compression; it ran continuously for six hours, being the first known diesel engine. In the town, Hornsby's built Elsham House (the grounds became Grantham College) and the Shirley Croft. Their site on Houghton Road was bought from Lord Dysart.|$|E
25|$|Diesel fuel {{originated}} from experiments conducted by German scientist and inventor Rudolf Diesel for his <b>compression-ignition</b> engine he invented in 1892. Diesel originally designed his engine to use coal dust as fuel, and experimented with other fuels including vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, {{which was used}} to power the engines which he exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exposition and the 1911 World's Fair in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in Europe the {{motorized}} bicycle {{continued to}} be popular, particularly in France and Italy. An Italian manufacturer, Vincenti Piatti, designed a 50cc engine for driving portable lathes and this was also used to power a bicycle frame {{in the form of}} the Mini Motore. Piatti later licensed the design to Trojan for production in Britain as the Trojan Minimotor. In West Germany, a <b>compression-ignition</b> (diesel) engine kit using an 18cc variable head engine made by Lohmann was produced during the 1950s. In France, where postwar reconstruction, taxes, and fuel shortages limited automobile access, motorized bicycle kits and complete models were produced by a variety of smaller manufacturers, often using a two-stroke gasoline engine mounted above the front wheel. In 1946, production of the very successful French VELOSOLEX commenced, continuing until 1988. The VéloSoleX was a mass-produced motorized bicycle that used a tire roller (friction drive) to the front wheel. After French production ceased, the VELOSOLEX {{continued to be}} produced in China and Hungary. An in-wheel gasoline engine was used on the Honda P50 moped, which ceased production in 1968. The velomoteur and motor scooter enjoyed a second renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s as a new generation of youth discovered they could ride a motorized vehicle without need of a driver's license. Other countries had relaxed licensing requirements, e.g. lower age limits for motorized bicycles, which increased their popularity.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} into {{compression ignition engines}} and the burning of diesel heavy fuel in rotaries using spark ignition.

5000|$|... 1891: Herbert Akroyd Stuart {{built his}} oil engine, leasing rights to Hornsby of England to build them. They {{built the first}} cold-start <b>compression-ignition</b> engines.

50|$|A diesel {{generator}} {{is the combination}} of a diesel engine with an electric generator (often an alternator) to generate electrical energy. This is a specific case of engine-generator. A diesel <b>compression-ignition</b> engine is usually designed to run on diesel fuel, but some types are adapted for other liquid fuels or natural gas.|$|E
5000|$|Strong public {{reaction}} to the Concept One convinced the company that it should develop a production version which was launched as the New Beetle in 1997 for the 1998 model-year, based on the Golf IV's larger PQ34 platform. [...] The New Beetle {{is related to the}} original only in name and appearance (including the absence of a car emblem script {{with the exception of the}} VW logo). For the 1998 model year, only the TDI <b>compression-ignition</b> engine was turbocharged; the spark-ignition engines were only naturally aspirated. In June 1999, Volkswagen introduced the 1.8T, which was the first turbocharged spark-ignition engine offered for the New Beetle. Volkswagen created a web site dedicated specifically to the 1.8T. [...] A convertible was added for the 2003 model-year to replace the Volkswagen Cabrio. However, the New Beetle Convertible was never offered with a <b>compression-ignition</b> engine in North America.|$|E
50|$|A {{spark-ignition}} engine is an internal combustion engine, generally a petrol engine, where the combustion {{process of the}} air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from a spark plug. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>compression-ignition</b> engines, typically diesel engines, where the heat generated from compression together with the injection of fuel is enough to initiate the combustion process, without needing any external spark.|$|E

50|$|Extremely large {{gas engines}} were also built as blowing engines for blast furnaces, {{with one or}} two {{extremely}} large cylinders and powered by the burning of furnace gas. These, particularly those built by Körting, used double-acting cylinders. Gas engines require little or no compression of their charge, in comparison to petrol or <b>compression-ignition</b> engines, and so the double-acting cylinder designs were still adequate, despite their narrow, convoluted passageways.|$|E
50|$|From around 1910, {{the diesel}} engine was {{improved}} dramatically, with more power being available at greater efficiencies than the hot bulb engine could manage. Diesel engines can achieve over 50% efficiency if designed with maximum economy in mind, and they offered greater power {{for a given}} engine size due to the more efficient combustion method. They had no hot bulb, relying purely on <b>compression-ignition,</b> and offered greater ease of use, as they required no pre-heating.|$|E
50|$|Wilksch Airmotive Ltd is a UK-based {{company which}} designs and {{manufactures}} <b>compression-ignition</b> engines for light aircraft. Wilksch engines run on jet fuel, which is cheaper and more widely available than avgas. The company, founded in 1994, manufactures two-stroke compression ignition engines.

5000|$|During the 1930s {{a number}} of LW-series engines (usually 4LWs, but {{occasionally}} 6LWs) were installed in large luxury cars including Lagondas, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces. The Gardner engine's reliability and economy (tests showed that even a two-ton Bentley could achieve 30 miles per gallon of fuel while having {{a top speed of}} 80 mph), coupled to its remarkable refinement and smooth running abilities, made it the only suitable <b>compression-ignition</b> engine at the time ...|$|E
50|$|He joined Hornsbys in 1895 as Chief Engineer, and Works Manager, {{having been}} {{knowledgeable}} of Hornsbys {{development of the}} <b>compression-ignition</b> heavy oil engine and the worldwide engineering potential of it. He became general manager, then managing director in 1904 (until 1918). Whilst at Hornsbys, their manufacturing area grew from 16 acre to 80 acre. From 1918-20, he was Joint managing director of Ruston & Hornsby Ltd, retiring in 1920. He was Vice-President of Grantham Liberal Club on London Road.|$|E
50|$|Diesel fuel flash points vary between 52 and 96 C. Diesel is {{suitable}} {{for use in a}} <b>compression-ignition</b> engine. Air is compressed until it has been heated above the autoignition temperature of the fuel, which is then injected as a high-pressure spray, keeping the fuel-air mix within flammable limits. In a diesel-fueled engine, there is no ignition source (such as the spark plugs in a gasoline engine). Consequently, diesel fuel must have a high flash point and a low autoignition temperature.|$|E
50|$|Diesel fuel {{is named}} after diesel engines, and not vice versa; diesel engines are simply <b>compression-ignition</b> engines, and can operate {{on a variety of}} {{different}} fuels, depending on configuration and location. Where a gas grid connection is available, gas is often used, as the gas grid will remain pressurized during almost all power cuts. This is implemented by introducing gas with the intake air and using a small amount of diesel fuel for ignition. Conversion to 100% diesel fuel operation can be achieved instantaneously.|$|E

50|$|NOx sensors are {{extremely}} expensive {{and are in}} general used only when a <b>compression-ignition</b> engine is fitted with a selective catalytic-reduction (SCR) converter, or a NOx absorber catalyst in a feedback system. When fitted to an SCR system, there may be one or two sensors. When one sensor is fitted it will be pre-catalyst; when two are fitted, the second one will be post-catalyst. They are used {{for the same reasons}} and {{in the same manner as}} an oxygen sensor; the only difference is the substance being monitored.|$|E
50|$|SM31 is a Co-Co locomotive, what {{means it}} runs on two bogies, each {{equipped}} with three axles. Bogies {{are similar in}} construction to those used in SU45 and SU46 locomotives. This gives SM31 locomotive good performance on highland tracks. Being a typical shunter, SM31 has one crew compartment of the same height as machine and electric compartments.The engine (V8 <b>compression-ignition</b> engine) {{is in fact a}} developed version of SM42 locomotive engine, with its total power raised by ca. 50%. The engine propels main alternator, which gives power to six 196 kW traction motors.|$|E
5000|$|Internal {{combustion}} (IC) {{engines are}} also available in upscale (and up-price) configurations. Variations include engines with multiple-cylinders, spark-ignited gasoline operation, and carbureted diesel operation. The term [...] "diesel" [...] {{is in fact a}} misnomer, as such engines actually operate by <b>compression-ignition.</b> The compression-ratio is controlled by an adjustable threaded T screw on the cylinder head, bearing onto a contra piston within the cylinder bore. Diesels are preferred for endurance competition, because of their fuel's higher energy content, a mixture of ether and kerosene (with lubricating oil). They have higher torque, and for a given capacity, they can usually [...] "swing" [...] a larger propeller than a glow engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{reciprocating}} engine, {{also often}} {{known as a}} piston engine, is typically a heat engine (although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a <b>compression-ignition</b> (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Partially {{premixed}} combustion (PPC), {{also known}} as PPCI (partially-premixed compression ignition) or GDCI (gasoline direct-injection <b>compression-ignition)</b> [...] is a modern combustion process intended {{to be used in}} internal combustion engines of automobiles and other motorized vehicles in the future. Its high specific power, high fuel efficiency and low exhaust pollution have made it a promising technology. A PPC engine injects and premixes a charge during compression stroke. Thus premixed charge is too lean to ignite during the compression stroke. The charge will ignite after the last fuel injection ends near TDC. The fuel efficiency and working principle of a PPC engine resemble those of Diesel engine, but the PPC engine can be run with a variety of fuels. Also the partially premixed charge burns clean.|$|E
