5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
5|$|When Broccoli and Saltzman {{bought the}} rights to {{existing}} and future Fleming titles, it did not include Casino Royale, which had already been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff, with the story having been adapted for television in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights were passed on to Charles K. Feldman, who subsequently produced the satirical Bond spoof Casino Royale in 1967. A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel Thunderball were held by Kevin McClory as he, Fleming and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had written a film script upon which the novel was based. Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce Thunderball, McClory still retained {{the rights to}} the story and adapted Thunderball into 1983's Never Say Never Again.

5|$|Feathers {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups. Based on the <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> of fossil evidence, it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait, though one that may have been selectively lost in some species. Direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather-like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non-avian dinosaur groups, both among saurischians and ornithischians. Simple, branched, feather-like structures are known from heterodontosaurids, primitive neornithischians and theropods, and primitive ceratopsians. Evidence for true, vaned feathers similar to the flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in the theropod subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Feather-like structures known as pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaurs, suggesting the possibility that feather-like filaments may have been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaurs themselves. Research into the genetics of American alligators has also revealed that crocodylian scutes do possess feather-keratins during embryonic development, but these keratins are not expressed by the animals before hatching.|$|E
5|$|The bell frog's <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> now {{ranges from}} Byron Bay, in {{northern}} New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria; populations mostly occur along the coast. In New South Wales, it has declined severely in range and abundance since the 1960s, although no similar declines {{have been reported}} in Victoria. In New South Wales, it has disappeared from highland areas above , except for a population in Captains Flat. A study of populations along coastal New South Wales indicated many populations were very small, usually of fewer than 20 adults. According to a 1996 study, six populations of more than 300 frogs are known: two in the Sydney metropolitan area, two in the Shoalhaven, and two in the New South Wales mid-north coast. There are now approximately only 40 sites in total where it is found, most of which are in the Sydney area. The green and golden bell frog has disappeared from an estimated 90% of its former range. Some specimens were apparently found in Armidale, {{but it turned out to}} be a misidentification of L. castanea. The declines in Victoria have been more modest and mostly in at inland areas where habitats have disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider is {{widespread}} across Australia. The <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> {{reported by the}} World Spider Catalogue includes Southeast Asia and New Zealand. Colonies and individuals have been found elsewhere, including England, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. It was believed at one time that the redback may have been introduced to Australia, because {{when it was first}} formally described in 1870, it appeared to be concentrated around sea ports. However, an earlier informal description (1850) from the Adelaide Hills is now known, and names in Australian Aboriginal languages also show that it was present well before European settlement. Its original range is thought to be a relatively small arid part of South Australia and Western Australia. Its spread has been inadvertently aided by modern buildings, which often provide habitats conducive to redback populations. The close relationship between the redback and the New Zealand katipo also supports the native status of both in their respective countries.|$|E

Due to its relative simplicity the study of the cylindrical dipole is quite complete, but owning to the degree of complexity, progress in the theory of the loop has been slower. In recent years the isolated circular loop antenna of arbitrary size {{has been the subject of}} mathematical and experimental analysis [7 [, [6]. It was not until 1970 that the first complete and general mathematical solution for the mutual admittance of two arbitrary size coaxial circular loop antennas was published.

However, for yet larger conductors numerical solutions are required which solve for the conductor's <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> (rather than assuming a sinusoidal pattern). This can be based on approximating solutions for either Pocklington's integrodifferential equation or the Hallén integral equation. These approaches also have greater generality, not being limited to linear conductors.|$|E

This single-frequency method and {{the concepts of}} physical bounds on antenna parameters and optimum <b>current</b> <b>distributions</b> are applied to different analysis and design situations of two-dimensional and three-dimensional radiating structures (i. e., antennas).

Antenna performance is compared with physical bounds or optimum-current performance in the situations studied. The results presented in this thesis suggest that single-frequency methods may reduce the time necessary to optimize automatically, e. g., using a computer, some antenna parameters such as bandwidth. Furthermore, physical bounds and optimum <b>current</b> <b>distributions</b> are tools that provide valuable information for the processes of antenna analysis and design...|$|R

25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found <b>current</b> <b>distribution.</b> In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{simulating}} voltage and <b>current</b> <b>distributions</b> in transmission lines is described. It gives the time domain {{solution of the}} terminal voltage and current {{as well as their}} line distributions. This is achieved by treating voltage and <b>current</b> <b>distributions</b> as distributed state variables (DSVs) and turning the transmission line equation into an ordinary differential equation. Thus the transmission line is treated like other lumped dynamic components, such as capacitors. Using backward differentiation formulae for time discretization, the DSV transmission line component is converted to a simple time domain companion model, from which its local truncation error can be derived. As the voltage and <b>current</b> <b>distributions</b> get more complicated with time, a new piecewise exponential with controllable accuracy is invented. A segmentation algorithm is also devised so that the line is dynamically bisected to guarantee that the total piecewise exponential error is {{a small fraction of the}} local truncation error. Using this approach, the user can see the line voltage and current at any point and time freely without explicitly segmenting the line before starting the simulation...|$|R

25|$|The family Stangeriaceae (named for Dr. William Stanger, 18111854), {{consisting}} {{of only three}} extant species, {{is thought to be}} of Gondwanan origin, as fossils have been found in Lower Cretaceous deposits in Argentina, dating to 70135mya. The family Zamiaceae is more diverse, with a fossil record extending from the middle Triassic to the Eocene (54200mya) in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Antarctica, implying the family was present before the break-up of Pangea. The family Cycadaceae is thought to be an early offshoot from other cycads, with fossils from Eocene deposits (3854mya) in Japan, China, and North America, indicating this family originated in Laurasia. Cycas is the only genus in the family and contains 99species, the most of any cycad genus. Molecular data have recently shown Cycas species in Australasia and the east coast of Africa are recent arrivals, suggesting adaptive radiation may have occurred. The <b>current</b> <b>distribution</b> of cycads may be due to radiations from a few ancestral types sequestered on Laurasia and Gondwana, or could be explained by genetic drift following the separation of already evolved genera. Both explanations account for the strict endemism across present continental lines.|$|E
