50|$|The early Tandy 1000's used a {{non-standard}} card-edge parallel {{printer port}} rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port. It required a Tandy-1000 <b>compatible</b> <b>printer</b> cable {{to connect to}} a standard printer parallel port.|$|E
50|$|As it {{was meant}} for the home market, it had a built in {{television}} RF modulator as well as RGB output and was meant {{to work with a}} basic audio tape recorder to save and load data. Error-checking of recorded programs was bugged, frequently causing user-created programs to fail when loaded back in.An additional feature was a Centronics <b>compatible</b> <b>printer</b> interface.|$|E
50|$|All models use Secure Digital (SD) or Multi Media Card (MMC). They {{come with}} a small amount of {{internal}} memory and are not bundled with a memory card. Many Exilim cameras {{come with a}} bundled charging and docking cradle. The cradle is used to recharge the camera's battery and to connect the camera to a PC or PictBridge <b>compatible</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common <b>compatible</b> <b>printers</b> were {{manufactured}} by Epson, Panasonic, Okidata, Star Micronics, and C. Itoh.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the DOS 5.0 version was its Type-Through feature. It allowed a user with certain <b>compatible</b> <b>printers</b> to use Word Perfect as a conventional typewriter. This functionality was removed in the DOS 5.1 version.|$|R
50|$|All {{printers}} {{with the}} right type of connector are compatible with all print servers; manufacturers of servers make available lists of <b>compatible</b> <b>printers</b> because a server may not implement all the communications functionality of a printer (e.g. low ink signal).|$|R
5000|$|At launch, twelve {{printers}} were AirPrint compatible, all of {{them from}} the HP Photosmart Plus e-All-in-One series. As of July 2014, that number had grown to about 1,100 <b>compatible</b> <b>printer</b> models from two dozen different manufacturers. The current list can be found on Apple's support site. The related technology is covered by US patent no. 20110194123, [...] "Printer that supports driverless printing".|$|E
50|$|Its {{hardware}} features included a dot-matrix display of {{two rows of}} 22 characters. Depending on context, either the top row was used to display the current expression or a message, or the bottom row was used to show menu options, which could be selected with the corresponding keys. An infra-red transmitter was also included, allowing the machine {{to be used with}} a <b>compatible</b> <b>printer,</b> such as the HP 82240B. A beeper could be used to sound date/time alarms.|$|E
50|$|The MXB-1 Memory Expansion Board was {{designed}} {{by a member of}} the VDUEB Users' Club. The MXB-1 contained space for extra EPROMs, an optional battery backed real time clock, a centronics <b>compatible</b> <b>printer</b> interface and address decoding for up to 192kB of RAM. The extra RAM was installed by replacing the standard 4116 16k × 1 bit RAM chips with 4164 64k × 1 bit RAM chips. The CPU's 64kB address limit was worked around through bank switching. The MXB-1 was mostly of benefit to users running the CP/M disk operating system, since CP/M could then have a full 64kB of RAM for programs, with up to 128kB being used as a small RAM disk.|$|E
50|$|The LaserJet 4 {{series was}} {{discontinued}} in the 1990s, and Hewlett Packard recommended the HP LaserJet 5 series {{as a replacement}} for the 4 series. However the driver for the HP LaserJet 4 exists in most, even older, software products and is a popular substitute driver for other PCL <b>compatible</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The driver Ultra LQ was {{developed}} for better printing at Epson <b>compatible</b> <b>printers,</b> it prints the letters in the matrix of 16 by 24 points instead of original 8 by 12 points. The driver Ultra BT for better printing at BT100 printer existed too. These drivers were distributed as independent software packages.|$|R
5000|$|The TI-95, {{also called}} the TI-95 Procalc, is a {{keystroke}} programmable calculator and was introduced in 1987 by Texas Instruments. It was rather large, measuring 3.7" [...] by 8" [...] by 1" [...] and had a dot-matrix display. It had 8kB of RAM and could be connected to PC-324 <b>compatible</b> <b>printers.</b> <b>Compatible</b> ROM and extra RAM could {{be placed in the}} expansion slot at the upper right corner of the device. The compatible ROM were labeled Mathematics, Statistics, and Chemistry, indicating their respective applications.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the back}} of the device you could also find an eight-pin DIN {{connector}} for a cassette recorder with which you could load programs at 2400 bit/s. Then two connectors for video output, an RCA connector RF output and an eight-pins DIN connector that could output NTSC or RGB video. The JR-200UP variant outputs composite PAL and RGB. Two other connectors provided a centronics <b>compatible</b> <b>printer</b> port, (supported by Basic with LPRINT, LLIST and HCOPY, a [...] "screen dump" [...] command) and an expansion interface port. The expansion port connector also had signal lines for an RS232 serial connection which Basic supported with several commands, but its main use was to connect a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive.|$|E

40|$|At present IIASA {{offers to}} its {{scientific}} community {{a set of}} basic, but limited computer graphics capabilities. Recent computer-program development in the graphics area has created greater demand and more awareness of the possibilities of computer graphics as a visualization tool in modeling. Some other application fields, like the use of graphics {{as a tool for}} program development, were still not touched at IIASA. In response to this demand, IIASA decided to order additional graphics hardware (display terminals and graphics <b>compatible</b> <b>printers)</b> and to invest a certain amount of resources into the generation of appropriate software. It is not the aim of this paper to discuss the benefits of graphics, but rather to identify the general graphics software requirements for IIASA and to propose a possible way of meeting them...|$|R

Vendors soon released <b>printers</b> <b>compatible</b> with both standard Centronics and the IBM implementation.|$|R
5000|$|Many printer {{manufacturers}} {{claim that}} if any ink cartridges, beyond those sold by themselves, {{are used in the}} printer, the warranty of the printer becomes void. Lexmark goes further, making ink cartridges that contain an authentication system, the purpose of which is to make it illegal in the United States (under the DMCA) for a competitor to make an ink cartridge <b>compatible</b> with Lexmark <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Non-GDI {{printers}} require hardware, firmware, {{and memory}} for page rendering; a GDI printer uses the host computer for this, making it cheaper to manufacture than a similar non-GDI printer. Some manufacturers produce {{essentially the same}} printer in a version <b>compatible</b> with a <b>printer</b> control language such as PCL or PostScript, and a cheaper GDI-only version. In most cases only the very lowest-cost models in any given manufacturer's range support only GDI.|$|R
