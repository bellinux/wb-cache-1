40|$|Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) is an {{alternative}} to flat-plate module photovoltaic (PV) technology. The bankability of CPV projects {{is an important issue}} to pave the way toward a swift and sustained growth in this technology. The bankability of a PV plant is generally addressed through the modeling of its energy yield under a baseline loss scenario, followed by an on-site measurement campaign aimed at verifying its energy performance. This paper proposes a procedure for assessing the performance of a CPV project, articulated around four main successive steps: Solar Resource Assessment, Yield Assessment, <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Provisional <b>Acceptance,</b> and <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Final <b>Acceptance.</b> This methodology allows the long-term energy production of a CPV project to be estimated with an associated uncertainty of ≈ 5 %. To our knowledge, no such method has been proposed to the CPV industry yet, and this critical situation has hindered or made impossible the completion of several important CPV projects undertaken in the world. The main motive for this proposed method is to bring a practical solution to this urgent problem. This procedure can be operated under a wide range of climatic conditions, and makes it possible to assess the bankability of a CPV plant whose design uses any of the technologies currently available on the market. The method is also compliant with both international standards and local regulations. In consequence, its applicability is both general and international...|$|R

Quelled by this latest disaster, Mona calls Mourad, who has been {{sitting on the front}} lawn for days awaiting her return. He promises her a new start in a different city where they can adopt children, but Mona sees the fallacy of a life in which her mother-in-law's death will always cast a shadow on their marriage. She tells Mourad that she is coming back to Chicago to turn herself in, but not before giving one last thank you to Marilyn.

50|$|On October 26, 2015, Duterte {{said in an}} {{interview}} that his deadline for deciding whether to seek the presidency was December 10. He also warned the people to abide by the law if he wins. On October 27, PDP-Laban has made it official that Duterte will substitute as the party's presidential bet if aspirant Martin Diño withdraws or is disqualified by the Commission of Elections (Comelec) from the 2016 race. Two days later, PDP-Laban standard bearer Martin Diño withdrew his presidential bid and named Duterte as his substitute because there was a possibility that Diño might be declared a nuisance candidate by the COMELEC. On October 30, an alleged campaign video of Duterte and Cayetano circulated on social media that put hopes on Duterte's candidacy as Cayetano's running mate. However, Duterte's aide Bong Go said in {{an interview}} that Duterte's mind had not changed yet but that he would continue soul-searching with his family to know if he would run in the upcoming elections. On November 1, Duterte said that nothing had changed and he was not fit for national office. He also said that he was still waiting for a communication from his party about his possible candidacy; Duterte would also wait if his daughter would agree to substitute for him at the mayoral race of Davao and he would retire from public service if Sara agreed to do so. On November 2, Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) executive Arwin Serrano said that Diño was deemed to face an election sabotage complaint because of proposing Duterte as his substitute for him; however, Diño denied the allegations that his filing of candidacy was just a front to pave the way for Duterte's possible substitution. In an interview with Comelec chairman Andres D. Bautista on November 3, he stated that although they have noted Diño's withdrawal, they would not move with any further action with regard to a possible substitution until they had Duterte's consent and unless it would be made official with a COC and a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> nomination and <b>acceptance</b> from PDP-Laban.
