40|$|Abstract—Power {{consumption}} of a multi-GHz local <b>clock</b> <b>driver</b> {{is reduced by}} returning energy stored in the clock-tree load capacitance back to the on-chip power-distribution grid. We call this type of return energy recycling. To achieve a nearly square clock waveform, the energy is transferred in a non-resonant way using an on-chip inductor in a configuration resembling a full-bridge DC-DC converter. A zero-voltage switching technique is implemented in the <b>clock</b> <b>driver</b> to reduce dynamic power loss associated with the high switching frequencies. A prototype implemented in 90 nm CMOS shows a power savings of 35 % at 4 GHz. The area needed for the inductor in this new <b>clock</b> <b>driver</b> is about 6 % of a local clock region.

40|$|Abstract—Large digital chips use a {{significant}} amount of energy to broadcast a low-skew, multigigahertz clock to millions of latches located throughout the chip. Every clock cycle, the large aggregate capacitance of the clock network is charged from the supply and then discharged to ground. Instead of wasting this stored energy, it is possible to recycle the energy by controlling its delivery {{to another part of the}} chip using an on-chip dc–dc converter. The <b>clock</b> <b>driver</b> and switching converter circuits share many compatible characteristics that allow them to be merged into a single design and fully integrated on-chip. Our buck converter prototype, manufactured in 90 -nm CMOS, provides a proof-of-concept that clock network energy can be recycled to other parts of the chip, thus lowering overall energy consumption. It also confirms that monolithic multigigahertz switching converters utilizing zero-voltage switching can be implemented in deep-submicrometer CMOS. With multigigahertz operation, fully integrated inductors and capacitors use a small amount of chip area with low losses. Combining the <b>clock</b> <b>driver</b> with the power converter can share the large MOSFET drivers necessary as well as being energy and space efficient. We present an analysis of the losses which we confirm by experimentally comparing the merged circuit with a conventional <b>clock</b> <b>driver.</b> Index Terms—Charge recycling, energy recovery, energy recycling, integrated clock/converter, integrated dc–dc converter, integrated output filter, multigigahertz clock, switching dc–dc converter.

These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower <b>clock</b> <b>drivers.</b> Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|E

40|$|Large digital chips use a {{significant}} amount of energy to distribute a multi-GHz clock. By discharging the clock network to ground every cycle, the energy stored in this large capacitor is wasted. Instead, the energy can be recovered using an on-chip DC-DC converter. This paper investigates the integration of two DC-DC converter topologies, boost and buck-boost, with a high-speed <b>clock</b> <b>driver.</b> The high operating frequency significantly shrinks the required size of the L and C components so they can be placed on-chip; typical converters place them off-chip.

To achieve voltage regulation, the clock duty cycle must be modulated; implying only single-edge-triggered flops should be used. However, this minor drawback is eclipsed by the benefits: by recovering energy from the clock, the output power can actually exceed the additional power needed to operate the converter circuitry, resulting in an effective efficiency greater than 100 %. Furthermore, the converter output can be used to operate additional power-saving features like low-voltage islands or body bias voltages. 1...|$|R

To address this question in cyanobacteria, we used a synthetic biology approach to make normally autotrophic cells capable of growth on exogenous sugar. This allowed us to manipulate metabolism independently from light and dark. We found that feeding sugar to cultures blocked the clock-resetting effect of a dark pulse.
