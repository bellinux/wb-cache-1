40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of flap interaction noise to variations in engine-under-the-wing externally blown flap geometry was investigated {{with a large}} cold-flow model. Both 2 - and 3 -flap wing sections (7 -ft chord) with trailing flap angles up to 60 deg were employed. Exhaust nozzles included <b>coaxial,</b> <b>plug,</b> and 8 - and 13 -inch diameter conical configurations. These nozzles were tested at two positions below the wing. The effects of these geometry variations on noise level, directivity, and spectral shape are summarized in terms of exhaust flow parameters evaluated at the nozzle exit and at the flap impingement station. The results are also compared with limited flap noise data available from tests using real engines...|$|E

30|$|The single SiNW {{devices were}} {{electrically}} characterized at various temperature ranging from 100 to 300  K; the measurements were {{performed in a}} thermally controlled environment (Janis ST- 100 H cryostat) consisting of a cold finger column inserted in a vacuum chamber. The samples were mounted on the holder {{at the end of}} the cold finger, and a thin Kapton film (12.5  μm) was placed between the samples and the holder to ensure electrical insulation of the circuit while providing a good thermal contact. The vacuum chamber was connected to a scroll pump (Varian SH- 100) and to a turbo-molecular pump (Alcatel ATP 80), leading to a residual pressure around 10 − 5 mbar. The value of temperature was acquired with a platinum Pt- 100 resistor embedded into the cold finger, while a controller (Lake-Shore 331), coupled with a heater and a liquid nitrogen transfer-line, tuned the temperature to the set-point value. Kapton-covered cables inside the chamber provided electrical wiring of the samples to external <b>coaxial</b> <b>plugs.</b> We used a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp SourceMeter with remote preamplifier for electrical measurement; external noises were minimized using a short triaxial cable connected to the <b>coaxial</b> <b>plugs</b> of the cryostat through a specific adapter. The SourceMeter system provides three signal terminals, namely Hi and Low terminals for the electrical measurement and the Guard terminal for the guard ring circuit. The two main signals were connected to the probe pads of the single SiNW devices, while the guard terminal was bonded to the backside of the samples to avoid any current leakage in the substrate.|$|R
50|$|The DC120 {{required}} 6 to 6.8 volts DC power, {{supplied by}} four AA-size 1.7 V lithium primary cells. Although nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) 1.25 V or nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) 1.2 V cells could be used, {{due to their}} lower capacity and discharge characteristics {{they needed to be}} replaced frequently — every 20 to 30 pictures, or so. Ordinary alkaline or carbon-zinc primary cells could be used for daylight photography and during storage to keep the camera's internal clock running and preserve settings, but they had excessive internal resistance and insufficient current capacity to power the camera when the photo flash was in use. An optional external AC adapter could also be used, supplying 7-8 VDC via a <b>coaxial</b> power <b>plug,</b> for transferring pictures to a computer or for fixed use indoors.|$|R
500|$|The first EyeTV {{hardware}} device {{was introduced in}} November 2002. It was a small USB-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer. It also had <b>coaxial</b> and RCA <b>plugs</b> to connect it with a VCR or camcorder. A 2002 article in Macworld {{said it was the}} [...] "first step" [...] in bridging computers and television, but at this point still had [...] "some kinks".|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the noise {{generated}} by inverted-velocity-profile <b>coaxial</b> (without center <b>plug)</b> and coannular (with center plug) nozzles should be modeled as the combined contributions of various source regions and noise generation mechanisms. In this paper, an empirical noise-prediction model is described which considers the noise generated by two jet-mixing regions and two potential regions of shock/turbulence interaction. Results calculated from the empirical model are compared with model-scale experimental data for static and simulated flight conditions. These comparisons are made for cases where both streams are subsonic, where the outer stream is supersonic with the inner stream subsonic, and where both streams are supersonic. The cases considered cover a range of inner-to-outer-stream area ratios and include both coaxial and coannular nozzles. It is shown that the model gives reasonable predictions of absolute noise spectra and even better predictions of incremental changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a coaxial high-frequency plug-in connector for connecting {{a large number}} of coaxial lines, whereby the plug-in terminals of the coaxial lines are placed directly adjacent to each other in a row and are surrounded by a common housing. Each individual coaxial line is connected to a base housing, whereby the base housing is in turn situated in common intermediate carriers. The intermediate carrier is surrounded by the overall housing. In the intermediate carrier itself or in the intermediate carrier together with the overall housing, there are apertures and recesses which serve to bear the base housing, whereby the base housing can be moved in the recesses or apertures. As a result of the electrically conducting design of the walls of the apertures or recesses, a high-frequency-tight chamber is formed for connecting <b>coaxial</b> lines and <b>plugs.</b> All parts of the coaxial high-frequency plug-in connector are designed to enable an automatic and machine assembly. In additi on, the coaxial high-frequency plug-in connector for {{a large number of}} coaxial lines has a particularly small pitch between the signal lines for assembling the individual coaxial lines...|$|R
