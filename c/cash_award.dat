5|$|Skyscraper Museum {{director}} Carol Willis, and art consultant Franck Mercurio, {{curator at}} the Field Museum in Chicago, offer moderating modern views {{about the influence of}} Saarinen's design. Willis notes that setback architecture was being implemented in New York City highrises because of 1916 zoning ordinances related to building height and sunlight, and that Saarinen's design was understood to be an embodiment of this trend. Mercurio points to the Tribune Tower competition entry from American architect Bertram Goodhue as having the same modernist features as Saarinen's, with dramatic setbacks but a more pronounced simplification of the exterior. Mercurio argues that Goodhue's design is a better example of modernism because it has less ornamentation. Goodhue's entry gained him honorable mention but no <b>cash</b> <b>award.</b>|$|E
