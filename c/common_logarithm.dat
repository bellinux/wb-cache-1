For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} <b>common</b> <b>logarithm</b> of ratios—10 times the <b>common</b> <b>logarithm</b> of a power ratio or 20 times the <b>common</b> <b>logarithm</b> of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

MethodsHepG 2. 2. 15 {{cells were cultured in}} vitro, and the culture supernatants of HepG 2. 2. 15 in each well were collected. HBV particles were obtained by ultracentrifugation, and HBV DNA concentration was measured by fluorescent-probe PCR. pDCs (on day 7 of culture) and HBV (1 × 105 copies/ml, 1 × 106 copies/ml, 1 × 107 copies/ml, and blank control) were co-cultured for 24 hours, and then cultured continuously for another 24 hours with CpG ODN 2216 at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. The mRNA expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7 in pDCs was measured by real-time PCR, the protein expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7 in pDCs was measured by Western blot, and the level of IFNα was measured by ELISA. The analysis of variance was used for comparison of continuous data between multiple groups, and the SNK-q test was used for comparison between any two groups; the <b>common</b> <b>logarithms</b> of HBV DNA copies were obtained, and the linear regression analysis was performed to {{investigate the}} correlation between related indicators and the <b>common</b> <b>logarithms</b> of HBV DNA copies. ResultsCompared with the blank control group and the HBV 1 × 105 copies/ml group, the HBV 1 × 106 copies/ml and HBV 1 × 107 copies/ml groups had significantly lower mRNA expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7, significantly lower protein expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7, and significantly lower expression of IFNα (all P＜ 0. 05). The inhibitory effects of HBV on the mRNA expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7, the protein expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7, and the expression of IFNα in the culture supernatants of pDCs rose with the increasing HBV DNA load (r=- 0. 729, - 0  761,- 0. 657,- 0  703 ， and - 0. 803, all P＜ 0. 05). ConclusionAfter in vitro treatment with HBV, the mRNA and protein expression of TLR 9 and IRF- 7 in normal pDCs is reduced, leading to reduced secretion of downstream IFNα. HBV can inhibit the function of normal pDCs and cause persistent HBV infection...|$|R
