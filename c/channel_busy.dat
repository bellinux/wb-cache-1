If the channel is found busy during the DIFS interval, the station defers its transmission. In a network where a number of stations contend for the wireless medium, if multiple stations sense the <b>channel</b> <b>busy</b> and defer their access, they will also virtually simultaneously find that the channel is released {{and then try to}} seize the channel. As a result, collisions may occur. In order to avoid such collisions, DCF also specifies random backoff, which forces a station to defer its access to the channel for an extra period. The length of the backoff period is determined by the following equation: ...|$|E

30|$|A contention-based, hardware-constrained {{cognitive}} MAC protocol (HC-MAC) {{is presented}} in [23] that incorporates sensing/stopping process and considers transmission constraints before sensing, thereby reducing the sensing time when the sensed spectrum fulfills the requirements of SUs in CRN. The drawback is that due to a single radio and absence of synchronization, multiple channel hidden terminals can cause collisions during the transmissions. In [24], fairness-oriented media access control protocol (FMAC) is proposed to bring fairness in access among the contending SUs of different CRNs by introducing three state spectrum sensing model. Here, <b>channel</b> <b>busy</b> state is further classified into <b>channel</b> <b>busy</b> by PU or <b>channel</b> <b>busy</b> by SU of other CRN. The proposed sensing algorithm can distinguish between the two busy states. Contention-based multichannel MAC (CBM-M) protocol for a distributed CRN separates the sensing mechanism from SUs by placing separate sensor nodes [25]. Accuracy in the sensing mechanism during PU reappearance for non-slotted CRN has been emphasized in [26].|$|E

3000|$|Topologies {{belonging}} to this category {{do not have}} any of the interference interactions as connected. Placement of flow Bb within the carrier sensing range of flow Aa is possible within a large area of carrier sensing range. Therefore, the distances d(A,B),d(a,B),d(A,b), and d(a,b) can be as small as slightly greater than transmission range and as large as exactly equal to carrier sensing range (which is ≈ 2.7 times the transmission range) or even outside carrier sensing range. The throughput of the two flows under this category is driven by the fact that frames transmitted by an interferer from closer location within carrier sensing range are sensed as busy periods. On the other hand, the frames transmitted by the interferer at relatively distant location within carrier sensing range may cause errors but otherwise can be rejected as interference, without making the <b>channel</b> <b>busy.</b> Keeping this in view, the MAC behavior can be divided into two parts. The first part comprises of region where a node can sense the frame transmission from other node as busy period.
