In {{order to}} improve the {{reflection}} coefficient of nickel electroforming layer with microprism structure effectively, controlling electroforming process strictly and adjusting different process parameters are needed for achieve the best electroforming effect. Nickel <b>casting</b> <b>layer</b> was prepared by ultrasonic direct current electroforming on the microprism nickel plate. Surface reflective coefficient of nickel <b>casting</b> <b>layer</b> was measured by retroreflectometer, and the morphology was observed by 3 D laser scanning microscopy system. The effects of ultrasonic power, frequency and average current density on the surface reflective performance were studied, experimental results were verified by measuring microprism side surface roughness. The results show that reflective coefficient of nickel <b>casting</b> <b>layer</b> prepared by high frequency ultrasonic electroforming was greater than that by low frequency with other experimental conditions remaining unchanged. It was increased first and then decreased with ultrasonic power and average current density increasing gradually, and the surface roughness measurement also verified this conclusion...|$|E

This paper seeks to propose suitable testing methods {{that can be}} used to assess the effect of delays between successive lifts on interfacial bond strength of hardened material, including the proposal of time limits necessary to ensure proper mixing of <b>cast</b> <b>layers.</b> Two methods for testing bond by slant shear and pull-off are tested and compared. The SCC mixtures were proportioned to exhibit low to high thixotropic levels, while the relative delay between <b>cast</b> <b>layers</b> was set to 30, 60, and 120 min after initial mixing. Test results have shown that the lowest drop in interfacial bond strength occurred for moderately thixotropic mixtures, given the moderate bleeding rate that prevented dryness of the first <b>cast</b> <b>layer</b> while, at the same time, avoided excessive increase in water that reduces bond strength development along the interfaces.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{innovative}} route for {{the preparation of}} asymmetric structures by combining the tape and freeze casting methods A perovskite oxide ceramic based on BSCF (Ba 0. 5 S 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 -delta) {{was chosen as the}} mother material. BSCF freeze cast substrates showed highly ordered and interconnected pores networks with open porosity from 66 % to 79 %. The top layer for the tape cast was altered by doping BSCF with Zr, thus forming a slightly different compound BSCFZ. The BSCFZ slurries containing 1. 0 wt% dispersant and pH > 6 were characterised by pseudoplastic behaviour, ideal for the preparation of tape <b>cast</b> <b>layers.</b> Coupling the BSCF freeze cast substrate with the BCSFZ tape <b>cast</b> green top <b>layer</b> to make asymmetric structures was achieved by the pre-sintering of the substrate between 900 and 1050 degrees C. This allowed for the densification and coupling of the BSCFZ top layer, resulting in suitable adhesion with no cracks or delamination. Higher pre-sintering temperatures than 1050 degrees C limited the densification of the BSCFZ top layer as the coefficient of expansion between the substrate and top layer did not match, leading to the formation of surfaces with high porosity.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{physical}} and mechanical properties of plaster of Paris (POP) bandage cast used as a splinting and casting materials. Materials and Methods: POP casts were divided into three Groups A, B and C with 2, 3 and 8 layer for POP bandage, respectively (n= 6 in each group). Handling characters, technical easiness or difficulties, setting time, weight, diameter and thickness of the casts were recorded for different groups. The casts were mounted on universal testing machine and axial load was applied @ 10 mm/min until failure. The load deflection graphs were plotted. The maximum force at which failure of the casts occurred was recorded. Stress, strain, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and stiffness of casts were calculated. Result: Construction of POP bandage cast was messy and required 45 - 60 min for hardening. 8 <b>layer</b> POP <b>cast</b> was comparatively heavier in weight and thicker in cross section than 3 <b>layer</b> <b>cast</b> followed by 2 <b>layer</b> <b>cast.</b> Under axial compression, the load bearing capacity of 8 <b>layer</b> POP <b>casts</b> was more than 2 and 3 <b>layer</b> <b>cast.</b> Conclusion: The values of load bearing capacity, stress, stiffness and MOE of cast were the highest for 8 <b>layer</b> POP <b>cast</b> followed by 2 and 3 <b>layer</b> <b>cast.</b> Use if splints with POP cast is recommended due to its poor mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|Megascolecidae {{earthworm}} casts (size up to 125 cm³) form {{a conspicuous}} layer in undisturbed basalt soils in South-East Australia. These fertile, well structured clay soils form a couplet with native mesic vegetation communities within sheltered {{sites in the}} humid zone. Casting is of potential importance to nutrient cycling at these sites since phosphorus fixation is a well established constraint in basalt soils. To explore this, we have initiated the present study, which seeks to determine spatial variability of earthworm activity (as proxied by casting) within and between adjacent native vegetation communities, {{and the influence of}} soil moisture and surface litter on casting. This study, conducted during August 2005, is based on 84 permanent 0. 25 m² sample plots, constructed within four well defined vegetation communities in the Blue Mountains of South-East Australia (dry sclerophyll, wet sclerophyll, rainforest and an ecotone between the last two which is distinctive at this site). Each vegetation community contains 16 randomly distributed sample plots. To assess the transition between these communities, four sub-zones were created, with 5 random sample plots between each community. The total amount of surface casts increased as the vegetation community became more mesic (dry sclerophyll – rainforest). This trend coincided with an increase in soil moisture of the <b>cast</b> <b>layer</b> and a decrease in the surface litter. The areas dominated by sclerophyll forest produced approximately 3200 g/m² of surface cast material, contrasting to the ecotone and rainforest communities which produced 5139 g/m² and 6888 g/m² respectively. This represents a two fold increase between sclerophyll and rainforest communities. Future work will address the rates of casting to explore seasonal effects. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Plaster casts {{can cause}} burns. Synthetic casts do not. Composite plaster–synthetic casts {{have not been}} {{thoroughly}} evaluated. This study analyzed the temperature from plaster casts compared with composite casts {{in a variety of}} in vitro conditions that would simulate clinical practice. Methods A Pyrex cylinder filled with constant body temperature circulating water simulated a human extrem-ity. Circumferential casts, of either plaster or composite construction (plaster inner layer with outer synthetic layer), were applied to the model. Peak temperatures generated by the exothermic reactions were studied relative to the following variables: dip water temperature (24 C versus 40 C), cast thickness (16, 30, and 34 ply), and delayed (5 -min) versus immediate application of the synthetic outer layers. Peak temperatures from the all-plaster casts were compared with the composite casts of the same thickness. Finally, the relative cast strength was determined. Results Potentially dangerous high temperatures were measured only when 40 C dip water was used or when thick (30 - or 34 -ply) casts were made. Cast strength increased with increasing cast thickness. However, the presence of synthetics in the composite <b>casts</b> <b>layers</b> did not increase cast strength in every case. Conclusion When applying composite casts, the outer synthetic layers should be applied several minutes after the plaster to minimize temperature rise. Composite casts do not routinely generate peak temperatures higher than plaster casts of similar thickness. Because the skin of children and the elderly is more temperature-sensitive than average adult skin, extra care should be taken to limit the exothermic reaction when casting children and the elderly: clean, room temperature dip water, minimal required cast thickness, avoidance of insulating pillows/blankets while the cast is drying...|$|R

Efforts are made to understand its fracture mechanisms {{and take advantage of}} these fracture mechanisms in the absorption of impact energy. A novel series of experiments has been performed on LBL manufactured thin films to demonstrate their unique fracture mechanisms. Polyurethane/Poly(Acrylic Acid) (PU/PAA) and PU/PAA/(PU/Clay) 5 nanocomposite films readily undergo Interlaminar mode II fracture, because of the relatively weak elctrostatic bonds between monolayers. Tensile tests performed while under observation by a scanning electron microscope demonstrate the tendency of these nanocomposite films to undergo interlaminar mode II fracture even when loads are applied in the plane of nanocomposite film. It is concluded that these mechanisms of energy dissipation are responsible for the enhanced toughness of these films when used as layers between glass blocks in the prevention of impact damage to the glass. A novel automated manufacturing facility has been designed and built to deposit large sheets of Layer-by-Layer nanocomposite film. These large sheets are incorporated into a borosillicate glass composite in order to compare the ballistic characteristics of LBL PU based nanocomposite films to a single <b>cast</b> <b>layer</b> of polyurethane. It is demonstrated that shear fracture is the mode of failure in the blocks containing the nanocomposite film. The shear fracture surface in the nanocomposite after it has undergone a ballistic impact is characterized. Additional experiments are performed to characterize the interlaminar fracture stresses and toughnesses of the nanocomposite LBL layers, to assist in the implementation of a numerical crack band model that describes the nanocomposite film.
