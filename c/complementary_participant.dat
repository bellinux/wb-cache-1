40|$|The {{discourse}} of laymen and professionals reveals {{the dependence of}} cognition on the interaction between participants, and the limitations of studying expertise by examining isolated individual behavior. This paper examines distributed cognition {{in the management of}} Multiple Sclerosis (MS). By varying the level of patient experience with the management of MS, we demonstrate the dependence of physician cognition on the patient’s contribution in four doctor-patient interactions. Experienced patients actively constructed clinical representations and presented initial evaluations for the doctor to refine and validate. Conversations between newly diagnosed patients and doctors demonstrated the physician work to establish a common understanding of the problem and acceptable interventions. Our analysis focuses on the <b>complementary</b> <b>participant</b> roles, and challenges the notion that medical cognition equals physician cognition...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} {{consists of an}} interdisciplinary approach which combines mainly sub-disciplines from the anthropological and psychological perspectives as theoretical background. Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore’s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky’s school of thought. The main objective {{of the study is}} to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern –how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or “fieldwork” approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses –based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a “study case” for this qualitative study. A period of <b>complementary</b> <b>participant</b> observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Current {{guidelines}} do {{not explicitly}} recommend statin use in heart failure (HF). Relatively low numbers of atherothrombotic events among HF patients, {{in the context}} of their elevated competing risks for non-atherothrombotic causes of death, may have prevented previous analyses of clinical trials from detecting a benefit for statins. We pooled data from two landmark trials of HF patients not on statin therapy randomized to rosuvastatin 10 [*]mg daily vs. placebo, CORONA and GISSI-HF, in order to improve our power to detect statistically significant differences in atherothrombotic events. We also accounted for competing risks from other causes of death. Methods and results: We used competing risks analyses to evaluate atherothrombotic events {{in the context of}} death from other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. We also performed traditional Cox survival analyses of the same data with the intention that these statistical approaches would be <b>complementary.</b> CORONA <b>participants</b> (n[*]=[*] 5011, median follow-up 32. 8 [*]months) were older and sicker than GISSI-HF participants (n[*]=[*] 4574, median follow-up 46. 9 [*]months) by design.

40|$|Illusory control {{refers to}} an effect in games of chance where {{features}} associated with skilful situations increase expectancies of success. Past work has operationalised illusory control in terms of subjective ratings or behaviour, with limited consideration {{of the relationship between}} these definitions, or the broader construct of agency. This study used a novel card-guessing task in 78 participants to investigate the relationship between subjective and behavioural illusory control. We compared trials in which participants (i) had no opportunity to exercise illusory control, (ii) could exercise illusory control for free, or (iii) could pay to exercise illusory control. Contingency Judgment and Intentional Binding tasks assessed explicit and implicit sense of agency, respectively. On the card-guessing task, confidence was higher when participants exerted control relative to the baseline condition. In a <b>complementary</b> model, <b>participants</b> were more likely to exercise control when their confidence was high, and this effect was accentuated in the pay condition relative to the free condition. Decisions to pay were positively correlated with control ratings on the Contingency Judgment task, but were not significantly related to Intentional Binding.

In addition, those participants who adopted the role of phase leader tended to exhibit more of a straight-line trajectory between targets, whereas participants who adopted the role of phase follower tended to exhibit a more elliptical trajectory.

40|$|Background: A {{collaborative}} is {{an effective}} method of implementing evidence-based practice across multiple sites through the sharing of experience and knowledge of others in a similar setting, over {{a short period of}} time. Collaborative methods were first used in the USA but have been adopted internationally. Aim: This paper sought to document the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the collaborative method, based on a single site 2 ̆ 7 s experience of participating in a multisite, state-wide heart failure collaborative. Method: Qualitative data was collected using three <b>complementary</b> methods: <b>participant</b> observation, reflective journalling and key informant interviews. Quantitative monitoring of team performance occurred monthly according to prespecified performance indicators. Findings: Barriers and facilitators that were identified by this study included: organisational factors, team composition, dynamics and networking, changing doctor behaviour, clinical leadership and communication. Conclusion: The findings from this study underscore the importance of leadership, communication and team cohesion for the successful implementation of the collaborative method at individual sites. In addition, the importance of a preparatory stage that deals with known barriers and facilitators to the collaborative method before the commencement of the official study period was highlighted. The potential for the collaborative approach to improve clinical outcomes warrants further systematic evaluation of process issues and consideration of the barriers and facilitators to implementation in various settings...|$|R

Atlanta Streets Alive (ASA) is a continually developing ciclovía recreativa based program occurring in urban Atlanta. Creating multi-sectoral partnerships and providing <b>complementary</b> activities to <b>participants</b> are key to ciclovía program sustainability. The objective of this capstone project was to create the STEPS to Atlanta Streets Alive Activity Guide (STEPS guide) by using a process method of evaluation framework for planning, conducting, and evaluating activities performed within ASA events. A pilot activity was conducted during the Atlanta Streets Alive event on October 17, 2010. The STEPS guide was assembled by using information collected during the pilot activity, with secondary analysis of the STEPS guide, including expert and focus group critique, to ensure accuracy and feasibility of use. The STEPS guide is a structured method of collecting static information about the individual activities conducted within ASA events. This information {{can be used by}} future activity partners to develop dynamic complementary activities within ASA events...|$|R
40|$|Understanding stable {{patterns}} of interpersonal movement coordination {{is essential to}} understanding successful social interaction and activity (i. e., joint action). Previous research investigating such coordination has primarily focused on the synchronization of simple rhythmic movements (e. g., finger/forearm oscillations or pendulum swinging). Very few studies, however, have explored the stable {{patterns of}} coordination that emerge during task-directed complementary coordination tasks. Thus, {{the aim of the}} current study was to investigate and model the behavioral dynamics of a <b>complementary</b> collision-avoidance task. <b>Participant</b> pairs performed a repetitive targeting task in which they moved computer stimuli back and forth between sets of target locations without colliding into each other.

This asymmetric movement pattern was also character-ized by a phase lag between participants and was essential to task success. Coupling directionality analysis an...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{older adults}} may seek care for {{low back pain}} (LBP) from both medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of {{chiropractic}} (DCs), co-management between these providers is uncommon. The {{purposes of this study}} were to describe the preferences of older adults for LBP co-management by MDs and DCs and to identify their concerns for receiving care under such a treatment model. METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups with 48 older adults who received LBP care in the past year. Interviews explored participants 2 ̆ 7 care seeking experiences, co-management preferences, and perceived challenges to successful implementation of a MD-DC co-management model. We analyzed the qualitative data using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Older adults considered LBP co-management by MDs and DCs a positive approach as the professions have <b>complementary</b> strengths. <b>Participants</b> wanted providers who worked in a co-management model to talk openly and honestly about LBP, offer clear and consistent recommendations about treatment, and provide individualized care. Facilitators of MD-DC co-management included collegial relationships between providers, arrangements between doctors to support interdisciplinary referral, computer systems that allowed exchange of health information between clinics, and practice settings where providers worked in one location. Perceived barriers to the co-management of LBP included the financial costs associated with receiving care from multiple providers concurrently, duplication of tests or imaging, scheduling and transportation problems, and potential side effects of medication and chiropractic care. A few participants expressed concern that some providers would not support a patient-preferred co-managed care model. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are interested in receiving LBP treatment co-managed by MDs and DCs. Older adults considered patient-centered communication, collegial interdisciplinary interactions between these providers, and administrative supports such as scheduling systems and health record sharing as key components for successful LBP co-management...|$|R

The study has been narrowed down to gather and analyze the experiences that students have about teachers, and how teachers uphold and set themselves to ground rules in the classroom.

It has also shown that the pupils get a feeling and believe that teachers think they’re above the rules that actually have been created by them selves. Nor are the teachers consequent enough in following up the rules that has been placed to follow in the classroom.

Alternatively, individual sensor images may each contribute unique <b>complementary</b> information forcing <b>participants</b> to process both sensors entirely to make a correct decision (AND processing). AND processing may also combine with either a parallel- or serial-processing structure: both sensors are processed simultaneously and the slowest to finish is used to make the discrimination (parallel-AND) or both sensors are fully processed, first one, then the other (serial-AND). Fusion also allows for a single percept in which all information is processed in parallel and is pooled to make a decision (coactive processing).|$|R
30|$|Understanding a firm’s {{sources of}} {{competitive}} advantage {{has become a}} major field of interest in strategy research (e.g. Barney 1991; Porter 2004 b; Rumelt 1984; Teece et al. 1997). The concept of sustained competitive advantage is often associated with a firm’s value creating strategy, whose benefits cannot easily be duplicated by others in the present or future (Barney 1991, p. 102). Traditional models focus on firm-internal processes, resources or dynamic capabilities, while value creation in the digital economy results from the collaboration of several economic actors. In order to pursue value co-creating activities, organizations have started to open up their value creation structures and processes by collaborating with other firms in various forms (Fjeldstad et al. 2012, p. 734; Snow 2015, p. 7; see also Baldwin and von Hippel 2011; Bollingtoft et al. 2012; Chesbrough 2003).

Accordingly, the locus of value creation as well as the shape of organizational forms has shifted from individual firms towards interorganizational networks (Miles et al. 2010, pp. 96; see Miles et al. 2009; Powell et al. 1996).|$|R

The purpose of this study was to examine pre-service {{classroom teachers}}??? beliefs about physical education, knowledge of the subject, and teacher self-efficacy beliefs to perform specific teaching tasks when partaking in one of three laboratory conditions (teaching children, peer-teaching, or no teaching) as part of a physical education methods course. Bandura's self-efficacy theory (1997) served as the theoretical framework. As part of a <b>complementary</b> mixed-method design, <b>participants</b> (N= 66) completed a physical education knowledge test, Values and Purposes of Physical Education Questionnaire, and a modified version of the Teacher's Self-efficacy Belief System-Self at both the beginning and end of the semester.

One-way analysis of variances of gain scores did not reveal any impacts of laboratory type on participants' beliefs, knowledge, or self-efficacy (p. 05). Analytic induction and constant comparison of qualitative data revealed three major themes: (a) changed perspectives, (b) desire to work with children, and (c) lecture as a mastery experience.

40|$|Many {{real world}} {{situations}} (potluck dinners, academic departments, sports teams, corporate divisions, committees, seminar classes, etc.) involve actors adjusting their contributions {{in order to}} achieve a mutually satisfactory group goal, a win-win result. However, the majority of human group research has involved situations where groups perform poorly because task constraints promote either individual maximization behavior or diffusion of responsibility, and even successful tasks generally involve the propagation of one correct solution through a group. Here we introduce a group task that requires <b>complementary</b> actions among <b>participants</b> in order to reach a shared goal. Without communication, group members submit numbers in an attempt to collectively sum to a randomly selected target number. After receiving group feedback, members adjust their submitted numbers until the target number is reached. For all groups, performance improves with task experience, and group reactivity decreases over rounds. Our empirical results provide evidence for adaptive coordination in human groups, and as the coordination costs increase with group size, large groups adapt through spontaneous role differentiation and self-consistency among members. We suggest several agent-based models with different rules for agent reactions, and we show that the empirical results are best fit by a flexible, adaptive agent strategy in which agents decrease their reactions when the group feedback changes. The task offers a simple experimental platform for studying the general problem of group coordination while maximizing group returns, and we distinguish the task fro...|$|R

40|$|PhD {{is about}} the family farm in the United Kingdom. It investigates the reasons behind their {{survival}} {{since the end of}} World War Two and the current day. The research is situated in a gap in knowledge within agricultural geography that exists due to an inadequacy to explore effectively the family farm and its continuation. This is related to two strands of research. First, analysts of the era between the mid- 1940 s and early-mid 1980 s argued that the inability of the family farm to access funding through external connections to fund technology would result in their extinction. Second, activities such as farm diversification, which have been suggested by proponents of agricultural phases since the early-mid 1980 s such as 'post-productivism', have failed to provide real options for family farmers to survive without food production. This PhD acknowledges the role of the family farm itself, technology and external connections to its persistence. It creates a theoretical framework grounded in an appreciation of the everyday and mundane, which justifies concentration on a single family farm located in Ceredigion, Wales, UK. The study implemented ethnography and multi-sited ethnography by living and working on a family farm and using the <b>complementary</b> methods of <b>participant</b> observation, focused discussions and in-the-field interviewing. The study found that family farmers utilise their own creativity, resources and abilities to engage with technology and external connections in diverse, multiple and unexpected ways. These practices were related to motivations such as maintaining a good way of life, producing food and supporting the local community. In turn, these motivations were connected to a deeply embedded emotional longing to survive and keep the name on the land...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Learning {{a musical}} {{instrument}} in childhood invites a future that holds lifelong pleasure and companionship, yet although thousands of children take up an instrument annually, many abandon their lessons after only a short period. Research on retention and attrition in instrumental music education has found that continuing participation {{is associated with a}} constellation of factors, but there is little research exploring how the learning experience itself might influence young people’s decisions to continue their music lessons. This thesis investigates the subjective perspective of learning and how this impacts upon individuals’ participation in formal instrumental music lessons during childhood and youth. The study employed a mixed-methods design with quantitative and qualitative methods as <b>complementary</b> strategies. Study <b>participants</b> varied in their age, amount of experience, depth of involvement in musical learning and accomplishment. In the quantitative stage, a descriptive-comparative approach examined individual, social and contextual dimensions of the music learning experience of primary and secondary students in an Australian context (n= 376), as well as relationships between these dimensions and continuing participation in formal instrumental music instruction. In the qualitative stage, an interpretive-descriptive approach was used to analyse semi-structured interviews undertaken with primary school children, tertiary students and adults in the community (n= 66). Affinity for music, representing the subjective meaning of music to the individual, was identified as the connection between individuals and music, and was a necessary condition for sustaining participation in musical learning. Affinity for music developed where learning was musically meaningful and where emotionally charged appraisals of learning made by the musical self were predominantly stable and positive. Musically meaningful learning occurred to the degree that individuals were able {{to make sense of the}} music through fluency and facility. The making of musical meaning was also influenced by the degree of correspondence between the musical repertoire, the individual and their socio-cultural environment. Patterns of learning associated with a range of technical and musical outcomes also emerged; these consisted of clusters of beliefs about music and learning, expressions of volition, and practice strategies. An explanatory theory of participation in music learning developed from the research suggests that the subjective experience of music learning influences the likelihood of continued participation. The major pedagogical implication of the study is that educators will be in a better position to foster musical meaning and affinity if they target students’ practice approaches while closely appraising the social context of student learning...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{economic}} and political context, significant changes are taking place in food security issues. Nowadays, emphasis is being placed on developing seamless and sensible links between various food security programmes, including emergency aid and overall development policies. In 1996, the European Union adopted a new community programme with flexible, trans-sectoral tools designed to: ? improve market supply through support to local food production (local purchases, and so-called triangular operations); ? facilitate the access of vulnerable groups to basic food supply, instead of simply providing food; ? create a stable and responsive political and economic climate to encourage long-term food security policies. Between October and December 1997, CTA and the Food Aid and Food Security Unit of the Directorate-General for Development of the European Commission organised {{a series of three}} seminars based on this new set of measures. This was done against a background of alarming perspectives, especially with regard to sub-Saharan Africa. The seminars were intended to inform and encourage discussion about the measures with ACP decision-makers (Permanent Secretary level of Ministries of Agriculture, Economic Affairs and Trade) and with representatives of NGOs and regional organisations, all of whom were actively involved in this domain. The four regions of Africa, and the Caribbean, were represented *. Each participant approached the seminars with their own particular experience and vision, and together discussed various sections of the new measures and their tools, such as aid in kind, financial aid, counterpart funding and foreign exchange arrangements. A set of case studies underlined just how diverse (e. g. countries in a critical state, in the process of rehabilitation, and {{with a high level of}} food insecurity) and complex situations of food insecurity are, as well as the difficulties of implementing corrective steps. It was recognised that it was the role of the State to create an institutional and economic framework to protect the poorest of the poor.

Motivated by the {{increasing use of}} different mobile and wireless technologies, especially smartphones and tablets among students as well as the public policy of tablets insertion in the context of public schools, this research investigates how mobile and wireless technologies may appear to contribute to the processes of teaching and learning Chemistry from the perspective of mobile learning and BYOD in the context of initial teacher training in IFRS - Campus Porto Alegre. The research aims to understand how mobile and wireless technologies can contribute to the processes of teaching and learning Chemistry from the perspective of mobile learning and BYOD in order to enhance the development of educational practices in the context of initial teacher training in IFRS - Campus Porto Alegre. Some other objectives of the research are: a) to identify the Natural Sciences undergraduates??? digital technological profile, mainly with regard to the access and use of digital technologies; b) to search and select the applications for tablets, with potential for the teaching and learning processes in Chemistry, available in virtual digital store; c) to establish evaluation criteria for the Apps in order to know them and classify them in terms of applicability; d) to design, develop and evaluate pedagogical practice in Chemistry with applications for tablets and smartphones in the context of mobile learning and BYOD. Taking into consideration the different characteristics of the research problems achieved, we opted for the development of an exploratory research, qualitative and quantitative, based on Design Research, where the artifact was a pedagogical practice developed through a complementary activity with a group of ten undergraduates. The instruments and materials which have been used are: questionnaires, ???workshops???, interviews, audio recordings, photos, video and observation. For data analysis, we used the text analysis discourse (GALIAZZI; MORAES, 2011). In order to interpret the data and for better understanding of the problem and research objectives, we sought theoretical foundation in the following authors: Galiazzi, Moraes (2002); Saccol, Schlemmer & Barbosa (2010); Lemos (2003); Giordan (2008). The main results of this research show that the licensees have broad access to digital technologies and the Internet, but its use was basically restricted to communication. There are several Apps for specific tablets and smartphones concerning Chemistry education, and general applications that have potential for the development of teaching practices available on virtual digital stores. However, after establishing criteria and evaluation of these Apps we selected some of them which were free, multiplatform, and with contents preferably in Portuguese. A pedagogical practice was designed from the technological profile of undergraduates and from selected applications considering the perspective of mobile learning and BYOD developed through a complementary activity. In that <b>complementary</b> activity the <b>participants</b> experienced the mobile and wireless technologies in the educational context and developed Chemistry learning projects in the context of mobile and wireless technologies...|$|R
