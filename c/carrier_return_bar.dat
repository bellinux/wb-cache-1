50|$|A <b>carrier's</b> <b>return</b> on {{investment}} {{is directly related}} to its ability to transport more service instances over a fixed capacity-constrained infrastructure, keeping Quality of Service high.

40|$|Persistent nasal {{carriers}} and noncarriers of Staphylococcus aureus were inoculated {{with a mixture}} of different S. aureus strains. The majority of non{{carriers and}} nearly all persistent <b>carriers</b> <b>returned</b> to their original carrier state after artificial inoculation. Furthermore, the majority of persistent carriers tested positive again for their original resident strain. Using a human nasal inoculation model, we here demonstrate that the human factor is an important determinant of S. aureus nasal carriage...|$|R
