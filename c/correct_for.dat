5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> {{the effects of the}} wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{model of}} {{nonlinear}} decay of the stock pollutant, and starting from the same initial conditions, the paper shows that a tax that only <b>corrects</b> <b>for</b> stock externalities can, at the steady state, be higher than a tax that <b>corrects</b> <b>for</b> both stock and flow externalities. The {{results indicate that the}} possibility exists that the optimal corrective tax (<b>correcting</b> <b>for</b> both externalities) may result in a steady state with fewer emissions and lower tax payments than a tax that only <b>corrects</b> <b>for</b> stock externality. Thus, a failure to consider flow externalities may have important implications fior the time path and steady states of production, emissions and taxes, and not just in terms of transitory consumption...|$|R

5|$|CTW enlisted Palmer, in {{conjunction}} with Harvard University, in 1979 to conduct a study in Jamaica regarding the effects of Sesame Street on children with no exposure to other children's television programs, in order to <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> the effects of multimedia exposure on children in the US. Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective.

5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the {{older and more}} widely distributed techniques.

5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E

5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left.

5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E

Following the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament several pollsters (including ESPN, USA Today, NBC Sports) omitted Michigan from the expected preseason top 25, however some that immediately projected Caris LeVert to return to Michigan included Michigan in the rankings: CBS Sports (#18) and Sports Illustrated (#16). Bleacher Report ranked Michigan at 25 noting lower expectations if LeVert declared himself eligible for the 2015 NBA draft. On April 21, LeVert {{announced that he would}} return for his senior season. That same day, Max Bielfeldt was released from his athletic scholarship with one year of eligibility remaining. Despite all 13 of its scholarships being committed at the time, Michigan continued to recruit five-star 2015 McDonald's All-American Jaylen Brown and four-star Kenny Williams for the class of 2015.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E

5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to <b>correct</b> <b>for</b> the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
