40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both <b>coarse</b> <b>screens</b> and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of <b>coarse</b> <b>screen).</b> <b>Coarse</b> <b>Screens</b> <b>Coarse</b> <b>screens</b> remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of <b>coarse</b> <b>screens</b> include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} <b>coarse</b> <b>screens.</b> Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after <b>coarse</b> or fine <b>screens</b> can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} near-infrared analysis for quantitating urea, creatinine, and protein in urine. Practical advantages of this method include ease of sample presentation {{and the absence of}} reagents or disposables. Design and Methods: The near-infrared methods were developed by first measuring the spectra of 123 different urine samples and, using independent clinical analyses, determining the protein, creatinine, and urea levels in each. Calibration models relating near-infrared spectroscopic features to those independently determined concentrations were optimized, and each model then validated using a set of 50 additional samples. Results: Standard errors of calibration were 14. 4 mmol/L, 0. 66 mmol/L, and 0. 20 g/L, and standard errors of prediction 16. 6 mmol/L, 0. 79 mmol/L, and 0. 23 g/L, respectively, for urea, creatinine, and protein. Conclusions: Near-infrared urea quantitation is as accurate as the reference method, enzymatic (urease) conductivity, used here for calibration. Creatinine analysis is slightly less accurate relative to the reference (Jaff 9 rate) method; however, these errors can be minimized by careful attention to factors affecting precision. The accuracy of the near-infrared protein analysis cannot approach that of the reference method; nevertheless, the technique is potentially useful for <b>coarse</b> <b>screening</b> and for quantifying protein levels above 0. 3 g/L.

40|$|In {{the past}} most {{probabilistic}} risk assessments (PRAs) of severe accidents in {{nuclear power plants}} have considered initiating events which could potentially lead to core damage and containment failure during normal full power operation. However, recent studies and operational experience during periods while plants were shutdown for maintenance or refueling indicated that potential accidents initiated during low power operation or shutdown conditions could also potentially become important contributors to risk. In 1989, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) began an extensive program to assess the risk during low power and shutdown operation. Two plants, Surry (a pressurized water reactor, PWR) and Grand Gulf (a boiling water reactor,BWR) were selected as the plants to be studied. This paper describes an analysis of accident progression and offsite consequences (level 3 PRA) carried out for the Surry plant. The focus of the level 3 PRA was on mid-loop operation, which is a plant operational state (POS) that can occur while the plant is shutdown for maintenance or refueling. Mid-loop refers to a configuration when the reactor coolant system is lowered to the mid-plane of the hot leg to allow essential maintenance to be performed.

40|$|Screening is a {{well-known}} classification process in the minerals processing industry. The process involves separation of fine particles from coarse particles based on size and is applicable to both dry and fine screening. Fine screening is normally carried out wet. Until recently, fine wet screening had been limited to relatively low throughput applications. Developments {{in the recent past}} have seen the evolution of fine screening to high capacity applications. It has found application in operations such as closed circuits with a mill in place of hydrocyclones. However, even though developments are increasing, there has been a process model developmental lag.

Add to this the global Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic, the global resurgence of tuberculo-sis (TB), and the disturbing increases in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and it becomes difficult to imagine the com-partmentalized world of even 30 years ago when dis-eases of different continents stayed in their place.

40|$|The {{present study}} arose {{out of a}} desire to test the {{assumption}} that in order to obtain direct stencils with good edge definition, one either had to use fine screens or. If using a relatively <b>coarse</b> <b>screen,</b> apply multiple coatings of emulsion to the screen before making the stencil. Neither alternative seemed satisfactory, since the first did not allow optimal use of the scope of screens available, and the second entailed an expenditure of time and supplies that could possibly be shown to be unnecessary. It was therefore determined to carry on an experiment that would show whether direct stencils with good edge definition can be obtained on relatively <b>coarse</b> <b>screens</b> with only one, or at most two applications of emulsion. The experiment thus envisioned also provided an opportunity to observe the influence on two other factors on stencil edge definition, besides those of mesh count and emulsion thickness: namely, screen thread diameter and coater blade thick ness. What finally evolved was a three-factor, three-levelled factorial experiment, in which the variables under study were* screen mesh count, thread diameter and emulsion thick ness. The fourth factor came into play when the experiment was run once for emulsions applied with a thick-bladed coater, and once for those applied with a thin-bladed coater. The specific question under study was: in the direct stencil system, is there a difference in the quality of edge definition obtainable with variations in screen mesh count, screen thread diameter, coater blade thickness and the number of emulsion coatings applied? Eighteen screens were stretched expressly for the experiment, representing three different mesh counts and three different thread diameters for each mesh count. Each screen was prepared {{in such a way as}} to receive three stencils of varying thickness per screen. All stencils were exposed to a test target designed to allow for the observation of diagonal and parallel stencil edges (i. e., diagonal or parallel with relation to screen thread direction). After the stencils were made, they were visually inspected, and the data obtained thereby was subjected to an analysis of variance. The results obtained showed that of the four factors studied, mesh count was the only one that made a clear difference in the quality of stencil edge definition. What the experiment did not conclusively show was whether or not coater blade thickness had any influence on that quality.

40|$|The {{hazards of}} lead in the {{environment}} have {{been a matter of}} increasing concern over the past several years. The most common sources of lead contaminated soils are those related to abandoned lead battery reclamation sites. There are over 200 such sites in the United States and several real and potential sites in Minnesota. Under present regulations such contaminated soil must be removed and placed in an approved and licensed landfill. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate that by applying conventional mineral dressing techniques it is possible to detoxify a significant percentage of the soil and thereby reduce the cost of landfill disposition. Prior test work at the Natural Resources Research lnstitute's Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory (CRL) on a sample from a battery reprocessing site in Wisconsin demonstrated that partial detoxification of the soil was practical. The object of this study was to apply similar techniques to material from a Minnesota site. The Shafer Metal site on north Plymouth avenue in Minneapolis was selected for this study after consultation with personnel from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Minnesota Department of Transportation who own the property. The lead contamination at the Shafer Metal battery reprocessing site occurs in three principal modes: lead metal fragments, surficial coatings of precipitated lead sulphate and lead dioxide, and lead incorporated into fused plastic material. The lead metal consists primarily of fragments of battery plates and connectors. The precipitated lead compounds occur as coatings on the rock and sand particles in the soil. The fused plastic material could have resulted from melting and casting of the lead, or operation of an incinerator. After preliminary sampling to confirm the distribution of lead contaminated soil at the site, three bulk samples of about 800 pounds each were collected for testing. These three samples were subjected to a series conventional mineral processing techniques involving attrition scrubbing, screening, and gravity separation. The tests demonstrated that over 60 % of the material can be separated as a clean rock and sand product that can be disposed of on site. About 5 % to 10 % of the material can be recovered as a lead-rich product that would be acceptable feedstock to a lead smelter. About 25 % of the weight would contain so much lead that it would have to be treated as hazardous material. Some 5 % to 10 % of the material would be rejected as a coarse trash product eligible for disposal in conventional landfills. The EPA Synthetic Precipitation Leach Test for Soils (Method 1312) was run on the rock and clean sand portion which represents over 60 % of the material. The tests demonstrated that this material had been effectively detoxified and could be disposed of on site. Based on these test data a treatment flow sheet to detoxify the material represented by the bulk samples taken at the Shafer Metal site was developed. The flow sheet includes the following process steps: I) <b>Coarse</b> <b>screening</b> to remove tramp trash; 2) attrition scrubbing to remove the lead compounds from the coarser rock and sand particles; and 3) gravity concentration to separate a high lead product, a clean rock and sand reject, and a lead-bearing fused plastic product. A minus 165 mesh fines fraction is also produced containing the natural fines from the soil and the lead released by the attrition scrubbing. The recommended treatment flow sheet is based on using conventional mineral processing equipment. The equipment could be sized small enough to be truck mounted, or set up as semi-portable units for on-site treatment. Engineering such a portable treatment plant was included in the extended project, but is beyond the scope of this abbreviated study. Whether treatment of the Shafer Metal site is practical depends upon the cost of building and operating such a treatment plant on site as opposed to direct disposal. It is recommended that this study be extended to include the design and engineering of a portable or semi-mobile treatment plant and that further continuous pilot plant operations be supported to confirm some of the coarse gravity separation steps. There are other similar sites in Minnesota that are contaminated by lead that would be amenable to similar treatment. Costing out the plant required and demonstration of the viability of the treatment flow sheet would make it possible to offer alternatives to the expensive disposal of such hazardous material in a licensed disposal site.

There are described typical ordering of particular equipment in to technological lines on waste water treatment plants. The bachelor thesis contains description of self-cleaning screen, hand skimmed <b>screen,</b> mechanical <b>coarse</b> <b>screen,</b> mechanical fine screen, equipment for grit and sand removing, skimmed cylinder strainers, screw conveyors, screw presses for screenings with washing and integrated coarse pre-treatment. There are published some schemes, sketches, photos and tables of technical parameters above mentioned equipment in this bachelor thesis. The sketches of technical drawing character are treated in Autodesk ACAD 2005 program...|$|R

The <b>coarser</b> the <b>screen</b> (lower frequency), the lower {{the quality of the}} printed image. Highly absorbent newsprint requires a lower screen frequency than less-absorbent coated paper stock used in magazines and books, where screen frequencies of 133 to 200 lpi and higher are used.|$|R

During the primary (mechanical) treatment step in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), coarse suspended or floating solids are removed from the wastewater by screens or sieves. Sand and other heavy particles are retained in sand traps; floating material is removed in grease separators [84]. <b>Coarse</b> <b>screens</b> have openings of approx. 20 â€“ 50 Â mm, intermediate screens of approx. 10 â€“ 20 Â mm and fine screens of approx. 2 â€“ 10 Â mm [84, 85]. Such screens are suitable for removing macroplastics from wastewater [72, 86, 87], while they willâ€”based on the opening sizes mentioned aboveâ€”not be able to capture smaller microplastics. Still, microplastics may be captured, if other materials are clogging the screens. Mintenig et al. [31] suggested that buoyant microplastics may be removed in the grease separating step. Microplastics with a high density such as PU {{can be expected to}} sediment and, thus, to be captured in the sand trap or with the sludge.|$|R

Spalling of the sputtered coating did occur from a <b>coarse</b> <b>screen</b> anode surface but only in flakes less than a mesh unit long. The results were obtained in a 200 hour accelerated life test conducted at an elevated discharge potential of 64. 6 volts. The test approximately reproduced the major sputter erosion and deposition effects that occur under normal operation but at approximately 75 times the normal rate. No discharge chamber component suffered sufficient erosion in the test to threaten its structural integrity or further serviceability. The test indicated {{that the use of}} tantalum-surfaced discharge chamber components in conjunction with a fine wire screen anode surface should cure the problems of sputter erosion and sputtered deposits spalling in long term operation of small mercury ion thrusters...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{intellectual}} property owners to earn monopoly rents and the inability of horizontal competitors to price fix legally are two propositions that are often taken as givens. This article challenges the wholesale adoption of either proposition {{within the context of}} buyer price-fixing in intellectual property markets. More specifically, it examines antitrust lawâ€™s role in protecting patent holdersâ€™ rents through its condemnation of otherwise ostensibly efficient buyer price fixing. Using basic economic analysis, this article refines the legal standards applicable at this point of intersection between antitrust and patent law. In particular, the author recommends the limited abandonment of per se condemnation of buyer price-fixing within pure intellectual property contexts. As an alternative, a <b>coarse</b> <b>screen</b> which accounts for both price and innovation effects is proposed. This recommendation represents one example of how antitrust law can better account for the complicated and imperfectly understood effects of the patent system on social welfare...|$|R
