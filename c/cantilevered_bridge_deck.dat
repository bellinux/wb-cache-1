5000|$|The old Port Mann Bridge {{opened on}} June 12, 1964, {{originally}} carrying four lanes. It {{was named after}} the community of Port Mann, through which {{the south end of}} the bridge passed. At the time of construction, it was the most expensive piece of highway in Canada. The first [...] "civilian" [...] to drive across the bridge was CKNW reporter Marke Raines. He was not authorized to cross, so he drove quickly. In 2001 an eastbound HOV lane was added by moving the centre divider and by <b>cantilevering</b> the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> outwards in conjunction with a seismic upgrade.|$|R
50|$|Cut River <b>Bridge</b> is a <b>cantilevered</b> steel <b>deck</b> <b>bridge</b> {{over the}} Cut River in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located along U.S. Highway 2 (US 2) in Hendricks Township, Mackinac County, between Epoufette and Brevort, about 25 mi {{northwest}} of St. Ignace and the Straits of Mackinac. There {{is a long}} but not often traversed wooden staircase to the valley below that was constructed some time after {{the construction of the}} bridge itself.|$|R
25|$|A {{cable-stayed}} bridge has {{one or more}} towers (or pylons), from which cables support the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b> A distinctive feature are the cables which run directly from the tower to the deck, normally forming a fan-like pattern or a series of parallel lines. This {{is in contrast to}} the modern suspension bridge, where the cables supporting the deck are suspended vertically from the main cable, anchored {{at both ends of the}} bridge and running between the towers. The {{cable-stayed bridge}} is optimal for spans longer than <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> and shorter than suspension bridges. This is the range where <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> would rapidly grow heavier if the span were lengthened, while suspension bridge cabling would not be more economical if the span were shortened.|$|R
50|$|When {{commissioned}} in 1943, Howrah was the 3rd-longest <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> in the world, behind Pont de Québec (549 m) in Canada and Forth Bridge (521 m) in Scotland. It {{has since}} been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{in the world in}} 2013. It is a suspension type balanced <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge,</b> with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers and a suspended span of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The anchor arms are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the anchor arms free from deck load. The deck system includes cross girders suspended between the pairs of hangers by a pinned connection. Six rows of longitudinal stringer girders are arranged between cross girders. Floor beams are supported transversally on top of the stringers, while themselves supporting a continuous pressed steel troughing system surfaced with concrete.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the primary}} cables cannot be {{anchored}} until the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> is completed, a self-anchored suspension bridge requires some falsework during construction. This falsework {{may take the}} form of compression struts (pictured here http://pghbridges.com/pittsburghW/0584-4477/7th1927clpgh1.jpg and in the above diagram) which hold up the main cables (or the parts of them which have already been constructed), allowing the ends of the span to be constructed first in the fashion of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge,</b> or it may be in the form of underdeck falsework, as was employed in the Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge ...|$|R
50|$|The Brønnøysund Bridge (Brønnøysundbrua) is a <b>cantilevered</b> road <b>bridge</b> {{near the}} town of Brønnøysund in Brønnøy {{municipality}} in Nordland county, Norway. The bridge was constructed in 1979 and it connects the small island of Torget with the mainland just south of Brønnøysund. The 550 m bridge has a maximum clearance to the sea of 30 m. It consists of 20 spans, the longest of which is 110 m. The <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> is made of pre-stressed concrete.|$|R
50|$|The Niagara <b>Cantilever</b> <b>Bridge</b> or Michigan Central Railway <b>Cantilever</b> <b>Bridge</b> was a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{across the}} Niagara Gorge. An {{international}} railway-only bridge between Canada and the United States, it connected Niagara Falls, New York, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, located {{just south of}} the Whirlpool Bridge, and opened to traffic in 1883, it was replaced by the Michigan Central Railway Steel Arch Bridge in 1925.|$|R
50|$|The Story Bridge is a heritage-listed steel <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{spanning}} the Brisbane River that carries vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic between {{the northern and}} the southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

50|$|A <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> is a <b>bridge</b> built using <b>cantilevers,</b> {{structures}} that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. The steel truss <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> was a major engineering breakthrough since it can span distances of over 1,500 ft. The AJX bridge is the only surviving <b>cantilevered</b> <b>deck</b> truss <b>bridge</b> in Wyoming.|$|R
50|$|Although some {{continuous}} truss <b>bridges</b> resemble <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> and may {{be constructed}} using cantilever techniques, there are important {{differences between the two}} forms. <b>Cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> need not connect rigidly mid-span, as the cantilever arms are self-supporting. Although some <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> appear continuous due to decorative trusswork at the joints, these bridges will remain standing if the connections between the cantilevers are broken, or if the suspended span (if any) is removed. Conversely, continuous truss bridges rely on rigid truss connections throughout the structure for stability. Severing a continuous truss mid-span endangers the structure. However, continuous truss bridges do not experience the tipping forces that a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> must resist, because the main span of a continuous truss bridge is supported at both ends.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a steel <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> {{which is a}} type of {{continuous}} truss bridge. The bridge's main span is uncommon for a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> in that the truss over the main channel tapers upward and the roadway below is suspended from the truss by steel hangers.|$|R
25|$|A <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> is a <b>bridge</b> built using <b>cantilevers,</b> {{structures}} that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|R

50|$|Cantilevers {{are widely}} found in construction, notably in <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> and {{balconies}} (see corbel). In <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridges</b> the <b>cantilevers</b> are usually built as pairs, with each cantilever {{used to support}} {{one end of a}} central section.

40|$|Cracking {{of newly}} placed binary Portland cement-slag {{concrete}} adjacent to <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> expansion dam replacements {{has been observed}} on several newly rehabilitated sections of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> This paper investigates the causes of cracking by assessing the concrete mixtures specified for <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> rehabilitation projects, as well as reviewing the structural design of decks and the construction and curing methods implemented by the contractors. The work consists of (1) a comprehensive literature review {{of the causes of}} cracking on <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> (2) a review of previous <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> rehabilitation projects that experienced early-age cracking along with construction observations of active deck rehabilitation projects, and (3) an experimental evaluation of the two most commonly used <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> concrete mixtures. Based on the literature review, the causes of concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking can be classified into three categories: concrete material properties, construction practices, and structural design factors. The most likely causes of the observed early-age cracking were found to be inadequate curing and failure to properly eliminate the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking. These results underscore the significance of proper moist curing methods for concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> including repair sections. This document also provides a blueprint for future researchers to investigate early-age cracking of concrete structures...|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} factors related to bridge design can {{contribute}} to <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (ElSafty and Abdel Mohti 2013). Restraint is typically caused by end conditions and the composite action between the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the supporting members of the superstructure. The fixity conditions at abutments can influence cracking in the end spans of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> (Darwin et al. 2004). Restraint can also be provided by stay-in-place forms (Saadeghvaziri and Hadidi 2005). Thicker <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> tend to have less cracking (TRB 2006; ElSafty and Abdel-Mohti 2013), although the relative stiffnesses of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the girders {{is an important factor}} in the propensity for a deck to experience cracking (Hadidi and Saadeghvaziri 2005). The type of girder used in a bridge superstructure has been shown to influence cracking, with <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> of steel girder bridges often exhibiting more cracking than <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> supported by other types of girders due to stiffness (Perfetti et al. 1985; Krauss and Rogalla 1996). The type of phased construction and continuity between spans in bridges built with precast girders can have important consequences in <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (Sousa et al. 2012). ElSafty and Abdel-Mohti (2013) found that deflection is an important parameter affecting cracking. Reinforcing steel characteristics (including bar size, spacing, cover, and other details) can affect the extent of <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking (Hadidi and Saadeghvaziri 2005) as well as crack widths and patterns (Soltani et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Within {{the last}} century the {{interest}} in wind-induced loads over civil engineering structures has {{become more and more}} important, the reason being that the development of new construction techniques and materials has allowed engineers and architects to design new structures far from the traditional concepts, and in many cases wind actions over these singular structures are not included in the existing codes of practice. In this paper the windinduced static loads over bridges constructed by the double cantilever method during erection stages are considered. The aerodynamic load over a double <b>cantilever</b> <b>bridge</b> under a yawing-angled wind produces a yawing (torsional) moment on the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> which can lead to undesirable rotation of the deck about the supporting pier. The effects of the wind yaw angle and the length of the deck are analysed. The wind action caused by the presence of sliding concrete forms at the ends of the deck is also studied...|$|R
