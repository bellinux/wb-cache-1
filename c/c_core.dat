They are often found with anti-Sm antibodies, {{but they may be}} associated with different clinical associations. In addition to SLE, these antibodies are highly associated with mixed connective tissue disease. Anti-nRNP antibodies recognise the A and <b>C</b> <b>core</b> units of the snRNPs and because of this they primarily bind to the U1-snRNP. The immune response to RNP may be caused by the presentation of the nuclear components on the cell membrane in apoptotic blebs. Molecular mimicry has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for the production of antibodies to these proteins because of similarity between U1-RNP polypeptides and Epstein-Barr virus polypeptides.|$|E

40|$|AbstractResponse-guided {{therapy is}} of limited use in {{developing}} countries because hepatitis C virus RNA detection by sensitive molecular methods is time- and labor-consuming and expensive. We evaluated early predictive efficacy of serum hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen kinetics on sustained virologic response in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus during pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment. For 478 patients recruited, hepatitis C virus RNAs were detected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 using Cobas TaqMan. Architect hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen was performed at baseline, and weeks 4 and 12. Predictive values of hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen on sustained virologic response were compared to hepatitis C virus RNA. In the first 12 weeks after treatment initiation the dynamic patterns of serum hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen and hepatitis C virus RNA levels were similar in sustained virologic response, relapse, and null response patients groups. Although areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves of hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen were {{lower than those of}} hepatitis C virus RNA at the same time points, modeling analysis showed that undetectable hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen (rapid virological response based on hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen) had similar positive predictive value on sustained virologic response to hepatitis C virus RNA at week 4 (90. 4 % vs 93. 3 %), and hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen decrease greater than 1 log 10 IU/mL (early virological response based on hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen) had similar negative predictive value to hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12 (94. 1 % vs 95. 2 %). Analysis on the validation group demonstrated a positive predictivevalue of 97. 5 % in rapid virological response based on hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen and a negative predictive value of 100 % in early virological response based on hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen. In conclusion, hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> antigen is comparable to hepatitis C virus RNA in predicting sustained virologic response of chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infected patients, and can be used to guide anti-hepatitis C virus treatment, especially in resource-limited areas...|$|R

When {{expressed}} in CD 4 + T lymphocytes, it can induce modifications in several essential cellular and biological networks. To {{shed light on the}} mechanisms underlying the alterations caused by the viral protein, we have analyzed HCV-core subcellular localization and its associations with host proteins in Jurkat T cells. In order to investigate the intracellular localization of Hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> protein, we have used a lentiviral system to transduce Jurkat T cells and subsequently localize the protein using immunoelectron microscopy techniques. We found that in Jurkat T cells, Hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> protein mostly localizes in the nucleus and specifically in the nucleolus. In addition, we performed pull-down assays combined with Mass Spectrometry Analysis, to identify proteins that associate with Hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> in Jurkat T cells. We found proteins such as NOLC 1, PP 1 γ, ILF 3, and C 1 QBP implicated in localization and/or traffic to the nucleolus. HCV-core associated proteins are implicated in RNA processing and RNA virus infection as well as in functions previously shown to be altered in Hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> expressing CD 4 + T cells, such as cell cycle delay, decreased proliferation, and induction of a regulatory phenotype. Thus, in the current work, we show the ultrastructural localization of Hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> and the first profile of HCV core associated proteins in T cells, and we discuss the functions and interconnections of these proteins in molecular networks where relevant biological modifications have been described upon the expression of Hepatitis <b>C</b> virus <b>core</b> protein.
