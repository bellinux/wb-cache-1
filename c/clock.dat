5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess <b>clock</b> is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one <b>clock</b> while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The <b>clock</b> can be analog or digital though a digital <b>clock</b> is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a <b>clock</b> starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess <b>clock</b> is placed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{wall of the}} transept, {{opposite}} Vicars' Hall, is a second <b>clock</b> face of the same <b>clock,</b> placed there just over seventy years after the interior <b>clock</b> and driven by the same mechanism. The second <b>clock</b> face has two quarter jacks (which strike on the quarter-hour) {{in the form of}} knights in armour.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running <b>clock.</b> This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital <b>clock</b> that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller <b>clock</b> also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running <b>clock</b> is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent <b>clock</b> is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
50|$|The PIP {{relies on}} the IEEE 1588 topology, {{consisting}} of grandmaster <b>clocks</b> (GC), ordinary <b>clocks</b> (OC), boundary <b>clocks</b> (BC), transparent <b>clocks</b> (TC) and hybrid <b>clocks</b> (HC = TC&OC).|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Willard began {{manufacturing}} and commercializing traditional tall case <b>clocks</b> (referred to as longcase <b>clocks</b> {{outside of the}} US). These <b>clocks,</b> often called Grandfather <b>clocks</b> today, generally stood about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall [...] Although some other clockmakers produced wooden movement <b>clocks,</b> Willard made only <b>clocks</b> with brass movements. His tall case <b>clocks</b> were always of eight-day duration (other than extremely rare extended running <b>clocks).</b>|$|R
50|$|When Johann Baptist Beha died in 1898, {{his sons}} Lorenz (1865 - 1941) and Engelbert (1866 - 1949) {{continued}} {{with the company}} in Eisenbach. The manufacturing program consisted of; cuckoo/quail <b>clocks,</b> cuckoo <b>clocks</b> with echo, weight operated <b>clocks,</b> spring powered <b>clocks,</b> trumpeter <b>clocks,</b> monk ringing a monastery bell, calendar <b>clocks,</b> etc.|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the <b>clock.</b> The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the <b>clock</b> again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's <b>clock</b> management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the <b>clock</b> with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish <b>clock</b> and {{instrument}} maker, was {{the first}} to invent and patent the electric <b>clock</b> in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a <b>clock</b> in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the <b>clock</b> going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{mortuary}} inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, {{records that}} he constructed a night <b>clock</b> (horologium nocturnum) {{as early as}} 850, his <b>clock</b> {{has been identified as}} being an observation tube used to locate stars with an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than a mechanical or water <b>clock,</b> an interpretation supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Clock</b> Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). <b>Clock</b> Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted <b>Clock</b> Tower to feel like one.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clock</b> Tower, {{released}} in Japan as <b>Clock</b> Tower 2, is a survival horror point-and-click adventure game developed by Human Entertainment and released for the PlayStation in 1996. It {{is the second}} game in the <b>Clock</b> Tower series after the original <b>Clock</b> Tower, which was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom one year prior. The story takes place in Norway and follows a variety of characters {{as they attempt to}} survive the return of Scissorman and uncover the mystery of his seemingly immortal state.

25|$|The {{registers}} are <b>clocked</b> in a stop/go fashion using {{a majority}} rule. Each register has an associated <b>clocking</b> bit. At each cycle, the <b>clocking</b> bit {{of all three}} registers is examined and the majority bit is determined. A register is <b>clocked</b> if the <b>clocking</b> bit agrees with the majority bit. Hence at each step {{at least two or}} three registers are <b>clocked,</b> and each register steps with probability 3/4.|$|R

5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game <b>clock.</b> An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game <b>clock</b> based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate <b>clock,</b> the play <b>clock,</b> is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play <b>clock</b> expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play <b>clock</b> is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
40|$|In a Distributed System with N sites, {{the precise}} {{detection}} of causal relationships between events {{can only be}} done with vector <b>clocks</b> of size N. This gives rise to scalability and efficiency problems for accurate logical <b>clocks.</b> In this {{paper we propose a}} class of logical <b>clocks</b> called plausible <b>clocks</b> that can be implemented with a number of components not affected {{by the size of the}} system and yet they provide good ordering accuracy. We develop rules to combine plausible <b>clocks</b> to produce more accurate <b>clocks.</b> Several examples of plausible <b>clocks</b> and their combination are presented. Using a simulation model, we evaluate the performance of these <b>clocks.</b> We also present examples of applications where constant size <b>clocks</b> can be used...|$|R
50|$|A clockmaker is an artisan {{who makes}} and/or repairs <b>clocks.</b> Since almost all <b>clocks</b> are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair <b>clocks.</b> Modern clockmakers may be {{employed}} by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing <b>clocks</b> and watches. Clockmakers {{must be able}} to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of <b>clocks</b> and time pieces that vary from antique <b>clocks</b> to modern time pieces in order to fix and make <b>clocks</b> or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery.|$|R

5|$|Human Entertainment {{went out}} of {{business}} in 2000, and Sunsoft became the sole owner of the <b>Clock</b> Tower intellectual property. A new game in the series, <b>Clock</b> Tower 3, was officially announced on 11 April 2001, with Capcom revealing they would be co-developing it with Sunsoft. They also revealed that acclaimed Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku would be directing the cutscenes. The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth. Released in December later that year, <b>Clock</b> Tower 3 was a commercial failure. Capcom had projected sales of at least 450,000, {{but by the end of}} 2003, it had only sold 122,022 units. <b>Clock</b> Tower 3s commercial failure is speculated as the reason why Capcom and Sunsoft have not revisited the series since.|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} is Wells Cathedral <b>clock,</b> an astronomical <b>clock</b> from about 1325, {{believed to be}} the work of Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury. Its mechanism, dated to between 1386 and 1392, was replaced in the 19th century, and the original mechanism moved to the Science Museum in London, where it continues to operate. It is the second-oldest surviving <b>clock</b> in England, after the Salisbury cathedral <b>clock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} <b>clock</b> continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a <b>clock.</b> Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a <b>clock</b> based on that design. The first pendulum <b>clock</b> was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Clock</b> Tower {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception across its history. In retrospective reviews, the first title, <b>Clock</b> Tower (1995), received praise for its haunting atmosphere but {{was criticized for}} tedious puzzles and exploration. Despite these criticisms, it is considered instrumental in establishing the survival horror genre and a creating a model for future horror games to follow. Its sequel, <b>Clock</b> Tower (1996), was met with mixed reception as well. The horror themes and atmosphere were well received, but the game's point-and-click gameplay and slow pace {{were found to be}} inferior to the growing landscape of action games on the PlayStation, especially Capcom's first Resident Evil title, which was released the same year. The third title, <b>Clock</b> Tower II, was met with unfavorable reviews. Critics heavily criticized the slow point-and-click interface and the flawed trial-and-error gameplay. <b>Clock</b> Tower 3 received similar reviews to the first two titles. The graphics, atmosphere and storyline received positive reviews, but again, the gameplay was a point of criticism. Critics believed the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were weak.|$|E
