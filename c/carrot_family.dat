[...] These studies have shown possible inhibition of 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, which are initiators of skin tumors.

40|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} tried to {{identify}} a biscuitroot or desertparsley (Lomatium) or springparsley (Cymopterus) can ap-preciate how variable these plants can be. As a consequence of my fl oristic study of southeast-ern Oregon, most recently the Owyhee region, I often encounter unusual forms of plants. Sometimes these forms are just minor variations {{within the range of}} what might be expected for a given species, and other times the variations seem diff erent enough to warrant a closer look. Further investigation may include more fi eld observations, locating additional populations with the unusual characters, careful measure-ments and comparisons of these characters between closely related species, greenhouse or experimental manipulations, or even phyloge-netic analysis of DNA sequence data. At the small liberal arts college where I teach, some of these aberrant populations that “don’t read the books ” make for fun research projects for keen undergraduate students. Th at {{was the case in the}} mid- 2000 s when I suggested to my student, Kim Carlson, that she make some measurements on specimens of three species of Lomatium from southeastern Oregon and southwestern Idaho. Flowers in these “apioids ” (Apiaceae, the <b>carrot</b> and parsley <b>family)</b> are small and rather nondescript white, yellow, or sometimes purplish, reddish, or brownish-green. Easily recognized by the characteristic umbel, members of the genera Lomatium and Cymopterus harbor a wild and confusing variation in the fruits, leaves, stems and roots. Many new species are still being described, for two reasons: diff erences among species are subtle and many of these plants are restricted to very narrow geographic ranges (narrowly endemic). For example, within the past five years, scientists described eight new taxa within Lomatium in the Pacifi c Northwest: L. bentonitum from the Succor Creek area in southeastern Oregon, L. brunsfeldianum from northern Idaho, L. tarantuloides from th...|$|R
