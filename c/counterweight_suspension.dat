40|$|Traction drive {{elevator}} installations employ {{ropes of}} variable length as {{a mean of}} car and <b>counterweight</b> <b>suspension.</b> The inertial and elastic characteristics of elevator suspension systems depend on the rope construction and vary slowly during the elevator travel. The system suffers from vibrations caused by various sources of excitation. This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} dynamic response of the suspension system employing traditional steel wire ropes as well as ropes constructed of aramid fibers. The equations describing the lateral response of the system subjected to a boundary periodic excitation are solved numerically. The results show that the entire rope is subjected to repetitive low frequency transient resonances. Consequently, the structural integrity of the suspension ropes is compromised. The issue of active vibration control and the feasibility of the integration of shape memory alloy elements within the suspension rope design are discusse...|$|E
40|$|In-water {{testing is}} {{frequently}} used to simulate reduced gravity for quasi-static tasks. For dynamic motions, however, the assumption {{has been that}} drag effects invalidate any data, and in-water testing has been dismissed in favor of complex and restrictive techniques such as <b>counterweight</b> <b>suspension</b> and parabolic flight. In this study, motion-capture was used to estimate treadmill gait metrics for three environments: underwater and ballasted to 1 g and to 1 / 6 th g, and on dry land at 1 g. Ballast was distributed anthropometrically. Motion-capture results were compared with those for a simulated dynamic walker/runner, and {{used to assess the}} effect of the in-water environment on simulation fidelity. For each test case, the model was tuned to the subject's anthropometry, and stride length, pendulum frequency, and hip displacement were computed. In-water environmental effects were found to be sufficiently quantifiable to justify using in-water testing, under certain conditions, to study partial-gravity gait dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Long moving {{vertical}} {{ropes and}} cables {{are used in}} various engineering systems. In particular, in high-rise structures traction drive elevators they are employed {{as a means of}} car and <b>counterweight</b> <b>suspension</b> and for compensation of tensile forces over the traction sheave. Also, ropes are applied in the elevator governor systems to activate the safety gear in order to bring the car and counterweight safely to rest in the event of emergency and failure of the normal stopping system. An adverse situation arises when the host structure is excited near its fundamental natural frequency and vibrates harmonically. This often results in a passage through resonance conditions in the rope system when the slowly varying natural frequencies of the ropes approach the frequency of the inertial load resulting from the building sway. The nature of such a loading is usually nondeterministic and it is necessary to apply stochastic models to analyze the dynamic responses of the ropes. In this paper a model to describe the lateral dynamic behaviour of a vertical moving rope is developed. The model takes into account the fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the ropes is coupled with their transverse motions which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing nonstationary nonlinear equations are then solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the elevator travel. Then, the methodology to account for the stochastic nature of the building sway is discussed and the differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are developed. The stochastic differential equations are treated numerically to predict the variance of the rope response...|$|E
40|$|The {{drive system}} is a key {{component}} of an elevator installation that supplies energy into the system, coupling the car-rope and the counterweight-rope subsystems. However, it often becomes a source of excitation that is responsible for vibrations that compromise the car ride quality. In this paper a non-stationary distributed-parameter model describing vertical dynamics of an elevator system that accommodates the drive machine, the car, the <b>counterweight</b> and the <b>suspension</b> ropes has been developed. The model is used to analyze the influence of the drive machine on the elevator system performance. The dynamic behaviour is described by a set of partial differential equations. Those are discretized by expanding the vertical displacements in terms of the linear mode shapes to obtain a set of ordinary differential equations. The mode shapes correspond to a system composed of three masses constrained by a suspension rope. The discrete model is then solved numerically in Matlab-Simulink using parameters of a real installation. The numerical simulation results predict transient resonance phenomena in the system...|$|R
