50|$|In {{another study}} {{regarding}} {{the relationship of}} sexual ornaments and phenotypic integration, {{there seems to be}} a paradox where sexual traits are expected to be both less integrated for greater expression, and more integrated to better indicate physiological quality. However, in the case of the house finch, the female house finches select for males based on their likelihood to be a good parent. The females base their choice of male parental behaviors on the elaboration of the male’s sexual ornamentation. Thus, female choice favors hormonally <b>controlled</b> <b>integration</b> of male sexual behaviors and male sexual ornamentation.|$|R

40|$|In {{cognitive}} science {{there is a}} seeming paradox: On the one hand, studies of human judgment and decision making have repeatedly shown that people systematically violate optimal behavior when integrating information from multiple sources. On the other hand, optimal models, often Bayesian, have been successful at accounting for information integration in fields such as categorization, memory, and perception. This apparent conflict could be due, in part, to different materials and designs that lead to differences {{in the nature of}} processing. Stimuli that require <b>controlled</b> <b>integration</b> of information, such as the quantitative or linguistic information (commonly found in judgment studies), may lead to suboptimal performance. In contrast, perceptual stimuli may lend themselves to automatic processing, resulting in integration that is closer to optimal. We tested this hypothesis with an experiment in which participants categorized faces based on resemblance to a family patriarch. The amount of evidence contained in the top and bottom halves of each test face was independently manipulated. These data allow us to investigate a canonical example of sub-optimal information integration from the judgment and decision making literature, the dilution effect. Splitting the top and bottom halves of a face, a manipulation meant to encourage <b>controlled</b> <b>integration</b> of information, produced farther from optimal behavior and larger dilution effects. The Multi-component Information Accumulation model, a hybrid optimal/averaging model of information integration, successfully accounts for key accuracy, response time, and dilution effects...|$|R
