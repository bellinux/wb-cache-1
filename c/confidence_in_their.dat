5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires and Montevideo {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized Montevideo, but was overwhelmed {{by the forces of}} Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, in spite of the prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence {{that they did not have}} before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> independent capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which {{continued into the}} seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own literature. Part of the explanation for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in a naïve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E

Seventy participants enrolled in a master's level practicum course completed the Washington University Sentence Completion Test, a measure of ego development, and the Counseling Theory Survey, a survey developed by the researcher, {{in order to identify}} students' identified theoretical orientations, students' degrees of <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> identifying <b>their</b> theoretical orientations, and students' degrees of comfort <b>in</b> applying <b>their</b> theories <b>in</b> clinical practice. Ego development level was operationalized as a dichotomous variable consisting of level E 5 and below and E 6 and above, based on the developmental task attained at E 6 : a shift from emphasis on in-group identity to self-evaluated standards. To determine potential relationships between the students' ego development levels and their theoretical orientations and their orientations when classified by domain of emphasis, 2 x 4 and 2 x 3 Chi-square analyses were used. Independent t-tests were conducted to determine if the students' degrees of <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> identifying <b>their</b> theoretical orientation and their degrees of comfort <b>in</b> applying <b>their</b> orientation varied across the two groups. No statistically significant results were found. Alternative explanations for the identification of theoretical orientation, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are discussed with emphasis on the need for greater integration of current theories related to the identification of theoretical orientation...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{emphasis on the}} importance of making Graduate Attributes (GAs) explicit to students as part of their degree programme and the role of students themselves in proactively developing GAs. The aim of the present project was to encourage students to actively develop and reflect upon curricular and extra-curricular attributes at an earlier stage <b>in</b> <b>their</b> degree programme. To this end we developed and evaluated short-self-reflection exercises in second year (pre-honours) psychology practical classes which asked students to reflect on their curricular and extra-curricular activities and how the practical skills gained from these activities are linked to graduate attributes. Activities were followed by careers workshops focused on gaining <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> communicating graduate attributes in an interview context, and the benefits of engaging with professional networking sites. We evaluated the impact of these activities on: 1) students’ levels of self-efficacy in specific GAs before and after the in class exercises; 2) students' <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> presenting <b>their</b> GAs <b>in</b> an interview situation; 3) student awareness of professional networking sites. The activities resulted in increased self- efficacy ratings after the GAS reflection, increased <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> presenting <b>their</b> GAs after the careers workshops, and an increased awareness of professional networking sites. The effectiveness of these activities as a method to increase student engagement <b>in</b> developing <b>their</b> GAs will be discussed in the wider context of embedding GAs and employability in pre-honours programmes across STEM disciplines...|$|R

We investigate two voting schemes: simple voting where voters have equal weight and weighted voting where weights depend on classifiers' <b>confidences</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> predictions. We consider ways to form such subsets for improved performance: When the training set is small, voting improves performance considerably. If the training set is not small, then voters converge to similar solutions and we do not gain anything by voting. To alleviate this, when the training set is of intermediate size, we use bootstrapping to generate smaller training sets over which we train the voters. Wh [...] ...|$|R
