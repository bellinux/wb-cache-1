Over the years, the problem has received a lot of attention. For linear systems the regulator problem was extensively studied in [4] and [5]. For nonlinear systems, the problem was first studied in [6] and afterwards in [7] {{on the one hand and}} [ [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Servo {{control is}} {{achieved}} by sending a servo a PWM (pulse-width modulation) signal, a series of repeating pulses of variable width where either {{the width of the}} pulse (most common modern hobby servos) or the duty cycle of a pulse train (less common today) determines the position to be achieved by the servo. The PWM signal might come from a radio <b>control</b> <b>receiver</b> to the servo or from common microcontrollers such as the Arduino.|$|E
50|$|Rotary {{switches}} {{were used}} as channel selectors on television receivers until the early 1970s, as range selectors on electrical metering equipment, as band selectors on multi-band radios and other similar purposes. In industry, rotary switches are used for control of measuring instruments, switchgear, or in control circuits. For example, a radio controlled overhead crane may have a large multi-circuit rotary switch to transfer hard-wired control signals from the local manual controls in the cab to the outputs of the remote <b>control</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{miniature}} RK61/2 thyratron marketed in 1938 {{was designed}} specifically to operate like a vacuum triode below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in radio <b>control</b> <b>receivers,</b> and was the major technical development {{which led to the}} wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of radio controlled modelling as a hobby.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1950s, New Zealand has had {{a system}} of load {{management}} based on ripple control, allowing the electricity supply for domestic and commercial water storage heaters to be switched off and on, as well as allowing remote control of nightstore heaters and street lights. Ripple injection equipment located within each local distribution network signals to ripple <b>control</b> <b>receivers</b> at the customer's premises. Control may either done manually by the local distribution network company in response to local outages or requests to reduce demand from the transmission system operator (i.e. Transpower), or automatically when injection equipment detects mains frequency falling below 49.2 Hz. Ripple <b>control</b> <b>receivers</b> are {{assigned to one of}} several ripple channels to allow the network company to only turn off supply on part of the network, and to allow staged restoration of supply to reduce the impact of a surge in demand when power is restored to water heaters after a period of time off.|$|R

A new specially designed wireless computer keyboard for MCE 2005 was released September 2005.|$|E
5000|$|With {{distributed}} power, long trains e.g. ore trains on mining lines {{may have}} locomotives {{at each end}} and at intermediate locations in the train to reduce the maximum drawbar load. The locomotives are often radio controlled from the lead locomotive by the Locotrol system. Remote control locomotives e.g. [...] "switchers" [...] in hump yards may be controlled by a stationary operator. These types of remote control systems often use the AAR MU standard which allows any locomotive using the AAR Mu standard to be easily [...] "MU'ed" [...] to a <b>control</b> <b>receiver</b> and thus capable of becoming remote-controlled.|$|E
50|$|When Horrible {{remotely}} {{drives the}} van away, Captain Hammer appears and takes over Horrible's song, smashing the remote <b>control</b> <b>receiver</b> and inadvertently causing the van to veer towards Penny. Hammer pushes {{her out of}} the way (into a pile of garbage) just as Horrible regains control of the van and stops it, making it appear that Captain Hammer stopped the van with his bare hands. The two confront each other, with Hammer slamming Horrible's head on the van's hood, but Penny emerges to thank Hammer, making him forget about beating up Dr. Horrible. As Hammer and Penny serenade each other, Horrible glares at them while he makes off with the wonderflonium.|$|E

5000|$|Standby {{power is}} {{electrical}} power used by appliances and equipment while switched off or not performing their primary function, often {{waiting to be}} activated by a remote controller. That power is consumed by internal or external power supplies, remote <b>control</b> <b>receivers,</b> text or light displays, circuits energized when the device is plugged in even when switched off, etc. Power can be saved by disconnecting such devices, causing at worst only inconvenience.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{multicast}} congestion <b>control,</b> <b>receivers</b> can misbehave by maliciously causing congestion {{to steal}} network bandwidth from well behaved flows. In source driven congestion <b>control</b> protocols (SDCC), <b>receivers</b> misbehave {{by sending a}} wrong feedback to the source. In receiverdriven congestion <b>control</b> protocols(RDCC), <b>receivers</b> misbehave by inflating their subscriptions. In this report, we present techniques {{to deal with these}} misbehaviours. Firstly, we show that when network tomography tools such as MINC are used in conjunction with SDCC protocols, they can aid in misbehavior detection. But in order to use MINC for misbehaviour detection, MINC itself must be made immune to misbehaviour. we analyze the effect of misbehavior within MINC and propose two techniques to detect and prevent misbehavior in MINC. For RDCC protocols, a misbehaviour prevention mechanism based on in-band distribution of keys was recently proposed for FLID-DL protocol. In this report, we show how we can design keys which can prevent misbehaviour in most RDCC protocols...|$|R
50|$|For MineCam 4, {{the final}} major {{development}} was a pan motor. It {{was difficult to}} arrange a system which allowed 360 degree rotation of the tilt yoke whilst maintaining connections for video, tilt servo, lighting power, camera power and flux-gate sensor. An RS Components geared dc servo motor was used, driven from the remote <b>control</b> <b>receiver,</b> and a thrust bearing and Oldham coupler. The motor's powerful magnet interfered with the compass sensor so a sheet of mu-metal donated by a helpful local firm was formed into a screen round the whole motor & gearbox assembly. The tilt servo {{did not seem to}} cause the same problem, as it is smaller and rotates with the sensor on the yoke. Wherever possible, all hardware is plastic or non-ferrous metal.|$|E
50|$|A reed's {{resonant}} frequency is a mid-range audible frequency of perhaps 300 Hz. The solenoid {{is driven by}} the output of the radio <b>control</b> <b>receiver,</b> which is an audio tone or tones. If the receiver output contains the appropriate tone for the {{resonant frequency}} of a reed, that reed would be made to vibrate. As the reed vibrates, it touches a contact screw above its free end. These contacts form the output of the decoder. Decoder outputs are generally fed to small relays. These allow a high current load to be controlled, such as the model's propulsion motor. Using a relay also adds a damping time constant to the output, so that the intermittent contact with the reed contact (which is vibrating at the transmitter audible tone frequency) becomes a continuous output signal.|$|E
50|$|This model {{represents}} a typical Edwardian or interwar 2-seat racing car used for long distance races {{such as the}} Le Mans 24 Hour Race. Whilst using the same basic chassis and layout as the Roadster and Limo, it has a two-cylinder uni-directional engine, with external cylinders {{on each side of}} the chassis to provide more power. It has an open 'cockpit' with an aerodynamic sloped rear end. It is painted with either red or blue bodywork, including fenders and wheels, with a chrome boiler cowl. It carries the racing number '12'. Although the model uses the same running gear and pistons as the other engines in the range, it is actually the fastest in the mobile Mamod lineup. This particular model is suitable for a radio <b>control</b> <b>receiver</b> to be fitted to control the steering mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1967, SEIMM (Società Esercizio Industrie Moto Meccaniche), a state <b>controlled</b> <b>receiver,</b> took {{ownership}} of Moto Guzzi. The SEIMM oversight saw Moto Guzzi adapting to a cultural {{shift away from}} motorcycles to automobiles. The company focused on popular lightweight mopeds including the Dingo and Trotter [...] and the 125cc Stornello motorcycle. Also during the SEIMM years Guzzi developed the 90° V twin engine, designed by Giulio Cesare Carcano, which would become iconic of Moto Guzzi.|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} Design, {{development and}} realisation of low cost and high flexible compact system for testing of ripple <b>control</b> <b>receivers.</b> Designed system provides an automatic test running, a saving of measured data and a test protocol generation. The solution The requirement of an {{automatic data processing}} and an evaluation suggests to use a computer as a control device of a test system. This premise conducts to design a prototype of a test system using virtual instrumentation based on PC plug-in boards. This solution is cheaper and more variable than the system consists from stand-alone instruments connected by IEEE 488 bus. A system for the automatic quality testing of ripple <b>control</b> <b>receivers</b> based on virtual instrumentation was designed and developed.

5000|$|On June 13, 1944, a V-2 rocket {{under test}} by the Germans (test rocket V-89, serial number 4089) from Peenemünde crashed in Sweden after the rocket had flown into cumulus clouds which had strayed into the controller's line of sight. It was {{supposed}} to crash in the sea outside Bornholm in occupied Denmark. [...] V-89 contained a FuG 230 Straßburg radio <b>control</b> <b>receiver</b> unit, normally commanded by a remote FuG 203 Kehl joystick-equipped radio control transmitter set that had also been meant for use with the Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile, (code named Burgund), as a development of the same FuG 203/230 equipment pairing used to guide both the Fritz X gravity-propulsion guided ordnance and the Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb. The ground controller appeared to have no trouble manoeuvring the rocket until it disappeared into the high cloud layer.|$|E
50|$|The VB-13, redesignated ASM-A-1 in 1948, was {{developed}} under the project code MX-674. It had an annular wing around the midsection of its body, mounted near the weapons center of gravity. At {{the rear of}} the bomb was an octagonal tail surface containing the Razon control surfaces. Intended to be carryed by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, the Tarzon bomb used the combination of AN/ARW-38 Army Navy, Piloted Aircraft, Radio, Automatic Flight or Remote Control command link transmitter on the B-29 and an AN/URW-2 Army Navy, Utility, Radio, Automatic Flight or Remote <b>Control</b> <b>receiver</b> on the Tarzon to provide manual command guidance of range and azimuth. This was done with visual tracking of the bombs course, aided by a flare mounted in the tail of the weapon. Gyroscopes on board the ASM-A-1 aided in stabilisation, while a pneumatic system drove the bombs control surfaces. The guidance system was considered effective; Tarzon proved in testing to have an accuracy of 280 ft.|$|E
50|$|In an {{electric-powered}} radio controlled model, the BEC {{is typically}} {{part of the}} electronic speed control (ESC). BEC allows such a model to carry only one battery (the motive power battery) instead of two (motive power, and a separate battery to operate the R/C equipment). A BEC-equipped ESC meant for airplane use often incorporates a low-voltage-cutoff (LVC) circuit which can sense the voltage drop caused when the battery has little charge left in it. It then cuts the power to the 'drive' motor {{in order to provide}} the 'steering' servo(s) with enough power to be able to bring the model safely back to the operator. The power to the propeller would be cut but the operation of the control surfaces would be maintained in order to perform a dead-stick landing. Without this feature, all control would be lost when the battery expired, probably resulting in the destruction of the model. In some cases, the BEC is part of the radio <b>control</b> <b>receiver,</b> instead of being part of the ESC.|$|E
5000|$|Remote control - Remote <b>control</b> <b>receivers</b> receive digital {{commands}} {{that control}} the device, which may be as complex as a space vehicle or unmanned aerial vehicle, or {{as simple as a}} garage door opener. Remote control systems often also incorporate a telemetry channel to transmit data {{on the state of the}} controlled device back to the controller. Radio controlled model and other models include multichannel recievers in model cars, boats, airplanes, and helicopters. A short-range radio system is used in keyless entry systems.|$|R
5000|$|... Dynamic Control - Dynamically <b>controlled</b> <b>receivers</b> {{are capable}} of {{choosing}} from the above processing schemes for whenever the situation arises. While much more complex, they optimize the power vs. performance trade-off. Transitions between modes and/or antenna connections are signaled by {{a change in the}} perceived quality of the link. In situations of low fading, the receiver can employ no diversity and use the signal presented by a single antenna. As conditions degrade, the receiver can then assume the more highly reliable but power-hungry modes described above.|$|R
