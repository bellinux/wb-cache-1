50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences. The engine mounts are one example along with the oil filter mounting, power steering pump, ECU, timing belt cover and probably the gearbox setup. The <b>camshaft</b> <b>pulleys</b> were inverted by Renault making the Volvo timing marks redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist alignment tool to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus {{was described}} in 22 pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and a model-based dosage <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> that may assist with therapy in new patients was developed. Patients received tacrolimus by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion (0. 03 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1)) starting. 2 days before transplantation, with conversion to oral therapy 2 - 3 weeks after transplant. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM. A Bayesian dosage <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> that searches for individual parameter estimates to describe concentration measurements, counterbalanced by the final population model, was created in Excel. Typical clearance was 106 mL. h(- 1). kg(- 0. 75), typical distribution volume was 3. 71 L/kg, and typical bioavailability was 15. 7 %. Tacrolimus clearance decreased with increasing serum creatinine, and bioavailability decreased with postoperative day. A Bayesian dosage <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> capable of suggesting an initial infusion rate based on patient covariate values and devising a further individualized dosage regimen as drug concentration measures become available was developed. Predictions from the model showed that current IV dose recommendations of 0. 03 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) may potentially produce toxic drug concentrations in this patient population, whereas current oral conversion of 4 times the adjusted IV dose may lead to subtherapeutic concentrations. A more suitable infusion rate to obtain a steady state concentration of 12 ng/mL was predicted to be 0. 035 mg. kg(- 0. 75). d(- 1). An additional loading dose of 0. 07 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) (total dose: 0. 07 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) + 0. 035 mg. kg(- 0. 75). d(- 1)) during the first 24 hours of therapy should allow rapid achievement of steady state concentrations. A conversion factor of 6 from TV to enteric therapy may be more suitable. Such dosage recommendations may be site specific. The appropriateness of targets was not investigated in this Study. The Bayesian dosing <b>adjustment</b> <b>tool</b> and suggested dose recommendations need to be evaluated in a prospective Study {{before they can be}} applied in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|Rigidly {{foldable}} shells offer tremendous {{potential for}} developing kinetic architectural structures. However, the added element of motion poses new design challenges. Initially, sketchy shell geometry is constructed {{to reflect the}} intended form. Further steps involve assuring an error free folding within a range that satisfies desired functional requirements. The kinematics of a parallel topology of the shell's geometry is difficult to express algorithmically what prevents from developing of automated <b>adjustment</b> <b>tools</b> based on computational methods. The geometry can be adjusted manually based on intuitive observations, however the process is tedious, time consuming and unpredictable. This paper develops automated <b>adjustment</b> <b>tools</b> based on the intuitive approach of a human designer. The study applies the fuzzy logic formalism as a computational interface between human approach and structured adjustments to the geometry. The advantages of fuzzy logic stem from its natural ability to represent human knowledge and effectiveness in reconciling ambiguities, uncertainties and redundancies that the intuitive human approach brings along. The development steps of fuzzy logic based algorithm are presented. Performed evaluation tests {{and the results are}} discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mechanical {{behaviour}} {{of power}} transmission systems {{have to be}} defined during preliminary design. Numerical simulations such as Finite Elements Analysis is the method used to design transmission components. This method aims to replace classical tests after experimental validation of computer software results. Sintered <b>camshaft</b> <b>pulleys</b> are designed using the same way. Design of this component can be optimised by simulating the quasi-static response of timing belt camshaft layout on a pulley under loading. The quasi-static belt response {{is related to the}} local behaviour of the transmission system while dynamic response of the whole camshaft layout is related to global behaviour. Because of the complex phenomena involved in such system and due to practical requirements of design office in terms of computer time, local and global analyses are performed separately, however, results from local analysis is used as input data for the second one. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the quasi-static behaviour of a timing belt setting on a pulley subjected to a torque. In order to take the environmental effects into account, the interaction between the belt and pulley is analysed with and without clearance. The analysis is performed using Abaqus Standard. The Finite Elements results show a significant influence of clearance on stresses distribution throughout the belt. When the belt is set up on pulley with clearance, reverse bending stresses are observed between the groove and teeth pulley, creating a polygonal effect. This effect generates a transmission error which may cause vibrations and then alter the behaviour of the belt during engine working. Without clearance between the two components, polygonal effect and transmission error are insignificant, and therefore dynamic excitations are smaller. Clearance is probably one of the major parameters governing the fatigue life of timing belt. Polygonal effect and quasi-static transmission error then constitute one of the input data for global dynamic simulations using a specific in-house...|$|R

40|$|Learning Management Systems (LMSs) {{have become}} a larger part of {{teaching}} and learning in the modern world. Therefore has Moodle, a free and open source e-learning tool surfaced and gained a lot of attraction and downloads. A purpose of this study has been to develop a new local plugin in Moodle with guidelines from Magnus Eriksson and Tsedey Terefe. A purpose for this project has also been to build a plugin which has the functions Date rollover and Individual date adjustment. Mid Sweden University (Miun) stated that WebCT/Blackboard was in use before Moodle and some other LMSs and the dissatisfaction with WebCT/Blackboard was rife, however some teachers liked it. Therefore WebCT/Blackboard was abandoned and Moodle was embraced. The methods of gaining information has generally been web based sources and three interviews, likewise called user tests. Programs and other aids that have been used include but are not limited to: Google Drive, LTI Provider, Moodle, Moodle documentation, Notepad++, PHP and XAMPP. The plugin has been implemented as a local plugin. The result has shown that the coded plugin, Date <b>adjustment</b> <b>tools</b> could be improved and that it was changed. In the plugin, support for old American English dates were added and the code for using the two functions “Date rollover” and “Individual date adjustment” were rewritten to not interfere with one another.

Belt dressings are typically liquids that are poured, brushed, dripped, or sprayed onto the belt surface and allowed to spread around; they are meant to recondition the belt's driving surfaces and increase friction between the belt and the pulleys.
