5000|$|The {{new church}} was {{designed}} by Eiermann and consists of four buildings grouped around <b>the</b> remaining ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old church.

25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve <b>the</b> high standards <b>of</b> clarity and <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman methods, due mainly to <b>the</b> great variability <b>of</b> colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass. For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixteenth century <b>the</b> decolourising powers <b>of</b> manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> carbon left in the wood ash also may affect <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> by modifying <b>the</b> furnace atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> in York Minster {{has been shown to be}} 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|R

Ruby-glass {{is made by}} <b>the</b> {{addition}} <b>of</b> {{traces of}} gold chloride to an ordinary fused glass; <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> so obtained is at first colourless and only assumes a ruby colour during subsequent prolonged heating. When an intensely luminous electric beam is passed tangentially through a small cylinder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colourless gold-glass, practically no internal illumination is visible; in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruby-glass, however, a yellowish-brown, luminous trace is produced, probably due to reflection from minute particles <b>of</b> metallic gold. <b>The</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruby-glass depends on <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> its reheating, and determines <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> illumination necessary to produce a visible trace; <b>the</b> deeper <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>the</b> less illumination is required. In <b>the</b> colourless <b>glass,</b> <b>the</b> gold probably exists {{in a state of}} extreme subdivision, and the reheating which produces the ruby colour brings about a coarser colloidal aggregation, similar to that which takes place in gelatino-bromide plates during maturation (de Bruyn, Rec. Trav. Chim., 1900, 19, 236). Red glass coloured by copper, and yellow glass coloured by silver, show respectively dull brown and greyish luminous traces, due to the finely divided metals. Glasses coloured by silicates of iron, chromium, manganese, and cobalt show only a faint luminous trace, and, allowing for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> small air bubbles, are optically "void" (vide). Glasses which are colourless of themselves show a faint bluish trace and are yellow when viewed through a great length; they thus resemble media containing an extremely minute turbidity (compare Abstr., 1899, ii, 537, 585). Glass decolorised by manganese compounds shows an intensely green fluorescence, the luminous trace being green when the incident light is either violet or blue, but suppressed when it is green, yellow, or red. Glasses containing iron alone or manganese alone are not fluorescent. Reprinted with <b>the</b> permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Chemical Society. Copyright © 2010.

Brill was {{called upon to}} conduct scientific investigations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> huge amount <b>of</b> material generated at the site, in order to exploit <b>the</b> full potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artefacts; after all, the site was being excavated specifically because of {{its role as a}} glass factory (Brill 1988). <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> vast quantity <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> fragments from Jalame, both vessel sherds and cullet, most were aqua and green and all were soda-lime-silica glasses melted in highly reducing conditions (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Where the melting conditions had been increasingly reducing, a ferri-sulfide chromophore complex was shown to have formed, thus changing <b>the</b> bluey-aqua <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> to an olive, or even an amber shade (Schreurs and Brill 1984).

Whilst work at Beth She’Arim had eventually found there to be five firing chambers responsible for heating the one tank, the fragmentary remains at Jalame made it very difficult to interpret the furnace set-up, apart from the fact that they believed there to have been only one firing chamber (Brill 1988).|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Drug-related cues may acquire {{incentive}} properties through classical conditioning. Objective: The {{present study}} investigated whether arbitrary stimuli {{paired with a}} low dose of alcohol would evoke differential skin conductance, salivary, craving and attentional orienting responses compared to arbitrary stimuli paired with vehicle {{in a sample of}} social drinkers. Methods: A discriminative classical conditioning procedure was employed, in which subjects repeatedly consumed two drinks, which differed in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flavour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drink and <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> in which it was administered. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drinks (CS+) always contained 0. 2 g/kg ethanol in flavoured tonic water and the other drink (CS-) always contained flavoured tonic water only. Alcohol craving, amount of salivation, and skin conductance level were measured in response to CS+ and CS- during conditioning training. After conditioning training, the frequency with which subjects directed their attention to CS+ and CS- drinks and their choice of drinks was assessed. Results: Comparable taste intensity ratings were given for alcohol and placebo drinks. Higher ratings <b>of</b> craving in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> CS+ and higher feelings of "lightheaded", "relaxed" and "contented" after consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CS+ drink (compared with CS-) were observed over successive conditioning sessions. Skin conductance level was also higher in response to CS+ compared to CS-. After conditioning sessions were completed, subjects shifted their gaze more frequently towards CS+ than CS-, although they did not choose to consume more CS+ than CS- drinks when instructed to choose between them. Conclusions: These data suggest that conditioned responses to an arbitrary cue paired with alcohol will develop rapidly and provide further support for incentive salience theories of drug addiction...|$|R

The chemical data allow identification of a group of four beads characterised by a mixed alkali composition, typical of FrattesinaFinal Bronze Age production. All the other samples have low levels of K 2 O (, 2 wt%) and relatively high Na 2 O (. 15 wt%). Among these last samples, which can be classified as natron-based glass, a number of blue beads show a high quantity of MgO (about 3 wt%), in combination with a low K 2 O amount. These low-K, high-Mg glasses also exhibit extremely high amounts of Al 2 O 3, possibly due to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Co-bearing alum as colouring compound.

40|$|Total {{stations}} are used extensively for taking geodetic and engineering survey measurements. These measurements are {{made possible by}} accurate observation of targeted points. One example is deformation surveys (slope stability monitoring) in mines. Continuous monitoring necessitates sheltering or housing the instrument to protect it against harsh weather conditions that are characteristic of mining environments. This research was carried out to investigate and propagate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> atmospheric variations and how these impact on total station observations taken through a shelter (window) glass in a surface mine environment. Tests and analysis were performed at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Witwatersrand by setting up a total station permanently in a shelter with removable window glass of different properties (thickness, colour and shape). The data collected was subjected to the atmospheric corrections formulae proposed by the instrument manufacturer. The results can be summarized as follows:  Current formulae for systematic survey error corrections adequately compensate for atmospheric parameters variation during distance measurements when measurements are not taken through <b>glass.</b>  <b>The</b> research established that <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> matter when taking total station distance measurements through a closed <b>glass.</b> <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> {{has little or no}} impact on vertical distance measurements but its impact on horizontal distance measurements increases as glass thickness and tint (colour) increase. The impact remains unchanged after atmospheric corrections formulae are applied which require additional error propagation.  The research also revealed that glass thickness of less than 3. 0 mm has no effect on the accuracy specification limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument, while a thickness of more than 3. 0 mm causes errors in horizontal distances observed through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> regardless <b>of</b> different angles intersecting <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b>  There is also positive correlation between the expected error and <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b>  <b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> has an impact on distance measurements. However, it is advisable to use only flat glass for total station observation windows; otherwise further research must be carried out to model <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> shape.  <b>The</b> distance between the total station and the observation window has no impact on distance accuracy. However, it is advisable to keep the distance between the total station and the observation window as short as practical. Therefore, distance measurements through any glass medium must either be avoided or the distance must be corrected. If distance must be measured through a <b>glass</b> medium, <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> material must be carefully considered when selecting <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> for <b>the</b> observation house sheltering the total station. This thesis develops a systematic error correction formula to remove <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> thickness on distance measurements. A second formula is proposed to cater for <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> tinted <b>glass</b> on horizontal distance measurements. The formulae are tested on new set of distance readings taken at the University campus and in an open pit mine to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicate that all horizontal distances measured through glass accurately conform to the accuracy limits specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total station after applying <b>the</b> developed <b>glass</b> impact correction formulae. The propagation formulae were also incorporated in software called Agcomo, which can be used to propagate total station systematic errors at mines during monitoring surveys. The software performs well in removing both the atmospheric variations impact and <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> properties impact on distance measurements. It has <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> performing atmospheric corrections alone or combine atmospheric and <b>glass</b> corrections when <b>the</b> need arises.

40|$|International audienceManganese is a {{chemical}} element {{used as a}} colourizer in glass industry since antiquity. Its capacity to be present under various oxidation states makes it responsible of a large variety of colourations. In its oxidized state (Mn 3 +), it imparts a strong purple to violet colour (dependant on matrix composition). Combined with iron, manganese often plays <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a decolourizer leading to uncoloured glasses mainly used to represent hands and faces in glass windows (see for example Ferrand et al., 2015). <b>The</b> exact understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> involved reactions is however not complete and might provide information about <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> technology used in these ancient times. A series of glasses has been synthesized in order to relate <b>the</b> colouration <b>of</b> <b>glasses</b> with <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> synthesis (temperature, atmosphere, glass composition). Two temperatures have been used (1200 and 1550 °C). Glasses have been synthesized under air or under reducing atmosphere (H 2 /N 2). <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> composition has been chosen on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> a large range of medieval glasses compositions for what concerns the main oxides (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, K 2 O, Na 2 O, CaO, MgO). The MnO (resp. FeO) content has been varied between 1. 5 -x wt% (resp. x wt%), x varying from 0 to 1. 5. Glass compositions have been checked by microprobe analysis at <b>the</b> Camparis facility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paris 6 university. Optical absorption spectra in the UV-Vis-NIR range have been measured at <b>the</b> Institute <b>of</b> Geochemistry, Mineralogy and Ore Formation in Kiev (UV-Vis) in the range 32000 - 6000 cm- 1 and at the Technical University in Berlin (NIR) in the range 7000 - 1000 cm- 1. <b>The</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>glasses</b> has been characterized within the CIE 1931 model. For a given temperature, results show that <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> Mn in a Fe-rich glass composition implies a decreasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentration in Fe 2 + and an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentration in Fe 3 +. When the uncoloured composition is reached a further increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mn content leads to glasses with a persistent pink colouration. However, results also show that uncoloured glasses are obtained for different contents of Mn according to the temperature used for the synthesis suggesting that the reaction between Mn and Fe {{is not a simple}} redox reaction. <b>The</b> content <b>of</b> Mn necessary to decolourize a glass made at 1200 °C is much lower than the one at 1550 °C. Finally, annealing an uncoloured glass in air leads to <b>the</b> reappearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pink colouration characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> Mn 3 +. <b>The</b> present set <b>of</b> <b>glasses</b> synthesized in variable conditions helps deciphering <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> making in ancient times. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> temperature combined with atmosphere and glass composition might provide clues to <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> ancient <b>glass</b> technology...|$|R

In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists.

During the 19th century {{a great number of}} churches were restored by Viollet-le-Duc. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval <b>glass,</b> both in <b>the</b> artwork and in <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> itself. <b>The</b> pioneers were Henri Gèrente and André Lusson.Other glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by <b>the</b> brilliant cerulean <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue backgrounds (as against <b>the</b> purple-blue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> Chartres) and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> pink and mauve glass.|$|R
