5|$|During {{her years}} in Minneapolis, Hickok {{lived with a}} society {{reporter}} named Ella Morse, {{with whom she had}} an eight-year relationship. In 1926, Hickok was diagnosed with diabetes, and Morse persuaded her take a year's leave from the newspaper so the pair could travel to San Francisco and Hickok <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> novel. At the beginning of the leave, however, Morse unexpectedly eloped with an ex-boyfriend, leaving Hickok devastated. Unable to face a return to Minneapolis, Hickok moved to New York, landing a job with the New York Daily Mirror.|$|E
5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld. Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> faster texture mapper. Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.|$|E
5|$|South Pacific is {{a musical}} {{composed}} by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan. The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway {{and was an}} immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot of the musical is based on James A. Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several of those stories. Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, would send a strong progressive message on racism.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{novel was}} based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> screenplay of the novel, she agreed {{in part because of}} his ability as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|He {{was tried}} and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence– {{execution}} by hanging– {{was to be}} carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two failed suicide attempts with his wife, who {{died as a result of}} the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp's Confession was published in 1826. Some editions included The Letters of Ann Cook as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.|$|E

25|$|The {{first series}} {{was created in}} 1953, soon after Riders of the Range (a popular Western, also written by Chilton) ended its six series on the BBC Light Programme. Michael Standing, then Head of the BBC Variety Department, asked Chilton if he <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> sci-fi programme, and Journey to the Moon (later known as Operation Luna) was the result. Each half-hour episode would usually end with a {{dramatic}} cliffhanger, to increase the audience's incentive to tune into the next episode.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the survey}} {{required}} a short answer portion where participants <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> sentence or so to explain some answers given. Several said they also felt an extreme amount of shame or continued sadness because they had blamed themselves for their partner’s straying. “Because maybe it was my fault,” said one survey-taker, a female in her 20s, who experienced {{a high level of}} shame. The survey revealed that 72% of the participants self-esteem was directly affected when their partners cheated on them (Johnson, 2017).|$|E
25|$|In Netanya, {{they had}} {{observed}} that the streets were filled with British military vehicles patrolling the town, and as a result, {{they were in a}} rush to carry out the hangings quickly, lest they get caught in the act. Starting at around 6:00 PM, Paice and Martin were individually taken out of the hatch, hustled into the next room, hooded, tied by the wrists and ankles, stood on a chair, had a noose placed around their necks and then, by the kicking away of the chair, hanged. The first man to be pulled out asked if he <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> message, but was told that there was no time. After twenty minutes, the bodies were taken down.|$|E

500|$|Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son, and {{his name}} was {{featured}} on its dedication page.

Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he <b>could</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright".

Bublé was referenced in the previous episode, [...] "Señor Macho Solo", as Hayek's character teases Baldwin's Jack over his many album collections of the singer.

However, {{when it came time}} to pick the right take, he opted for the first because it sounded [...] "more raw and more off-the-cuff." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Good Old Days" [...] is about a psychopath fondly remembering his childhood. Yankovic described the song as an [...] "experiment".
