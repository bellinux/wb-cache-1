In the proposed model, among each mobile <b>communicating</b> <b>pair,</b> one is considered to be stationary while the other is moving with a speed relative to the first one.

40|$|Abstract— 60 GHz is well-suited for {{device-to-device}} {{communication and}} for general in-home applications {{due to its}} huge available bandwidth. However, links at this frequency are easily degraded by environmental conditions. Indeed, the poor multipath makes it necessary to maintain good LoS (Line of Sight) paths between <b>communicating</b> <b>pairs</b> of nodes. In this paper we analyze the problem of link breakage and degradation in point-to-point 60 GHz networks. We propose using repeaters to provide alternate paths between communicating nodes when the direct path degrades. The decision on which path to use {{is driven by the}} goal of maximizing data rate per connection as well as overall throughput in the network. Using extensive simulations we show that by carefully using repeaters, we can maintain Gbps rates for each <b>pair</b> of <b>communicating</b> nodes in indoor spaces. We develop an efficient distributed algorithm for allocating repeaters to links as needed and explicitly deal with the problem of interference caused by the repeaters themselves. Finally, we study the scalability of the solution with increasing numbers of <b>communicating</b> <b>pairs</b> and show that Gbps rates can be maintained even when there are as many as eight <b>communicating</b> <b>pairs</b> in a small 10 mx 10 m room.

40|$|Optimal {{resource}} allocation with an objective of maximizing the system capacity is an NP-hard problem in multihop cellular networks. Hence, different heuristic algorithms {{have been developed}} {{over the years that}} would improve the network system capacity. In this paper, a novel cluster-based architecture is proposed for a two-hop cellular network whereby the transmission distance between any <b>communicating</b> <b>pair</b> is restricted to half the cell radius. In this design, a given radio resource is used by two simultaneously communicating pairs in every hexagonal cell, but for only half the time slot period. The characteristic feature of this cluster-based design is that it enables a frequency reuse ratio of one. The proposed hierarchical system is analyzed and tested under realistic propagation conditions including lognormal shadowing. It has been observed that the system capacity of a cluster-based design is 2. 5 times that obtained from the single-hop cellular system with no relaying. In addition, the cluster-based design achieves higher capacity compared to state-of-the-art two-hop algorithms. This is an important finding since the hierarchical cluster-based approach has fewer degrees of freedom in the selection of the routing path for the end-to-end connection. Practical routing algorithms should be able to benefit from this...|$|E

First, we provide some definitions towards a framework for analyzing multi-modal communications. Then,we study the relationship of the two communication modes and quantify several aspects of correlation and inference.

We compare the behavior between China and the U. S. and we find several similarities and differences. For example, we find evidence of an after-lunch siesta among Chinese users. Finally, we study the evolution of the two modes over time.

Though our main motivation is related to communications in nanonetworks with electrons that carry magnetic spin as the bipolar information, one can also imagine that the particles may be molecules that use chirality to convey information. Since {{it is difficult for}} a particle to carry an identifier that conveys the identity of the “source” or “destination”, each node receives particles whose source cannot be ascertained since physical imperfections may result in particles being directed to the wrong destination in a manner that interferes with the correctly directed particles, and particles that should arrive at a node may be received by some other node. In addition, noise may randomly switch the polarity of particles, {{and in the case of}} magnetic spin we can also have the effect of entanglement. We estimate the error probability in such a multipoint network as a function of the rate of flow of particles, and the power consumption per <b>communicating</b> <b>pair</b> of nodes.

40|$|Abstract—Networks with {{homogeneous}} routing nodes are con-stantly at risk as any vulnerability found {{against a}} node {{could be used}} to compromise all nodes. Introducing diversity among nodes can be used to address this problem. With few variants, the choice of assignment of variants to nodes is critical to the overall network resiliency. We present the Diversity Assignment Problem (DAP), the assignment of variants to nodes in a network, and we show how to compute the optimal solution in medium-size networks. We also present a greedy approximation to DAP that scales well to large networks. Our solution shows that a high level of overall network resiliency can be obtained even from variants that are weak on their own. We provide two variations of our problem to meet real-world system needs. First, for networks with knowledge of higher-level protocols we offer a technique to create assignments that maximize the needs of a specific application (e. g., Paxos and BFT). Second, for networks with knowledge of the value of traffic between each <b>communicating</b> <b>pair</b> of nodes, we offer a weighted version that can increase resiliency between important communicating pairs while sacrificing resiliency for the less important pairs. Our assignments are based on assumed compromise probabil-ities and independence of compromises between different diverse variants.

40|$|Abstract 3 D-CGIN is a CGIN {{providing}} {{at least}} 3 disjoint paths between any <b>communicating</b> <b>pair.</b> It uses alternate source for every sender to ensure availability of 3 disjoint paths. 3 D-CGIN {{is compatible with}} distance tag routing and destination tag routing schemes. These methods prove quite useful in 3 D-CGIN. In the presence of faults, the new path is searched from source to destination. In order to tolerate faults, extra processing is required for selection of new path and diverting/resending the packets on that new path. Generally, the extra processing causes increase in processing time or hop count. To gain the advantage of multiple disjoint paths, we must carefully design the routing scheme, such that, it can minimize extra processing while tolerating the faults. We feel that, use of timely updated network status will certainly help in improving the routing. In 3 D-CGIN, we introduce such network status aware strategies. This paper introduces two such schemes, which use pre-computing of routing tags. These methods use the network status to avoid paths with faulty nodes. The paper first discusses the routing in Destination Tag and rerouting. The network 3 D-CGIN can tolerate a maximum of 6 faults in worst case, due to the additional link at initial stage.

They have embraced a modular datacenter (also called pod, a smaller mobile datacenter) as the building block for reasons such as efficient cooling, power savings, mobility, easier deployment and administration. However, delivering scalable inter-pod bisection bandwidth remains a challenge. Current solutions that promise full bisection bandwidth between arbitrary pair of hosts can be expensive and power-intensive for interconnecting modular datacenters.
