5000|$|Through his {{articles}} Lee obtrusively voiced his opinions, and offended {{many important}} {{people in the}} Malayan society. For instance, he once wrote about wealthy people who had a penchant of [...] "donating a dollar, and expecting 3 dollars' worth of recognition of patriotism, charity, and generosity". As a result, Lee adopted different pen-names to have his work published. Lee died of illness in 1947 {{at the age of}} 34. Upon his death, the local literary circle honoured him with an elaborate funeral, and a <b>commemorative</b> <b>feature</b> in the Chinese newspapers, honoring him with the title of Singapore Cultural Warrior.|$|E
5000|$|Backmuir Wood is {{an ancient}} woodland, which was {{acquired}} by the Woodland Trust in 1996, with financial assistance {{from a number of}} sources including Scottish Natural Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. At the time of acquisition, the area of the wood was 111 acres (45 hectares), but it has been extended while under the ownership of the Trust. In 2000, the Trust used funding from Homebase to purchase an adjacent 4-acre (1.6-hectare) field to extend the wood, as part of the [...] "Woodlands for the Millennium" [...] scheme in celebration of the 2000 millennium. The planting of over 8000 trees on the site began the following year, and this plantation became known as Millennium Corner. A <b>commemorative</b> <b>feature,</b> consisting of standing stones within a ring of copper beech trees, was also placed in the wood. In 2009, following a fundraising appeal, the Trust was able to extend Backmuir Wood by another 17 acres (7 hectares).|$|E
50|$|The Regular Issues were {{released}} over a ten-year period and—with {{the exception of}} one stamp—were the only definitives in general use until 1938 when the Post Office offered the Presidential Issue. The exception, released on June 15, 1932 in anticipation of the impending rate increase on standard letters from 2¢ to 3¢, scheduled for July 6, was a 3¢ Washington regular issue stamp. Rather than designing this hurried production entirely from scratch, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing modified the 2¢ stamp from the Washington Bicentennial Issue which had been released {{at the beginning of the}} year, and already looked very like a definitive. The Bureau needed only to change the numerals, to remove the stamp's sole <b>commemorative</b> <b>feature</b> (the date ribbons surrounding the portrait) and to print the stamp in the purple ink traditionally used for the 3¢ denomination. The result was that a Washington definitive issue for the normal letter rate—an invariable feature of American postage since 1870—remained continuously available to the public. The 3¢ Lincoln stamp from the 1922 series still sold widely in 1932 but disappeared from post offices the following year, prompting such protests that the Bureau had to reprint it from new plates in early 1934. During the six years following the final release of the regular issue in 1932, a steady stream of 3¢ commemoratives appeared which helped to meet the basic postal needs of the country. The Regular Issues of 1922-1932 are among one of the longest running issues of definitive postage, for their duration of common usage—sixteen years—exceeded that of the Washington-Franklin issues of (1908-22) and is surpassed only by the Presidential Issue, which appeared in 1938 and was only partially replaced in 1954, with several denominations remaining available for several years thereafter.|$|E
