If the player is hit by an attack of any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, or in some cases, time will be deducted from the <b>countdown</b> <b>timer.</b> If the player completely runs out of energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, the game will end.|$|E
5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a <b>countdown</b> <b>timer,</b> during which the door is open. Once the timer is active, the player must get to the door before the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Daredevil was {{released}} on March 18, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K. Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site. The images were randomly distributed among select subscribers, with Netflix tracking to see which one was the best-performing to eventually use for all subscribers. Netflix also debuted a <b>countdown</b> <b>timer</b> to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to see how long it was until the season would debut. The season was enhanced to be available in high dynamic range after its initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe.|$|E
50|$|Some {{traffic lights}} in the capital cities (e.g. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide) have <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> for {{pedestrian}} crossing lights, usually a countdown from 30 when the red flashing man appeared. <b>Countdown</b> <b>timers</b> have been installed on some pedestrian crossing lights in Auckland counting down from 15 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> are {{becoming}} common at {{urban and suburban}} intersections. The added information that pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> provide to pedestrians {{can also be used}} by approaching drivers. A before and after case study on the effects that pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> have on safety and efficiency of operations was performed at two signalized intersections in Lincoln, Nebraska. The effects on both drivers and pedestrians were analyzed. Performance measures for pedestrian analysis include pedestrian compliance and average pedestrian walking speed. Performance measures for the driver analysis include probability of stopping and speed at the stop bar of vehicles during the yellow phase (vehicles passing through the intersection during the yellow phase). Data was collected using a Wide Area Detector and a Pan-Tilt-Zoom video camera. Data was collected using state of the art data collection software, Wonderware, which displayed all traffic and pedestrian signal information, vehicle detections, individual vehicle speeds and distances from stop bar, and the video from the PTZ camera all on one computer screen. Statistical models were estimated to understand the effects that pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> have on the performance measures. The resulting models identified statistically significant factors that affected the performance measures. Pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> were found to increase pedestrian walking speed by 0. 2 ft/sec, and decrease speed at the stop bar of vehicles during the yellow phase by 1. 0 mi/hr. The probability of stopping curve became steeper after installation of pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers,</b> but the difference in probability of stopping was not statistically significant.

5000|$|Some {{municipalities}} {{have found}} that there are instances where pedestrian countdown signals may be less effective than standard hand/man or [...] "WALK"/"DONT WALK" [...] signals. New York City started studying the pedestrian timers in an inconclusive 2006 study but only started rolling out pedestrian timers {{on a large scale}} in 2011 after the conclusion of a second study, which found that pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> were ineffective at shorter crosswalks. Additionally, a 2000 study of pedestrian <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, at several intersections near Walt Disney World, found that pedestrians were more likely to cross the street during the pedestrian clearance interval (flashing upraised hand) if there is a timer present, compared to at intersections where there was no timer present. A study in Toronto found similar results to the Florida study, determining that <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> may actually cause more crashes than standard hand/man signals. However, other cities such as London found that <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> were effective, and New York City found that countdown signals worked mainly at longer crosswalks.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead Nightmare adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and Land Grab. The former is a horde mode in which {{up to four}} players cooperatively fight off waves of zombies. Players must open coffins between waves to replenish a <b>countdown</b> <b>timer,</b> which discourages players from camping in the same location. It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, Land Grab, is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam and otherwise unconnected to the undead theme. In Land Grab, players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in Land Grab games, only Undead Nightmare owners can initiate them.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second <b>countdown</b> <b>timer</b> is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E

40|$|Involving {{students}} in a lecture is an important but {{not an easy task}} that every lecturer must encourage. This task becomes even greater in a math class that is composed of eighty to a hundred sixty students. In 2007, the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) started offering some of its basic math courses in lecture-recitation set-up. This shift and many other factors drove most math instructors of UPLB to widely use presentation software, such as the PowerPoint (PPT), to deliver their lectures. The non-stop use of these softwares, however, seems to have negative effects on the students when it comes to maintaining their involvement in a lecture discussion for they tend to be more passive spectators. On the other hand, adding <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> strategically on some parts of the discussion seems to lessen such negative effects. This study determined the effectiveness of using <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> in maintaining students’ involvement in a lecture of MATH 27 (Analytic Geometry and Calculus II), a course in UPLB commonly taken by sophomore students. Results show that the effectiveness of <b>countdown</b> <b>timers,</b> as perceived by the students, is independent to students’ genders and degree programs, but is dependent to the colleges where the students belong to. Also, some effects of <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> are significantly correlated to various data from students’ profiles. It was concluded in the study that the use of <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> is effective in maintaining student’s involvement in MATH 27 lectures and might also be useful in other math lecture classe...|$|R

25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Elimination Chamber match, WWE only promoted two matches in a caged environment, the steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches. The steel cage was the first type of cage-based match in professional wrestling and consisted of four fenced walls of steel surrounding the ring apron, while the Hell in a Cell was a taller roofed version that surrounded the ring and ringside area on the ground rather than the apron. In 2002, WWE announced the creation of the Elimination Chamber, a match that combined elements of WWE's Hell in a Cell matches, Royal Rumble match, Survivor Series matches, and World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) WarGames matches, such as the <b>countdown</b> <b>timer</b> and time intervals from the Royal Rumble and War Games matches, the large enclosed cage format of both Hell in a Cell and War Games, and the elimination process from the Survivor Series contest.|$|E
25|$|On April Fools' Day, April 1, 2017, Sega {{released}} 8-bit Bayonetta {{game for}} free on Microsoft Windows; while the game uses 8-bit era graphics and was extremely simplified in gameplay (only allowing Bayonetta to jump and fire {{at a few}} enemies) and {{considered part of the}} April Fools' Day pranks, players found several bits of pieces in the achievements that pointed to a <b>countdown</b> <b>timer</b> on Sega's website ending on April 11, 2017, as well as other data mining suggesting a possible port of the Bayonetta game to Windows. At the end of the timer, it was confirmed that Bayonetta was coming to Windows, supporting 4K graphics and other improvements from the original versions. A spokesperson for Platinum Games said that they have become interested in porting more of their games to the personal computer, though the decision to do so has been a choice of their respective publishers; Sega has been supportive of personal computer releases of late. Platinum's development efforts to port the game to the Wii U aided in completing the port to the personal computer.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Traffic signal <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> (TSCT) are innovative, {{practical}} and cost effective technologies {{with the potential}} to improve efficiency and safety at signalized intersections. The purpose of these devices is to assist motorists in decision making at signalized intersections with real time signal change information. While successful implementation of these devices is observed internationally, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) prohibits the use of TSCT. This research explores the impacts of <b>countdown</b> <b>timers</b> on US drivers; a novel effort not yet conducted.

500|$|Concurrent {{with these}} changes, Portal 2 became {{available}} for pre-loading on the Steam client. At this point, several journalists and players suspected that Portal 2 {{may have been}} unlocked early {{at the end of}} the <b>countdown</b> <b>timer.</b> This correlated with a separate puzzle embedded in messages sent by Newell to a number of gaming sites; the message suggested the [...] "early release" [...] of material and [...] "thirteen offsite chambers", seemingly referring to the independent games, as well as a message [...] "4/19/2011 7 AM == 4/15/2011 9 AM", again referencing the planned Portal 2 release date and the <b>countdown</b> <b>timer.</b> As April 15 drew near, about nine heavily involved players from the ARG appeared to disengage from the various chat rooms, leaving with the message [...] "There's a hole in the sky through which I can fly"a line used in early advertisements for Portal; when contacted by other players, these individuals remained coy and cryptic about their actions, appearing to have been [...] "infected" [...] by GLaDOS.

50|$|<b>Countdown</b> <b>timers</b> on {{traffic lights}} were {{introduced}} in the 1990s. Timers are useful for pedestrians, to plan whether there is enough time to cross the intersection {{before the end of}} the walk phase, and for drivers, to know the amount of time before the light turns green. In the United States, timers for vehicle traffic are prohibited, but pedestrian timers are now required on new or upgraded signals on wider roadways.|$|R

500|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>{{countdown}}</b> <b>timer,</b> {{the countdown}} website redirected to a new page on the fictional Aperture Science website, calling itself [...] "GLaDOS@Home". Spoofing other distributed computing efforts like Folding@home, the site stated that if players generated enough CPU cycles by playing the thirteen games in the Potato Sack, GLaDOS would be rebooted earlier, effectively suggesting an earlier release of Portal 2 before the originally scheduled time of 7:00 AM PDT on April 19, 2011. The number of potatoes found would also serve to help to [...] "boost" [...] the effort. Only one game, Killing Floor, saw an update in this phase, where a special chamber in their Portal-themed map would be opened for players to complete for an in-game achievement. The players organized a schedule of games to be played to maximize the rate of progression, and eventually, ended up unlocking Portal 2 on Steam about ten hours before this scheduled time. The approximately 1800 players that had successfully earned all 36 potatoes by the time of Portal 2s launch were given the Valve complete pack, including Portal 2, which they could gift to other players. Players who had found at least thirteen potatoes or played each of the Potato Sack games for a minimum amount of time received Portal 2-themed items within Team Fortress 2.|$|E
500|$|The austere {{settings}} {{in the game}} came about because testers {{spent too much time}} trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film The Island as reference. While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it. They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game, though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic [...] "Lab Rat", that ties Portal and Portal 2s story together. According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by James Bond lasers, which was partially applied to the turrets, Portal Kombat where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a <b>countdown</b> <b>timer</b> near the end; Swift noted, [...] "Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, [...] "It was really cheap to make [...] " [...] in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.|$|E
