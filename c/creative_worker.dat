Yet the bulk of academic study of creative work (both functionalist and critical), as well as the content of higher/further professional education programs and everyday understanding of <b>creative</b> <b>workers,</b> focuses on one subset of the Creative Industries: those involved in the production of cultural goods or services (film, television, music etc.) for consumption by the general public.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} ceremonies stood in Olympiads as both {{vehicles}} of {{cultural values and}} shows embracing the banal and the everyday. But {{how much do we}} understand them as forms of public art? The present book examines the London 2012 opening and closing ceremonies and the handover event to Rio for the 2016 Olympics as articulations of national and cosmopolitan belonging. It is argued that embodied and projected performances of Britishness and Brazilianness embraced both artistic styles and the contemporary digital turn, refinement and banality. Combinations of art and technology reflect a vision of humanity in motion complying with the Olympic values of fairness, beauty and embodied well-being. The three ceremonial performances supported imaginative travel on stage, on big screens and in musical genres. This travel, at once mediated, embodied and experiential, created an ideal form of ‘human’: a tornadóros.

40|$|Creative {{workers are}} {{employed}} in sectors outside the creative industries often in greater numbers than within the creative field. This is the first book to explore the phenomena of the embedded creative and creative services through a range of sectors, disciplines, and perspectives. Despite {{the emergence of the}} <b>creative</b> <b>worker,</b> there is very little known about the work life of these ‘creatives’, and why companies seek to employ them. This book asks: how does creative work actually “embed” into a service or product supply chain? What are creative services? Which industries are they working in? This collection explores these questions in relation to innovation, employment and education, using various methods and theoretical approaches, in order to examine the value of the embedded creative and to discover the implications of education and training for creative workers. This book will be of interest to practitioners, policy makers and industry leaders in the creative industries, in particular digital media, application development, design, journalism, media and communication. It will also appeal to academics and scholars of innovation, cultural studies, business management and labour studies...|$|E

These embedded creatives make up 2 per cent of manufacturing industry employees. There is little qualitative research into embedded creatives. This paper aims to address this by exploring the contribution of creative skills to manufacturing in Australia.

40|$|Using newly derived panel {{data from}} NUTS 2 regions in Europe, {{the role of}} <b>creative</b> <b>workers</b> is {{systematically}} evaluated in this Ph. D. thesis. First of all, a Growth Accounting model is used together with two empirical models for testing {{the economic impact of}} <b>creative</b> <b>workers</b> and ICT. It appears that the development level of the creative economy is unbalanced across the main European regions. However, there is a complementary relationship between ICT and creative skills in explaining output and productivity growth. This thesis then develops an empirical model to investigate how <b>creative</b> <b>workers</b> are distributed across different European regions. The findings suggest that Florida’s (2013) theoretical framework has explanatory power in larger regions. In contrast, how well a local government performs has a substantial impact on the influx of <b>creative</b> <b>workers</b> among small-sized regions, and the overall quality of political institutions appears to enhance this process.

Drawing on Paul du Gay's concept of personhood, case studies on digital gaming explore the formation of two forms of personhood ? creative consumers and creative workers. Specifically, these forms of creative agency are analysed {{in terms of their}} connections on the ?talent pathway?, and the transitions that see creativity and talent as inherent in all individuals and in need of channelling and directing. The creative-consumer case study unpacks the digital games industry strategy of enrolling fan-creators within their commercial operations. This case study reveals the increasing importance of co-production for the creative economy, {{and the extent to which}} diverse cultural practices are facilitated and positioned. Higher education Games Design courses will then provide the case study for examining how the creative-consumer can be positioned to make a productive contribution to the creative economy as a worker. Within this context, the formation of fans/students into a <b>creative</b> <b>worker</b> or industry-ready worker is evident.

Advertising communicated a message from a certain brand to the target audience through a particular medium. The aim of this research was making advertising with a powerful message, so it was able to become a captain of consciousness that could play an important role in economic and social systems of modern society. Because of its potential power, the creative advertising workers had a big responsibility in their hands. It was not only to explore the creativity visually or verbally to a <b>creative</b> <b>worker,</b> but also, they should understand the purpose of communication, the communication strategy, and the creative strategy. In this case, TokoBagus run this in making advertisement campaign to promote its brand. The method used in this research was the qualitative method and inductive model. Data were collected through an interview, literature, and visual data. Those collected data were analyzed using a qualitative-verificative strategy and case study method. The case study was Toko Bagus advertising campaign from the year 2011 to the year 2014 when finally its name changes into OLX. It finds that the advertisements only become beautiful works of art, but it does not solve the problem of the brand. Therefore, this research is important to document the communication strategy and the creative strategy of an advertising campaign so it can be a reference for a young designers or students.  </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates how {{creative}} industries workers adapt to and influence {{the use of}} new digital technologies. It looks at how these technologies affect business models, content production and product distribution in the comics industry, and how these changes create uncertainty and risk for creative workers in this industry. It examines the strategies comics creators use to shape new industry structures {{and the status of}} digital comics within the wider industry, as well as their own identities as media industry workers. The study uses data from interviews and historical documents to compare the experiences of editors, writers, pencillers, inkers, colourists, letterers and new digital workers who are creating content at two existing print publishers and two new digital companies to develop a theory of the creators’ ‘adaptation framework’. The adaptation framework recognises the influence of historically and culturally constructed discussions about what constitutes ‘good work’ in the comics industry and the influence this has on the adoption of new forms of digital technology for comics’ production. Critical judgment and public validation of choices made regarding the use of digital technologies encourages creators to reframe their work identity and the content they produce. This analytical framework highlights the availability of different professional identity categories, including a ‘core’ identity and guiding values, plus a supplementary ‘pioneer’ identity, which acknowledges the creative freedom offered by digital media. Creators also use discursive practices, such as ‘reactive’ and ‘relational’ positioning, to manage their identity in relation to the field of comics production and to distance their work from negative evaluations of digital comics derived from historical exemplars of what are now perceived to be ‘poor works’, and by extension poor work by the creator. Periods of change throw into relief existing understandings held by workers and consumers of what constitutes a ’good’ comic book. Early digital comics projects from the 1990 s and 2000 s influence creators’ perceptions of whether digital technologies can produce such ’good works’. Pioneers and early adopters take on the role of experts and advocates, engaging in the process of socialising the new discourses and practices into the broader field of comics production. The pioneer identity is correlated with the privitisation and individualisation of risk, whereby creators invest their human, social, and symbolic capital in projects that have uncertain outcomes in exchange for creatively challenging careers and potentially reputation-building work. The pioneers are open to change, but their previous print-based identity often provides stability to their core identity as creators capable of producing ‘good work’. Creators rely on these identities to orient themselves in relation to the new norms, practices and routines of comic book work, engaging in identity management to manage the risk that their investment in skill development and time spent producing digital comics will not produce a return on investment measured through financial or social capital recognised in the industry. Adaptation to digital work forces aspects of the creator’s identity to change, but their core understanding of who they are, what they do, and why they do it is still a valuable and sustaining element of their identity as a <b>creative</b> <b>worker.</b> Thesis (Ph.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a new monograph entitled Neoliberalism and its Subjects. It focuses on how neoliberalism operates as 'a mode of governance' (Brown 2005) and functions to produce subjects, citizens, and new modes of social organization. The monograph traces the role of media and communication in the various extensions of neoliberalism into public and private life. It also pays {{particular attention to the}} role of culture, media and communications in neoliberal extensions, and in normalizing market logic as the basis for decision making and working practices. In this way an attempt is made to map how neoliberalism operates as a productive force. The monograph draws out how neoliberalism is applied in practice by providing an empirically-based examination of neoliberal extensions into creative practice, immigration policy, consumption and citizenship. Neoliberalism {{has been described as a}} political and economic program (Hay 2004; Harvey 2007 and 2010), as an ideology (Bourdieu and Wacquant 2001; Giroux 2008), and as a rationality influencing schemas of thought and processes of analysis (Brown 2005; Foucault 2008; Couldry 2010). It is argued that market logic is colonizing human experience (Boltanski and Chiapello 2005), in part through constraining and shaping language which produces new forms of knowledge that are inscribed in practice (Lemke 2002), and which prescribe a 'way of doing things' (Foucault 2008). Writers such as Gill and Scharff (2011) have recently called for more attention to be paid to neoliberalism 'on the ground'. In particular, they argue that deeper empirical connections need to be made between neoliberalism and subjectivity; connections which draw out " [...] . the ways in which these governing practices quite literally 'get inside us' to materialize and constitute our subjectivities" (2011 : 7). The chapters in the monograph take up this call, investigating the myriad ways in which media and communication practices are determinants of, and conduits for, neoliberal subjectivities and subject positions. These chapters expand previous discussions by providing a thorough and detailed assessment of neoliberal processes through the investigation of site-specific case studies. The paper to be presented provides a brief overview of the book including an introduction to the subject areas covered: in the chapter entitled 'The <b>Creative</b> <b>Worker</b> as Neoliberal Subject' Conor traces the elaboration of a neoliberal, creative subject-hood in relation to cultural sector employment in the UK and New Zealand, focusing on screen production industries. Particularly, the analysis seeks out the disjunctures between the discourses of neoliberal policy-making that continue to proffer creativity as a skills-based entrepreneurial strategy for all workers; and empirical labour market data which illustrates that rather than freedom, autonomy and egalitarianism, creative work in film and television production is characterized by precariousness, insecurity, hierarchy, and lack of diversity. These disjunctures, embodied in the subject of the 'creative worker', highlight the anxieties that come with the implementation of fiercely individualised and economised notions of creativity. In the second chapter 'The Skilled Immigrant as Neoliberal Subject' Redden argues that Britain's move to a points-based immigration system with its emphasis on 'skill' must be considered in relation to the central role media plays in reinforcing and amplifying market-based schema of evaluation (Couldry 2010), and also in the formulation and implementation of policy making (Kuhn 2002). By connecting the development of immigration policy to neoliberal efforts and processes of mediation the chapter aims to detail the relationships between the media, politics and policy through a site and issue specific analysis. The chapter draws upon textual analysis of news coverage in 2008 and policy documents in addition to interviews with journalists, politicians, civil servants and activists. In the fourth chapter entitled 'The Critical Consumer as Neoliberal Subject' Lekakis argues that an examination of the 'critical consumer' provides a means to assess the intrusion of a market mentality on political participation. The paper evaluates the political meaningfulness of political consumption (Micheletti et al. 2004) in relation to the forms of participation evoked through dominant narratives and their interpretations and enactments by citizens. Through a series of interviews with citizen consumers and agents involved in the campaigning side of the fair and solidarity trade scene, as well as an interrogation of the activation and promotion of fair trade products, this chapter argues for a series of contentions sustained in the enactment of political consumerism alongside the political project of neoliberalism. The entity of the critical consumer has become a specific subject for political reasoning through the marketplace. The majority of the paper is devoted to outlining the theoretical framework for the book and detailing how this framework is applied through the discussion of Dencik's chapter entitled 'The Global Citizen as Neoliberal Subject'. In this paper Dencik argues that the concept of 'global citizen' should be viewed not as a product of the necessary expansion of political community, but as a new political subject driven by the political logic of late capitalism. The concept of 'global citizen' - far from being an articulation of political practice that overcomes the stifling inadequacies of the nation-state - privileges the (elite) individual over the collective as the primary unit of social change, absolves rather than enhances political responsibility, and celebrates the privatisation rather than the democratisation of public discourse and practice. As such, the paper challenges 'uncritical globalisation theory' (Fuchs 2010) by placing the appeals to a global 'space' as part of the (re) articulation of democratic practice in its appropriate context of contemporary neoliberal capitalism, ultimately highlighting its potential compromises to actual social justice and democratic change...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of organisational business acumen and social network structure on the earnings and labour precarity experienced by <b>creative</b> industry <b>workers.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Results from a survey that collected data from a random sample of 289 <b>creative</b> <b>workers</b> are analysed using structural equation modelling. Mediating effects of social network structure are explored. Findings: Results support the qualitative findings of Crombie and Hagoort (2010) who claim that organisational business acumen is a significant enabler for <b>creative</b> <b>workers.</b> Further, social network structure has a partial mediating effect in mitigating labour precarity. Research limitations/implications: This exploratory study is novel in its use of a quantitative approach to understand the relationship between labour and social network dynamics of the creative industries. For this reason, developed scales, while robust in exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, warrant further application and maturity. Practical implications: The organisational business acumen of <b>creative</b> <b>workers</b> is found to mitigate labour precarity and increase perceived earnings. Social implications: The results from this study call for policy and management shifts, to focus attention on developing business proficiency of <b>creative</b> <b>workers,</b> in an effort to curb labour precarity in the creative industries, and enhance positive spillovers into other sectors. Originality/value: The paper fills a gap in knowledge regarding the impact of organisational business acumen and social network structure on the pay and working conditions of people working in a sector that is dominated by self-employed and freelance arrangements...|$|R
