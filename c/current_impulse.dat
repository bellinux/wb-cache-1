25|$|A neuron's {{ability to}} {{generate}} and propagate an action potential changes during development. How much the membrane potential of a neuron changes {{as the result of}} a <b>current</b> <b>impulse</b> is a function of the membrane input resistance. As a cell grows more channels are added to the membrane causing a decrease in input resistance. A mature neuron also undergoes shorter changes in membrane potential in response to synaptic currents. Neurons from a ferret lateral geniculate nucleus have a longer time constant and larger voltage deflection at P0 than they do at P30. One consequence of the decreasing action potential duration is that the fidelity of the signal can be preserved in response to high frequency stimulation. Immature neurons are more prone to synaptic depression than potentiation after high frequency stimulation.|$|E

The battery capacity of the nodes is viewed as a common resource of the system and its use is to be optimized. Results from a previous study on battery management have shown that: (1) pulsed current discharge outperforms constant current discharge, (2) battery capacity can be improved by using a bursty discharge pattern due to charge recovery effects that take place during idle periods, (3) given a certain value of current drawn off the battery, higher <b>current</b> <b>impulses</b> degrade battery performance, even if the percentage of higher <b>current</b> <b>impulses</b> is relatively small. We develop a network protocol based on these findings. This protocol favors routes whose links have a low energy cost.

5000|$|... (f) The impulse timer is a D type {{positive}} {{edge triggered}} flip flop. Input information applied at D {{is transferred to}} Q on the occurrence of the positive edge of the clock pulse. thus when the comparator output (e) is positive Q goes positive or remains positive at the next positive clock edge. Similarly, when (e) is negative Q goes negative at the next positive clock edge. Q controls the electronic switch to generate the <b>current</b> <b>impulse</b> into the integrator. Examination of the waveform (e) during the initial period illustrated, when Vin is 0.4 V, shows (e) crossing the threshold well before the trigger edge (positive edge of the clock pulse) {{so that there is}} an appreciable delay before the impulse starts. After the start of the impulse there is further delay while (e) climbs back past the threshold. During this time the comparator output remains high but goes low before the next trigger edge. At that next trigger edge the impulse timer goes low to follow the comparator. Thus the clock determines the duration of the impulse. For the next impulse the threshold is crossed immediately before the trigger edge and so the comparator is only briefly positive. Vin (a) goes to full scale, +Vref, shortly {{before the end of the}} next impulse. For the remainder of that impulse the capacitor current (c) goes to zero and hence the integrator slope briefly goes to zero. Following this impulse the full scale positive current is flowing (c) and the integrator sinks at its maximum rate and so crosses the threshold well before the next trigger edge. At that edge the impulse starts and the Vin current is now matched by the reference current so that the net capacitor current (c) is zero. Then the integration now has zero slope and remains at the negative value it had at the start of the impulse. This has the effect that the impulse current remains switched on because Q is stuck positive because the comparator is stuck positive at every trigger edge. This is consistent with contiguous, butting impulses which is required at full scale input.|$|E

Different factors, including the <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> waveforms, the front time and half peak time of <b>impulse</b> <b>current,</b> the quantity of electric charge and absorption of unit heat, have been studied by performing a series of laboratory tests.
