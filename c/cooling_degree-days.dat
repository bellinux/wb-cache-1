To capture feedbacks from impacted natural or socio-economic systems requires interactive two-way coupling but this is generally computationally infeasible with even moderately complex general circulation models (GCMs).

The combined model is evaluated with measurements from an urban neighborhood in Basel, Switzerland, {{and the importance of}} surface–atmosphere model coupling is demonstrated. Impacts of extensive albedo increases in two Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods are modeled. Clear-sky summertime reductions of diurnal maximum air temperature for the residential neighborhood (λp = 0. 33) are − 1. 1 °, − 1. 5 °, and − 3. 6 °C for uniform roof albedo increases of 0. 19, 0. 26, and 0. 59, respectively; reductions are about 40 % larger for the downtown core (λp = 0. 53). Realistic impacts will be smaller because the 1 D modeling approach ignores advection; a lake-breeze scenario is modeled and temperature reductions decline by 80 %. Assuming no advection, the analysis is extended to seasonal and annual time scales in the residential neighborhood. Yearly average temperature decreases for a 0. 59 roof albedo increase are about − 1 °C, with summer (winter) reductions about 60 % larger (smaller). Annual <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-day</b> decreases are approximately offset by heating degree-day increases and the frequency of very hot days is reduced. Despite the variability of modeling approaches and scenarios in the literature, a consistent range of air temperature sensitivity to albedo is emerging; a 0. 10 average increase in neighborhood albedo (a 0. 40 roof albedo increase for λp = 0. 25) generates a diurnal maximum air temperature reduction of approximately 0. 5 °C for “ideal” conditions, that is, a typical clear-sky midlatitude summer day...|$|R

The impact on energy, especially energy consumption for heating and cooling of buildings, is very important. These influences are different in terms of space and time due to spatial and temporal variations of temperature. In this study, daily data of minimum and maximum temperature of 51 stations for 1959 - 2004 were used to detect annual and seasonal variations of heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> in Xinjiang, China, by using the Mann-Kendall trend test and linear regression techniques. The results indicate that: (1) taking 18 A degrees C as the base temperature, annual mean heating degree-days (HDD) ranged between 2, 700 and 7, 973 A degrees C, and annual mean <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD) (the base temperature is 24 A degrees C) ranged between 0. 4 and 792 A degrees C. CDDs are relatively low in Xinjiang; (2) autumn, winter, and annual HDDs show significant decreasing trends. Annual CDD at 23 out of 51 stations present significant increasing trends, while no remarkable positive trends can be observed at the other stations; and (3) with respect to spatial variations, Xinjiang was characterized by significant decreasing annual, winter, and autumn HDDs, and it was particularly true for the northern Xinjiang. The annual and summer CDDs in the western parts of northern Xinjiang (the edges of the Tarim Basin and the Turpan-Hami Basin) were characterized by significant increasing trends. However, no fixed spatial patterns can be identified in the variations of annual and summer CDDs.

The results show that Bangkok has the highest annual and monthly cooling degree-hours followed by Songkla, Ubonratchathani, and Chiangmai. In all cities, the number of cooling degree-hours is much more than one of heating degree-hours which implies that energy consumption of buildings is used for space cooling much more than space heating.

The effect of temperature data variations on the energy consumption and on CO 2 emissions of buildings was examined by calculating the energy demands for heating and cooling and the CO 2 emissions from diesel-oil and electricity use of a typical residential building-model. From the study it is concluded that the heating energy requirements during the decade 1993 - 2002 were decreased, as compared to the energy demands of the decade 1983 - 1992, while the cooling energy requirements were increased. The variations of CO 2 emissions from diesel oil and electricity use were analog to the energy requirements alterations.

This paper, based on results carried out in the framework of IEA_ECBCS annex 48 project, presents an estimate of primary energy and CO 2 savings in Europe by reconverting chillers into reversible heat pumps in office buildings. A typology of office buildings has been defined with standard values for internal loads, occupancy rate, building envelope characteristics and ventilation rates. Based on these data, the heating and cooling demand profiles have been simulated for different European climatic zones. First, a study of meteorological data based on <b>cooling</b> and heating <b>degree-days</b> has enabled to limit the simulation cases to few representative climates of all Europe. Then, the simulation results for these climates show that office buildings offer large opportunities for reversibility since the cooling power required is closed to the heat power required.

The potential of primary energy and CO 2 savings in Europe has been assessed considering an instantaneous retrofit of air-conditioning systems on the market.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{combining}} dynamical and statistical ensembles {{for the purpose}} of improving ensemble reliability for underdispersive ensembles is introduced. The method involves adding independent sets of N random four-dimensional ‘dressing ’ perturbations to each of the K members of a dynamical ensemble forecast to obtain an N × K dressed ensemble. The new method mathematically constrains the stochastic process used to generate the statistical dressing perturbations so that it removes seasonally averaged errors in the second moment measures for originally underdispersive ensembles. A random-number generator experiment and an experiment with the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) ensemble generation scheme show that the previously proposed ‘bestmember’ dressing method fails to reliably predict the second moment of the distribution of forecast errors, whereas the new dressing method reliably predicts this second moment. After being dressed with the second moment constraint method, the ETKF ensemble is more skilful than the undressed ensemble.

The results indicate that winter and summer are the two peak seasons of energy consumption due to the urban residential heating and cooling demand. The base temperature of electricity and daily temperature is 10 °C in winter and 22 °C in summer respectively. When the outdoor temperature is below 10 °C, the heating demand becomes obvious, and with over 22 °C the cooling demand. The spatial distribution of <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD) and heating degree-days (HDD) clearly shows urbanization effects. By the influence of urbanization the central city experiences greater CDD in summer and lower HDD in winter.

Phase change transition temperature, quantity, and location of PCM were all considered while incrementally adding PCM to Passive House simulation models in multiple climate zones across the United States. Whole building energy simulations were performed using EnergyPlus from the US Department of Energy. A prototypical Passive House with a 1500 Watt electric heater and no mechanical cooling was modeled. The effectiveness of the PCM was determined by comparing the zone-hours and zone-degree-hours outside the ASHRAE defined comfort zone for all PCM cases against a control simulation without PCM. Results show that adding PCM to Passive Houses can significantly increase thermal comfort {{so long as the}} house is in a dry or marine climate. The addition of PCM in moist climates will not significantly increase occupant comfort because the majority of discomfort in these climates arises due to latent load. For dry or marine climates, PCM has the most significant impact in climates with lower <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days,</b> reducing by 93...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigated regional climate {{differences and}} weather {{impacts on the}} effectiveness of cool roofs. In most US climate zones, cool roofs can reduce energy consumption because they reflect more sunlight and heat than standard roofs. Since temperatures are expected to increase in many regions, cool roofs may offer greater energy and cost savings than currently estimated. Energy consumption by Department of Energy (DOE) Research Laboratory buildings across the US with cool and standard roofs were assessed using metered energy datasets collected from 2003 - 2013. Statistical tests were conducted to compare differences in energy consumption of buildings between cool and standard roofs at sites in different climatic regions. In order to better understand the effectiveness of cool roof technologies in a future that is expected to become increasingly warmer, data collected from weather stations near each DOE site were used to interpret the potential influences of weather patterns on cool roof energy savings. This research confirmed that cool roofs do reduce energy consumption, especially at sites with warmer summers and milder winters. Regression analyses of energy consumption and temperature data were conducted to identify associations between air temperatures and heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> with seasonal energy consumption. While the energy consumption of buildings with cool roofs was generally less than buildings with standard roofs, the differences in energy consumption varied depending on building use and building size...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{estimates}} an {{irrigation water}} demand function using disaggregate climate and well data over a 33 year time period. Aggregating climate information over long periods, like a year, causes {{a loss of}} detail on temporal climatic variation, while aggregating climate information over space causes a loss of detail on spatial variation. This analysis uses disaggregate climate variation at a temporospatial level {{to determine the effects}} of climate on groundwater use. Results show that increased heat, measured in <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days,</b> correlates with increased water use, while increased precipitation correlates with decreased water use. However, the effects are generally magnified for later summer months, and are lower at the beginning and end of the growing season – with a few exceptions. Soil type effects groundwater demand for July in particular, and has a ubiquitous effect at the marginal level. Other economic and physical variables were controlled for in the analysis. Using NOAA climate scenarios, which depict climate under increased carbon dioxide for three time periods in the future, we perform an ex-ante analysis using the coefficients derived from our model to determine future irrigation demand. In both high- and low-emissions scenarios, irrigation demand increases. The water increases derived in the forecast range from 10 – 15 % from the average in earlier years, to as much as 27 % in later years. Advisor: Karina Schoengol...|$|E
30|$|The {{technique}} {{we consider}} {{to capture the}} dependence of present-time Italy electricity demand on meteorological variables is that presented by Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2015). They model the demand of ordinary days {{by means of a}} linear regression model made up of i) a time-dependent term capturing long-term trends, ii) a term accounting for the differences among the different days of the week and iii) a set of terms depending on temperature-derived variables that can be obtained from high-resolution Tn, Tm, and Tx fields. The latter are national averages over Italian urbanised areas of <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD), heating degree-days (HDD) and solar radiation deficit with respect to a defined threshold (S), with solar radiation estimated using daily temperature range as a proxy. Applying this technique, Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2014) quantified the present-time dependence of the Italian electricity demand of an ordinary day on CDD, HDD and S in, respectively, 24.6 GWh degree-day− 1, 6.6 GWh degree-day− 1 and 2.9 GWh day− 1  MJ− 1  m 2. These values give evidence of a relevant contribution of meteorological conditions on the electricity demand, especially in the summer period: in this season, the fraction of the electricity demand driven by meteorological conditions can exceed 20  %. Temperature is indeed the most important meteorological variable influencing the electricity demand: it regulates the request for conditioning in summer and for heating in winter (Pardo et al. 2002; Moral-Carcedo & Vicéns-Otero 2005; Hor et al. 2005; Bessec & Fouquau 2008; Hekkenberg et al. 2009; Apadula et al. 2012). The latter request is however rather low in Italy as the use of electricity for heating is limited.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{technical and}} economic choices for rural electrification in Africa and presents {{the rationale for}} trigeneration (capability for electricity, heating, and cooling) in health and education applications. An archetypal load profile for a rural health clinic (25 kWhe/day and 118 – 139 kWht) is described, and a regional analysis is performed for sub-Saharan Africa by aggregating NASA meteorological data (insolation, temperature, and heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days)</b> using correlates to latitude. As a baseline for comparison, the technical, economic (using discounted cash flow) and environmental aspects of traditional electrification approaches, namely photovoltaic (PV) systems and diesel generators, are quantified, and options for meeting heating and cooling loads (e. g. gas-fired heaters, absorption chillers, or solar water heaters) are evaluated alongside an emerging micro-concentrating solar power (-CSP) technology featuring a solar thermal organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Photovoltaics hybridized with LPG/Propane and -CSP trigeneration are the lowest cost alternatives for satisfying important but often overlooked thermal requirements, with cost advantages for CSP depending on latitudinal variation in insolation and thermal parameters. For a 15 -year project lifetime, the net present cost for meeting clinic energy needs varied from 45 to 75 k USD, with specific levelized electricity costs of 0. 26 – 0. 31 USD/kWh. In comparison, diesel generation of electricity is both costly (> 1 USD/kWh) and polluting (94 tons CO 2 per site over 15 years), while LPG/Propane based heating and cooling emits 160 – 400 tons CO 2 depending on ambient conditions. The comparative analysis of available technologies indicates that where the energy demand includes a mixture of electrical and thermal loads, as in typical health and education outposts, on-carbon emitting -CSP trigeneration approaches can be cost-effective.

40|$|The {{heat stress}} index (HSI) is a new, {{comprehensive}} summer index that evaluates daily relative stress for locations throughout the United States based on {{deviations from the}} norm. The index is based on apparent temperature and other derived meteorological variables, including cloud cover, <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days,</b> and con-secutive days of extreme heat. Statistical distributions of meteorological variables are derived for 10 -day periods of the annual cycle so that percentile values for each parameter can be determined. The daily percentile values for each variable are then summed, and a statistical distribution is fit to the summed frequencies. The daily HSI value is the percentile associated with {{the location of the}} daily summed value under the summation curve. The index is analyzed and spatially verified by comparing intra- and interregional results. Although stations from various climate regions have different criteria defining an excessive heat stress event, neighboring stations typically produce similar HSI results because they are usually affected by the same air mass. To test the effectiveness of the HSI, a relationship between the index results and mortality values is made. Overall, the highest mortality days are associated with the highest HSI values, but high-HSI days are not always associated with high numbers of deaths. A mortality study such as this one {{is just one of many}} potential environmental applications of the HSI. Other applications include implementing the index to correlate extreme weather con-ditions with resource consumption, such as electric-utility load, to determine conditions for which load levels are excessive. The ability to forecast the HSI using a variety of weather forecasting tools has also generated interest within various industries that have a need to issue weather stress advisories, watches, and warnings. 1...|$|E
