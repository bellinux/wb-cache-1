5|$|Most European {{countries}} have {{taken steps to}} conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies; {{there is also an}} overall European action plan. The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other <b>countries.</b> <b>Where</b> breeding sites impinge on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake. The corn crake {{does not appear to be}} seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> abortion is not allowed and in <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions.
