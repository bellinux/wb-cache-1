40|$|Background. Teachers {{may believe}} that <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as {{punishing}} will increase their influence in class. However, according to students, teachers do not gain influence by using coercion while it does result {{in a loss of}} teachers' warmth. Teachers' misunderstanding of the effect of coercion on their influence and warmth during a lesson (i. e., the lesson social climate) may obstruct them in creating a positive social climate. Aims. To investigate teachers' understanding of the effect of coercion on the lesson social climate and to test the hypotheses that teachers' general authoritativeness and friendliness affects the accuracy of teachers' understanding, we used students' perceptions of the effect of teacher coercion on the social climate as a criterion. Sample. Dutch secondary school teachers (N = 48) and their students (N = 1208) rated, on average, 9 of their lessons (Nlessons rated = 447). Method. The social climate and teachers' general authoritativeness and friendliness were tapped with the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction and teachers' <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviours</b> with the Teacher Behaviour Observation Checklist. Multilevel models including cross-level three-way interactions were fitted to test the hypotheses. Results. The accuracy of teachers' understanding of the effect of coercion on the social climate depended on their general friendliness. Conclusion. In general, teachers misinterpreted coercion as helpful to gain influence in class and as less harmful to their warmth. While friendlier teachers were more accurate in understanding the impact of coercion on their warmth during a lesson, less friendly teachers were more accurate in understanding the impact of coercion on their influence...|$|R

The three traits are associated with impulsivity, manipulative behaviours and lack of empathy. These personality traits would be useful in seducing a partner for a short term encounter. From an evolutionary perspective, these would have been particularly beneficial to our ancestral males who wanted to increase their reproductive success, through seducing many women and therefore increasing their chance of passing on their genes. These particular traits may be used as a tactic for increasing success in mating.|$|R

For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour.

30|$|Violence {{against women}} and girls (VAWG) in noncrisis situations, {{especially}} in areas with poor socioeconomic standards, {{is much higher than}} men. For many women in the world domestic violence and abuse are regular events, but crises and disasters greatly aggravate these situations. A broader definition of VAWG includes “controlling and <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> subordination, exploitation, disempowerment, deprivation and encompasses physical violence and the threat of physical violence, and a range of types of abuse including, but not limited to, psychological, sexual, financial and emotional abuse” (UK Home Office 2013, p. 29). Included within this definition of VAWG, sexual harassment of women is a major issue in conflict situations. Victimization of the civilian population is common in conflict situations, but “it is now more dangerous to be a woman than to be a soldier in modern wars” (Major General Patrick Cammaert of the UN Mission in Congo, 2008, quoted in Chemaly 2012) {{due to the fact that}} rape is used as weapon. Similarly, in disaster situations, post-disaster cramped living conditions, lack of privacy, and living in close proximity to others can escalate sexual violence and abuse for female survivors.

50|$|Yet Crittenden also emphasises that {{development}} and time may lead away from pathology. A toddler {{may have come}} to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in aiming to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{with the goal of}} maintaining their caregiver’s availability. Not only with time can relationships change (e.g. within the family system), but new relationships occur throughout development, and may be the basis for a change of attachment pattern if a relationship is formed with this figure, or if they cause the person to rethink how and whether they seek comfort. Such a new relationship may be with a clinician or other professional, so long as this encounter is not too fleeting. For instance, in work with families experiencing complex difficulties, Crittenden emphasises that ‘observing videotaped parent-child interactions with the parent and discussing these observations from the parent’s perspective can be a powerful means of creating communication between procedural and semantic memory systems’.|$|R

We used a new measure to assess children's (N = 837, age 9 to 13 years) optimistic and pessimistic relationship expectations {{of their family}} relationships separate from their expectations of peers/others. Our aim was to investigate whether family structure, interparental conflict and parenting dimensions were important correlates of these two aspects of children's relationship expectations. Six maternal and paternal dimensions of parenting were measured, including warmth, rejection, structure, chaos, autonomy support, and <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Children who reported witnessing more interparental conflict had more negative relationship expectations about their family and about others, but these associations were no longer significant when the parenting dimensions were considered. Family structure {{was not associated with}} children's relationship expectations of peers/others, but children who had experienced parental divorce had less positive family relationship expectations. Overall, many of the six parenting dimensions were associated with family expectations, but fewer were associated with expectations of peers/others.

40|$|Background: Theory {{suggests}} that young women's own efficacy for sexual self-protective behaviour is greater {{when they are}} more advanced in their cognitive autonomy, and when they have romantic partners who support autonomy rather than engage in <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and are warm and accepting rather than rejecting. Methods: A total of 199 women (aged 16 to 25 years) completed questionnaires measuring sexual self-efficacy, autonomy, partner communication and their partners' behaviours. Hypotheses were tested with structural equation modelling. Results: Correlations showed that young women reported more self-efficacy when they had greater autonomy and reported partners to be more supportive and warmer, and less coercive and rejecting. In structural equation modelling, the association of women's autonomy with sexual self-efficacy was indirect via their perceived capacity to communicate with their partners. Associations of partner behaviours with sexual self-efficacy were both direct and indirect via the capacity to communicate. Conclusions: Sexual efficacy is enhanced among young women who report a greater general capacity to communicate openly with their partners and have partners who display more warmth and less rejecting behaviours. Young women are also higher in sexual self-efficacy when they report more cognitive autonomy and lower partner coercion, but these associations are completely indirect via females' greater capacity to communicate openly. The findings provide support for sexual health programs focussing on decision-making skills, personal competence, partners' behaviours and dyadic communication strategies.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the predictors of social dominance, the strategies children use to control resources (prosocial and coercive), and the associations between these strategies and measures of personality, social skills, and peer regard. A total of 30 preschoolers (ages 3 – 6) were rated by their teachers on social dominance. Based on these ratings, dominant children were paired with multiple subordinate children (i. e., block design; Kenny, 1990) and observed in a play situation designed to elicit resource control behaviour. As hypothesised, age and the surgency facet of extraversion predicted social dominance (but openness to experience did not). Furthermore, also as expected, both prosocial behaviour and <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviour</b> were related to resource control in the play situation. Last, both resource control strategies were associated with parent-rated social competence, but only coercive control was associated with positive peer regard (i. e., Likeability). Factors of personality (e. g. agreeableness, hostility) were not associated with either of the strategies. The utility of an evolutionary perspective to resource control and social competence is discussed. After twenty- ve years of scholarly work on children’s peer relationships and social adaptation (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 1998), it is now well-established that children who are competent with peers, that is, children who can form and maintain positive associations with others (Hartup, 1983), enjoy favourable developmental outcomes not enjoyed by those who fail at these basic developmental tasks (Berndt...|$|E

For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviours</b> with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} how legal engagement can be {{an opportunity}} to exercise coercive control over a former intimate partner. Drawing on interviews with 65 women who engaged with the legal system {{as a result of}} violence in their intimate relationships, this article explores how women’s engagement with the legal system is frequently experienced as an extension of an intimate partner’s coercive control. It builds on existing research showing how legal processes provide an opportunity for perpetrators to continue and even expand their repertoire of <b>coercive</b> and controlling <b>behaviours</b> post-separation. I refer to this as legal systems abuse. This article explores women’s reported experiences and considers how expectations of equality of access to justice and fair hearing; concepts that underpin legal processes, can be reconciled with legal engagements that seek to end <b>coercive</b> and controlling <b>behaviours.</b> The article concludes that improved understanding of domestic and family violence as coercive control by legal actors may help to circumvent the opportunities for legal systems abuse...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} {{personality}} traits {{have been associated}} with the perpetration of sexual aggression in community samples. In particular, maladaptive narcissistic personality traits have been shown to correlate with use of sexual coercive tactics, as have traits associated with primary psychopathy. In separate research, indices of higher sex drive and interest in sexual deviance (e. g., paraphilic interests) {{have been associated with}} sexually abusive and aggressive behaviours. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to replicate these findings, and also to determine the unique contributions that distinct sets of personality traits and indices of sexual interests and behaviors make in accounting for self-reported endorsement of sexually coercive tactics. Participants recruited from a university student population completed a battery of questionnaires online, measuring narcissistic traits, psychopathic traits, indices of sex drive and interest in paraphilias, use of sexually coercive tactics, and social desirability responding. It was hypothesized that higher scores on primary psychopathy and maladaptive narcissism would be significantly and positively correlated with higher scores on a measure of sexually coercive tactics. It was also hypothesized that higher scores on primary psychopathy and maladaptive narcissism, in separate hierarchical multiple regression models, would remain significant predictors when indices of sex drive and sexual deviance were added to the models. Further, it was expected that these latter measures would have incremental validity. Findings add to theoretical understanding of these predictors of sexually <b>coercive</b> <b>behaviours</b> among university students by examining them in integrated models. These results also have potential implications for prevention and intervention work...|$|R
