In this paper, we propose a real-time (i. e. video rate) color region segmentation followed by a robust color classification and region merging dedicated to various applications such as RoboCup four-legged league or an industrial <b>conveyor</b> <b>wheeled</b> robot. Performances of this algorithm and confrontation with other existing methods are provided. ...|$|R
5000|$|Frantz shares {{went public}} on November 17, 1959 and traded Over the Counter until October 7, 1970 {{when it was}} listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1985, the Company {{successfully}} defended itself from a hostile takeover attempt by E.A.C. Industries, Inc. In 1987 it was delisted from the American Stock Exchange and in 1988 became privately held. [...] Today Frantz continues to manufacture and market anti-friction products such as bearings, <b>conveyor</b> <b>wheels,</b> and balls throughout North America and internationally from its plants in Sterling, Illinois.

40|$|Color Region {{may be an}} {{interesting}} image feature to extract for visual tasks in robotics, such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. But, whereas numerous methods are used for vision systems embedded on robots, only a few use this segmentation {{mainly because of the}} processing duration. In this paper, we propose a new real-time (ie. video rate) color region segmentation followed by a robust color classification and a merging of regions, dedicated to various applications such as RoboCup four-legged league or an industrial <b>conveyor</b> <b>wheeled</b> robot. Performances of this algorithm and confrontation with other methods, in terms of result quality and temporal performances are provided. For better quality results, the obtained speed up is between 2 and 4. For same quality results, the it is up to 10. We present also the outlines of the Dynamic Vision System of the CLÉOPATRE Project —for which this segmentation has been developed — and the Clear Box Methodology which allowed us to create the new color region segmentation from the evaluation and the knowledge of other well known segmentations...|$|R

The belt of the conveyor is missing except for a portion at the upper end. This is draped over a wide pulley wheel at the very end of the <b>conveyor.</b> The pulley <b>wheel</b> is powered via a chain (still extant) and an electric motor mounted on a frame above it.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a quadratic programming formulation for the solution of layered elastic contact problems {{in the presence of}} friction is presented in this paper. <b>Conveyor</b> belts, tyred <b>wheels,</b> composite cylinders, and conrod bearings, are classical examples of systems which can be studied using the efficient numerical methodology proposed here. In this type of mechanical assembly, micro-slip between the mating surfaces often occurs and may eventually lead to system failure. Accurately capturing the evolution of slip and stick areas using a computationally inexpensive procedure (as an alternative to full finite element analysis) is therefore key to preventing these failures and to improving the design of various engineering components...|$|R
40|$|Dear Sir or Madam, My name is David Longman and I {{am looking}} a {{position}} in race engineering, engineering design or race mechanics. Over the last 10 years, I have combined my motorsports experience with formal education to enhance my race engineering design skills. I am currently working as an engineer at Porter's Fabrications, a multi-million dollar manufacturing facility. On a daily basis I deal with complex engineering drawings which require prototype construction and I determine the methods for manufacturing. These methods include laser cutting, bending/forming, machining, welding and powder coating. I graduated from UNC-Charlotte {{with a degree in}} mechanical engineering, physics, a math minor and a concentration in motorsports. Having this vast amount of education has helped me with my problem solving skills and knowing where to look for answers. In my senior year, I designed and built a revolutionary alignment rig for the Formula SAE car. The rigs accuracy was based on the true axis of wheel rotation not on how true parts where machined. This allowed the user to measure toe and camber free wheel or tool defects. Lastly, I used system of <b>conveyor</b> rollers, <b>wheel</b> plates, plumb bobs and corner weight scales {{for the rest of the}} rig...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{technology}} {{has had a}} profound effect in every area of human activity. This {{technology has}} transformed the content and ideas of the printing press (ink and paper) into bitslbytes of electronic documents. Most importantly, digital technology has become a cornerstone in e-business and Internet marketing by increasing the ability of accessing and distributing information via electronic media. The focal point of this thesis is to design digital brochures for the Material Handling Industry of America (MHIA). PDF document will be used in converting the hard copy brochures into interactive electronic document format. These brochures include "Application Guidelines for Gravity Roller & <b>Wheel</b> <b>Conveyors</b> " and "Retail Trends & Conveyor Systems". Before the conversion, the texts and images will be updated in order to reflect the current changes in the industry and the true picture of the company. Then it will be formatted for on screen reading. Finally, bookmarks and thumbnails will be added to increase the navigability of the PDFdocuments. Based on the review for this research study, digital technology is still in its early stages of development despite the expanded uses of PDF that have gone well beyond its initial scope of viewing and printing. Looking ahead, applications of digital technology will become an increasingly integral part of every business in response to competition and demand, and Adobe will continue to take up these challenges.

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to investigating the factor that effect repair and maintenance cost of combine harvester. Combine harvester is use to overcome shortage of manpower in agriculture sector. Repair and maintenance cost is the main factor in order to select a new or second hand combine harvester because the capacity or age of the machine may increase the cost of repair and maintenance. Common model of combine harvester that is mainly use in Malaysia is New Holland. The {{research was}} conducted in Langkawi and Kota Setar district. This research is significant for the conductor or owner to decide the best combine harvester before purchasing. The combine harvester with several ability and durability that can enhance {{the efficiency of the}} combine harvester in harvesting operation. Cross section survey that is use to collect the data and regression and correlation matrix is the data interpreted result in the research model. The distribution of critical parts have changed during repair and maintenance cost activities are ground speed vari-drive (24 %), shaft tire (18 %) and grain elevator drive (9 %), for the maintenance in off season the part normally changed are <b>wheel,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and pump bush track (10 %), Soucy track (9 %), and, straw walker and header (8 %). Combine harvester need to be repair and maintenance after usage in between 60 I to 900 hours in seasons. The owner or farmer need to repair and maintained the combine harvester to reduce the factor that enhance combine harvester breakdown. This problem needs to overcome to reduce the losses to owner of combine harvester. Machinery cost is the secondary highest cost after own the land...|$|R
5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt <b>conveyor</b> prevents the <b>wheels</b> of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|R
