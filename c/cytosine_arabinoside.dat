50|$|<b>Cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> {{combines}} a cytosine base with an arabinose sugar. It is an antimetabolic agent with the chemical name of 1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Certain sponges, {{where it was}} originally found, use arabinoside sugars to form a different compound (not part of DNA). <b>Cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> is similar enough to human cytosine deoxyribose (deoxycytidine) to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. <b>Cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into <b>cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for mitosis, are therefore most affected. <b>Cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> also inhibits both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether {{changes in}} iron metabolism and the transferrin receptor (TRF-R) expression {{were involved in}} the antileukaemic effects of <b>arabinoside</b> <b>cytosine</b> (ara-C). Treatment with 100 nM ara-C for 48 h reduced thymidine uptake and increased the surface expression of the TRF-R on leukaemic blasts derived from 13 / 16 (81 %) patients and on the HL- 60 and U- 937 cell lines. Whereas intracellular non-haem iron was strongly depleted 24 h after ara-C addition, TRF-R up-regulation and recovery of intracellular non-haem iron concentration occurred together after a longer exposure of the cultured cells to the drug. Since iron is an essential regulator of cell proliferation we have evaluated the effects of the combination between ara-C and the iron chelator desferioxamine (DSF) on the growth of HL- 60 and U- 937 cells. We found that desferioxamine strongly potentiated the effects of ara-C on leukaemic cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by, for instance, curcumin {{is becoming an}} important new approach in combination with chemotherapy or irradiation {{for the treatment of}} a variety of cancers including haematological malignancies. A dose-limiting side effect of anticancer therapy in the gastrointestinal tract is mucosal barrier injury. It is hypothesised that mucosal barrier injury is initiated and amplified by proinflammatory-and NF-kappaB-regulated mediators. Therefore, the effect of NF-kappaB inhibition was studied in the onset of mucosal barrier injury. In response to cytostatic drug treatment (<b>arabinoside</b> <b>cytosine</b> (Ara-C) and methotrexate (MTX)), NF-kappaB was activated in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC- 6) resulting in an NF-kappaB-related induction of tumour necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1. NF-kappaB inhibition increased the susceptibility of IEC- 6 cells to Ara-C as well as MTX-induced cell death when obtained by the addition of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), but not using curcumin. In an animal model for MTX-induced mucosal barrier injury, the induction of NF-kappaB-related cytokines and chemokines was detected upon treatment with MTX. Despite increased susceptibility shown in vitro, the {{inhibition of}} NF-kappaB resulted in a partial amelioration of villous atrophy normally seen in the small intestine upon MTX treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is {{the most}} frequently-occurring {{malignant}} neoplasm in children, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. In a microarray assay using samples from 100 children with ALL, SFRS 1 {{was found to be}} up-regulated. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF 1, also termed SF 2 /ASF), encoded by the SFRS 1 gene, had been shown to be a pro-oncoprotein. Our previous study indicated that SRSF 1 can be methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT 1) in vitro; however, the biological function of SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 in pediatric ALL are presently unknown. Methods Matched, newly diagnosed (ND), complete remission (CR) and relapse (RE) bone marrow samples from 57 patients were collected in order to evaluate the expression patterns of SRSF 1 and PRMT 1. The potential oncogenic mechanism of SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 in leukemogenesis was also investigated. Results We identified significant up-regulation of SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 in the ND samples. Importantly, the expression of SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 returned to normal levels after CR, but rebounded in the RE samples. Our observation that SRSF 1 could predict disease relapse was of particular interest, although the expression patterns of SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 were independent of the cytogenetic subtypes. In pre-B-cell lines, both SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 expression could be efficiently attenuated by the clinical chemotherapy agents <b>arabinoside</b> <b>cytosine</b> (Ara-c) or vincristine (VCR). Moreover, SRSF 1 and PRMT 1 were associated with each other in leukemia cells in vivo. Knock-down of SRSF 1 resulted in an increase in early apoptosis, which could be further induced by chemotherapeutics. Conclusions Our results indicate that SRSF 1 serves as an anti-apoptotic factor and potentially contributes to leukemogenesis in pediatric ALL patients by cooperating with PRMT 1. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} brain structure involved in the control of. energy homeostasis. Recent reports indicate that hypothalamus exhibits neuroproliferative. potency in adult. Moreover, it has been found that hypothalamic cell. proliferation could be modulated by numerous intrinsic factors such as CNTF, IGF-. 1, bFGF and EGF, and by external and internal conditions such as dehydration,. variation in ambient temperature and during ovarian cycle. Interestingly, experimental. manipulation of neurogenesis can affect body weight. However, whether. nutritional conditions could influence hypothalamic cell proliferation and thereby. modify energy homeostasis is still unknown. To address this question, mice were. subjected to a high fat diet (HFD) for 1 week and hypothalamic cell renewal was. assessed through central chronic infusion of Bromodeoxy-Uridine (BrdU). Using this. approach, we report that hypothalamus constitutively exhibits G 2000 BrdUpositive. neo-formed cells per day. This proliferative rate was significantly higher in hypothalamus 3 days after the onset of HFD (+ 60 %) but decreased by 50 % on day. 5. To determine whether these HFD-induced modifications of cell renewal were. linked to change in cell proliferation, we counted Ki 67 immunoreactive cells. We. found 1937 Ki 67 immunoreactive cells in hypothalamus from mice fed with. standard chow. However, the number of such cell was significantly higher in mice. fed with HFD for 1 and 3 days (+ 30 % and 50 %, respectively), and returned to basal. value after 5 days. In order to evaluate the role of newborn cells, HFD fed mice were. treated with the anti-mitotic <b>arabinoside</b> <b>cytosine</b> (AraC) for 30 days. Results show. that AraC treatment increased HFD-induced body weight gain, suggesting that. newborn HFD-induced cells produce anorectic function.

50|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} of antineoplastic resistance is over-expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes or carrier molecules. By increasing expression of metabolic enzymes, drugs are more rapidly converted to drug conjugates or inactive forms that can then be excreted. For example, increased expression of glutathione promotes drug resistance, as the electrophilic properties of glutathione allow it to react with cytotoxic agents, inactivating them. In some cases, decreased expression or loss of expression of drug-metabolising enzymes confers resistance, as the enzymes are needed to process a drug from an inactive form to an active form. Arabinoside, a commonly used chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphomas, is converted into <b>cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> triphosphate by deoxycytidine kinase. Mutation of deoxycytidine kinase or loss of expression results in resistance to arabinoside. This {{is a form of}} enzymatic deactivation.|$|E

40|$|This {{protocol}} supersedes {{the previous}} (March 2003) version Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and High Risk Myelodysplasia are primarily {{diseases of the}} elderly. Although there have been gradual improvements in rates of initial over time, very few patients survive beyond 5 years. Considerable numbers of patients with these diseases have not been entered into previous clinical trials since there is uncertainty as to whether intensive chemotherapy will be either tolerated or beneficial. The AML 14 Trial will evaluate two treatment strategies, an Intensive and a Non-Intensive approach. Where there is uncertainty, patients with AML or High Risk MDS (> 10 % blasts) will be randomised between the Intensive and the Non-Intensive treatment approaches. The Intensive treatment arm will compare two doses of Daunorubicin (50 mg/m 2 vs 35 mg/m 2), two doses of <b>Cytosine</b> <b>Arabinoside</b> (200 mg/m 2 vs 400 mg/m 2), and three versus four courses of treatment in total.

40|$|We {{present an}} adult female patient who {{developed}} irreversible paraplegia and areflexia four days post intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate, <b>cytosine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> and hydrocortisone. On {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) of the lumbar spine, diffuse gadolinium enhancement of the anterior spinal nerve roots (ventral roots) was detected. Methylprednisolone was intravenously administered at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg for three days. Despite this treatment, flaccid weakness in the lower extremities and urinary retention persisted. Following consolidation chemotherapy, no improvement in neurologic status was noted. Six months later, a follow-up MRI revealed severe atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord.
