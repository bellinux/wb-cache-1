2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In <b>Commission</b> <b>v</b> <b>Germany</b> the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E

40|$|Free {{movement}} of goods is a fundamental principle of the European Community. Article 36 of the EEC Treaty, however, provides important exceptions {{to the principle of}} free {{movement of}} goods as embodied in Article 30. Recently, the Court of Justice of the European Community (2 ̆ 2 Court of Justice 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Court 2 ̆ 2) has begun to develop a significant body of case law on the protection of human health exception of Article 36. This development coincides with the increasing public interest in consumer protection law, particularly with regard to the production of food-stuffs. Commission of the European Communities v. Federal Republic of Germany presents the Court 2 ̆ 7 s most recent attempt to define the protection of human health exception. In <b>Commission</b> <b>v.</b> <b>Germany,</b> the Court held that the Reinheitsgebot or beer purity laws of the Federal Republic of Germany (2 ̆ 2 Germany 2 ̆ 2) violated Article 30 and could not be justified under the Article 36 protection of human health exception. This Note examines <b>Commission</b> <b>v.</b> <b>Germany</b> for the legal definition it gives to the Article 36 exception for the protection of human health.

40|$|Most {{amendments}} of the Polish {{rail transport}} law in 2011 concerned the organisation of rail transport including: improvements in timetable changing procedures; mechanisms {{to ensure the}} observance and early publication of timetables; interoperability of the rail system and; certification of train drivers. Introduced were also some changes meant to restructure the incumbent state rail operator (in Polish: Polskie Koleje Państwowe; hereafter PKP). The short, but important, amendment of the Act on Commercialization, Restructuring and Privatization of state enterprise ‘PKP’ seeks to guarantee the independence from railway operators of the personnel of the infrastructure manager (in Polish: PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe; hereafter PKP PKL). The rail infrastructure manager’s lack of autonomy {{was one of the}} Commission’s allegations against Poland in the case C- 512 / 10 which is yet to be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

40|$|In 2010, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) {{delivered}} a landmark judgment concerning {{the requirements of}} the ‘complete independence’ of national data protection supervisory authorities (<b>Commission</b> <b>v.</b> <b>Germany,</b> C- 518 / 07). Two and a half years later, the Court has taken a far more moderate view when assessing the level of independence of the Austrian Data Protection Commission (Commission v. Austria, C- 614 / 10). For the author, who had criticized the previous judgment, the more recent one is a major step forward – towards a fair balance to be struck between the necessary independence of these authorities and  the likewise necessary coherence of general State organization, State responsibility and State budget. The more recent judgment is also more in line with a) the wording of Article 8 (3) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, b) the level of independence enjoyed by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), the French Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL) and the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI) under the ‘Paris Principles’, and c) the  previous case law (Commission v. ECB). Nevertheless, even this more moderate level of independence required for data protection authorities seems to exceed the one deemed sufficient for the judiciary. This is highly problematic {{given the fact that the}} judiciary is not just a branch of State organization completely separated from data protection authorities but, on the contrary, is called upon to legally review the decisions of data protection authorities. So also Commission v. Austria will, most probably, not yet be the end of the story – the more so, because the arguments raised in both judgments in favour of ‘complete independence’ are not intrinsically linked to the issue of data protection, but are likewise applicable to all kinds of regulatory bodies or institutions with a specific remit to secure fundamental rights, and, thus, in principle with horizontal relevance. </p...|$|E
