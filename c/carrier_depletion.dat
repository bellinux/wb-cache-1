Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge <b>carrier</b> <b>depletion</b> region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes.

40|$|In this work, the {{capacitive}} {{response of}} organic electronic devices is analysed. Particular attention {{is given to}} small-molecule organic solar cells, {{with the purpose of}} deriving an equivalent circuit for the small-signal response of these devices. The different components characterising the solar cells electrical response are individuated and discussed and a specific physical meaning is associated with each element of the equivalent circuit. In the experimental section, the capacitive elements of the equivalent circuit are characterised by analysing organic diodes and solar cells. It is found that the capacitance of an organic solar cell is a combination of four components: the dielectric response of the materials, the depletion regions formed at the interfaces, the accumulation of free and trapped charge <b>carriers.</b> The <b>depletion</b> regions formed in organic doped semiconductors are characterised by analysing organic p/n homojunction diodes composed of Zinc-Phtalocyanine (ZnPc). The results demonstrate that the mechanisms involved in the formation of depletion zones in organic semiconductors can be described by the classical Mott-Schottky theory. This allows to estimate the free charge carrier density of doped layers with capacitance measurements. In addition, the current-voltage characteristics of organic p/n homojunctions are found not to obey the classical Shockley theory. It is demonstrated that charge carrier tunnelling is the cause of this discrepancy and an analytic model is used to describe the current-voltage characteristics. The accumulation of free charge carriers is found to induce capacitance effects typical of relaxation semiconductors. In presence of unbalanced charge carriers injection, negative capacitance values are observed.
