40|$|Abstract. <b>COFFE</b> is a {{hash-based}} authenticated encryption scheme. In {{the original}} paper, it was {{claimed to have}} IND-CPA security and also ciphertext integrity even in nonce-misuse scenario. In this paper, we analyse the security of <b>COFFE.</b> Our attack shows that even {{under the assumption that}} the primitive hash function is ideal, a valid ciphertext can be forged with 2 enquiries with success probability close to 1. The motivation of the attack is to find a collision on the input of each of the hash calls in the <b>COFFE</b> instantiation. It can be done in two ways. The first way is by modifying nonce and last message block size. Chosen appropriately, we can ensure two <b>COFFE</b> instantiations with different nonce and different last message block size can have exactly the same intermediate state value. This hence leads to a valid ciphertext to be generated. Another way is by considering two different <b>COFFE</b> instantiations with different message block size despite same key. In this case, we will use the existence of consecutive zero in the binary representation of pi to achieve identical intermediate state value on two different <b>COFFE</b> instantiations. Having the state collisions, the forgery attack is then conducted by choosing two different plaintexts with appropriate nonce and tag size to query. Having this fact, without knowing the secret key, we can then validly encrypt another plaintext with probability equal to 1...|$|E
