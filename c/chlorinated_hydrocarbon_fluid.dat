NF is injected periodically while OF is injected continuously and both are extracted so that both are drawn across the plume. NF stimulates microbial colony growth; withholding it periodically forces the larger, healthy colony of microbes to degrade the contaminants. Treatment is continued until the subsurface concentration of contaminants is acceptable. NF can be methane and OF be air, for stimulating production of methanotrophs to break down chlorohydrocarbons, especially TCE and tetrachloroethylene...|$|R

Application of the developed model to a testing set of 73 <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> demonstrates that the new model is reliable with good predictive accuracy and simple formulation. Besides, the model does not require any experimental physicochemical properties in the calculation, so it is easy to apply, especially in cases where it is inconvenient or impossible to measure the physicochemical properties...|$|R

An inventory has been drawn up for the emissions to air and surfacewaters in the Netherlands of seven chlorinated hydrocarbons: dichloromethane, chloroform, carbontetrachloride, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, tri-chloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, for which abatement measures are presented. Using the STRAVERA model, future trends in emissions and surface water loading have been computed for three scenarios: (1) established policy, (2) planned policy and (3) additional measures. Because of the fast proceeding of the established and planned policy regarding the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> scenario (1) and (2) are presented together. The results of the calculations are compared with the government policy target (North Sea Action Plan). Although this target of 50 % reduction in surface water loading in 1995 can be achieved for all seven <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> extra attention must be paid to the development of the emissions of chloroform, dichloroethane, and tetrachloroethylene. This study shows, in fact, that this extra attention is certainly necessary because replacement occurs of one <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> by the other.
