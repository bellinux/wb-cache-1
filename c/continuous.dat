5|$|A <b>continuous</b> front line, {{no matter}} how thinly held.|$|E
5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a <b>continuous</b> surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a <b>continuous</b> and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a <b>continuous</b> linear map whose inverse is also <b>continuous).</b> This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is <b>continuous</b> if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E
5|$|<b>Continuous</b> Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on <b>continuous</b> care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for <b>continuous</b> care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, <b>continuous</b> care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compute the curve-shortening flow efficiently, both a <b>continuous</b> curve and the <b>continuous</b> {{evolution}} of the curve {{need to be replaced}} by a discrete approximation.|$|E
5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or <b>continuous,</b> but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of <b>continuous</b> fluid.|$|E
5|$|Episodes in bold are <b>continuous</b> episodes, {{where the}} story spans over 2 or more episodes.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a <b>continuous</b> wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is <b>continuous,</b> welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, <b>continuous</b> broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. <b>Continuous</b> style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|M. lashuyuanensis – this oospecies {{is based}} on an eggshell {{fragment}} found in the Nanxiong Basin of Guangdong. With a thickness of , its eggshell is the thickest among Macroolithus oospecies. It is furthermore distinguished by having a dark, dense band near the top of its <b>continuous</b> layer and a gradual transition between the <b>continuous</b> and mammilary layers.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a <b>continuous</b> function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike. In contrast, three-dimensional materials have <b>continuous</b> DOS. The sharp peaks found in one-dimensional materials are called Van Hove singularities.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} <b>continuous</b> functional calculus has {{applications in}} particular to pseudodifferential operators.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from <b>continuous</b> and diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange. During <b>continuous</b> gas exchange, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a <b>continuous</b> cycle. In discontinuous gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of <b>continuous</b> gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need {{to rise to the}} water surface to replenish air supplies, which may be held or trapped in special structures.|$|E
5|$|This is <b>continuous</b> and compactly supported, {{but not a}} mollifier {{because it}} is not smooth.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of <b>continuous</b> {{geometry}} based on lattice theoretic principles. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry {{in terms of the}} properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the <b>continuous</b> geometries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{auditing}} {{is made up}} {{of three}} main parts: <b>continuous</b> data assurance (CDA), <b>continuous</b> controls monitoring (CCM), and <b>continuous</b> risk monitoring and assessment (CRMA).|$|E
25|$|Any {{absolutely}} <b>continuous</b> {{function is}} uniformly <b>continuous.</b> On the other hand, the Cantor function is uniformly <b>continuous</b> but not absolutely <b>continuous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Every Lipschitz <b>continuous</b> map {{between two}} metric spaces is uniformly <b>continuous.</b> In particular, every {{function}} which is differentiable and has bounded derivative is uniformly <b>continuous.</b> More generally, every Hölder <b>continuous</b> function is uniformly <b>continuous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cauchy did {{not clearly}} {{distinguish}} between continuity and uniform continuity on an interval. Notably, in his 1821 Cours d'analyse, Cauchy {{argued that the}} (pointwise) limit of (pointwise) <b>continuous</b> functions was itself (pointwise) <b>continuous,</b> a statement interpreted as being incorrect by many scholars. The correct statement is rather that the uniform limit of <b>continuous</b> functions is <b>continuous</b> (also, the uniform limit of uniformly <b>continuous</b> functions is uniformly <b>continuous).</b>|$|E
25|$|Symmetric to {{the concept}} of a <b>continuous</b> map is an open map, for which images of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map f has an inverse function, that inverse is <b>continuous,</b> and if a <b>continuous</b> map g has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a {{bijective}} function f between two topological spaces, the inverse function f−1 need not be <b>continuous.</b> A bijective <b>continuous</b> function with <b>continuous</b> inverse function is called a homeomorphism.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} <b>continuous</b> {{production}} {{demonstrated by the}} paper machine influenced the development of <b>continuous</b> rolling of iron and later steel and other <b>continuous</b> production processes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{probability}} theory deals with events {{that occur in}} a <b>continuous</b> sample space.|$|E
25|$|In particular, if X is <b>continuous,</b> then M and A are <b>continuous.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>continuous</b> lattice is a {{complete}} lattice that is <b>continuous</b> as a poset.|$|E
25|$|A <b>continuous</b> real {{function}} on {{the closed}} unit interval is uniformly <b>continuous.</b>|$|E
25|$|All uniformly <b>continuous</b> {{functions}} are <b>continuous</b> {{with respect to}} the induced topologies.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as for}} {{discrete}} events, {{there are}} Petri nets for <b>continuous</b> and hybrid discrete-continuous processes that are useful in discrete, <b>continuous</b> and hybrid control theory, and related to discrete, <b>continuous</b> and hybrid automata.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponential}} function xnbsp&nbsp&e'x is <b>continuous</b> everywhere {{on the real}} line but is not uniformly <b>continuous</b> on the line.|$|E
25|$|By the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani {{representation}} theorem, the <b>continuous</b> dual {{of certain}} spaces of <b>continuous</b> functions {{can be described}} using measures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{auditing}} {{need not}} be literally <b>continuous.</b> Auditors {{need to consider the}} natural rhythm of the process being audited, including the timing of computer and business processes as well as the timing and availability of auditors trained or with experience in <b>continuous</b> auditing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{reporting}} is {{the release of}} financial and non-financial information on a real-time or near real-time basis. The purpose of <b>continuous</b> {{reporting is}} to allow external parties access to information as underlying events take place, rather than waiting for end-of-period reports. The adoption of XBRL by companies makes the release of <b>continuous</b> reporting information more feasible. <b>Continuous</b> reporting also benefits users under Regulation Fair Disclosure.|$|E
25|$|In <b>continuous</b> {{digestion}} processes, {{organic matter}} is constantly added (<b>continuous</b> complete mixed) or added in stages to the reactor (<b>continuous</b> plug flow; first in – first out). Here, the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples {{of this form}} of anaerobic digestion include <b>continuous</b> stirred-tank reactors, upflow anaerobic sludge blankets, expanded granular sludge beds and internal circulation reactors.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a <b>continuous</b> {{function}} {{is a function}} for which sufficiently small changes in the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output. Otherwise, a {{function is}} said to be a discontinuous function. A <b>continuous</b> function with a <b>continuous</b> inverse function is called a homeomorphism.|$|E
25|$|The tangent {{function}} is <b>continuous</b> on the interval (−π/2,nbsp&π/2) {{but is not}} uniformly <b>continuous</b> on that interval.|$|E
25|$|There are 3 breath sequences: <b>Continuous</b> {{mandatory}} ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and <b>Continuous</b> Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath {{sequence is}} a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: <b>continuous</b> mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and <b>continuous</b> spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).|$|E
25|$|These {{functions}} are often incorrectly {{referred to as}} the basis functions of the (<b>continuous)</b> transform. In fact, as in the <b>continuous</b> Fourier transform, there is no basis in the <b>continuous</b> wavelet transform. Time-frequency interpretation uses a subtly different formulation (after Delprat).|$|E
25|$|Pearson's {{system of}} <b>continuous</b> curves. A system of <b>continuous</b> {{univariate}} probability distributions {{that came to}} {{form the basis of}} the now conventional <b>continuous</b> probability distributions. Since the system is complete up to the fourth moment, it is a powerful complement to the Pearsonian method of moments.|$|E
