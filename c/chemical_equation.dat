25|$|A {{chemical}} reaction {{is a process}} that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, {{chemical reaction}}s encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a <b>chemical</b> <b>equation.</b> Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} reaction is {{a transformation of}} some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a <b>chemical</b> <b>equation,</b> which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms {{on the left and}} the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of {{chemical reaction}}s a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.|$|E

25|$|Plants use {{carbon dioxide}} {{gas in the}} process of {{photosynthesis}}, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The <b>chemical</b> <b>equation</b> of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to use it.|$|E

40|$|Markov jump {{processes}} {{are widely used}} to model interacting species in circumstances where discreteness and stochasticity are relevant. Such models have been particularly successful in computational cell biology, and in this case, the interactions are typically first-order. The <b>Chemical</b> Langevin <b>Equation</b> is a stochastic differential equation that {{can be regarded as}} an approximation to the underlying jump process. In particular, the <b>Chemical</b> Langevin <b>Equation</b> allows simulations to be performed more effectively. In this work, we obtain expressions for the first and second moments of the <b>Chemical</b> Langevin <b>Equation</b> for a generic first-order reaction network. Moreover, we show that these moments exactly match those of the underlying jump process. Hence, in terms of means, variances and correlations, the <b>Chemical</b> Langevin <b>Equation</b> is an excellent proxy for the <b>Chemical</b> Master <b>Equation.</b> Our work assumes that a unique solution exists for the <b>Chemical</b> Langevin <b>Equation.</b> We also show that the moment matching result extends to the case where a gene regulation model of Raser and O’Shea (Science, 2004) is replaced by a hybrid model that mixes elements of the Master and Langevin equations. We finish with numerical experiments on a dimerization model that involves second order reactions, showing that the two regimes continue to give similar results.

40|$|The <b>chemical</b> Fokker-Planck <b>equation</b> and the {{corresponding}} <b>chemical</b> Langevin <b>equation</b> are commonly used approximations of the <b>chemical</b> master <b>equation.</b> These equations are derived from an uncontrolled, second-order truncation of the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the <b>chemical</b> master <b>equation</b> and hence their accuracy remains to be clarified. We use the system-size expansion to show that chemical Fokker-Planck estimates of the mean concentrations and of the variance of the concentration fluctuations about the mean are accurate to order Ω(- 3 ∕ 2) for reaction systems which do not obey detailed balance and at least accurate to order Ω(- 2) for systems obeying detailed balance, where Ω is the characteristic size of the system. Hence, the <b>chemical</b> Fokker-Planck <b>equation</b> {{turns out to be}} more accurate than the linear-noise approximation of the <b>chemical</b> master <b>equation</b> (the linear Fokker-Planck equation) which leads to mean concentration estimates accurate to order Ω(- 1 ∕ 2) and variance estimates accurate to order Ω(- 3 ∕ 2). This higher accuracy is particularly conspicuous for chemical systems realized in small volumes such as biochemical reactions inside cells. A formula is also obtained for the approximate size of the relative errors in the concentration and variance predictions of the <b>chemical</b> Fokker-Planck <b>equation,</b> where the relative error is defined as the difference between the predictions of the <b>chemical</b> Fokker-Planck <b>equation</b> and the master equation divided by the prediction of the master equation.
