40|$|Nowadays, {{the globe}} is {{suffering}} {{an economic downturn}} and the competition within the logistics industry has {{become more and more}} intense. Therefore, a number of logistics services providers (LSPs), such as freight forwarding companies, is facing with a decline in business volume. It is believed that the reason of profit loss is due to high operating and transportation costs within the logistics network. LSPs, in such sense, try to reappraise the current logistics network and relocate the distribution centres for cutting operating costs, reducing lead time, and enhancing customer service level. In order to help these companies achieve these goals, a decision support system (DSS) is required to analyze various factors including inbound <b>freight</b> <b>costs,</b> warehousing <b>costs,</b> and outbound <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> under different scenarios.

Road freight generates eight times the external costs of rail, 2. 35 Euro cents per tonne kilometre in 2005 (5. 6 % accidents, 74. 7 % air pollution and 19. 7 % climate) vs. 0. 28 (13. 4 % accidents, 53. 9 % air pollution and 32. 7 % climate) ...|$|R

In a first analysis, the Canadian’s system goes through problems of productivity efficiency, especially for the short stayed permitted time of foreign containers in the country. In a contrast, the extensive coastline and the high import taxes, contribute to the development of Brazilian cabotage. However, the policies of Mercosur prevent the cabotage along countries in the same coast (i. e. Brasil-Argentina), a fact that would facilitate trade between the countries...|$|R

Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans.

40|$|This work {{sought to}} explain the complex nature of the {{principles}} behind <b>freight</b> <b>costs,</b> focusing on certain dysfunctions and the limited efficiency of freight rate negotiation in the supply chains of the Brazilian agribusiness. Statistical and econometric techniques were used to identify the systematic behavior of the freight rates of the selected products and, where possible, this procedure was allied to other market evidence. It was possible to identify the influence of many variables on freight rates, such as distance, seasonality of production, the corridors along which the cargo is transported, its specific characteristics and the resulting demands made by customers. The fact that distance behaved as an explanatory variable, and was statistically significant {{in all of the}} models, means that mileage should be considered an important variable in the determination of freight rates. However, it is also necessary to consider that the significance of â€œdistanceâ€ varies as much according to the detailed characteristics of the cargo as it does according to region. It was concluded that these variables make it possible both to develop negotiation strategies and to minimize conflicts in negotiations, as the costs are identified by the parties concerned. agribusiness logistics, transportation <b>costs,</b> <b>freight</b> rates.,...|$|R
