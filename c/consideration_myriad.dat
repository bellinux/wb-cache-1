In private or institutionalized practice, in almost any area of active research, in meat inspection, and in pathology and diagnostic services, one common shared activity is the actual or supervisory killing of animals. The motivations, methods, and <b>considerations</b> are <b>myriad,</b> but the process of inflicting death on a variety of living creatures is an inseparable, undeniable part of the veterinary profession...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{biological}} control introductions have adversely affected non-target native species. Although {{many of these}} problems occurred {{in the early days}} of {{biological control}}, some are recent. Because of how little monitoring is done on species, communities, and ecosystems that might be affected by biological control agents, it is quite possible that known problems are the tip of an iceberg. Regulations for officially sanctioned releases for biological control are insufficient, and there are also freelance unregulated releases undertaken by private citizens. Cost-benefit analyses for conservation issues, including those associated with biological control, are exceedingly difficult because it is hard to assign values to the loss of species or ecosystem functions. Risk assessment for biological control is difficult because of how hard it is to predict community- and ecosystem-wide impacts of intro-duced species and because introduced species disperse and evolve. Nevertheless, cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments for biological control introductions would have the salubrious effect of forcing <b>consideration</b> of <b>myriad</b> factors that now often receive cursory attention and of broadening public understanding of the issues...|$|R
50|$|Concordia had outgrown its modest {{beginning}} and by February 1893 land was purchased in Unionville, New York (now Hawthorne) for $9,000 donated by M.S. Becker. In modern terms {{that would be}} $250,000. A sub-committee was elected to locate land outside of New York City. Pastor Edmund Bohn, William Dick, and Henry Fischer took a train to the Unionville Station in Westchester County. Property was selected based on the persuasiveness of {{a real estate agent}} and a local farmer who claimed that oats, corn, vegetables, and hay could be harvested from the land and that the property contained enough stones to build a foundation.After great <b>consideration</b> (and <b>myriad</b> maintenance issues) the college was moved once again to its current home in Bronxville. Fourteen acres were bought for $52,383 (equivalent to over 1 million dollars today) on April 23, 1908. The Bronxville property, like the Hawthorn campus, was chosen for its close proximity to Manhattan and for its bucolic backdrop. Three buildings—Feth Hall, Bohm Hall and the Commons—were designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton and constructed in 8 months for $160,000 ($3,793,486.87 in 2015 dollars), which included furnishings and landscaping. On January 4, 1910 the Bronxville campus opened with a student body of 100 young men.|$|R
40|$|This {{reaction}} article applauds {{the authors}} of the Major Contribution for their thoughtful and thorough <b>consideration</b> of the <b>myriad</b> issues that accompany disaster mental health work. The reaction highlights three themes that emerged in the articles of the contribution: opportunities for collaboration, opportunities for the application of social justice, and opportunities for bioecological research and interventions. In addition, suggestions are made for future exploration of prevention opportunities, separating the reality of disaster response from popular media images, and ethical considerations for counseling psychologists working as disaster responders. Keywords disaster response, professional identity, bioecological model, social justice A clear articulation of the various roles counseling psychologists can assume in the response to disaster is long awaited, and I read the articles of this Major Contribution with great interest and appreciation for the thorough and thoughtful work of the authors.

40|$|Investigation of the {{engineering}} trade-space associated with complex capabilities and system-of-systems (SoS) solutions is often pursued outside the purview of an over-arching Major Defense Acquisition Program. As a result, many of the mandates associated with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition process may not be levied upon such activities. However, since establishing an operational context for system or capability development remains a systems engineering best practice, the requirement for a concept of operations document should be given favorable <b>consideration.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>myriad</b> variants of CONOPS in the DoD (and the organizational pedigree associated with each) can generate misunderstanding and disagreement over authorship, ownership, approval authority, and the intended purpose of the document. The title alone can undermine the utility of an operational context document and result in its misinterpretation or rejection. This paper compares guidance {{on the development of}} operational concept documents from industry, DoD and U. S. military services and compares them with related documents that are sometimes confused with (or inappropriately substituted for) CONOPS. A new method for establishing an operational context for SoS-based capability development is presented as an alternate to the aforementioned documents...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{art that}} I create has {{uncertain}} archival potential. I work with recycled and ephemeral materials, and often it is the idea or theme and not the material that matters most. In contrast, particular teaching moments and memories remain with me as an educator. For example, while I was in graduate school, a mentor warned against “putting all my eggs in one basket. ” This phrase and predicament seemed personally and professionally poignant in terms of sustaining myself in my field. There are <b>myriad</b> <b>considerations</b> (or containers) for an art educator. How much time should go into curriculum building versus one’s own work, what topics are most relevant to pursue in research and teaching, and which theories and approaches will be of most value to one’s field? Responding to these and more personal considerations of social and family commitments, I began to weave hundreds of tiny baskets from colorful recycled telephone wire and filled them with collections of tiny beads and ceramic forms (Figure 1). Crafting this web of baskets {{was a sort of}} reflection of my attempts to make a meaningful constellation out of so many possibilities in art education, and to keep several interests in mind and in hand. Rather than accept art and craft making as a small part o...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{increasing}} attention has been devoted within various disciplines to aspects previously considered trivial, among which are images, material objects and spaces. While the visual, the material and the spatial are receiving ever more <b>consideration</b> and the <b>myriad</b> issues surrounding them are being tackled, their convergence in educational settings across time and space has thus far remained underexplored. A travelling photo exhibition, The Family of Man, {{will serve as a}} starting point in this paper for addressing some of the complexities inherent in this convergence and thus highlight an essential yet neglected feature of education: its reliance on, and creative use of, multiple “modes” of communication and representation when attempting to produce learning effects. As a particular educational constellation that went on to travel throughout the world and interact with the contexts in which it moved, The Family of Man was anything but neutral in design. The paper will show just how carefully it was composed to promote meaning-, power-, and knowledge-making in accordance with its mission. This border-crossing installation thus constituted a spectacle of different interacting views, forms, surfaces, lighting effects, panoramas, movements, captions and other factors that aimed to create order among things and people. Nevertheless, the paper argues, “theatres of display” in education such as this do not imply determination and causality of effects, but rather provide “uncertain conditions” within a spectrum of “actors” and “actants”. The paper relates this to the manifold affordances of objects, images, places and so on, to disruptions of meaning in their convergence across time and space and to “emancipation” on the part of learners...|$|R

However, this challenge is also limited by the changing code of the Internet, at varying levels, as corpora-tions seek to change open code to closed-proprietary code and limit such actions. Thus, this article explores the resistances of fans to corporate actions and how the code of the Internet is gradually changing into a system more con-ducive to corporate capitalism than community creation or any other transformative space. It would be unwise to ignore the design of cyberspace itself while we are engaged in the <b>myriad</b> <b>considerations</b> of particular GUI [graphical user interface] and VR [virtual reality] implementations. —Benedikt (1992, 131) Cyberspace is architecture; cyberspace has an architecture; and cyberspace contains architecture. —Novak (1992, 226) Contributors to the volume Cyberspace: First Steps wrote of the radical potentials for cyberspace, mostly visualized as the development of virtual real-ity (VR) systems where users could interact socially as well as professionally (Benedikt 1992). Writers in that volume were concerned with the architecture of cyberspace, as they believed that how the digital space was built would encourage and discourage certain uses. They knew that architecture could never completely determine user actions but was a critical dimension to con-sider. However, VR’s potential as a popular medium has largely faded, and most attention to “cyberspace ” now concerns the World Wide Web and com...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. The key {{objective}} of this thesis is clearly stated in its comprehensive title. In today’s fast moving, turbulent and highly competitive world, high tech companies and engineering-based organizations struggle possibly more than other businesses with the seemingly irrational, analogical events when most people in such organizations are rational, highly analytical persons. Value creation {{is one of the}} {{key objective}}s of modern high tech companies. Hence, the achievement of this ideal within the constraints and <b>consideration</b> of a <b>myriad</b> of factors requires a different approach and implies an ongoing transformation process which is not always based on rational aspects alone. If such a transformation is to be sustainable and takes place in a globally competitive framework, the approach has to be holistic and it has to consider many additional factors which tend to be considered as soft in the analytical world of high tech. The thesis formulates a management and leadership model which includes both the soft and hard factors in a comprehensive and collaborative manner. The model lends itself to understand and judiciously manipulate the dynamics of the high tech global business environment for sustained competitive advantage. The model recognizes and enables the manager and leader to address the many issues confronting them daily by giving a new strategic perspective with the help of sub-models. These sub-models form the anchors whereby a complex situation can be managed reasonably, effectively and hopefully wisely too. The suggested model is to a large degree independent of time and industry-space and is considered valid for a long time to come. Although aimed at providing a guideline at executive level of management in the high tech environment the suggested model is by no means limited to engineering nor is it limited to high tech companies. The framework and model anchors developed, are equally valid in other complexity-prone industries as can be confirmed by the author’s wide international practical experience in a number of industries, from Banking, Service provides, Health Systems, e-commerce, Petro-Chemical and others...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{presents}} a critical argument {{to the profession}} of career development {{for the purpose of}} stimulating reflexive <b>consideration</b> on the <b>myriad</b> influences that impinge upon practitioners. The paper suggests that given the current skills agenda in the Australian economy, it may be timely to reflexively consider career development practice. The paper uses Charles Dickens’ novel Hard Times and the character Mr Thomas Gradgrind, who was a dedicated educator in a small industrial town set in the Victorian era, to exemplify how the influence of prevailing social philosophies and economic conditions imbue the practice of professionals. It is suggested that there are potential parallels between the practices of Mr Gradgrind and contemporary career development practitioners. Career development practitioners are asked to consider their position in and amongst high level political, economic and educational influences and to reflect upon if and how these influences manifest in their practices. Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them. This is the principle upon which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children. Stick to the Facts, sir! (Dickens, 1854 / 1969, p. 47). So said our earnest Mr Thomas Gradgrind—acolyte of proper education for Coketown, a sooty Victorian-era coal mining town; a dirty old town indeed. What educational principle was Mr Gradgrind espousing? Toward what educational objective was he aiming? What was Charles Dickens trying to say through that tirade of the extraordinary character Mr Gradgrind? Following from Dickens’ illuminating critique of industrial society of the 19 th century, this paper {{presents a}} comment on the economic, political and educational issues associated with the current “skills-shortages” and Australia’s concomitant drive to produce a sustainable labour supply for industries experiencing an impaired capacity to recruit skilled personnel now and into the future (Employment Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, 2003). This brief polemical paper raises critical questions about the position and role of career development practitioners in the confluence of their responsibilities to their clients and the broader social and economic conditions in which they operate as human services or education professionals...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of a myoelectric prosthesis for high level upper extremity amputees requires <b>consideration</b> of a <b>myriad</b> of factors. Although state-of-the-art componentty can dramatically effect the outcome, other factors left unaddressed can negate any advantages that new technology canoffer. Many individrials fit with a prosthesis fiom the humeral neck level and higher often {{complain that the}} weight of the prosthesis, heat build-up while wearing the prosthesis, lack of stability, difficulty in independent donning, and reduced control of terminal device while in certain planes and body positions have resulted in reduced wearing times and in many cases discontinuation of prosthetic use all together. Of course, the factors listed above that lead to reduced wear and in some cases discontinuation are not comprehensive, but do overwhelmingly categorize the responses of over 250 high level amputees polled across the United States between 1993 - 1999. Although a panacea does not exist to completely eliminate the above factors that lead to discontinuation, substantial success at addressing these concerns {{can be found in the}} use of an interface design. Typical interface designs for high level amputees can generally be divided into three classes: 1) "Bucket Interface Style" that completely cover s the effected shoulder and torso often to the midline. The major disadvantage of this style is overheating of the wearer due to excessive interface to skin coverage. 2) "Modified Bucket Style" which encompasses the basicdesign of the "Bucket Interface Design" as it completely encapsulates the shoulder girdle but does not extend to the midline or inferiorly to capture a majority of the torso. This design has partial success in the reduction of heat build up experienced by the wearer, but often results in poor stability and lack of skin to electrode contact whichis manifested in poor terminal device control in certain planes and body positions. Additionally, auxiliary harnessing is required for this design which can have a negative impact on independent donning. 3) "Sander Frame Design" which involves the use of aluminum struts to reduce heat build up and provide acceptable stability and dorming effort. This design has not been universally adopted in the United States due to high degree of fabrication time and skill required. The purpose ofthis paper is to detail the Microframe Interface Design, a more effective alternative to the three current interface designs for high level myoelectric prostheses.
