Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{confusion}} with C. hippos, the species contribution to fisheries is also poorly understood. A combined total of 2233 to 10054 t {{per year for}} C. hippos and C. fischeri was recorded from several African countries by the FAO in the 1995 to 2004 interval, indicating it is of moderate importance. Like the other <b>crevalle</b> <b>jacks,</b> the species is a strong gamefish and sought after by anglers in West Africa. Taken by lures or bait, the species is not considered a good table fish, having coarse, tasteless flesh.|$|R
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack's</b> colour {{ranges from}} brassy green to blue or bluish-black dorsally, {{becoming}} silvery white or golden ventrally. A dark spot is {{present on the}} pectoral fin, with a similar dark to dusky spot present on the upper margin of the operculum. Juveniles have around five dark vertical bands on their sides, with these fading at adulthood. The first dorsal fin, pectoral and pelvic fins range from white to dusky, occasionally with golden tinges throughout. The anal fin lobe is bright yellow, with {{the remainder of the}} fin ranging from golden to dusky, while the underside of the caudal peduncle often being yellow in adults. The caudal fin itself is also golden to dusky, with the lower lobe often brighter yellow than the upper, with both the lobes often having a black trailing edge.|$|R

25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is a powerful, predatory fish, with {{extensive}} studies showing the species consumes {{a variety of}} small fish, with invertebrates such as prawns, shrimps, crabs, molluscs and cephalopods also of minor importance. Dietary shifts with both age, location and season have been demonstrated, which led some researchers to postulate the species is indiscriminant in its feeding habits. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> reaches maturity at 55cm in males and 66cm in females, with spawning taking place year round, although peaks in activity have been documented in several sites. The larval and juvenile growth has been extensively studied, with the oldest known individual 17 years of age. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is an important species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with annual catches ranging between 1000 and 30 000 tonnes over its entire range. It is taken {{by a variety of}} netting methods, including purse nets, seines and gill nets, as well as hook-and-line methods. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is also a revered gamefish, taken both by lures and bait. The species is considered of good to poor quality table fare, and is sold fresh, frozen, or preserved, or as fishmeal or oil at market. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is closely related to both the Pacific <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> and the longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> the latter of which has been extensively confused with the true <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> until recently.|$|E
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> {{lives in}} both inshore and {{offshore}} habitats, with larger adults preferring deeper waters than juveniles. In the inshore environment, <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> inhabit shallow flats, sandy bays, beaches, seagrass beds, shallow reef complexes and lagoons. The species {{is also known}} to enter brackish waters, with some individuals known to penetrate far upstream; however, like most euryhaline species, they generally do not penetrate very far upriver.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, a <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> {{caught by}} {{fishermen}} off South Carolina displayed swollen, bulbous mandibles. These swellings were initially {{thought to be}} due to a copepod parasite, however radiographs and subsequent sectioning found them to be bony in nature. The cause of this calcified connective tissue is still unknown, and there remains only a single reported case of such an ailment in <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack.</b>|$|E
40|$|Following the BP Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} event, {{there was a}} {{critical}} need to assess {{the effects of the}} oil and dispersant chemicals on the coastal pelagic fish complex in the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if spilled crude oil and dispersant chemicals have posed an ecological risk to the coastal pelagic fish complex through the detection of vitellogenesis. Crude oil containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dispersant chemicals and other estrogen-mimicking compounds are suspected to induce vitellogenin production in male and immature female fish, normally only produced by sexually mature females. Blood plasma and surface mucus were collected from wild-caught adult and juvenile males and females from as many representative coastal pelagic species as possible (including yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares and swordfish Xiphias gladius). To create a control for this experiment, <b>crevalle</b> <b>jacks</b> (Caranx hippos) and lookdowns (Selene vomer) were injected with estradiol- 17 β (10 μg/g body weight) into the peritoneal cavity to induce vitellogenesis, regardless of sex or reproductive stage. The mucus and blood plasma of each injected fish was collected 7 to 11 days post-injection. Mucus and blood plasma samples of wild-caught and experimentally-injected fishes were separated using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with a phosphoprotein specific fluorescent dye (Pro-Q Diamond®), and visualized through ultraviolet transillumination. Vitellogenin was visibly detectable in the mucus collected from the control-injected fish, suggesting a disruption in the endocrine system as a result of estrogen exposure (estradiol- 17 β). However, there were no elevated levels of vitellogenin detected in any wild-caught fish mucus or blood plasma samples, indicating no vitellogenesis. From this, we infer that there has been no detectable endocrine disruption to the sampled coastal pelagic fish complex in the Gulf of Mexico two years after the start of the spill...|$|R
25|$|Many older {{publications}} {{list the}} species range {{as from the}} eastern Pacific, which now is known to represent the Pacific <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> and is considered a distinct species. There are also often mentions of the species erroneously having circumtropical and Indian Ocean distributions, with these records probably attributable to similar Indo-Pacific species, namely the blacktip trevally and giant trevally. The species distribution overlaps that of the similar longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> in the eastern Atlantic, with careful identification needed to distinguish the two. Within the Atlantic, confusion with both longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> and horse-eye jack, Caranx latus, have also led to erroneous records being made, with Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter suggesting this occurred in the Mediterranean, and the species may actually be absent from waters north of Mauritania.|$|E
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is {{a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with the greatest quantity of the species taken from the eastern Atlantic. In some fisheries, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species and therefore of great importance in these regions. In the Americas, the reported annual catch has ranged between 150 and 1300 tonnes since 1950, with catches since 2000 ranging between 190 and 380 tonnes. Most of the western Atlantic catch is from Florida, although Caribbean fisheries, such as Trinidad, take considerable quantities of the fish. The eastern Atlantic catch statistics do not differentiate longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> from <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> thus must be considered a composite dataset. This region only comprises catch data from Angola, Ghana, São Tome, and Principe. These catches are much larger than in the east, with hauls of between 1000 and 38 000 tonnes per year recorded since 1950, although catches since 2000 only range between 1900 and 10 200 tonnes. <b>Crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is taken by a number of fishing methods, including haul seines, gill nets, purse seines, trawls, handlines and trolling lines. The abundance of the species in Trinidad leads to the fish being taken in several quite different types of fishery; demersal trawls, artisanal gill nets and even beach seines, which illustrates the species' importance. In Trinidad, recreational fishermen also may sell their catch, which adds to the overall quantity of fish sold. <b>Crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|E
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> inhabits the {{tropical}} and temperate {{waters of the}} Atlantic Ocean, ranging extensively along both the eastern American coastline and the western African and European coastlines. In the western Atlantic, the southernmost record comes from Uruguay, with the species ranging north along the Central American coastline, and throughout the Caribbean {{and many of the}} numerous archipelagos within. The species is found throughout the Greater Antilles, however it is absent from the leeward Lesser Antilles, with its distribution being patchy throughout other Caribbean archipelagos. From the Gulf of Mexico, its distribution extends north along the U.S. coast and as far north as Nova Scotia in Canada, also taking in several northwest Atlantic islands. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is also known from Saint Helena Island in the southern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} large carangids in the Atlantic Ocean, with at least two systematic studies placing it within the top five most abundant species of that region, namely lagoons in Nigeria and Chiapas, Mexico. Seasonal movements are known from both the American and African coastlines, with both juveniles and adults appearing to migrate. In North America, young individuals recruited to northern estuaries are known to move to warmer tropical waters at the onset of winter to escape possible hypothermia. At least one hypothermia-driven mass mortality of 200 crevalle jacks has been reported from the Slocum River in Massachusetts, indicating low-temperature mortality is a major concern for north-ranging groups of the species, with temperatures below 9.0°C apparently being lethal to the fish. This applies not only to river dwelling fish, but also to marine migrants which linger too long in the temperate regions during winter. In Nigeria, and presumably other parts of Africa, the species appears to migrate seasonally, possibly to take advantage of prey, with the fish arriving in Nigeria during September to November. The species is more active during the day than the night, with larger catches in fisheries taken during the day, also. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is a schooling species for most of its life, forming moderately large to very large, fast-moving schools. At larger sizes, the fish become more solitary and move to the deeper offshore reefs. Evidence from laboratory studies indicates <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> are able to coordinate their feeding and spawning aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae and, to a lesser extent, corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Field studies have also shown the species increases in abundance with increased levels of DMSP over coral reefs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> reaches sexual {{maturity}} at different lengths in males and females, with estimates suggesting males reach maturity at 55cm and {{four to five}} years of age, and females at 66cm and five to six years of age. Reproduction is thought to occur year round in most areas, although there are peaks in activity. South of Florida, this period is between March and September, in Cuba it is April and May, while in Jamaica no definitive peak has yet been identified. The species also has a protracted spawning in Ghana, although a peak in activity occurs between October and January. Juveniles are also present in lagoons year round in this location, indicating year round spawning and recruitment. The place of spawning also appears to be variable, with the act occurring offshore south of Florida, while in Colombia and Belize, they have been observed spawning over inshore reefs and bays. Large aggregations of <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> form prior to spawning, with these schools containing upward of 1000 individuals. Pairs break off from the school to spawn, with one individual turning a much darker color during this exchange. Once spawning has occurred, the pair rejoins the main school. Fecundity in the species has been estimated as up to one million eggs, with these being pelagic, and spherical in shape. They have a diameter of 0.7 to 0.9mm, and contain a pigmented yolk and one yellow oil globule with dark pigments. The larvae have been extensively described in the scientific literature, although the sequence of fin formation is still not well known. Defining features of the larval <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> include a relatively deep body, heavily pigmented head and body, and more detailed meristic characteristics, with flexion occurring at 4 to 5mm in length.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} is a {{moderately}} large species, growing to a recorded maximum length of 69cm, and a weight of 6.8kg, but is commonly encountered at lengths {{of less than}} 40cm. The bar jack displays the typical body shape {{of most of the}} jacks, having an elongate, moderately deep and compressed form, with dorsal and ventral profiles of approximately equal ity. The dorsal fin is divided into two sections, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second has 1 spine followed by 26 to 30 soft rays. The anal fin is composed of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 23 to 26 soft rays, with both the anal and soft dorsal fin lobes being slightly elongated. The pectoral fins are falcate and longer than the head, consisting of 19 to 21 soft rays. The lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, and possesses 17 to 104 scales including 23 to 29 scutes posteriorly; also having bilateral paired caudal keels present. The chest is completely scaled, which easily distinguishes it from the similar <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> Caranx hippos. The snout is moderately pointed, with both the jaws containing narrow bands of villiform teeth, with the bands becoming wider anteriorly. The upper jaw also contains an outer row of enlarged recurved teeth. There are 10 to 14 upper limb gill rakers, and 31 to 38 on the lower limb and 24 vertebrae.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is {{classified}} [...] within the genus Caranx, {{one of a}} number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, a group of percoid fishes in the order Perciformes. The species belongs to what William Smith-Vaniz and Ken Carpenter refer to as the Caranx hippos complex, a group of closely related fishes which also includes Caranx caninus (Pacific <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack)</b> and Caranx fischeri (longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The giant {{trevally}} {{was first}} scientifically {{described by the}} Swedish naturalist Peter Forsskål in 1775 based on specimens taken from the Red Sea off both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, {{with one of these}} designated to be the holotype. He named the species Scomber ignobilis, with the specific epithet Latin for [...] "unknown", [...] "obscure" [...] or [...] "ignoble". It was assigned to the mackerel genus Scomber, where many carangids were placed before they were classified as a separate family. This later revision in classification saw the species moved to the genus Caranx, where it has remained. Even after its initial description, the giant trevally (and the bigeye trevally) were often confused with the Atlantic <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> Caranx hippos, due to their superficial similarity, which led to some authors claiming the <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> had a circumtropical distribution. After Forsskål's initial description and naming, the species was independently renamed three times as [...] Caranx lessonii, Caranx ekala and Carangus hippoides, all of which are now considered invalid junior synonyms. The latter of these names once again highlighted the similarity with the <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> with the epithet hippoides essentially meaning [...] "like Carangus hippos", which was the crevalle jack's Latin name at that time. Despite the resemblance with the <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> the two species have never been phylogenetically compared, either morphologically or genetically, to determine their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is {{a popular}} and highly {{regarded}} gamefish throughout its range, with the recreational catch of the species often exceeding commercial catches. The only amateur catch data available are from the US, which has an annual catch of around 400 to 1000 tonnes per year. In Trinidad, the species {{is the basis for}} several fishing tournaments. <b>Crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> are targeted from boats, as well as from piers and rockwalls by land based anglers. Fishermen often target regions where depth suddenly changes, such as channels, holes, reefs or ledges, with strong currents and eddies favourable. The fish take both live and cut baits, as well as a variety of artificial lures; however, when the fish are in feeding mode, they rarely refuse anything they are offered. Popular baits include both live fish, such as mullet and menhaden, as well as dead or strip baits consisting of fish, squid or prawns. <b>Crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> readily accept any style of lure, including hard-bodied spoons, jigs, plugs and poppers, as well as flies and soft rubber lures. There is some evidence based on long term observations that the species favours yellow [...] lures over all others. Tackle is often kept quite light, but heavy monofilament leaders are employed to prevent the fish's teeth from abrading the line. <b>Crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> are generally considered quite poor table fare, with selection of younger fish and bleeding upon capture giving the best results. The flesh is very red and dark due to the red muscle of the fish, which makes it somewhat coarse and poor tasting. When pulled from the water, this fish snorts in what many people describe as [...] "a pig-like" [...] fashion. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> has been implicated in several cases of ciguatera poisoning, although appears less likely to be a carrier than the horse-eye jack.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> Caranx hippos (also {{known as}} the common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, jack crevale and yellow cavalli) is a common species of large marine fish {{classified}} within the jack family, Carangidae. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is distributed across the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Nova Scotia, Canada to Uruguay in the west Atlantic and Portugal to Angola in the east Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is distinguishable from similar species by its deep body, fin colouration {{and a host of}} more detailed anatomical features, including fin ray and lateral line scale counts. It {{is one of the largest}} fish in the genus Caranx, growing to a maximum known length of 124cm and a weight of 32 kg, although is rare at lengths greater than 60cm. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> inhabits both inshore and offshore waters to depths of around 350 m, predominantly over reefs, bays, lagoons and occasionally estuaries. Young fish dispersed north by currents in the eastern Atlantic are known to migrate back to more tropical waters before the onset of winter; [...] however, if the fish fail to migrate, mass mortalities occur as the temperature falls below the species' tolerance limits.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{discussion in the}} scientific literature regarding the possible conspecifity of the Pacific <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack,</b> Caranx caninus, with Caranx hippos. Arguments ranged from the species being conspecific, subspecific or as individual species. This {{led to the creation}} of two trinomial names; Caranx hippos hippos and Caranx hippos tropicus. The former was an attempt to separate the 'subspecies' on each side of the Americas, while the latter was an unnecessary name to divide the Atlantic Caranx hippos into subspecies. The most recent review of the species complex by Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter treated the fish as separate species, citing differences in the development of hyperostosis and differing anal fin colours as evidence of species status. The species' most often used common name, <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> (or 'jack crevalle') is based on the word [...] "cavalla", an earlier word used for the jacks. Other names include common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, yellow cavalli and a host of generic names, such as horse mackerel and crevalle.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is a {{powerful}} predatory fish which predominantly takes other small fishes as prey at all stages of its life, with various invertebrates generally being of secondary importance to its diet. Several studies conducted on the species' diet over its range have found other aspects of its diet vary widely, including the specific types of prey the species takes and the change in diet with age. The most detailed of these studies was conducted in the Southern USA, which showed the species diet comprised between 74% and 94% [...] fish. The remainder of the diet was various prawns, shrimps, crabs, molluscs and stomatopods. The types of fish taken varied throughout the range, with members of Clupeidae, Sparidae, Carangidae and Trichiuridae all taken in variable amounts, usually with members of one family dominating the local diet. The percentage of various invertebrates also was highly variable, with penaeid shrimps, portunid crabs, stomatopods and squid being of importance to different populations. The study also indicated young <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> predominantly take clupeids, adding sparids and later carangids to their diets as they grow larger. The larger individuals also took much higher amounts of invertebrates, and also small quantities of seagrass, indicating larger fish are more opportunistic. This general change in diet with age also seems spatially variable, with young <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> in both Maryland and Puerto Rico consuming almost exclusively crustaceans, including shrimps, crabs (and juvenile tarpon) in Maryland and harpacticoid copepods in Puerto Rico before moving to fish-dominated diets later in life. Research in Ghana shows a pattern somewhat intermediate to the previous two locations; adults take larger fish, predominantly Engraulis guineensis and Sardinella eba, while juvenile fish take smaller fishes such as Epiplatys sexfasciatus or juvenile caridian and penaeid shrimps.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> was {{the first}} species of its genus to be scientifically {{described}} and named, and is also the type species of the genus Caranx. It was described and named in 1766 by the famed Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, based on the holotype specimen taken {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas, United States. He named the species Scomber hippos, placing it in the mackerel genus Scomber, a practice which was common prior to 1801 when the carangids were not yet recognised as separate from the scombrids. The specific epithet means [...] "horse" [...] in Latin, with Scomber hippos literally translating in English as [...] "horse mackerel", which has become a common name for many species of carangid. As the state of fish taxonomy progressed, the species was transferred to both Caranx and Carangus, with the name Caranx hippos now accepted. Bernard Germain de Lacépède {{was the first}} person to separate the <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> from the mackerels, placing it in its own genus Caranx, although he had redescribed the fish as Caranx carangua, which became the type species of Caranx. As well as Lacepede's renaming, the species has been independently redescribed a total of six times, with all of these names, including Lacepede's, categorised as invalid junior synonyms under ICZN rules.|$|E
2500|$|The widely {{variable}} diet of {{the species}} throughout its life stages led authors in the 1950s and 1960s to conclude the species was indiscriminate in its feeding habits, eating whatever was locally available. The diets of the populations in both the southern USA and Ghana also varied quite markedly by season and year, which led the authors of both these studies to agree with these earlier conclusions. Recent laboratory studies, however, [...] have shown the species may have preferences for certain sizes of prey. In these experiments, the fish were presented {{with a range of}} size classes of the same prey species, Menidia beryllina, with the results showing they prefer to take the smallest size class possible, which contrasts with more aggressive predators, such as bluefish. Both adults and juveniles feed throughout the day, generally becoming inactive at night. During some feeding periods recorded in Ghana, digestion in the species was so rapid that food becomes unidentifiable within four to five hours of consumption. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is also an important prey species itself, taken by larger fish, such as billfish and sharks, as well as seabirds. As well as being preyed on during its adult stage, the spawn of the <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is known to be eaten by planktivorous organisms, including whale sharks in the Caribbean.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} members of Caranx, growing to a known maximum length of 125cm and a weight of 32kg, {{although}} it is generally uncommon at lengths greater than 65cm. Unverified reports of fish over 150cm may also be attributable to this species. The <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> is morphologically similar to a number of other deep-bodied carangids, having an elongate, moderately compressed body with [...] the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The eye is covered by a well-developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under or past the posterior margin of the eye. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of eight spines and the second of one spine followed by 19 to 21 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine and 16 or 17 soft rays. The pelvic fins contain one spine and five soft rays, while the pectoral fins contain 20 or 21 soft rays. The caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section midway below the second dorsal fin. The straight section contains 23 to 35 very strong scutes, with bilateral keels present on the caudal peduncle. The chest is devoid of scales with the exception of a small patch of scales in front of the pelvic fins. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of teeth. The species has 35 to 42 gill rakers in total and 25 vertebrae are present.|$|E

The species distribution overlaps that of the similar longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> in the eastern Atlantic, with careful identification needed to distinguish the two. Within the Atlantic, confusion with both longfin <b>crevalle</b> <b>jack</b> and horse-eye jack, Caranx latus, have also led to erroneous records being made, with Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter suggesting this occurred in the Mediterranean, and the species may actually be absent from waters north of Mauritania.|$|E
