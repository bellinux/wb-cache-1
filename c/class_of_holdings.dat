40|$|Abstract: Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} there is a relationship between land distribution and productivity in agriculture. This paper estimates a cross-country agricultural production function that includes for the first time measures of land distribution as elements of productivity. The measures capture both the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> within a country, and the availability <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> across the agricultural population. The estimates suggest a very large and significant role for the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings.</b> This role, though, does not appear to arise because of the decreasing returns to farm size that are often identified in micro-level research. The results indicate that improvements in the distribution of agricultural land are a potential source of gains in agricultural productivity, and income per capita, across countries...|$|R
