"The general {{blurring}} {{and shifting}} of Fraunhofer's {{lines of the}} spectrum point, in my opinion, to a widespread cosmic change of a subtle and singular <b>character.</b> <b>Light</b> from a planet is the reflected light of the sun. Light from a star is a self-produced light. But the spectra both from planets and stars have, in this instance, all undergone the same change. Is it, then, a change in those planets and stars? To me such an idea is inconceivable. What common change could simultaneously come upon them all? Is it a change in our own atmosphere? It is possible, but in the highest degree improbable, since we see no signs of it around us, and chemical analysis has failed to reveal it. What, then, is the third possibility? That {{it may be a}} change in the conducting medium, in that infinitely fine ether which extends from star to star and pervades the whole universe. Deep in that ocean we are floating upon a slow current. Might that current not drift us into belts of ether which are novel and have properties of which we have never conceived? There is a change somewhere. This cosmic disturbance of the spectrum proves it. It may be a good change. It may be an evil one. It may be a neutral one. We do not know. Shallow observers may treat the matter as one which can be disregarded, but one who like myself is possessed of the deeper intelligence of the true philosopher will understand that the possibilities of the universe are incalculable and that the wisest man is he who holds himself ready for the unexpected. To take an obvious example, who would undertake to say that the mysterious and universal outbreak of illness, recorded in your columns this very morning as having broken out among the indigenous races of Sumatra, has no connection with some cosmic change to which they may respond more quickly than the more complex peoples of Europe? I throw out the idea for what it is worth. To assert it is, in the present stage, as unprofitable as to deny it, but it is an unimaginative numskull who is too dense to perceive that it is well within the bounds of scientific possibility.|$|E

5000|$|This {{system allows}} the player to {{interact}} with the Game Boy Advance's multiplayer link. The first option, Let's Amigo (レッツアミーゴ), allows players to exchange main characters to acquire new spells. For instance, exchanging between a wind elemental main character and a sound elemental one will allow the wind elemental character to learn a sound elemental spell, and vice versa. Magic learned in this way can be strengthened with experience like all other spells {{from the beginning of the}} game. Each player can also receive [...] "special" [...] spell data, which can be equipped to allied characters. However, equipped spells will not strengthen with experience. Exchanging a certain number of times will give the main character a new spell or change their element. Love magic is acquired if the player exchanges with 5 players of the same element. Exchanging 100 times will change the main character's element to the dark element and change their appearance to the dark costume. Learning all of the spells in the game and fulfilling the two prior requirements will give the main <b>character</b> <b>light</b> magic, change their element to the light element, and change them into the light costume.|$|E
5000|$|The {{premise of}} the She-Ra TV series was the reverse of the He-Man cartoon, where the heroes are {{actually}} rebels countering an evil establishment (rather than Skeletor trying to conquer Eternia). The Great Rebellion, hidden within the Whispering Woods, is led by Queen Angela and her daughter Glimmer, with the main cast of the Princess of Power cartoon also featuring Adora/She-Ra's steed Spirit/Swift Wind, the main male heroic character of the series, Bow, the timid owl-like Kowl, the inept magician Madame Razz and her wise-cracking sidekick, Broom. Also appearing in many episodes are the small imp-like forest-dwelling Twiggits (mainly Sprockett, Spritina, and Spragg) and the mystical <b>character</b> <b>Light</b> Hope, {{who served as a}} 'Sorceress of Grayskull-type' guide to She-Ra, residing high atop Mount Skydancer in the Crystal Castle. Throughout the series recurring characters and members/allies of the Rebellion included Adora's swashbuckling love interest Sea-Hawk, the flirtatious Frosta, magical Castaspella, butterfly-like Flutterina, the mermaid Mermista, peacock-like Peakablue, Perfuma, Netossa, Sweet Bee, Sorrowful the dragon, the elephant warrior Snout Spout, Loo-Kee, the [...] "hide-away elf of Whispering Woods," [...] and the comet warriors Granita, Rokkon and Stonedar. Some of the other popular one-off heroes and villains were Spinnerella, Huntara, General Sunder, False-Face, Colonel Blast, the Red Knight, King Micah, the Meteorbs and the Star Sisters. She-Ra: Princess of Power would air its final episode 'Swifty's Baby' on December 5, 1986; with no real conclusion or finale for neither the She-Ra nor He-Man Filmation series.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The TGA has refuted {{the value}} of CMS as an antiseptic, forbidding claims for {{efficacy}} other than 'sterilising water supplies'. Laboratory studies show this position is not {{in accord with the}} facts. Aims: To evaluate antibacterial properties of some CMS preparations available from local pharmacies, health food stores or via the Internet. Methods: Twelve commercial CMS formulations were analysed for total Ag content, pH, conductivity, colloidal <b>character</b> (<b>light</b> scattering by Ago nanoparticles) and content of non-colloidal silver (Ag+) ions. Antimicrobial activity was determined by growth inhibition against a panel of pathogenic bacteria and 3 fungi (Aspergillius niger, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cervissiae). Toxicity (LC 50) was assessed by the Artemia franciscanna (brine shrimp) nauplii bioassay. Results: The 12 CMS preparations tested ranged from 2. 5 - 14500 ppm; 10 (83 %) were found to be have inhibitory activity, albeit with varying specificity and efficacy. Argyrol and HLY displayed the broadest specificity, inhibiting the growth of all 14 bacteria tested (100 %). These 2 preparations also inhibited the growth of 3 (100 %) and 2 (67 %) of the fungal species tested respectively. Only low concentrations of CMS were required for antibiotic activity, with MIC values = 5 姯ml for some preparations against certain pathogens. Two commercial colloidal gold preparations were devoid of antimicrobial activity. All CMS preparations displayed low toxicity in the Artemia franciscanna nauplii bioassay, further confirming their value as antiseptics for medicinal use. Discussion: CMS preparations should still be seriously considered as alternative medicinals for topical treatments e. g. burns, periodontitis and thrush after applying strict Quality Controls for antimicrobial efficacy and incipient toxicity to animal cells. They may also have wider ramifications for treating chronic diseases post infection eg Proteus spp. and rheumatoid arthritis. [1]Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesFull Tex...|$|E
