50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the <b>clutch</b> <b>switch</b> located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|E

50|$|Diesel {{compression}} release brake controls consist of an on/off switch and, often, a multi-position switch {{that controls the}} number of cylinders on which the brake is active. Throttle and <b>clutch</b> <b>switches</b> are integral with the system. Activation occurs when both the clutch is released with transmission in gear and the throttle is released. It is the driver's job to ascertain the correct transmission gear to use depending on, for example, the steepness of the grade and whether the truck is loaded or empty.|$|R
40|$|The Transmission {{model and}} {{software}} package to investigate stress loading of a hydromechanical transmission of a dump truck have been developed. The given software package allows to model stress loading of transmission gears in taking-off and acceleration modes at various road resistance, positions of an engine control pedal and initial revolutions of an engine crankshaft, various laws of friction <b>clutch</b> <b>switching</b> {{and some other}} parameters that permit to reveal a rate of various operational mode influence on stress loading of a dump truck transmission. An equivalence of the developed software is proved by the comparison of the experimentally obtained stress loading process of the hydro-mechanical transmission of a BelAZ- 7555 dump truck {{with the results of}} the simulation Â </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{mechanism for}} magneto-rheological <b>clutches,</b> <b>switches</b> and devices {{is the ability}} of magnetic fields to induce relatively thick, linearly extended structures which span the relevant fluid medium. Recent observations have shown these to form via initial thin, linear, chain-like threads along the field lines, which then associate laterally via a diffusion-controlled process into the relatively thick columns which give rise to the enhanced rheology of the fluid. A theoretical analysis is given herein which accounts for these two types of associations. By considering the interaction energy between parallel aligned free chain segments, the theory reveals a tendency for the threads to associate at their overlapping ends, thereby forming thick columns. The weak overlapping thus accounts for the ability of the columns to disperse rapidly once the field has been removed. Tentative geometries for the initial morphology of these secondary column clusters are proposed. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} process of damping of non-linear vibrations in a three-mass model of a power transmission system with a multi-disc exible friction <b>clutch</b> <b>switched</b> on and o electroma-gnetically. Steady-state motion of the system is subject to harmonic exci-tation. The problem is considered on the assumption of a uniform unit pressure distribution between the contacting surfaces of the cooperating friction discs. Structural friction, small relative sliding of the clutch discs and linear viscotic damping have also been taken into account. In the case of sliding, the friction coecient is not constant but depends on the relative angular velocity of slowly sliding discs. The aim of the analysis is to assess the in uence of geometric parameters of the system, its exter-nal load, unit pressure, viscotic damping on resonance curves and phase shift angle of steady-state vibrations. The equations of motion of the examined system are solved by means of the slowly varying parameters (Van der Pol) method and digital simulation.

50|$|A Motorcycle {{handlebar}} is a {{tubular component}} of a motorcycle's steering mechanism. Handlebars provide a mounting place for controls such as brake, throttle, <b>clutch,</b> horn, light <b>switch</b> and rear view mirrors; and they may support part of the rider's weight.

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{technical}} {{change in the way}} oil pressure is regulated in the <b>clutch,</b> i.e. FWD <b>switching.</b> Oil pressure on the clutch plates is now regulated by a centrifugal valve integrated in the electric axial six piston oil pump. Compared to the previous generation, the Haldex 5 system is 1.4 kg lighter (ca. 6.6 kg without oil) and simpler as it does not contain an oil pressure accumulator.|$|R
50|$|When the {{electromagnetic}} clutch {{is used in}} automobiles, {{there may be a}} <b>clutch</b> release <b>switch</b> inside the gear lever. The driver operates the switch by holding the gear lever to change the gear, thus cutting off current to the electromagnet and disengaging the clutch. With this mechanism, {{there is no need to}} depress the clutch pedal. Alternatively, the switch may be replaced by a touch sensor or proximity sensor which senses the presence of the hand near the lever and cuts off the current. The advantages of using this type of clutch for automobiles are that complicated linkages are not required to actuate the clutch, and the driver needs to apply a considerably reduced force to operate the clutch. It is a type of semi-automatic transmission.|$|R

The double spherical joint is a six DOF joint that consists of six single DOF mechanical pairs in series with their axes intersecting at a point. The double spherical joint replaces two hip joints (six DOF) of humanoid robot, and even provides the equivalent function of waist joints without actually adding them. The backlash clutch is a new joint drive mechanism and {{to be used in}} this paper for knee joints of humanoid robots.

50|$|Unlike {{the motor}} driven, <b>clutch</b> {{controlled}} panel <b>switch</b> selectors, crossbar switches using the link principle required incoming and outgoing markers {{to find an}} idle path {{and set up the}} switch train for each call. Earlier crossbar exchanges had used the crossbar switch according to the selector principle, with one input and typically 100 or 200 outputs, similar to a stepping switch. 1XB pioneered the link principle, with each switch able to handle as many phone calls as it had inputs or outputs, typically ten. This innovation diminished the cost of switches, at the expense of more complex controls. The complexity of the circuitry challenged the art of circuit drawings, leading to the development of detached contact drawings, which in turn led to the application of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd {{generation}} of VFR400R was the VFR400R NC24, produced for the 1987 and 1988 model years, the first production Honda motorcycle to utilize an ELF-designed Pro-Arm single-sided swingarm (which later {{became one of}} the trademarks of the Honda VFR series). Discontinued with this model were the hydraulically actuated <b>clutch</b> which was <b>switched</b> back to a cable system, and the TRAC anti dive system on the front forks. Styling remained close to the NC21, with the NC24 keeping the single large headlight and the exhaust silencer on the right hand side. This model also had a 180Â° deg crank firing engine as with the nc21, but redline was raised to 14000 rpm. The NC24 was available in three colour schemes in 1987 (including an official Rothmans replica), and one in 1988. Note that the rear wheel on the NC24 was held onto the hub with 4 bolts (sometimes hidden with a plastic 'fake' single nut).|$|R

40|$|Variation {{in female}} {{preference}} functions, both genotypic and phenotypic, {{has been largely}} ignored in the literature, despite its implications {{to the maintenance of}} genetic variation in populations and the resolution of the "Lek paradox. " Polymorphic populations, such as in the side-blotched lizard, provide ideal study systems for its investigation, especially in the context of incipient processes of sympatric speciation. Females of the side blotch lizard exist in 2 genetically distinct morphs, yellow throated and orange throated, that experience disruptive selection for life history traits. Males express 3 throat color morphs, blue, orange, and yellow, that exhibit alternative strategies in intrasexual competition. We experimentally tested for female preference in triadic mate choice trials to identify the presence of discrete genetic and condition-dependent variation in female preference function. We found that females did in fact show genetic variation in preference for males but that females also operate a multicondition preference function dependent upon the genotype of the female and her state (number of clutches laid). Females exhibited positive assortative mating prior to the first clutch. However, prior to later <b>clutches,</b> orange females <b>switched</b> choice, preferring yellow males. These findings are discussed in relation to the maintenance of coadapted gene complexes within populations and the prevention of divergent directional selection (population bifurcation) by condition-dependent variation in mate choice.

40|$|In many {{bird species}} early breeders have higher {{reproductive}} performance than late breeders {{from the same}} population. This could {{be caused by a}} reduction in environmental factors related to date per se (Date Hypothesis), or because poorer performers nest later (Parent Quality Hypothesis). We manipulated hatch date of Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor by <b>switching</b> <b>clutches</b> with different lay dates, generating broods with advanced or delayed timing, and assessed the impact of the experiment on nestling mass. The Date Hypothesis better explained the decline in nestling mass {{in the first half of}} the season, while the Parent Quality Hypothesis was supported in the second half. We also found that female mass loss was unintentionally reduced in advanced females and suggest that such impacts of the experiment on parent quality, or correlations between nestlings and their actual parents via heritability or maternal effects, could bias hatch-date manipulation experiments towards supporting the Date Hypothesis. Differential costs of incubation, either due to naturally low temperatures early in the season, or due to the unintentional manipulation of female incubation costs, appear to have driven support for the Date Hypothesis early in the season. Seasonal declines in reproductive performance have been observed in a wide variety of avian taxa. These declines result from a reduction, over the course of the season, in fitness-related parameters such as nestling mass and growth (Hochachka 1990, Sedinger & Flint 1991), clutch size (Winkler & Allen 1996), nestling survival (Norris 1993, Wiggins et a...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the work of {{automotive}} transmission the analysis of transients during switching gear is performed. The proposed algorithm of control gear process in double-flow transmission {{takes into account the}} different ways of managing the motor effect {{since the beginning of the}} gear, the duration of direct switching on the efficiency of acceleration of the vehicle. Different programs gear change at different values of both clutches are studied. Energy cost at switching is carried out within the framework of realization of the given vehicle program. For a single energy criterion is taken overall fuel consumption for the program motion, part of which is the fuel consumption of the equivalent work of skidding of frictional elements of both <b>clutches</b> when you <b>switch</b> power flow without breaking. Arguments are adduced that the process of the gear must not be too fast. We emphasize that there is no contradiction between optimal gear change laws in terms of fuel efficiency and dynamism. On the basis of the developed mathematical model software that allows you to explore the quality of transients when switching gears on a uniform energy selection is developed. Examples of using different methods to control the engine and double-flow transmission are given. Generally according to absolute fuel consumption, preference should be given to enhanced governance. New data are given; on their basis key areas for improvement in the management switch are identified. ...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{are an important}} step toward reducing global petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Flywheel energy storage in a hybrid vehicle combines high energy density and high power density, yet requires a highly efficient continuously variable transmission with a wide operating range. This paper presents a novel solution to coupling a high-speed flywheel to the drive train of a vehicle, the switch-mode con-tinuously variable transmission (CVT). The switch-mode CVT, the mechanical analog of a boost converter from power electronics, utilizes a rapidly <b>switching</b> <b>clutch</b> to transmit energy from a flywheel to a spring, which applies a torque to the drive train. By varying the duty ratio of the clutch, the average output torque is controlled. This paper examines the feasibility of this concept by formulating a mathematical model of the switch-mode CVT, which is then placed in state-space form. The state-space formulation is leveraged to analyze the system stability and perform simple optimization of the switch time and damping rate of the spring over the first switching period. The results of this work are that a stable equilibrium does exist when {{the speed of the}} output shaft is zero, but the system will not reach and stay at a desired torque if this condition is not met, but requires continuous switching between the two states. An optimal switching time and damping ratio were found for the given parameters, where the lowest error occurred with low values of damping ratio. This work builds a foundation for future work in increasing the complexity of the model and the optimization method. DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4003373...|$|R
40|$|This thesis treats {{position}} control of an electropneumatic clutch actuator operated by simple on/off solenoid valves. This clutch actuator {{is intended for}} automatic manual transmission systems or clutch-by-wire systems in heavy duty trucks. Pressurized air is already present {{as a part of}} the brake system in such vehicles, and pneumatics is therefore the natural choice for actuating the manual transmission in these clutch actuator systems. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of the automobile industry. For the clutch actuator system this influence the choice of number of sensors present in the production system, limiting it to only a position sensor. It also lead to that a set of on/off solenoid valve is chosen for actuation over more commonly used proportional valves, even though it complicates the control task. Production quality sensors are considered in this thesis, and these are sensors which are more influenced by noise than sensors found in test rigs made for research and development. Motor vibration and possible other mechanical influence also have to be taken into consideration when testing in a full-scale truck as done in this thesis. Motivated by the choice of on/off solenoid valves as the control valves in the <b>clutch</b> actuator system, <b>switched</b> control design is considered. Switched controllers exploit the on/off solenoid valves discrete behavior, switching the valves between fully open and fully closed in a manner such that desired supply or exhaust of air from the actuator chamber is obtained, ensuring the demanded piston position. Based on this line of action, two switched controllers are developed along with a dual-mode switched controller utilizing the best features of the individual controllers. Stability analysis based on standard Lyapunov theory are provided, and the performance of the controllers are tested in a full-scale test truck at Kongsberg Automotive ASA. Both theoretical and practical performance analyses confirm that switch controllers are well suited for actuator piston {{position control}} of the clutch actuator system. Full-state feedback availability is assumed in the design of the switched controllers. Adaptive nonlinear observers are derived to provide estimates of unmeasured states and parameters for the clutch actuator system. These adaptive observers are deterministic with linear output-injection, and have adaptation laws for estimation of clutch load characteristics and friction. A full-order adaptive observer, including filtering of position for suppression of noise, shows best performance. The adaptation of unknown parameters accounts for wear of the clutch and variations in temperature, ensuring a robust design of the clutch actuator model and improving state estimates. Theoretical analyses of convergence are derived under persistence of excitation condition, and performance of the adaptive observers are validated by experimental data. The switched controller and the adaptive nonlinear are combined into an observerbased switched controller. Simulation of this is provided, comparing the results with actual truck measurements. These analysis indicate that the pressure sensor can be exchanged with an adaptive nonlinear observer without significant loss of performance for nonlinear state feedback based control designs for the system.
