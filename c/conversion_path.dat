50|$|A <b>conversion</b> <b>path</b> a {{description}} of the steps taken by a user of a website towards a desired end {{from the standpoint of the}} website operator or marketer. The typical <b>conversion</b> <b>path</b> begins with a user arriving at a landing page and proceeding through a series of page transitions until reaching a final state, either positive (e.g. purchase) or negative (e.g. abandoned session). In practice, the study of the dynamics of this process by the interested party has evolved into a sophisticated field, where various statistical methods are being applied to the optimization of outcomes. This includes real-time adjustment of presented content, in which a website operator tries to provide deliberate incentives to increase the odds of conversion based on various sources of information, including demographic traits, search history and browsing events. In practice this reflects in different content presented to users arriving from online advertising versus search engines, and similarly different content is presented to depending on their demographic segments.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marketing}} attribution is {{to quantify the}} influence each advertising impression has on a consumer’s decision to make a purchase decision, or convert. Visibility into what influences the audience, when and to what extent, allows marketers to optimize media spend for conversions and compare the value of different marketing channels, including paid and organic search, email, affiliate marketing, display ads, social media and more. Understanding the entire <b>conversion</b> <b>path</b> across the whole marketing mix diminishes the accuracy challenge of analyzing data from siloed channels. Typically, attribution data is used by marketers to plan future ad campaigns and inform the performance of previous campaigns by analyzing which media placements (ads) were the most cost-effective and influential as determined by metrics such as return on ad spend (ROAS) or cost per lead (CPL).|$|E
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone {{involves a}} multistep hydroxylation of 11 -deoxycorticosterone at the 11 - and 18 -positions, {{resulting in the}} formation of corticosterone and 18 -hydroxycorticosterone, the final precursor of aldosterone. Two members of the cytochrome P 450 11 B family, CYP 11 B 1 and CYP 11 B 2, are known to catalyze these 11 - and 18 -hydroxylations, however, only CYP 11 B 2 can oxidize 18 -hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone. It is unknown what sequence of hydroxylations leads to the formation of 18 -hydroxycorticosterone. In this study we have investigated which of the possible <b>conversion</b> <b>paths</b> towards formation of 18 -hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone are most likely from the ligand perspective. Therefore, we combined quantum mechanical investigations on the steroid conformations of 11 -deoxycorticosterone and its ensuing reaction intermediates with Fukui indices calculations to predict the reactivity of their carbon atoms for an attack by the iron-oxygen species. Both F(-) and F(0) were calculated to account for different mechanisms of substrate conversion. We show which particular initial conformations of 11 -deoxycorticosterone and which <b>conversion</b> <b>paths</b> are likely to result in the successful synthesis of aldosterone, and thereby may be representative for the mechanism of aldosterone biosynthesis by CYP 11 B 2. Moreover, we found that the most likely path for aldosterone synthesis coincides with the substrate conformation proposed in an earlier publication (Ref. (2)). To summarize, we show that on a theoretical and strictly ligand-directed basis {{only a limited number of}} reaction <b>paths</b> in the <b>conversion</b> of 11 -deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone is possible. Despite its theoretical nature, this knowledge may help to understand the catalytic function of CYP 11 B 1 and CYP 11 B 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} design-ing a universal file format converter. File format conver-sion is {{a necessary part of}} data dissemination and cura-tion. Complete and robust converters however are hard to find and build due to the abundance of file formats, the fact that many formats are closed, and the complexi-ties within individual format specifications. On the other hand many software applications exist that are capable of performing some degree of data conversion between a subset of the available formats. To take advantage of this we introduce a data structure called an I/O-Graph to store the available input and output formats of these applications. Based on a concept of imposed code reuse we use this to develop a service, NCSA Polyglot, which through this graph is capable of performing the larger union of conversions supported by the underlying soft-ware. The Polyglot system is designed to be easily exten-sible, scalable with the number of conversion requests, and inclusive of all available third party software. Given a data set of files from a particular domain, we are able to assign weights to the edges within the I/O-Graph indi-cating the amount of information retained during a con-version. These edge weights allow the system to then choose <b>conversion</b> <b>paths</b> with the least amount of infor-mation loss. 1...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{materials}} {{can be used}} as a valuable resource for reuse, recycling or energy recovery. In this paper a review on using waste as energy resource, done in the REMOWE project, included in the EU funded Baltic Sea Region Programme, is presented. Five main <b>conversion</b> <b>paths</b> have been identified; combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion and fermentation. Combustion and anaerobic digestion are mature and well-proven technologies for waste treatment but improvements are needed to make the processes more efficient as energy conversion processes. For anaerobic digestion feedstock pre-treatment, avoidance of inhibition, mixing, residues utilization, and monitoring and control are identified development areas. A more recent trend is development of dry digestion technology for the treatment of municipal waste. The possible improvements of the combustion process using waste as fuel includes plant efficiency, improved emission control and ash handling. Pyrolysis and gasification have been used for waste treatment but the technologies are still in the development stage. Identified development areas are process operation conditions, gas and by-product quality, gas cleaning and plant efficiency. Studies comparing waste to energy systems found do not give a clear picture of what waste to energy technology that is most favourable.

The pyrolysis and oxidation of two such unsaturated alcohols have been studied, i. e. 3 -methyl- 2 -butenol (prenol) and 3 -methyl- 3 -butenol (isoprenol). Experiments at three equivalence ratios, i. e. φ = 0. 5, φ = 1. 0 and φ = ∞ (pyrolysis), were performed using an isothermal jet-stirred quartz reactor at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1100 K, a pressure of 0. 107 MPa and a residence time of 2 s. The reactant and product concentrations were quantified using gas chromatography. A kinetic model has been developed using the automatic network generation tool “Genesys”. Several important rate coefficients are obtained from new quantum chemical calculations. Overall, {{there is a good}} agreement between model calculated mole fraction profiles and experimental data. Reaction path analysis reveals that isoprenol consumption is dominated by a unimolecular reaction to formaldehyde and isobutene. At the applied operating conditions, the equivalence ratio has no effect on the isoprenol conversion profile.

This paper {{presents the results}} of a study carried out to assess the potential adaptation of the Electra radio to a multi-channel transceiver. The basic concept is a Frequency Division multiplexing (FDM) communications scheme wherein different receiver architectures are examined. Options considered include: (1) multiple IF slices, A/D and FPGAs each programmed with an Electra baseband modem; (2) common IF but multiple A/Ds and FPGAs and (3) common IF, single A/D and single or multiple FPGAs programmed to accommodate the FDM signals. These options represent the usual tradeoff between analog and digital complexity. Given the space application, a common IF is preferable; however, multiple users present dynamic range challenges (e. g., near-far constraints) that would favor multiple IF slices (Option 1). Vice versa, with a common IF and multiple A/Ds (Option 2), individual AGC control of the A/Ds would be an important consideration. Option 3 would require a common AGC control strategy and would entail multiple digital down <b>conversion</b> <b>paths</b> within the FPGA.

The usage of marketing analytics and attribution however remains extremely low, which results in a marginalisation of the marketing industry. As businesses and organisations shift significant amounts of their marketing budget towards digital channel advertising, the necessity for marketing analytics and attribution is ever important. The marketing industry is currently using Last Click analysis to measure online channel performance which assigns the credit of a conversion and sale to the last marketing channel a customer has interacted with. Research shows Last Click analysis to be an insufficient method to measure campaign effectiveness and performance. Cooperative Game Theory attribution using Shapley Value is shown to be an optimum methodology and technique to employ in order to conduct attribution analysis.

40|$|Conversion {{reactions}} in lithium batteries have been proved for several classes of materials, such as oxides, fluorides, sulphides, nitrides, phosphides and recently for hydrides. Metal hydrides can be electrochemically {{reduced to a}} highly conductive composite material consisting of nanometric metallic particles dispersed in an amorphous LiH matrix. Magnesium hydride undergoes a reversible conversion reaction and it has very good theoretical performances, i. e. a theoretical specific capacity of 2038 mA h g - 1 and a working potential of 0. 5 V vs. Li +/Li. The purpose of our study is to investigate the MgH 2 redox activity by evaluating the effect of ball milling pre-treatments and by studying the conversion reaction mechanism. Three materials, prepared by submitting bulk MgH 2 to different ball milling procedures, are investigated. By coupling electrochemical tests, ex situ X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, we prove that the lithium incorporation does not follow a simple direct <b>conversion</b> <b>path</b> as it follows at least a sequence of four consecutive processes: (a) the hydride conversion reaction of MgH 2 to give Mg and LiH, (b) the alloying of Li in hcp Mg and (c and d) the formation and lithium enrichment of a bcc Li-Mg solid solution. Furthermore some experimental clues suggest that the mechanism is probably even more complex as it can imply the formation of other unknown intermediate Li-Mg-H phases. Moreover large morphological changes occur upon lithium incorporation in the electrodes: in particular an extended sintering of the metal nanoparticles occurs upon cycling. This effect leads to electrode pulverization and capacity fading.

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cell {{exhibits}} its advantages such as fuel variability. Capable of running on renewable fuels, SOFCs {{are regarded as}} potential solution to carbon-neutral energy <b>conversion</b> <b>path.</b> SOFCs operate on fuel supplied to the anode and oxidant supplied to the cathode. The anode should facilitate the oxidation of fuel and transport of electrons from the reaction site to the current collector. It should also enable the diffusion of gaseous fuel to the reaction sites and reaction products away from the reaction sites. Meeting abovementioned requirements, Ni/YSZ cermets are competent SOFC anodes, where Ni is an electronic conductor, YSZ is an ionic conductor, and pores in between Ni and YSZ facilitate the fuel supply. Fuel oxidation occurs {{in the vicinity of}} triple phase boundaries (TPBs), where Ni particles, YSZ particles and pore interact. Thus, TPB length quantifies the electrochemically active sites within the anode. The fuel oxidation involves physical processes and multi-elementary reaction steps in reality, among which exists a rate-limiting step. The overall reaction rate can be represented by the rate-limiting step whose kinetics are proposed {{as a function of the}} TPB length. In many past computational studies of the cermet anode, a global electrochemical reaction expressed by Butler-Volmer equation is put forward, simplifying electrode reaction to a single step process and probably inadequately to present insights into intrinsic processes occurring within the anode. In this work, TPB-based kinetics, derived from the pattern anode experiment, are implemented in a CFD model to evaluate the performance of Ni/YSZ cermet-based cells. For model validation, simulated polarization curves are compared with the experimental ones. TPB length as a fitting parameter is determined to ensure the agreement between simulated polarization curves and experimental ones. The fitted TPB length is found to be several orders of magnitudes lower than physical TPB length of typical Ni-YSZ cermet anode, which might imply that only a small fraction of the physical TPB length actually participates in the electrochemical reactions. CFD behavior like species distribution and electrochemical behavior like overpotential breakdown are investigated. The gradient of species molar fraction in anode turns to be larger than that in fuel channel, agreeing with the fact that fluid flow is much slower in anode where species transport in porous electrode is dominated by diffusion rather than convection. The cathode activation overpotential makes the most significant contribution to the overall overpotential. The anode activation overpotential at high current density region in the case of low molar fraction of inlet hydrogen yields rapid increase, which could be explained as a consequence of rapid decrease of exchange current density in the vicinity of anode/electrolyte interface. Parametric study of operating temperature is conducted later to see its effect on the cell performance. The higher the operating temperature is, the slower drop of cell voltage with respect to cell current is observed. At a fixed cell voltage, an elevated temperature will cause intensified fuel consumption/vapor generation within anode, leading to a larger gradient of species molar fraction and accordingly a larger concentration overpotential...|$|E

40|$|The current {{commercial}} {{supply of}} renewable energy from biomass and the legislative focus on cutting-edge cogeneration is predominantly based on the renewable resource wood. This is generating an exponentially increasing demand for wood as reserves are steadily being reduced by competition for material. Wood prices are therefore rising and the cost effectiveness of existing methods of use is diminishing. By 2030, Europe will face a deficit between supply and demand of 150 million tons of wood. This makes the development of unutilized biowaste with great potential for energy recovery imperative and particularly pertains to agricultural waste, which is largely precluded from direct use as material. Germany alone has a theoretically available supply of 20 million tons of culmiferous waste per year. Other agricultural waste includes rice husks (China alone produces 197 million tons of rice annually, olive pits and citrus fruit waste (from Italy and Spain), and sugar cane (Brazil produces 514 million tons annually). The objectives of the project are to ascertain both the hyperstoichiometric and hypostoichiometric thermochemical conversion characteristics of representative agricultural fuels with high relevance for Central European agriculture sector separately and in blends using laboratory and pilot-scale fluidized bed combustors, to identify the options for conditioning process products, and to assess the potential for optimization. Furthermore, potential uses of process products as material will be identified {{for the purpose of}} creating closed material cycles and measures will be taken to influence the quality of the process products positively.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for construct-ing Σ ∆ learning algorithms and hardware that can identify and track low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional analog signal space. At {{the core of the}} proposed approach is a min-max stochastic optimization of a regularized cost function that combines machine learning with Σ ∆ modulation. As a result, the algorithm not only produces a quantized sequence of the transformed analog signals but also a quantized representation of the transform itself. The framework is generic and can be extended to higher-order Σ ∆ modulators and for different signal transformations. In this paper, the Σ ∆ learning is demonstrated for identifying linear compression manifolds which can elimi-nate redundant analog-to-digital <b>conversion</b> (ADC) <b>paths.</b> This improves the energy efficiency of the proposed architecture com-pared to a conventional multi-channel data acquisition system. Measured results from a four channel prototype fabricated in a 0. 5 µm CMOS process has been used to verify the energy efficiency of the Σ ∆ learner and to demonstrate its real-time adaptation capabilities that are consistent with the theoretical and simulated results. One of the salient features of Σ ∆ learning is its self-calibration property whereby the performance remains unchanged even in the presence of computational artifacts (mis-match and non-linearities). This property makes the proposed architecture ideal for implementing practical high-dimensional analog-to-digital converters.

40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) Adult {{religious}} conversion is an atypical {{religious experience}} with multiple {{social and psychological}} meanings for the convert. Four adult religious converts were interviewed to explore and describe their perspectives of their interpersonal relationships during the conversion process. These transcribed interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis within a case study design from a Critical Realist paradigm. The converts viewed <b>conversion</b> as a <b>path</b> to a preferred way of life with nine themes identified (romance with the religiously wayward, esteem for a religious sage, acceptance, gaining a new religious family, new religion aids relationships, life transitions, commonality maintains alt-religious relationships, diverse family dynamics, and altreligious relationships ending). Further interpretation integrated these themes within three relational processes that engage religious conversion through disrupting the convert’s religious status quo, maintaining relational stability conducive to conversion, and attracting the convert toward the new religion. These relational dynamic processes explore the texture and express the subtleties of relationships during the religious conversion process...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{localized}} D region disturbances, such {{as those}} associated with lightning discharges, affect the characteristics of VLF waves propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. In particular, both phase and amplitude changes in the subionospheric signal can be observed at receiving sites {{as a result of}} the wave scattering that takes place in the disturbed region. In the present paper we present a multiple-mode three-dimensional model of VLF propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide in the presence of localized D region disturbances. The model takes into account great circle (GC) propagation paths with realistic ground and ionospheric conductivity changes that result in mode <b>conversion</b> along the <b>path.</b> It is assumed that conductivity changes transverse to the GC paths are negligible except in the vicinity of the D region disturbance and that mode coupling is negligible within the disturbed region. This new model is applied to experimental observations and is found to be in general agreement. The diagnostics potential of the model for characterizing energetic particle precipitation events is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, we {{have used}} {{exclusively}} the FM band as this band is slowly gaining its popularity due to the liberalization policy of Govt. of India for its implementation. So, it is absolutely essential to find best fit propagation model. In the present work, {{we have used}} the field strength measurements of two FM broadcasting stations, each operating on different transmitted power and at different transmitting antenna heights. These field strength measurements (readings) on <b>conversion</b> into <b>path</b> loss and thereafter further {{be compared with the}} various available path loss models. An appropriate modification has been suggested and applied after calculating the mean square error (MSE) between the measured path loss and calculated path loss with the help of available models. For practical implementation, all the measurements have been taken in Punjab state of India (border district of Gurdaspur). It is further emphasized that all the measurements have been taken in an open area, so suggested model in this paper would be the best fit for open area conditions in the north bordering area of Punjab. All the measurements (readings) have been taken using the Anritsu site master by carrying it using car and with the available Anritsu dipole antenna. Using the corrected (modified) formula {{we have been able to}} reduce the Mean Square Error (MSE) value to one fourth value. For 100 W FM broadcasting station the value of MSE is coming exactly within the 6 dB limit, which is the necessary and appropriate condition for the good propagation model and for 10 KW FM stations is nearly coming closer to the 6 dB, which is the limit of a good propagation model...|$|R
