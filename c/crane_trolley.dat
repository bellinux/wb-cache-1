40|$|The various {{embodiments}} of {{the present}} disclosure relate generally to crane control systems. An exemplary embodiment {{of the present}} invention provides a crane control system comprising a real-time position-location module, an on-off controller module, and an input-shaper module. The real-time position-location module generates a position signal indicative of the distance between <b>crane</b> <b>trolley</b> and a desired location of safety. The on-off controller module maps the position signal to a velocity command signal, wherein the velocity command signal comprises instructions for the <b>crane</b> <b>trolley</b> to move in a vector relative to the desired location {{in at least a}} first velocity only if the distance between the <b>crane</b> <b>trolley</b> and the desired location is greater than a cut-off threshold 150.

50|$|Large camera cranes {{are almost}} {{indistinguishable from the}} usual boom-type cranes, with the {{exception}} of special equipment for smoothly moving the boom and controlling noise. Small camera cranes and crane-trucks have a lightweight construction, often without a mechanical drive. The valves are controlled manually by balancing the load-specific counterweight, facilitating manipulation. To improve usability and repeatability of movement of the crane in different takes, the axis of rotation arrows are provided with limbs and a pointer. In some cases, the camera crane is mounted on a dolly for even greater camera mobility. Such devices are called <b>crane</b> <b>trolleys.</b> In modern films robotic cranes allow use of multiple actuators for high-accuracy repeated movement of the camera in trick photography. These devices are called tap-robots; some sources use the term motion control.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of cargo handling with cranes {{it is necessary to}} control the <b>crane</b> <b>trolley</b> position so that the swing of the hanging load is minimized. In this paper we consider a linear parameter-varying model of the crane, where the time-varying parameter is the length of the suspending rope. We consider the set of models given by frozen values of the rope length and show how all these models can be reduced to a single time-invariant model using a suitable time scaling. The time scaling relation can be used to derive a control law for the time-varying system that implements an implicit gain scheduling. Using a Lyapunov-like theorem, it is also possible to find relative upper bounds for the rate of change of the varying parameter that ensure the stability of the time-varying system.

40|$|The Tower is an {{official}} {{publication of the}} Georgia Tech Board of Student Publications and {{is sponsored by the}} Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program and the Price Gilbert Memorial Library System. This article is from Volume 1, Issue 2. Digital notch filtering, lowpass filtering, and input shaping are three well-known methods for shaping reference commands to reduce vibration in flexible systems. Both filters and input shapers are used to modify signal commands {{in such a way as}} to minimize vibration. In unshaped signal generation of tower cranes, the load on the crane will always have residual oscillation or swaying due to the crane’s motion. Filters and input shapers minimize this motion by shaping the original command through a series of impulses designed to be out of phase with the unshaped oscillation thus canceling the vibration. Since the introduction of robust input shaping (Singer, 1990) substantial evidence has led to the assessment that input shaping is superior to both notch and lowpass filtering for suppressing vibration in mechanical systems (Singer 1999). This project examines the validation of theoretical developments in the comparison between notch filtering, lowpass filtering, and input shaping utilizing portable bridge and tower cranes. Also, work was previously done with the WinCC software, provided by Siemens, in order to create a user interface in which the position of the tower <b>crane</b> <b>trolley</b> and payload are displayed on the WinCC along with the available workspace and a set of controls for actuating the crane.

40|$|Despite {{the trend}} of {{increasing}} automation degree in control systems, human operators are still needed in applications such as aviation and surgery, or machines used in remote mining, forestry, construction, and agriculture, {{just to name a}} few. Although there are research results showing that the performance between the operators of working machines differ significantly, there are currently no means to improve the performance of the human-machine system automatically based on the skill and working differences of the operators. Traditionally the human-machine systems are designed so that the machine is "constant" for every operator. On the contrary, the Human Adaptive Mechatronics (HAM) approach focuses on individual design, taking into account the skill differences and preferences of the operators. This thesis proposes a new type of a HAM system for mobile working machines called Human Adaptive Mechatronics and Coaching (HAMC) system that is designed to account for the challenges regarding to the measurement capability and the work complexity in the real-life machines. Moreover, the related subproblems including intent recognition, skill evaluation, human operator modeling, intelligent coaching and skill adaptivity are described. The intent recognition is solved using a Hidden Markov model (HMM) based work cycle modeling method, which is a basis for the skill evaluation. The methods are implemented in three industrial applications. The human operator modeling problem is studied from the structural models' perspective. The structural models can be used to describe a continuum of human operator models with respect to the operating points of the controlled machine. Several extensions and new approaches which enable more efficient parameter estimation using the experimental data are described for the conventional Modified Optimal Control Model (MOCM) of human operator. The human operator modeling methods are implemented to model a human operator controlling a <b>trolley</b> <b>crane</b> simulator. Finally, the concept of human adaptive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is described.
