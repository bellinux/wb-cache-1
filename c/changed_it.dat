Nevertheless, the county borders set then were quite different from those present during the interbellum, as only 39 counties were formed from the 56 remaining after the war.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided {{to make it an}} outright drama. The storyline eventually became too serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he wrote it in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E

5|$|Balachander {{approached}} his favourite screenwriter Ganesh Patro {{to write the}} dialogues; Patro was credited for giving a native appeal to Balachander's successful Telugu films. Despite finding the concept obsolete, Patro silently completed the bound script in two months. According to Patro, Balachander tweaked the film's script many times during the shoot. They planned to name the film Bilahari after the Carnatic raga of the same name, but <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> to Rudraveena to reflect the characters' anger, equating it {{to that of the}} Hindu god Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Bonstelle {{was born}} to Helen and Joseph Bonesteel on her father's farm {{near the town of}} Greece, New York, the {{youngest}} of their eight children. Her exact date of birth is unknown, and she kept it a secret, but it was sometime in November 1869 – 1871. Originally named Bonesteel, later in life she <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> to Bonstelle after, according to legend, seeing it misspelled like that on a theater marquee.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, {{but when the}} script {{was about to be}} filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist {{at the end of the}} script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E

5|$|Paleoclimatology, {{although}} sometimes {{treated as}} part of paleoecology, focuses more {{on the history of}} Earth's climate and the mechanisms that have <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments, for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the greenhouse effect and thus helping to cause an ice age in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{bought the}} Georgian five-bay villa (built around 1830) for £48,000 at auction in 1968, {{along with its}} eight acres of land, and lived there until 1976. The house had been {{registered}} as a Grade II listed building in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir, previously known as Gladsmuir House. Jane Howard restored an earlier name, Lemmons; the next owners <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> back to Gladsmuir.|$|E

The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{communist}} groups existed in Sarawak, {{the first of}} which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951. Another group, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970. Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok {{were two of the}} more notable communist leaders involved in the insurgency. As the political scene <b>changed,</b> <b>it</b> grew progressively more difficult for the communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, pushed for a continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak government.|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{division}} {{between east and}} west Wessex continued to be important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood Forest on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and Winchester in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> from royal demesne, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> to Me and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E

5|$|Anna Louise Mohan {{was born}} in 1885 in San Francisco, California. Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in Pennsylvania, became a {{journalist}} and stump speaker involved in labor issues and Democratic Party politics. Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, {{who grew up on}} the ranch of her stepfather, James Say, near Humboldt Lake in Nevada. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise. Later in 1885, the family moved to Reno, where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the Southern Pacific railway. The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896). Although the family lived in Wadsworth, Nevada, Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12. Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name, but never <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> legally from Mohan.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the mountain was the highest point in the region, the succession of the authorities that held control over it took an interest in its name and <b>changed</b> <b>it</b> periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of Austria-Hungary, the highest peak of the Carpathians received its first government-sponsored name − after the contemporary head of state Emperor Francis Joseph I. Guidebooks sometimes did not catch up on these name changes. After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, the mountain continued to be known simply as Gerlachovský štít because it belonged to the village of Gerlachov. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the High Tatras for Poland, simultaneously called the mountain Szczyt Polski (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it. The new Czechoslovak government changed the name to Štít legionárov (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the Czechoslovak Legions in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier Gerlachovský štít in 1932. As a result of the Communist coup d'état in 1948, the mountain was renamed once more − to Stalinov štít (Stalin Peak) in 1949. Its traditional name Gerlachovský štít was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.|$|E
