With regard to organizational matters commercialization may take place by setting up a firm with the objective of commercially exploiting a patented invention, briefly expressed by the term spin-off. Despite these differences the two concepts are linked to each other, since academic engagement precedes commercialization in many cases. For instance, working on common projects may give academic staff an idea for commercially valuable projects and may therefore be a starting point for a spin-off (Perkmann et al. 2013).|$|R

50|$|Cover is a {{term used}} in the law of {{contracts}} to describe a remedy available to a buyer who has received an anticipatory repudiation of a <b>contract</b> for the <b>receipt</b> of goods. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the buyer is permitted (but not required) to find another source of {{the same type of}} goods. The buyer may then file a lawsuit against the breaching seller to recover the difference, if any, between the cost of the goods offered and the cost of the goods actually purchased.|$|R
25|$|The Code only allows claims {{substantiated}} by documents, or in {{some cases}} the oath of witnesses. Saving <b>contracts</b> and <b>receipts</b> thus assumed a vital importance in Babylon - in fact it could literally be a matter of life or death. A buyer had to be sure of the seller's title. If he bought (or received on deposit) property from even a minor or a slave without witnessing contracts, he would be executed as a thief (§7). If purchased goods were stolen and the rightful owner reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and the deed of sale, or witnesses to it; otherwise, he would be adjudged a thief and die. If he proved his purchase, he had to give up the property but could pursue a remedy against the seller or, if the seller had died, could reclaim fivefold from his estate.|$|R

30|$|This dataset is {{compiled}} {{annually from}} 2005 to 2013. It consists of 4  % {{of the population}} registered with the Social Security (SS) system either as workers, unemployed receiving benefits, or pensioners for at least 1  day of the current year of the sample (over a million work histories). The complete labor market history is reported for all individuals. This database provides highly detailed information about their past and present labor activities, including monthly wages, type of <b>contract,</b> <b>receipt</b> of unemployment insurance benefits, reasons for job termination, and several characteristics of hiring firms such as size, age, ownership, location, and sector of activity. Individual characteristics such as age, gender, residence, and nationality and household characteristics such as gender and date of birth of household members are also provided in the database—they are obtained from census records. Every individual in the sample is followed if they maintain any relationship (working, being unemployed receiving benefits or as pensioners) with Social Security records. There are several characteristics that make the CSWH an appropriate database for this aim. Firstly, it is an administrative dataset that provides highly accurate information on employment for {{a random sample of}} 4  % of all Social Security records. The data can be combined with census information on each year so {{that it is possible to}} obtain information about family members. Secondly, it is longitudinal so it is possible to obtain information on the worker’s entire labor market history. Furthermore, it assigns an employer identification code that enables firms, sectors, numbers of workers, and locations to be identified. Type of contract, entry and leaving date, and hours worked are also known. We pool all the information registered in CSWH from 2005 to 2013. Hence, any individual who is included in this dataset for at least 1  day from 2005 to 2013 appears in our sample. The fact that this dataset is compiled only from 2005 onwards disregards it to evaluate the immediate impact of the law, which is the aim of the first part of the paper. The sample of parents that can be observed reducing working hours due to childcare issues in the years previous to the passing of the law is very small and not representative, given that workers are restricted to have any contact with Social Security in 2005.|$|R

Company investment procedures are -frequently analyzed {{to ensure that}} there is no better way to meet established goals (Dean, 1954; Wellington, 1963). These goals are usually to maximize the return on asset investment or achieve a desired growth rate in earnings per share. Much has been written about these processes, but the analysis usually begins at the point where all pertinent information regarding the proposal has been gathered (Petty, 1975). This thesis investigates how this information is gathered. The research method was field research of three local organizations. This thesis has four major conclusions. First, that vendor information is extensively used {{and in the case of}} the Corporate Farm, heavily relied on for cost data. Second, that historical information in the form of past <b>contracts,</b> sales <b>receipts</b> and rental agreements, are at a minimum used as a point of reference for cost data estimation in all cases.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{evaluate}} the effect of a Swedish educational programme encouraging the use of bicycle helmets. Another to important aim was to use a theoretical model to explain which factors contribute to the prediction of cyclists' intention to use a helmet. A non-representative sample consisting of employees working for the same insurance company located at three different locations in Sweden was selected. Two served as an experiment group and the third as a control or comparison group. Measurements were taken before and after the campaign. The educational campaign was held by the Swedish Falck Ambulans. The session lasted for one hour. The emphasis of the campaign was to focus on accidents and injuries to the brain when not wearing a helmet. The participants were also given an opportunity to sign a bicycle helmet <b>contract</b> on <b>receipt</b> of which they received a helmet free of charge. Data were collected using a web-based self-report survey. The results revealed that the proportion of people who used a helmet when biking to work had increased substantially amongst those having taken part in the session. It also showed that after the campaign the intention to use the helmet was greater amongst the experiment group than amongst the control group. The results showed that the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was effective in the predicting of the intention to wear a helmet. The strongest predictor was perceived behavioural control followed by subjective norm. The weakest TPB predictor was the attitude. The prediction of helmet wearing intention was significantly improved when anticipated regret and past behaviour were added to the model. The results from the Transtheoretical model showed that participants in the experimental group had on average moved one step closer to a change. In sum, it could be concluded that an educational campaign, which also includes elements of endorsement (i. e. to be given a bicycle helmet when signing a contract to use the same), significantly increases the likelihood of using a bicycle helmet...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2009, the Serious Fraud Office {{announced}} that it intended to prosecute BAE Systems for offences relating to overseas corruption. The Guardian claimed that a penalty [...] "possibly of more than £500m" [...] might be an acceptable settlement package. On 5 February 2010, BAE Systems agreed to pay £257m criminal fines to the US and £30m to the UK. The UK had already massively benefited from £43 billion <b>contract</b> in tax <b>receipts</b> and jobs in the UK, and dropped an anti-corruption investigation into the Al Yamamah contracts later taken up by US authorities. Crucially, under a plea bargain with the US Department of Justice, BAE Systems was convicted of felony conspiracy to defraud the United States government and sentenced in March 2010 by US District Court Judge John D. Bates to pay a $400 million fine, {{one of the largest}} fines {{in the history of the}} DOJ. Judge Bates said the company's conduct involved [...] "deception, duplicity and knowing violations of law, I think it's fair to say, on an enormous scale". BAE Systems did not directly admit to bribery, and is thus not internationally blacklisted from future contracts. Some of the £30m penalty the company will pay in fines to the UK will be paid ex gratia for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. On 2 March 2010 Campaign Against Arms Trade and The Corner House were successful in gaining a High Court injunction on the Serious Fraud Office's settlement with BAE Systems.

N. economic sanctions since the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The Oil-For-Food program was divided into six-month phases and required renewal by the Security Council at each phase. The first phase lasted from December 1996 to June 1997, and the program continued for a total of 13 phases, with the final phase extending until the U. S. -led invasion in 2003. During each phase, Iraq was permitted to sell an approved amount of oil to international buyers. Income from the program was held by the United Nations in escrow accounts that were used to purchase food, medical supplies and other humanitarian materials. The Iraq Survey Group, a CIA-organized investigative body tasked with cataloging the extent of Iraq’s illicit weapons program after the inva-sion, estimated that the Oil-For-Food program generated $ 64 billion in revenues over its lifetime (Duelfer, 2004). After the invasion of Iraq, considerable evidence emerged suggesting that Saddam Hussein was able to subvert the Oil-For-Food program to obtain hard currency as well as items on the United Nation’s prohibited transfer list.

It also contains other Cypres family correspondence; vital and travel documents; <b>contracts</b> and <b>receipts</b> concerning {{the family home}} in Cracow; and archival and genealogical research about the family. The correspondence consists of original documents, {{but some of the}} research is photocopied. In 1889, Emil Elias married Pepi Cypres (daughter of Peretz Cypres) in Cracow (today Poland); soon thereafter they left for America, settling in New York City. Emil Elias traveled extensively throughout the Middle East selling religious items. When Pepi became pregnant in 1891, she returned alone to Cracow to have her baby in the parental home. In December 1892, Pepi returned to New York, accompanied by her one-year-old daughter Minna (Minde), her younger brother Michael, her younger sister Malcia, and a twelve-year-old girl from the Elias family. Pepi's sisters Auguste Landau, Adele Spira, Amalia Burstenbinder, and Helen Storch as well as their brother Bernhard remained in Europe. Bernhard Cypres was a jewelry and diamond dealer as was his son, who married into a wealthy Belgian family. Auguste (Gusti) Landau lived in Berlin and supported herself and her two children as a seamstress. During World War One she established a company, supplying the Prussian Army. Soon after the war, her daughter married a Polish lawyer and they had two children; her son remained in Berlin, working as an orthopedist for the well-known shoe house Leyser. After World War I Emil established a coal and seltzer business in New York, before moving the family to a farm in Colchester, CT under a program set up by Baron de Hirsch. There, he made kosher wine, and Minna met her future husband, Phillip Feiden. Eventually, the family returned to New York, settling in the Bronx and working in real estate. Emil and Pepi had two more children, Nathaniel and Percy, and in 1918 Minna married Phillip Feiden. They had two sons, Barry and Elliott. In the 1930 's, Minna Feiden founded and operated a chain of lending libraries located in small towns in the Hudson Valley. Nathaniel Elias, after graduating from Columbia University with a degree in chemical engineering, worked for Thomas Edison in his Edison, New Jersey laboratory; he later established his own chemical engineering laboratory in New York City. Percy Elias graduated from Columbia with a degree in journalism; he established the New York publishing house "Emerson Books" and ran it until his death in the 1960 's. Most of the family members who had stayed in Europe did not survive the Holocaust.

If you are the author please contact PEARL Admin (pearladmin@plymouth. ac. uk) to discuss options. This Thesis will consider {{the development of the}} traditional bill of lading from its origins, which appear to be much older than previously considered, up to the present day. The development of the bill of lading will be examined in order to answer basic questions: what is a traditional bill of lading, and what functions does it perform. In Part I of the Thesis the development of the three main functions of the traditional bill will be considered, namely <b>receipt,</b> <b>contract,</b> document of title. It will conclude with observations {{on the nature of the}} traditional bill of lading and how it differs from the early form of the bill of lading. Part II of the Thesis will then consider the development and nature of related shipping documents (charterparty bills, received for shipment bills, non-transferable bills), how far these documents perform the functions of the traditional bill of lading, and whether they can be truly described as bills of lading. Part II will then go on to consider the development and nature of electronic bills of lading and assess how well such bills perform the functions of the traditional bill of lading. The Thesis will conclude that although most of the functions of the traditional bill are in effect performed by electronic bills, electronic bills are in fact a new type of bill of lading and not merely a traditional bill in an electronic format. Conclusions will then be drawn as to what effect the development of new types of bill of lading will have on the future of the traditional bill of lading in the maritime industry...|$|R
40|$|First, we {{consider}} it helpful {{to give a}} short introduction into the topic of communication and share some reflections why this aspect is important to look at {{in the frame of}} the HealthyGrowth project. The general question is why communication is necessary and what the purpose of communication is. One aspect commonly mentioned concerns information as a means of marketing. As Karstberg (2015) notes: “Research shows that a significant barrier to consumers purchasing more organic foods is lack of information. This leads the relevant body of research to call for better communication around organic foods. ” Zanoli and Naspetti (2002 : 652) expressed the need “to devise a better communication strategy” with a view to “informing consumers about the extra quality inherent in organic food” (Duffy et al. 2005 : 374). And Aertsens et al. (2011) add that consequently, “consumers’ lack of knowledge concerning organic food is an important factor slowing down growth”. So communication is of utmost importance when it comes to aspects of growth of the organic sector. However, ultimately communication is the basis of every human interaction. It is the process by which we create sense and meaning and built up relationships with each other. Communication is thus to be understood in its broadest sense, so that actually everything that carries meaning or conveys a message is to be understood as communication. It therefore comprises all forms of audio-visual interactions between people (face-to-face conversations, phone calls, skype/web-meetings etc.) as well as artefacts like <b>receipts,</b> <b>contracts,</b> e-mails, all forms of publication materials (e. g. brochures, leaflets, flyers, radio or TV commercials, video clips, newspaper ads etc.) and – not to forget – of course also the (organic) products themselves. This said the next point in question is what the purpose of communication is specifically within values based organic food chains. Regarding the overall objective the HealthyGrowth project, we are primarily interested to investigate the role of communication for maintaining trust and integrity during growth processes. In this respect, communication becomes particularly important for collectively developing desired qualities, discussing which values to communicate, establishing fairness,loyalty, identification and trust or simply negotiating volumes and prizes. Moreover, it plays also a crucial role for increasing the knowledge of stakeholders involved along the supply chain...|$|R

In {{this article}} there are {{published}} the regesta of the parchments {{from the family}} archive of the Fanfogna Garagnin family, which are now kept in the City Museum of Trogir. This collection and consequently the division of material in this article are, for greater ease of survey, made in three groups. The first and the greatest group consists of parchments dating from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, which are than divided into subgroups according to the respective century and ordered chronologically. Most of these documents were written in the notarial chanceries of Zadar, {{but many of them}} came from the chanceries of Venice (ducali), Ancona, Split, Šibenik, Trogir, Hvar, Nin, Skradin and Pag, with a few documents from Rome or Padua. The oldest and most numerous are the documents which contain typical notarial documents containing contracts on selling and buying landed property, judicial suits, auctions, last wills, grants, procurations, <b>receipts,</b> <b>contracts</b> on dowries, appointing of executors of wills, contracts on selling salt-pans and so on. All these notarial deeds give a wide spectrum of data regarding everyday life, trade, judicial practice, microtoponymy and social relations, and in them the main actors are usually ordinary people, with only a few famous personalities. However, in a lot of these deeds the main actors were ecclesiastical persons, members of both of the regular and the secular clergy, including members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy (bishops and archbishops). The second group consists of only five documents. Three of them, written on paper, are of a completely private character and relate to Anthony Fanfogna and the Garagnin brothers. One document is written in a Cyrillic script of the so-called western type (bosančica) and speaks of the sale of some land in the village of Zastina in Poljica, while the last document is written in German. The third and last group mostly consists of papal bulls issued by different popes from Pope Paul V to Pope Pius VI. These are mostly documents regarding the ecclesiastical career of Archbishop John Lucas Garagnin of Split. They are written in a peculiar type of chancery script, the so-called bollatica, {{and this is one of}} the greatest collections of charters written in that script extant in Croatian archives. In this volume of Zbornik there is published the first part of this article, containing the regesta of the parchments dating to the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, while the regesta of the rest of the parchments and of the two remaining groups of documents will be published in the following issue...|$|R
