50|$|In 1928, in {{an attempt}} to measure the {{escapement}} of salmon in the south east of Alaska, the Bureau of Fisheries constructed four special weirs designed so the passing salmon could be counted (see photo below). Escapement is the proportion of spawning stock which survives fishing pressure during a salmon run. The <b>counting</b> <b>stations</b> were intended to provide harvest managers with data they needed to manage the salmon fisheries, but they missed much of the escapement. Smaller fish passed through the weirs uncounted, the salmon could not be counted during times of flood, and there were hundreds of other salmon streams in the area without <b>counting</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

The north fish ladder (except entrance section) and a portion of ladder adjacent to the south fish <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> were studied in a 1 : 10 -scale model. A group of four typical diffusion chambers in each ladder was reproduced in a 1 : 8 -scale model. Fishway weirs with 6 -ft-long overflow crests at each end of a 12 -ft-long nonoverflow section, upstream fins, and 18 - by 18 -in. orifices at the floor were adopted. Orifice sizes in the regulating sections were adjusted to control discharge and head drops between 19 nonoverflow bulkheads for an 11 -ft range in forebay levels. Sloping floors, baffle beams at a constant elevation, and metering orifices sized to provide 60 cfs each were selected for diffusers in sloping portions of the fish ladders. Improved designs were developed for the bulkhead and weir adjacent to the north fish <b>counting</b> <b>station.</b> The addition of a third orifice in bulkheads of the regulating section (to assist passage of shad and sockeye salmon) increased turbulence at the north fish <b>counting</b> <b>station.</b> The south fish <b>counting</b> <b>station,</b> with an illuminated vertical counting board, was satisfactory after the orifices in the adjacent downstream weir were enlarged to reduce head on the weir...|$|R

40|$|Underwater {{time-lapse}} video {{technology has}} been used to monitor adult spring and summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) escapement into the Secesh River and Lake Creek, Idaho, since 1998. Underwater time-lapse videography is a passive methodology that does not trap or handle this Endangered Species Act listed species. Secesh River chinook salmon represent a wild spawning aggregate that has not been directly supplemented with hatchery fish. The Secesh River is also a control population under the Idaho Salmon Supplementation study. This project has demonstrated the successful application of underwater video adult salmon abundance monitoring technology in Lake Creek in 1998 and 1999. Emphasis of the project in 2000 was to determine if the temporary fish <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> could be installed early enough to successfully estimate adult spring and summer chinook salmon abundance in the Secesh River (a larger stream). Snow pack in the drainage was 93 % of the average during the winter of 1999 / 2000, providing an opportunity to test the temporary <b>count</b> <b>station</b> structure. The temporary fish <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> was not the appropriate technology to determine adult salmon spawner abundance in the Secesh River. Due to its temporary nature it could not be installed early enough, due to high stream discharge, to capture the first upstream migrating salmon. A more permanent structure used with underwater video, or other technology needs to be utilized for accurate salmon escapement monitoring in the Secesh River. A minimum of 813 adult chinook salmon spawners migrated upstream past the Secesh River fish <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> to spawning areas in the Secesh River drainage. Of these fish, more than 324 migrated upstream into Lake Creek. The first upstream migrating adult chinook salmon passed the Secesh River and Lake Creek sites prior to operation of the fish <b>counting</b> <b>stations</b> on June 22. This was 17 and 19 days earlier than the first fish arrival at Lake Creek in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Peak net upstream adult movement at the Secesh River site occurred June 28 and at the Lake Creek site on June 27. Peak of total movement was August 16 at Secesh River and August 7 at Lake Creek. The last fish passed through the Lake Creek fish <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> on August 31 and on September 8 at the Secesh River site. Migrating salmon in the Secesh River and Lake Creek exhibited two behaviorally distinct segments of fish movement. The first segment of movement was characterized, mainly, by upstream movement only. The second segment consisted of upstream and downstream movement with very little net upstream movement. The fish <b>counting</b> <b>stations</b> did not impede salmon movements, nor was spawning displaced downstream. Fish moved freely upstream and downstream through the fish counting structures. Fish movement was greatest between the period of 5 : 00 p. m. and 4 : 00 a. m. There appeared to be a segment of ''nomadic'' males that moved {{into and out of the}} spawning area, apparently seeking other mates to spawn with. The downstream movement of salmon allowed by this fish <b>counting</b> <b>station</b> design may be an important factor affecting reproductive success as male salmon seek other females to spawn with. Traditional weirs operated for broodstock collection do not allow for downstream movement of adults. This methodology has the potential to provide more consistent and accurate salmon spawner abundance information than single-pass and multiple-pass spawning ground surveys. Accurate adult abundance would allow managers to determine if recovery actions were benefiting these salmon spawning aggregates and if recovery goals were being met...|$|R

40|$|Modifications of {{the flow}} control {{sections}} and <b>counting</b> <b>stations</b> of the Bradford Island and Washington Shore fish ladders at Bonneville Dam were necessary to accommodate rapid pool changes which will result from fluctuating discharges caused by power peaking at hydroelectric projects upstream. Fishway operation for the extreme flood control pool range from elev 70. 0 to elev 82. 5 (feet above mean sea level) was considered. The normal range for design was between elev 72. 0 and 80. 0. A portion of the forebay, the exit control section, the <b>counting</b> <b>station,</b> the supply channel for auxiliary water, and typical sections of each ladder were studied in a 1 : 14 -scale model.

The designs for both ladders were operative with forebay levels between elev 70. 0 and 76. 5.

40|$|Abstract: We used point count {{data from}} a 3 -year {{experiment}} measuring the impact of firewood cutting on an oak woodland bird community to recommend a sampling design for detecting environmental impacts on bird population trends. The optimal allocation of sampling effort to <b>count</b> <b>stations</b> and visits varied from two to seven visits per station depending on the bird species. When the number of <b>count</b> <b>stations</b> was constrained by logistics, additional visits increased statistical power to detect an effect to acceptable levels (> 0. 5) for some species. Depending on the species, 14 to 920 <b>count</b> <b>stations</b> per treatment level were necessary to detect a 50 percent difference in {{the mean number of}} birds counted with power = 0. 8. As California’s oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands come under increasing pressure from human activities, so increases the need for the reliable detection of impacts on wildlife. In an experimental framework, the challenge is to isolate the effects of interest from natural spatial and temporal variability using an appropriate statistical test (Osenberg and others 1994). The power of a statistical test is the probability that it will find an effect of a specified size to be significant (Cohen 1988). Thus, power is critical in studies evaluating the impacts of environmenta...|$|R
