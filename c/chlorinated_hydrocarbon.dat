25|$|The thermal {{cracking}} reaction is highly endothermic, and is generally {{carried out in}} a fired heater. Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> side products. In practice, EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to stop undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a purification system. Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the chlorinated hydrocarbons, while other processes use a refrigerated continuous distillation system.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} {{are used}} in nearly any industrial practice where degreasing removers are required. PCE is a highly utilized solvent in the dry cleaning industry because of its cleaning effectiveness and relatively low cost. It has also been used for metal-degreasing operations. Because it is highly volatile, it is more frequently found in groundwater than in surface water. TCE has historically {{been used as a}} metal cleaning. The military facility Anniston Army Dept (ANAD) in the United States was placed on the US EPA Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) because of groundwater contamination with as much as 27 million pounds of TCE. Both PCE and TCE may degrade to vinyl chloride (VC), the most toxic <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Since <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{pesticides}} dissolve in {{fats and}} are not excreted, organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely. Biological magnification is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons (pesticides) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain. Among marine animals, pesticide concentrations are higher in carnivorous fishes, {{and even more so}} in the fish-eating birds and mammals {{at the top of the}} ecological pyramid. Global distillation is the process whereby pesticides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the Earth, in particular the Poles and mountain tops. [...] Pesticides that evaporate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances (thousands of kilometers) by the wind to an area of lower temperature, where they condense and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Correlation for {{estimation}} of the aqueous solubility (logSw) of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> molecules is proposed.

The correlation equation obtained {{which is based on}} a training set of 50 <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> has a correlation coefficient of 0. 9670 and a standard error of 0. 44 log 10 units. Application of the developed model to a testing set of 73 <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> demonstrates that the new model is reliable with good predictive accuracy and simple formulation. Besides, the model does not require any experimental physicochemical properties in the calculation, so it is easy to apply, especially in cases where it is inconvenient or impossible to measure the physicochemical properties...|$|R

50|$|Acute {{intoxication}} of rats with aldrin decreases chronaxie, whereas {{chronic exposure}} to this <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> insecticide has the reverse effect. Chronic exposure of rats to the closely relatedepoxide, dieldrin, {{has been suggested}} to reduce their muscular efficiency in performing a work exercise. Dieldrin is a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> insecticide widely used in crop protection andpreservation. Among the diverse symptoms resulting from intoxication are muscular twitching increasing in severity to epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness. Strychnine,which has a spinal locus of activity, causes tonic hind limb extension in mice, which {{is thought to be}} due to a removal of the effect of inhibitory interneurons on the nervouspathway to extensor muscles. Leptazol, on the other hand, produces a similar tonic extension by an excitatory action predominantly on cerebral structures. Diphenylhydantoin selectively elevated the threshold convulsive dose of leptazol but not that of strychnine hydrochloride, indicating an anticonvulsant activity on the nervous pathway between the predominant locus of activity of leptazol and the hind limbs.|$|E
