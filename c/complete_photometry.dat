Based on the photographic and CCD photometry down to the horizontal branch, a distance modulus (m-M) v = 20. 4 mag is derived, with E(B-V) = 0. 0 mag, corresponding to a distance of 120 kpc from the sun. Using the (V-K) colors of two giants in AM- 1, a metallicity of Fe/H = - 2. 0 + or - 0. 2 is deduced, in good agreement with earlier determinations.

L 1228 has previously been studied at optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths but not in X-rays. We present results of a sensitive 37 ks Chandra ACIS-I X-ray observation of the L 1228 core region. Chandra detected 60 X-ray sources, most of which are faint (< 40 counts) and non-variable.

40|$|We present deep VI {{photometry}} {{of stars}} in the globular cluster M 5 (NGC 5904) based on images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches below V ~ 27 mag, revealing the upper 2 - 3 magnitudes of the white dwarf cooling sequence, and main sequence stars eight magnitudes and more below the turn-off. We fit the main sequence to subdwarfs of known parallax to obtain a true distance modulus of (m-M) _ 0 = 14. 45 +/- 0. 11 mag. A second distance estimate based on fitting the cluster white dwarf sequence to field white dwarfs with known parallax yielded (m-M) _ 0 = 14. 67 +/- 0. 18 mag. We couple our distance estimates with extensive photometry of the cluster's RR Lyrae variables to provide a calibration of the RR Lyrae absolute magnitude yielding M_V(RR) = 0. 42 +/- 0. 10 mag at [Fe/H] = - 1. 11 dex. We provide another luminosity calibration {{in the form of}} reddening-free Wasenheit functions. Comparison of our calibrations with predictions based on recent models combining stellar evolution and pulsation theories shows encouraging agreement.

The objects have been selected from their optical color and then spectroscopically confirmed by Vanzella et al. (2005). From the public spectra we assessed {{the nature of the}} Ly-alpha emission and divided the sample into galaxies with Ly-alpha in emission and objects without Ly-alpha line (i. e. either absent or in absorption). We have then used the <b>complete</b> <b>photometry,</b> from U band to mid infrared from the GOODS-MUSIC database, to study the observational properties of the galaxies, such as UV spectral slopes and optical to mid-infrared colors, and the possible differences between the two samples. Finally through standard spectral fitting tecniques we have determined the physical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, stellar ages and so on, and again we have studied the possible differences between the two samples. Our results indicate that LBG with Ly-alpha in emission are on average a much younger and less massive population than the LBGs without Ly-alpha emission. Both populations are forming stars very actively and are relatively dust free, although those with line emission seem to be even less dusty on average.

The archival mid-infrared data were merged with extant HÎ± emission data, optical and near-infrared photometry, and moderate-resolution optical spectroscopy to identify the remnant disk-bearing population of the cluster and to estimate the fraction of stars that still retain primordial circumstellar disks. The principal sample of 232 suspected cluster members with masses ranging from 10 to 0. 3 M_âŠ™ (B 2 -M 5 spectral types) was drawn from known HÎ± emission stars, X-ray-detected stars from a single 100 ks archival Chandra observation, and established lithium-rich stars. A second sample of 153 stars over a similar mass range whose membership status was based on optical photometry alone was also examined. Measured fluxes in the optical and infrared passbands were fitted with synthetic, low-resolution spectra created using the NextGen atmospheric models, permitting the detection of infrared excesses relative to predicted stellar photospheric fluxes.

40|$|We present {{accurate}} resolved WISE photometry {{of galaxies}} in the combined SINGS and KINGFISH sample. The luminosities in the W 3 12 Î¼m and W 4 23 Î¼m bands are calibrated to star formation rates (SFRs) derived using the total infrared luminosity, avoiding UV/optical uncertainties due to dust extinction corrections. The W 3 relation has a 1 -Ïƒ scatter of 0. 15 dex over nearly 5 orders of magnitude in SFR and 12 Î¼m luminosity, and a range in host stellar mass from dwarf (10 ^ 7 M_) to âˆ¼ 3 Ã—M_ (10 ^ 11. 5 M_) galaxies. In the absence of deep silicate absorption features and powerful active galactic nuclei, we expect {{this to be a}} reliable SFR indicator chiefly due to the broad nature of the W 3 band. By contrast the W 4 SFR relation shows more scatter (1 -Ïƒ = 0. 18 dex). Both relations show reasonable agreement with radio continuum-derived SFRs and excellent accordance with so-called "hybrid" HÎ± + 24 Î¼m and FUV+ 24 Î¼m indicators. Moreover, the WISE SFR relations appear to be insensitive to the metallicity range in the sample. We also compare our results with IRAS-selected luminous infrared galaxies, showing that the WISE relations maintain concordance, but systematically deviate for the most extreme galaxies. Given the all-sky coverage of WISE and the performance of the W 3 band as a SFR indicator, the L_ 12 Î¼ m SFR relation could be of great use to studies of nearby galaxies and forthcoming large area surveys at optical and radio wavelengths.

Our analysis is based on the largest multiwavelength compact group sample to-date, containing <b>complete</b> ultraviolet-to-infrared (UV-to-IR) <b>photometry</b> for 1, 770 isolated groups (7, 417 galaxies). We classified the nuclear activity of the galaxies based on optical emission line and mid-infrared diagnostic methods, as well as using spectral energy distribution fitting. We observe a 15 % increase on the number of the AGN-hosting late-type galaxies found in dynamically old groups, over the past 3 Gyr, accompanied by the corresponding decrease of their circumnuclear star formation. Comparing our compact group results with those of local isolated field and interacting pair galaxies, we find no differences in the AGN at the same redshift range. Based on both optical and mid-IR colour classifications, we report the absence of Seyfert 1 nuclei and we attribute this to the low accretion rates, caused by the depletion of gas. We propose that the observed increase of LINER and Seyfert 2 nuclei (at low-z's), in the early-type galaxies of the dynamically young groups, is due to the morphological transformation of lenticular into elliptical galaxies. Finally, we show that at any given stellar mass, galaxies found in dynamically old groups are more likely to host an AGN. Our findings suggest that the depletion of gas, due to past star formation and tidal stripping, is the major mechanism driving the evolution of the nuclear activity in compact groups of galaxies.

Consistent with this finding, all elliptical/SO galaxies are in the low-SSFR locus, while 22 out of 24 spirals / irregulars are in the high-SSFR locus, with two borderline cases. We further divide our sample into three subsamples (I, II, and III) according to decreasing H I richness of the parent galaxy group to which a galaxy belongs. Consistent with the SSFR and alpha-IRAC bimodality, 12 out of 15 type I (11 out of 12 type III) galaxies are in the high- (low-) SSFR locus, while type II galaxies span almost {{the full range of}} SSFR values. We use the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) to construct a comparison subsample of galaxies that (1) match HCG galaxies in J-band total galaxy luminosity and (2) are not strongly interacting and largely isolated. This selection eliminates mostly low-luminosity dwarfs and galaxies with some degree of peculiarity, providing a substantially improved, quiescent control sample. Unlike HCG galaxies, galaxies in the comparison SINGS subsample are continuously distributed both in SSFR and alpha-IRAC, although they show ranges in SFR(sub TOTAL) values, morphologies and stellar masses similar to those for HCG systems. We test the SSFR bimodality against a number of uncertainties, and find that these can only lead to its further enhancement. Excluding galaxies belonging to HCGs with three giant galaxies (triplets) leaves both the SSFR and the alpha-IRAC bimodality completely unaffected. We interpret these results as further evidence that an environment characterized by high galaxy number densities and low galaxy velocity dispersions, such as the one found in compact groups, {{plays a key role in}} accelerating galaxy evolution by enhancing star formation processes in galaxies and favoring a fast transition to quiescence...|$|R
