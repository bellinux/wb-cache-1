In which, Enterprise ResourcePlanning (ERP) model is most widely used in orderto <b>cost</b> <b>control,</b> <b>accounting</b> and e-business &analyses. The order of the customers are routingautomatically to the next department when onedepartment finishes their work of the customer’sorder and each department have access to the singledatabase that holds the customers new order. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) modelis responsible for receiving the request andresponses to the customers quickly and directly. The request includes queries, complaints,suggestions, and orders. These requests areforwarded to inner view ERP through querygenerator. In this paper, we proposed a model thatintegrates the customer queries, transactions,databases and all other specifications used in ERPSystems, then use data mining techniques tointegrate decision making and forecasting. UsingERP characteristics, data gathered from centraldatabase are in cluster format which is based onaction taken against the queries generated bycustomers.

30|$|With {{regard to}} {{ecological}} and content validity, rather than apply highly structured items (e.g. multiple choice items), we developed three authentic problem scenarios and provided an open-ended problem space {{in terms of}} an authentic office simulation. The assessment was aimed at apprentice industrial clerks {{at the end of a}} 3 -year apprenticeship program and focused on the domain of controlling (i.e., support of managerial decisions, <b>cost</b> planning, <b>cost</b> <b>control,</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting,</b> etc.). The computer-based office simulation provided typical tools (e.g., email client, spreadsheet software, file system, notebook, calculator, etc.). In order to assess the non-cognitive components in our competence model, we implemented an integrated measurement of self-concept and interest that we refer to as ‘Embedded Experience Sampling’ (EES). Test-takers are requested to spontaneously answer short prompts (EES items) during the test that are embedded in typical social interactions in the workplace. The empirical section is based on a study with 780 VET students from three commercial training occupations in Germany (industrial clerks and apprentices from two similar VET programs). The focus of the contribution is on testing a theoretically derived competence model based on item response theory, the implemented scoring methods and reliability of the instrument.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Existing literature and research findings indicated that <b>cost</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> of construction projects by contractors {{at the level of}} site operations has remained ineffective largely due to inability of existing control systems to accurately predict when, to what extent and why an on-going operation or project is to overrun its planned duration and cost. In most cases the information that would enable such advance detection becomes available to decision makers after the affected operation or project is completed. It is then hoped that the information could be used to 'control' future similar situations which in the case of construction projects hardly arise, at least never under identical circumstances. The existing <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> systems also fail to enable rational corrective decisions to be formulated. This resulted in total reliance on previous experience and personal intuition to make a guess of corrective measures. Most research efforts have focussed mainly on various aspects of project modelling and <b>cost</b> <b>control</b> using traditional <b>accounting</b> approaches that consistently fail to meet the requirements and schedule of timely <b>cost</b> <b>control.</b> This research identified, from empirical evidence, construction and management science literature, the essential criteria and features of an effective <b>cost</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> approach for construction projects. The evidence from these three sources led to the formulation of an alternative approach based on quantitative analysis of cost data from construction projects. The <b>cost</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> process carried out on sites was formulated as a problem whose solution process is implemented using multiple regression and goal programming models and techniques that enable timely evaluation and prediction of costs and a rational computation of corrective decisions. This allowed cost deviations to be detected and optimum corrective measures calculated while the affected operation or project was still in progress...|$|R

40|$|Background To measure higher-order {{outcomes}} of vocational {{education and training}} (VET) we developed a computer-based assessment of domain-specific problem-solving competence. In modeling problem-solving competence, we distinguish four components of competence: (1) knowledge application, (2) metacognition, (3) self-concept, and (4) interest as well as thirteen facets of competence, {{each of which is}} assigned to one of the four components. Methods With regard to ecological and content validity, rather than apply highly structured items (e. g. multiple choice items), we developed three authentic problem scenarios and provided an open-ended problem space in terms of an authentic office simulation. The assessment was aimed at apprentice industrial clerks {{at the end of a}} 3 -year apprenticeship program and focused on the domain of controlling (i. e., support of managerial decisions, <b>cost</b> planning, <b>cost</b> <b>control,</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting,</b> etc.). The computer-based office simulation provided typical tools (e. g., email client, spreadsheet software, file system, notebook, calculator, etc.). In order to assess the non-cognitive components in our competence model, we implemented an integrated measurement of self-concept and interest that we refer to as ‘Embedded Experience Sampling’ (EES). Test-takers are requested to spontaneously answer short prompts (EES items) during the test that are embedded in typical social interactions in the workplace. The empirical section is based on a study with 780 VET students from three commercial training occupations in Germany (industrial clerks and apprentices from two similar VET programs). The focus of the contribution is on testing a theoretically derived competence model based on item response theory, the implemented scoring methods and reliability of the instrument. Fine-grained response patterns from automated codings and human ratings were condensed into one partial credit item for each scenario and each of the facets in the cognitive component ‘knowledge application’. Results The multidimensional Rasch analysis revealed satisfactory EAP/PV reliabilities, which are between. 78 and. 84 for the ‘knowledge application’ facets and between. 77 and. 85 for the non-cognitive facets.
