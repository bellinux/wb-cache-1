50|$|The server’s {{front panel}} offered two 3.5 inch drive bays. The hard disks were mounted in {{removable}} carriers, {{despite the fact}} that the server only supported <b>cold</b> <b>swap.</b> A single socket server, the processor on offer was the 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor. An intense cooling system was incorporated, with a large heatsink and an array of pipes, with three small fans addressing cooling needs. Despite the presence of three fans, the server’s noise levels were low. Power utilization was also low, with the server drawing 65W when idle and 94W at peak performance.|$|E

50|$|The Mast General Store, {{located in}} Historic Valle Crucis, is {{recognized}} by the National Register of Historic Places {{as one of the}} best remaining examples of an old country general store. It is still the center of the community housing the post office (Valle Crucis, NC 28691) and offering coffee for 5¢ on the honor system. There is even a large wood stove you can sit around on <b>cold</b> days <b>swapping</b> stories or playing a game of checkers. It remains true to the old-time general store from the 19th century by offering items that its neighbors might need, as well as products of interest to travelers and other visitors. Today there are nine locations, including the Original Store and Annex, both located in Valle Crucis, North Carolina. The store sells commodities, such as old-time hearth and home goods, outdoor clothing and gear, footwear, work clothes, old-fashioned wind-up toys, regional books and music, honey, and more than 500 varieties of old-fashioned candy.|$|R
50|$|Gorikot {{lies on the}} {{historic}} junction where roads link Rattu and Tarisheng Base camp-Nanga Perbat, and other axis leads to Gudai - Chilum & Deosai Plains linking Astore to Skardu.The roads are not fully paved but are suitable for local jeeps. The majority of people here are Sunnis. Gorikot {{is well known for}} its scenic beauty as lush green plains, lofty mountains and <b>swapping</b> <b>cold</b> winds makes addition to its beauty. In Gorikot, terrace farming is practiced in a subsistence scale. Crops like cotton, wheat, peas, and fruits are grown here; apples are a cash crop for landlords and are supplied to places like Islamabad. Fruit drying also occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Giles Whittell is an English {{author and}} journalist. He {{has worked for}} The Times of London since 1993, first as US West Coast Correspondent from 1993 to 1999 and later as Moscow Correspondent (1999-2001) and Washington Bureau Chief (2009-2011). He is {{currently}} the paper's chief leader writer. His books [...] include Lambada Country (1992), Extreme Continental (1994), Spitfire Women of World War II (2007) and Bridge of Spies, a New York Times bestselling account of the <b>Cold</b> War spy <b>swap</b> between Rudolf Abel, Gary Powers and Frederic Pryor on Berlin's Glienicke Bridge in 1962. The book {{was published in the}} US in 2010 and the United Kingdom in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Marshals {{registered}} enemy {{aliens in}} wartime, sealed the American border against armed expeditions from foreign countries, {{and at times}} during the <b>Cold</b> War also <b>swapped</b> spies with the Soviet Union. In the 1960s the marshals were {{on the front lines}} of the civil rights movement, mainly providing protection to volunteers. In September 1962, President John F. Kennedy ordered 127 marshals to accompany James Meredith, an African American who wished to register at the segregated University of Mississippi. Their presence on campus provoked riots at the university, but the marshals stood their ground, and Meredith registered. Marshals provided continuous protection to Meredith during his first year at Ole Miss, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy later proudly displayed a deputy marshal's dented helmet in his office. U.S. Marshals also protected black schoolchildren integrating public schools in the South. Artist Norman Rockwell's famous painting The Problem We All Live With depicted a tiny Ruby Bridges being escorted by four towering United States Marshals in 1964.|$|R
30|$|The phonon {{transport}} is studied {{using the}} nonequilibrium molecular dynamics [NEMD] simulations as {{implemented in the}} LAMMPS software package (Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, USA)[16]. The Tersoff potential [17] is adopted to solve Newtonian equations of motion according to the Müller-Plathe algorithm [18] with a fixed time step of 0.5 fs. We carry out a 300 -ps constant temperature simulation and a 200 -ps constant energy simulation {{to make sure that}} the system has reached a steady state. The nanotubes are then divided into 40 equal segments with periodic boundary condition, and the first and twenty-first segments are defined as the hot and cold regions, respectively. The coldest atom in the hot region and the hottest one in the <b>cold</b> region <b>swap</b> their kinetic energies every hundreds of time steps, and then temperature gradient responses and thermal flux maintain via atom interactions in neighboring segments [19, 20]. The electronic transport is calculated using the NEGF method as implemented in the AtomistixToolKit code (Quantum Wise A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) [21, 22]. The nanotube is modeled by a central part connected by the left and right semi-infinite one. We use the Troullier-Martins nonlocal pseudopotentials [23] to describe the electron-ion interactions. The exchange-correlation energy is in the form of PW- 91 [24], and the cutoff energy is set to be 150 Ry. We use a double ζ basis set plus polarization for the carbon atoms, and the Brillouin zone is sampled with 1 × 1 × 100 Monkhorst-Pack meshes. The mixing rate of the electronic Hamiltonian is set as 0.1, and the convergent criterion for the total energy is 4 × 10 - 5 eV.|$|R
30|$|DNA {{sequences}} were aligned {{using the}} program MUSCLE {{implemented in the}} software MEGA 5 (Tamura et al. 2011) with subsequent manual adjustments. The aligned matrix was analyzed using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) optimality criteria and Bayesian Inference (BI). MP analyses were performed using PAUP* v. 4.0 b 10 (Swofford 2002). All characters were unordered and equally weighted and gaps were treated as missing. Heuristic searches were conducted with 1000 replicates of random addition, 10 trees held at each step during stepwise addition, tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping, and deepest descent option in effect. Brach supports (parsimony bootstrap: PB) were assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates with 10 random taxon additions and heuristic search options. To assess the congruence among the two data sets, the incongruence length difference test (ILD test for partition-homogeneity test in PAUP*) was performed. One thousand homogeneity replicates of heuristic searches were conducted with 100 random sequence additions and MulTrees not in effect. Ten ML analyses with 5000 bootstrap (likelihood bootstrap: LB) resamplings were conducted using RAxML-HPC 2 v 7.2. 7 - 3 (Stamatakis et al. 2008) via the CIPRES Portals ([URL] The matrix was partitioned (i.e., ITS vs. rpL 16 intron) with a gamma model of rate heterogeneity and proportion of invariable sites estimated by the program. The program MrBayes v 3.1. 2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) was employed for BI analyses. The aligned matrix was partitioned into ITS and rpL 16 data sets. Prior to the analysis, DNA substitution models for each partition were selected by MrModeltest (Nylander 2004) based on the Akaike information Criterion (AIC). BI analyses were conducted using mixed models specified to each data partition. Four runs of Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) analyses were performed, with a random starting tree and four chains for each run (one cold and three heated). The MCMCMC length was ten million generations and the chain was sampled every 1000 th generation from the cold chain. To assure that the <b>cold</b> chain <b>swapped</b> successfully with the heated chains and the Metropolis coupling functioned well, the resulting log files were by inspecting the trace plots of parameters using the program Tracer v 1.5 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007). The function ‘Compare and Cumulative’ of the program AWTY (Nylander et al. 2008) was employed to check topological convergence and convergence of posterior probabilities (PP) of splits from different runs. Bayesian clade posterior probabilities and average branch lengths were calculated based on the sampled trees after the first 25 % of the sampled trees were discarded as burn-in.|$|R
