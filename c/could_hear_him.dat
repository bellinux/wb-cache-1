5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

25|$|West's {{friend and}} fellow artist Tammy Wynette stated that she had put aside visiting her in the hospital, saying that she planned {{to allow her to}} heal first, {{something}} she admitted to later regretting. In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death. On his last visit (the day of West's death), Rogers recalled that although he was told it was unlikely that West <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him,</b> he still spoke to her for a considerable amount of time in the hope she could hear what he was saying.|$|E

25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, and she told him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E
500|$|During the 1860s, Longfellow {{supported}} abolitionism {{and especially}} hoped for reconciliation between {{the northern and}} southern states after the American Civil War. His son was injured during the war, and he wrote the poem [...] "Christmas Bells", later the basis of the carol I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day. He wrote in his journal in 1878: [...] "I have only one desire; and that is for harmony, and a frank and honest understanding between North and South". Longfellow accepted an offer from Joshua Chamberlain to speak at his fiftieth reunion at Bowdoin College, despite his aversion to public speaking; he read the poem [...] "Morituri Salutamus" [...] so quietly that few <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> The next year, he declined an offer to be nominated for the Board of Overseers at Harvard [...] "for reasons very conclusive to my own mind".|$|E

In Colombo {{he gave his}} [...] From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop so they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> From Madras, he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora. While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India's great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule. These lectures, published as Lectures from Colombo to Almora, demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology.|$|E

500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E
500|$|Juster {{quit his}} job {{so that he could}} work on the book. His {{imagination}} fired by a boy who approached him on the street and with whom he discussed the nature of infinity, Juster wanted to finish the story about [...] "a boy who asked too many questions" [...] before returning to the book on cities. Juster shared his house in Brooklyn Heights with cartoonist Jules Feiffer whose bedroom was immediately below, and who <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> pacing in the night. Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend's insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a book about a boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride. Sheftel got Jason Epstein, an innovative editor at Random House with a deep appreciation for children's literature, to agree to review the manuscript. Some at Random House considered the book's vocabulary too difficult: at the time, educators advised against children's literature containing words the target audience did not already know, fearing the unfamiliar would discourage young learners. Based on seven chapters of manuscript, plus a three-page outline {{of the rest of the}} story, Epstein bought the book.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Iwai and Noguchi {{returned}} to Hokkaido {{to set up}} their own band, and asked former Guild member Yoshitomo Kobayashi to join. They moved to Sapporo to further their music career, and rented a house with Iwai's older brother Katsutoshi Iwai and his friend Masatsugu Takahashi, who also had a separate band called Logic. All five people practised music in their own rooms, but because Katsutoshi Iwai's room was a Japanese style room, the other band members <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> through the thin shōji walls. Originally Fumito Iwai thought that they would not work well together musically with Katsutoshi Iwai and Takahashi, since they both enjoyed [...] 1990s British rock and grunge. However, in late 2012, Fumito Iwai heard his brother composing the song [...] "River", and enjoyed it so much he asked to arrange the song. On New Years Day, Fumito Iwai unveiled his completed arrangement for the song, which all the housemates loved. Takahashi suggested they merge their two bands to create a five-member band, which lead to the formation of Folks.|$|E
2500|$|Wilder went to {{the awards}} {{ceremony}} expecting to win even though the studio had been backing their other big hit of the year, Leo McCarey's Going My Way, and studio employees were expected {{to vote for the}} studio favorite. As the awards show wore on and Double Indemnity lost in category after category, it became evident {{that there would be a}} Going My Way sweep. McCarey beamed as his picture won award after award and when he was named Best Director, Wilder could no longer take it. When McCarey got up to make his way to the stage to accept the award for best picture, Wilder, sitting on the aisle, stuck out his foot and tripped him. [...] "Mr. McCarey...stumbled perceptibly," [...] he gleefully recalled.

2500|$|The album's final vocal overdubbing session {{took place}} on April 13, 1966, {{concluding}} a ten-month-long recording period that had begun with [...] "Sloop John B" [...] in July 1965. The album was mixed three days later in a single nine-hour session. Saxophonist Steve Douglas recalls of the album's draft mix: [...] "It was full of noise. You <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> talking in the background. It was real sloppy. He had spent all this time making the album, and zip—dubbed it down in one day or something like that. , he took it back and mixed it properly. I {{think a lot of}} times, beautiful orchestrated stuff or parts got lost in his mixes". A true stereophonic mix of Pet Sounds was not considered in 1966 largely because of mixing logistics. In spite of whether a true stereo mix was possible, Wilson intentionally mixed the final version of his recordings in mono (as did Spector). He did this because he felt that mono mastering provided more sonic control over the final result, irrespective of the vagaries of speaker placement and sound system quality. Another and more personal reason for Brian's preference for mono was his almost total deafness in his right ear. The total cost of production amounted to a then-unheard of $70,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E
