5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of obesity, {{insulin resistance}} and {{type 2 diabetes}} {{can be traced to}} impaired <b>carbohydrate</b> and lipid <b>metabolism.</b> <b>Carbohydrate</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> heavily depend on the mitochondria, which itself is regulated by NRF- 1. These metabolic pathways are controlled through the metabolic alterations in concentrations of high energy compounds such as the AMP/ATP and the NAD+ /NADH ratios. Decreased concentrations of ATP are able to activate AMPK which in turn activate a versatile transcription factor, NRF- 1. The function of NRF- 1 is to regulate both <b>carbohydrate</b> and lipid <b>metabolism.</b> On the other hand, changes in the NAD+ /NADH ratios affect the activity of other metabolic regulators such as the protein deacetylases called sirtuins. It has been established that sirtuins can increase the activity of the transcriptional coactivator, PGC- 1, through deacetylation, the main coactivator of NRF- 1. It has however not yet been established whether sirtuins can directly regulate the activity of NRF- 1.

Experimental studies in which P. frisia SH 6 - 1 was grown in the presence of axenic cultures of the algae Phaeocystis globosa, Leptocylindrus danicus and Thalassiosira rotula exhibited distinctly different responses with the best growth together with P. globosa and T. rotula and very low growth together with L. danicus.

40|$|Identification of the {{underlying}} molecular mechanisms for a derived phenotype by adaptive evolution is difficult. Here, we performed a systems-level inquiry into the metabolic changes occurring in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{as a result of}} its adaptive evolution to increase its specific growth rate on galactose and related these changes to the acquired phenotypic properties. Three evolved mutants (62 A, 62 B, and 62 C) with higher specific growth rates and faster specific galactose uptake were isolated. The evolved mutants were compared with a reference strain and two engineered strains, SO 16 and PGM 2, which also showed higher galactose uptake rate in previous studies. The profile of intermediates in galactose metabolism was similar in evolved and engineered mutants, whereas reserve <b>carbohydrates</b> <b>metabolism</b> was specifically elevated in the evolved mutants and one evolved strain showed changes in ergosterol biosynthesis. Mutations were identified in proteins involved in the global carbon sensing Ras/PKA pathway, which is known to regulate the reserve <b>carbohydrates</b> <b>metabolism.</b> We evaluated one of the identified mutations, RAS 2 (Tyr 112), and this mutation resulted in an increased specific growth rate on galactose. These results show that adaptive evolution results in the utilization of unpredicted routes to accommodate increased galactose flux in contrast to rationally engineered strains. Our study demonstrates that adaptive evolution represents a valuable alternative to rational design in bioengineering of improved strains and, that through systems biology, it is possible to identify mutations in evolved strain that can serve as unforeseen metabolic engineering targets for improving microbial strains for production of biofuels and chemicals...|$|R
25|$|The enzymes transketolase, {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are {{all important}} in <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The cytosolic enzyme transketolase {{is a key}} player in the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a major form of energy for the cell. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, while the reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and for myelin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} protein {{involved}} in <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>metabolism</b> that {{is worthy of}} mention along with GLUT-4. The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates a six-carbon sugar, most notably glucose, {{which is the first}} step in glycolysis. When glucose is transported into the cell it is phosphorylated by hexokinase. This phosphorylation keeps glucose from leaving the cell, and by changing the structure of glucose through phosphorylation, it decreases the concentration of glucose molecules, maintaining a gradient for more glucose to be transported into the cell. Hexokinase II transcription is increased in both red and white skeletal muscle upon treatment with AICAR. With chronic injections of AICAR, total protein content of hexokinase II increases in rat skeletal muscle.|$|E
