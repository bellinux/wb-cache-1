5|$|Internet {{searches}} {{for information on}} suicide return webpages that 10-30% of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts. There is some concern that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge. Some people form suicide pacts online, either with pre-existing friends or people they have recently encountered in <b>chat</b> <b>rooms</b> or message boards. The Internet, however, may also help prevent suicide by providing a social group {{for those who are}} isolated.|$|E

Later that year he sold his collection of medals and international caps to raise funds. In 2002, he was reported as living alone in a bungalow in New Hartley. In an interview two years later, he revealed that he suffers from loneliness and hallucinations due to his condition and {{the side effects of}} his medication. Following the interview a Liverpool fan bought Kennedy a computer, which allowed him to make friends on football <b>chat</b> <b>rooms.</b> Kennedy remained a favourite amongst Liverpool supporters decades after leaving the club, and was voted in at No.25 on the 2013 poll '100 Players Who Shook The Kop'.|$|E
40|$|Heavy <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> use {{has been}} {{associated}} with social isolation, introversion, impulse control problems, and risk taking. Such characteristics form part of the cluster of traits associated with schizotypy. This study used multiple regression {{to examine the relationship between}} age, sex, four dimensions of schizotypy, and frequency of reported <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> use. The only significant association with schizotypy was between frequency of <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> use and impulsive nonconformity (IN) in females. These findings may be explained by the increased risk associated with female <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> use...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} an internet <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> with free entry but secure identity. Traders exchange messages in real time of both a fundamental and non-fundamental nature. We explore conditions under which traders post truthful information and make trading decisions. We also a describe an equilibrium in which momentum traders profit from their exposure to informed traders in the <b>chat</b> <b>room.</b> The model generates a number of empirical predictions: (1) unskillful traders post more often than skillful traders; (2) skillful traders will not follow unskillful traders in stock picking; (3) The optimal strategy for unskillful traders is to follow skillful traders in stock picking. We test and affirm all three predictions using a unique data set of <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> logs from the Activetrader Financial <b>Chat</b> <b>Room.</b> <b>chat</b> <b>room,</b> strategic information...|$|R

Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, <b>chat</b> <b>rooms</b> or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{operating}} Ars Technica {{has always been}} funded primarily by online advertising.

40|$|The {{present study}} used a <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> {{paradigm}} {{to examine the}} effects of social ostracism on brain activity in the frontal lobe via EEG. Previous research has suggested that frontal lobe activity changes during the experience of social ostracism. Participants were placed in a <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> with two other individuals. Unknown to participants, these individuals were actually confederates in the study. This experiment consisted of three primary phases. In the first phase, confederates actively included the participant in the <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> conversation. In the second phase, they were completely ignored (social ostracism). Confederates re-included the participant in the last phase of the <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> conversations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate what variables may influence the experience of social ostracism, such as gender and attractiveness of the ostracizing students...|$|R

Some communities – such as Classmates.com – took a different approach by simply having people link to each other via email addresses. PlanetAll started in 1996.|$|E
