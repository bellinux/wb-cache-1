40|$|The {{function}} of <b>changeover</b> delays in producing matching was examined with pigeons responding on concurrent variable-interval variable-interval schedules. In Experiment 1, no <b>changeover</b> delay {{was compared to}} {{two different types of}} <b>changeover</b> delay. One type, designated generically as response- response but in the present example as peck-peck, was timed from the first response on the switched-to key; the other, designated generically as pause-response but in the present example as pause-peck, was timed from the last response on the switched-from key. High <b>changeover</b> rates occurred with no <b>changeover</b> delay. Peck-peck and pause-peck <b>changeover</b> delays produced low and intermediate <b>changeover</b> rates, respectively. In Experiment 2, pause-peck and peck-peck <b>changeover</b> delays were compared across a range of relative reinforcement rates. Similar matching relations developed despite differences in the <b>changeover</b> rates and local response patterns as a {{function of}} the type of <b>changeover</b> delay. In Experiment 3, both types of <b>changeover</b> delay yielded similar <b>changeover</b> rates when their obtained durations were equal via yoking. The results suggest that <b>changeover</b> delays function to separate responses on one key from reinforcers on the other or to delay reinforcement for changing over. In addition, the distribution of responding during and after the <b>changeover</b> delay may vary considerably without affecting matching...|$|R

Local response rates were found to differ for unequal schedules of a concurrent pair: local response rate was greater for the variable-interval schedule with the smaller average interreinforcement interval, but qualifications based on an interresponse-time analysis were discussed. In a second experiment, two 3 -minute variable-interval schedules were arranged concurrently, and the experimental variable was the <b>changeover</b> procedure: either a <b>changeover</b> delay was incurred by each <b>changeover</b> or a small fixed ratio on a <b>changeover</b> key was required to complete a <b>changeover.</b> <b>Changeover</b> delays of 2 and 5 seconds were compared with a fixed-ratio <b>changeover</b> of five responses. The response output on the main key (associated with the variable-interval schedules) was greater when a <b>changeover</b> delay was arranged than when a fixed ratio was required to <b>changeover.</b> A detailed analysis of stripchart records showed that a 2 -second delay generated an increased response rate for 3 seconds after a <b>changeover,</b> while the fixed-ratio requirement generated an increased rate during the first second only, followed by a depressed response rate for 2 seconds...|$|R

In the 2012 US Open final against Victoria Azarenka, she was down 3–5 in the third set and found herself two points away from losing the match. Williams then proceeded to win the next 4 games and defeated Azarenka. In the semi-finals of the 2015 French Open, Williams was ill and barely able to walk during <b>changeovers,</b> yet beat her opponent, Timea Bacsinszky, 6–0 in the third set. Another improbable win occurred in the third round of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, when she recovered from two breaks of service in the third set to defeat Great Britain's number-one female player, Heather Watson. Williams has bounced back from a set down to win in 37 Grand Slam matches.|$|E

However, a 2006 Suffolk County Council study concluded that Suffolk should move to the 2-tier school system used {{in the majority of}} the UK. For the purpose of conversion to 2-tier, the 3-tier system has been divided into 4 geographical area groupings and corresponding phases. The first phase was the conversion of schools in Lowestoft and Haverhill in 2011, followed by schools in north and west Suffolk in 2012. The remainder of the <b>changeovers</b> to 2-tier will take place from 2013, for those schools that stay within Local government control, and not become Academies and/or free schools. The majority of schools thus now (2013) operate the more common primary to high school (11–16). Many of the county's upper schools have a sixth form and most further education colleges in the county offer A-level courses. In terms of school population, Suffolk's individual schools are large with the Ipswich district with the largest school population and Forest Heath the smallest, with just two schools.|$|E

2500|$|In just a {{few weeks}} in his new post at AMC, Chapin decided to focus on the {{smallest}} and at that time the least popular AMC model — the compact Rambler American. His objective was to double Rambler sales to 140,000 cars in 1967 and recapture at least 10% of the compact market that AMC once dominated. He saw a gap between U.S. cars and the inexpensive imports (primarily the Volkswagen Beetle) and positioned the Rambler right into the center of this gap with a new, low price tag to make its total value superior to the imports, as well as superior in both price and range of choice" [...] to U.S. compacts. Chapin cut the suggested retail price of the basic two-door Rambler American sedan to $1,839 (US$ in [...] dollars), which was $278 less than its closest U.S. competitor, the $2,117 Plymouth Valiant. This move made the considerably larger and more powerful American only $200 more than the rudimentary Volkswagen. By forgoing the annual styling <b>changeovers</b> that were expected among the domestic firms, AMC could save retooling costs and keep the car's price so low. Helping AMC was the strategic decisions by the competing automakers not to match the price drop.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of her career until 1990, Graf regularly played doubles events in Grand Slams and other tournaments, winning a total of 11 titles. In 1986, she formed a partnership with rival Gabriela Sabatini. The pair was moderately successful, winning the 1988 Wimbledon Championships [...] together and reaching the finals of the French Open in 1986, 1987 and 1989. The partnership was the subject of much discussion, as the two women, both known to be shy, usually kept communication to a minimum during <b>changeovers</b> and between points, a highly unusual situation in doubles. Sabatini said of the partnership: [...] "doubles is all about communicating with each other, and we didn't communicate that much. We would just say the basic things, but nothing else." [...] The pair played their last major tournament together at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, losing in the quarterfinals. From 1991 until the end of her career, Graf would only play doubles sporadically, forming short-term partnerships with a variety of players, including Lori McNeil, Anke Huber and her best friends on the tour, Rennae Stubbs, Patricia Tarabini and Ines Gorrochategui.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>changeover</b> process in the manufacturing industry is becoming widely recognised. <b>Changeover</b> is a complete process of changing between the manufacture of one product to manufacture of an alternative product until specified production and quality rates are reached. The initiatives to improve <b>changeover</b> exist in industry, as better <b>changeover</b> process typically contribute to improved quality performance. A high-quality and reliable <b>changeover</b> process can be achieved through implementation of continuous or radical improvements. This research examines the <b>changeover</b> process of Saudi Arabian manufacturing firms because Saudi Arabia’s government {{is focused on the}} expansion of GDP and increasing the number of export manufacturing firms. Furthermore, it is encouraging foreign manufacturing firms to invest within Saudi Arabia. These initiatives, therefore, require that Saudi manufacturing businesses develop the <b>changeover</b> practice in order to compete in the market and achieve the government’s objectives. Therefore, the aim of this research is to discover the current status of <b>changeover</b> process implementation in Saudi Arabian manufacturing businesses. To achieve this aim, the main objective of this research is to develop a conceptual model to understand and examine the effectiveness of the <b>changeover</b> process within Saudi Arabian manufacturing firms, facilitating identification of those activities that affect the reliability and high-quality of the process. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of this area, this research first explores the concept of quality management and its relationship to firm performance and the performance of manufacturing <b>changeover.</b> An extensive body of literature was reviewed on the subject of lean manufacturing and <b>changeover</b> practice. A research conceptual model was identified based on this review, and focus was on providing high-quality and reliable manufacturing <b>changeover</b> processes during set-up in a dynamic environment. Exploratory research was conducted in sample Saudi manufacturing firms to understand the features of the <b>changeover</b> process within the manufacturing sector, and as a basis for modifying the proposed conceptual model. Qualitative research was employed in the study with semi-structured interviews, direct observations and documentation {{in order to understand the}} real situation such as actual daily practice and current status of <b>changeover</b> process in the field. The research instrument, the <b>Changeover</b> Effectiveness Assessment Tool (CEAT) was developed to evaluate <b>changeover</b> practices. A pilot study was conducted by examining the CEAT, proposed for the main research. Consequently, the conceptual model was modified and CEAT was improved in response to the pilot study findings. Case studies have been conducted within eight Saudi manufacturing businesses. These case studies assessed the implementation of manufacturing <b>changeover</b> practice in the lighting and medical products sectors. These two sectors were selected based on their operation strategy which was batch production as well as the fact that they fulfilled the research sampling strategy. The outcomes of the research improved the conceptual model, ultimately to facilitate the firms’ adoption and rapid implementation of a high-quality and reliability <b>changeover</b> during the set-up process. The main finding of this research is that Quality’s factors were considering the lowest levels comparing to the other factors which are People, Process and Infrastructure. This research contributes to enable Saudi businesses to implement the <b>changeover</b> process by adopting the conceptual model. In addition, the guidelines for facilitating implementation were provided in this thesis. Therefore, this research provides insight to enable the Saudi manufacturing industry to be more responsive to rapidly changing customer demands...|$|R

2500|$|Voyager's world flight takeoff {{took place}} on the longest runway at Edwards AFB at 8:01 am local time on December 14, 1986, with 3,500 of the world's press in attendance. As the plane accelerated, the tips of the wings, which were heavily loaded with fuel, were damaged as they {{unexpectedly}} flew down and scraped against the runway, ultimately causing pieces (winglets) to break off at both ends. [...] (The pilot had wanted to gain enough speed that the inner wings, rather than the fragile outer wings, would lift the plane; in 67 test flights, the plane had never been loaded to capacity.) [...] The aircraft accelerated very slowly and needed approximately 14,200 feet (2.7mi; 4.3km) of the runway to gain enough speed to lift from the ground, the wings arching up dramatically just before take-off. The two damaged winglets remained attached to the wings by only a thin layer of carbon fiber and were removed by flying the Voyager in a slip, which introduced side-loading, tearing the winglets off completely. [...] Some of the carbon fiber skin was pulled off in the process, exposing the blue form core. Burt Rutan following with pilot Mike Melvill determined that Voyager was still within its performance specifications despite the damage and decided to allow the flight to continue. [...] During the flight, the two pilots had to deal with extremely cramped quarters. To reduce stress, the two had originally intended to fly the plane in three-hour shifts, but flight handling characteristics while the plane was heavy prevented routine <b>changeovers,</b> and they became very fatigued.

40|$|Since {{foraging}} {{in nature}} {{can be viewed}} as instrumental behavior, choice between sources of food, known as “patches,” {{can be viewed as}} choice between instrumental response alternatives. Whereas the travel required to change alternatives deters <b>changeover</b> in nature, the <b>changeover</b> delay (COD) usually deters <b>changeover</b> in the laboratory. In this experiment, pigeons were exposed to laboratory choice situations, concurrent variable-interval schedules, that were standard except for the introduction of a travel requirement for <b>changeover.</b> As the travel requirement increased, rate of <b>changeover</b> decreased and preference for a favored alternative strengthened. When the travel requirement was small, the relations between choice and relative reinforcement revealed the usual tendencies toward matching and undermatching. When the travel requirement was large, strong overmatching occurred. These results, together with those from experiments in which <b>changeover</b> was deterred by punishment or a fixed-ratio requirement, deviate from the matching law, even when a correction is made for cost of <b>changeover.</b> If one accepted an argument that the COD is analogous to travel, the results suggest that the norm in choice relations would be overmatching.

40|$|Performance on {{concurrent}} schedules can be decomposed to run lengths (the {{number of}} responses before switching alternatives), or visit durations (time at an alternative before switching alternatives), that are {{a function of the}} ratio of the rates of reinforcement for staying and switching. From this analysis, a model of concurrent performance was developed and examined in two experiments. The first exposed rats to variable-interval schedules for staying and for switching, which included a <b>changeover</b> delay for reinforcers following a switch. With the <b>changeover</b> delay, run lengths and visit durations were functions of the ratios of the rates of reinforcement for staying and for switching, as found by previous research not using a <b>changeover</b> delay. The second directly assessed the effect of a <b>changeover</b> delay on run lengths and visit durations. Each component of a multiple schedule consisted of equivalent stay and switch schedules but only one component included a <b>changeover</b> delay. Run lengths and visit durations were longer when a <b>changeover</b> delay was used. Because visit duration is the reciprocal of <b>changeover</b> rate, these results are consistent with the established finding that a <b>changeover</b> delay reduces the frequency of switching.
