40|$|Let’s begin slowly by {{defining}} some notational conventions and by stating some basic {{things that will}} be assumed without proof. All vectors in these notes will be regarded as column vectors, indexed either by the vertices of a graph or by integers.

If A is a matrix, Av will denote <b>column</b> <b>v,</b> and Auv will be the element in row u of <b>column</b> <b>v.</b> The zero vector and the zero matrix and zero itself will all be denoted by 0. We will use several properties of matrices and vectors of real numbers that are familiar to everyone who works with linea algebra but not to everyone who studies graph theory, so it seems wise to list them here: (i) The dot product of (column) vectors a and b is a · b = a T b (1. 1) the vectors are orthogonal (also called perpendicular) if a · b = 0. The length of vector a is Cauchy’s inequality asserts that ‖a ‖ = √ a · a. (1. 2) a · b ≤ ‖a ‖ ‖b ‖ (1. 3) equality holds iff a is a scalar multiple of b or b = 0. The vectors are called orthonormal if they are orthogonal(perpendicular) {{and the length of}} each is 1.

Moreover we compare results of general decoupling theorems using Haar distributed unitaries with those using smaller sets of operators, in particular ϵ-approximate 2 -designs.
