40|$|Lyophilised {{collagen}} scaffolds {{have shown}} enormous potential in tissue engineering {{in a number}} of areas due to their excellent biological performance. However, they are limited for use in bone tissue engineering due to poor mechanical properties. This paper discusses the development of a calcium-phosphate coating for collagen scaffolds in order to improve their mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering. Pure collagen scaffolds produced in a lyophilization process were <b>coated</b> <b>by</b> <b>immersing</b> <b>them</b> in sodium ammonium hydrogen phosphate (NaNH(4) HPO(4)) followed by calcium chloride (CaCl(2)). The optimal immersing sequence, duration, as well as the optimal solution concentration which facilitated improved mechanical properties of the scaffolds was investigated. The influence of the coating on composition, structural and material properties was analysed. This investigation successfully developed a novel collagen/calcium-phosphate composite scaffold. An increase in the mechanical properties of the scaffolds from 0. 3 kPa to up to 90 kPa was found relative to a pure collagen scaffold, while the porosity was maintained as high as 92 %, indicating the potential of the scaffold for bone tissue engineering or as a bone graft substitute...|$|E

40|$|Nd-Fe-B {{permanent}} magnets are characterised by excellent magnetic properties. However, being extremely {{vulnerable to the}} attack of both climate and corrosive environments, their applications are limited.

We also investigate if the corrosion resistance of silanized Nd-Fe-B magnets increases in mildly corrosive environments <b>by</b> <b>immersing</b> <b>them</b> in a synthetic saliva solution. It {{was found that the}} silanization treatment does not affect the strength of the magnetic force and provide an enhancement of the corrosion resistance of the substrate. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
