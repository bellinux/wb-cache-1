40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} has accumulated on the behavior of volatility for pricing data on a variety of different financial assets. Twenty-four-hour currency markets are a particularly useful vehicle for examining the relationship between information and asset volatility [...] in part because the distinction between public and private information is clearly defined in the foreign exchange market. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the effect of public news on inter- and intra-day exchange-rate return variances. Unlike previous studies, the impacts of both U. S. and foreign macroeconomic news announcements are examined in the spot and futures currency markets [...] for the yen, pound, and mark. The relationship between news and volatility is first examined using variance ratio tests over trading and non-trading periods. Second, diffusion and jump-diffusion process models are developed which contain parameters conditional on the release of news. These models are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood and are compared to equivalent unconditional models using likelihood ratio tests. ^ Results from this study provide insight into the relationship between public information and currency market volatility. Variance ratio tests indicate that U. S. news releases have a greater impact on <b>currency</b> <b>variance</b> than foreign news releases. In addition, trading/non-trading variance patterns are found to differ between the spot and futures markets [...] particularly for the yen. Market liquidity differences and the timing of public news announcements are shown to be factors which can explain whether the spot or futures markets reflect the arrival of public information first. The impact of public macroeconomic news releases on volatility is also shown to be concentrated in the period immediately surrounding the announcement. ^ Maximum-likelihood estimation of diffusion and jump-diffusion process models reveals that simple models, conditional on ex ante macroeconomic news announcements, better explain the currency return generating process than equivalent unconditional models. Over the period studied, merchandise trade balance and industrial production announcements had a greater impact on volatility than money supply or inflation announcements. Finally, the correlation between the yen, pound, and mark was highest on days of U. S. macroeconomic news. ...|$|E
50|$|Financial risk is most {{commonly}} {{measured in terms}} of the variance or standard deviation of a variable such as percentage returns or rates of change. In foreign exchange, a relevant factor would be the rate of change of the spot exchange rate between <b>currencies.</b> <b>Variance</b> represents exchange rate risk by the spread of exchange rates, whereas standard deviation represents exchange rate risk by the amount exchange rates deviate, on average, from the mean exchange rate in a probability distribution. A higher standard deviation would signal a greater currency risk. Economists have criticized the accuracy of standard deviation as a risk indicator for its uniform treatment of deviations, be they positive or negative, and for automatically squaring deviation values. Alternatives such as average absolute deviation and semivariance have been advanced for measuring financial risk.|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme {{develops}} emerging agribusiness {{leaders to}} help shape {{the future of}} New Zealand agribusiness and rural affairs. Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. The co-operative business model has been in existence since 1844. It is estimated that today, at least 50 % of the world's population is, in some way, affected by co-operative activity. Most of this activity is in the agricultural sector where groups of farmers have formed co-operatives. This provides them with some collective strength and security to ensure their produce is processed and marketed accordingly. The relationship between a co-operative and its members is formalised through a set of co-operative principles that outline what responsibilities members have to the cooperative, and vice versa. Co-operatives have certain requirements of their members, namely that members own and control the business equitably and they are the providers of capital. While the supporting objectives of a co-operative business model and an investor driven model are similar, the prime objectives are different. A co-operative's prime objective is to deliver benefits to members, while the investor-driven business objective is, quite simply, to deliver a return on investment of capital. Fonterra's impact on the New Zealand economy is significant. It is New Zealand's largest company, by some margin, with turnover of $NZ 12 billion, and employs 20, 500 people worldwide. Fonterra's farmers are a diverse group of people who, as individual farmers, have differing goals and objectives. They do however, have a common requirement of their co-operative; to collect, process, and market their milk. As New Zealand's largest business, and a co-operative, Fonterra should lead an initiative that will lift the profile of 'doing business' using the co-operative model. The risks that Fonterra faces, as a result of commodity price fluctuations, or <b>currency</b> <b>variances,</b> are relatively small when compared to the risks that poorly informed, nonparticipative members could place on the co-operative...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares a {{standard}} GARCH {{model with a}} Constant Elasticity of Variance GARCH model across three major currency pairs and the S&P 500 index. We discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using a more sophisticated model designed to estimate the variance of variance instead of assuming it to be a linear function of the conditional variance. The current stochastic volatility and GARCH analogues rest upon this linear assumption. We are able to confirm through empirical estimation that for equity returns and for some <b>currency</b> crosses the <b>variance</b> of variance does in fact grow at a rate which exceeds the standard linear expectations...|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} trading- versus nontrading-period {{variance}} ratios in weather-sensitive markets {{are lower than}} those in the equity market and higher {{than those in the}} <b>currency</b> market. The <b>variance</b> ratios are also substantially lower during periods of the year when prices are most sensitive to the weather. Moreover, the comovement of returns and volatilities for related commodities is stronger during the weather-sensitive season, largely due to stronger comovement during nontrading periods. These results are consistent with a strong link between prices and public information flow and cannot be explained by pricing errors or changes in trading activity.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the welfare properties of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes in a two-country, dynamic, infinite-horizon model with agents optimizing {{in an environment}} of uncertainty created by monetary shocks. The optimal exchange rate regime may depend on whether prices are set in the currency of producers or the currency of consumers. When prices are set in consumers' <b>currency,</b> the <b>variance</b> of home consumption is not influenced by foreign monetary variance under floating exchange rates, while there is transmission of foreign disturbances under floating rates if prices are set in producers' currencies, or under fixed exchange rates. An important feature of the model is the exchange rate regime affects not just the variance of consumption and output, but also their average levels. When prices are set in producer's currency, as in the traditional framework, we find that there is a trade-off between floating and fixed exchange rates. Exchange rate adjustment under floating rates allows for a lower variance of consumption, but exchange rate volatility itself leads to a lower average level of consumption. When prices are set in consumer's currency, floating exchange rates always dominate fixed exchange rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Stock return {{volatility}} co-moves with credit spreads on corporate bonds {{of the same}} company. Based on the similarity between corporate borrowing decisions and government budget constraints, and the associated analogy between stock for a corporate company and fiat money for a sovereign country, we conjecture that for small open economies with potential credit issues, the currency {{return volatility}} co-moves with the credit spread on the countryâ€™s sovereign debt. We analyze the conjectured relation using data on currency options and sovereign credit default swap spreads on two emerging market countries: Mexico and Brazil. The analysis confirms our conjecture: Credit spreads and currency option implied volatilities show strong positive contemporaneous correlation. We propose an integrated valuation framework that models the joint dynamics of <b>currency</b> return <b>variance</b> and sovereign credit risk. We model the sovereign default by a Poisson process with stochastic arrival rate. The currency price, quoted in dollar price per one unit local currency, drops by a random amount upon sovereign default. The pre-default currency price moves continuously with stochastic volatility. We specify the joint dynamics of the diffusion variance rate and the default arrival rate vi...|$|R

These results are consistent with a strong link between prices and public information flow and cannot be explained by pricing errors or changes in trading activity. A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE FINANCE LITERATURE investigates the link between information and prices. Theory suggests that prices are a function of public information and order flow (see, e. g., Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Kyle (1985), and Glosten and Milgrom (1985)). Order flow is driven by both public and private information as well as investor shocks, which may be either rational (e. g., noninformation-based liquidity trades) or irrational (e. g., trades based on noise as described by Black (1986)). Prices can deviate from fundamental value due to market microstructure, liquidity, and hedging effects, and pricing errors can arise from noise trading and the systematic underreaction or overreaction to information. Much of the empirical literature attempts to discriminate among public information, private information, market frictions, and pricing errors as sources of return volatility. Some researchers argue that observed volatility is much higher than can be explained by fundamentals, by market microstructure o...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} use of {{variance}} analysis at the highest organizational level in a big multinational corporation. In addition, this thesis analyzes the challenges companies face with variance analysis {{as well as the}} role of <b>currencies</b> in the <b>variance</b> analysis context. Because relatively {{little is known about the}} subject, an exploratory case study approach was chosen as a research method. A total of 10 interviews were conducted with the accounting experts and business unit managers of the case company in fall 2016. In addition, internal documents of the company and numerous discussions with the employees were used as empirical data. The control framework of Simons (1990) was used to analyze the case findings. In this framework variance analysis is almost exclusive seen as an operational level diagnostic control system. However, the results of this study suggest that at the highest organizational level variance analysis is not used for control. The value-adding role of variance analysis has shifted from operational-level diagnostic control system to information system that is used to help management and external stakeholders to develop knowledge about the organization. The feedback from variances is used to evaluate trends in the business and the outcomes of different strategic decisions and not in operational decision making. Variance analysis has been criticized of being a nonvalue-adding activity in the modern global and highly competitive business environment. Despite the criticism, it is still widely used in practice. This study shows why companies still use variance analysis and how the role of variance analysis has developed to meet the requirements of the changed business environment. The thesis does not deny the truthfulness of the prevalent criticism towards variance analysis. However, when variance analysis is used by senior management to evaluate the performance of a company, the criticism is not as severe as if it would be used in operational decision making. Similar observations as in this study of how companies use accounting information have been made in the accounting literature before but the results are novel in the research concerning variance analysis. However, as a case study approach is used, the results of this thesis cannot be directly generalized to all organizations. In order for the results to be generalizable, a critical mass has to develop to confirm the findings. Therefore, the study goes beyond the setting of the case by building initial hypotheses for future deductive research to test...|$|R
