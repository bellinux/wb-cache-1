40|$|Unsupplemented cattle {{offered a}} high grass {{allowance}} (18 kg (DM) /head/day), achieved 0. 97 of the DM intake {{of a positive}} control offered <b>concentrates</b> ad-libitium. At a low grass allowance (6 kg/DM/head/day), there was no effect of supplementary <b>concentrates</b> on grass intake. At a medium (12 kg/DM/head/day), and high grass allowance, supplementary <b>concentrates</b> reduced grass intake by 0. 43 and 0. 81 kg/DM respectively per kg/DM <b>concentrate</b> offered. * Supplementary <b>concentrates</b> increased complete diet digestibility even though offering supplementary <b>concentrates</b> also increased total DM intake. Complete diet digestibility was higher than the additive values of the grass and <b>concentrates.</b> This would imply that the supplementary <b>concentrates</b> increased the grass DM digestibility. * Increasing the grass allowance increased plasma urea concentration; supplementary <b>concentrates</b> increased total dietary nitrogen intake and reduced plasma urea concentration. These {{findings suggest that the}} <b>concentrate</b> supplement enabled greater utilisation by rumen micro-organisms of the degradable nitrogen supplied by the grass. * Supplementing with <b>concentrates</b> increased carcass growth by 116 g/kg <b>concentrate</b> DM eaten whereas increasing the grass allowance increased carcass growth by 38 g/kg/DM grass eaten. The carcass weight response to <b>concentrates</b> of grazing animals was twice that of animals offered <b>concentrates</b> ad-libitum which gained 57 g carcass per kg <b>concentrate</b> DM eaten. * The relationship between carcass gain (Y) (kg/day) and supplementary <b>concentrates</b> (X) (kg/day) was quadratic (P< 0. 001) and was best described by the equation: Y = - 0. 0099 X 2 + 0. 1364 X + 0. 2459 (R 2 = 0. 60). The relationship between carcass gain (Y) (kg day- 1) and grass intake (X) was also quadratic (P< 0. 01) and was best described by the equation: Y = - 43 X 2 + 275 X + 133 (R 2 = 0. 48). Although there was a much larger (double) carcass growth response to supplementary <b>concentrates</b> than to additional grass DM eaten, increasing grass intake significantly increased carcass fat scores whereas offering supplementary <b>concentrates</b> did not. This would imply that relative to <b>concentrates,</b> autumn grass led to a change in the partitioning of energy from muscle towards subcutaneous fat. * As a strategy for increasing the performance of cattle grazing the type of autumn grass used in this study, offering supplementary <b>concentrates</b> offers more scope to improve animal performance than altering grass allowance. * The carbohydrate source of the three <b>concentrates</b> formulated to differ in rate of degradability did not alter rumen fluid pH, volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration or the rate of grass DM or N degradation when grass supply was considered to be limiting or liberal. The autumn grass was apparently capable of buffering the effects of <b>concentrate</b> DM degradation rate which varied by up to two fold. * The rumen fluid parameters were more influenced by the pat-tern of grass intake than type of <b>concentrate</b> offered.

40|$|Background: Platelet {{transfusion}} {{is accompanied}} by febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions.

The number of white cells in the platelet <b>concentrates</b> is crucial to cytokine generation. Methods: This study was performed to determine whether WBC reduction in platelet <b>concentrates</b> by prestorage leukodepletion filters or inactivation by gamma radiation reduced the levels of these cytokines during storage for 3 days.
