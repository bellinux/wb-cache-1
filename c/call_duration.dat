To explore this we manipulated genetic quality of male decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) by inbreeding and measured the resting metabolic rate and total energy budget of males.

In this paper, we provide a unique, complementary analysis of cellular primary usage by analyzing a dataset collected inside a cellular network operator. One of the key aspects of our dataset is its scale – it consists of data collected over three weeks at hundreds of base stations. We dissect this data along different dimensions to characterize and model primary usage as well as understand its temporal and spatial variations. Our analysis reveals several results that are relevant if Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) approaches are to be deployed for cellular frequency bands. For instance, we find that <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> show significant deviations from the oftenused exponential distribution, which makes call-based modeling more complicated. We also show that a random walk process, which does not use <b>call</b> <b>durations,</b> can often be used for modeling the aggregate cell capacity.

50|$|Quality {{is usually}} {{measured}} by the Answer-Seizure Ratio (ASR = call attempts answered / call attempts), Post-Dial Delay (PDD) and the Average <b>Call</b> <b>Duration</b> (ACD). If the average <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> is very low, it is taken to mean that the call quality is so poor that people cannot have a conversation and hang up. This matters to calling card operators because people do not re-purchase card services that give a low ACD. In case of significant discrepancies in ACD values across available routes, the carrier shall prioritize the routes offering higher ACD. A low ASR is taken to mean that callers cannot get through {{to the other end}} and hence that the route is congested or is of low quality. The low ASR is not as bad as low ACD, because it suggests at least a proper answer supervision (i.e. correct signaling), and therefore the handover mechanism can reroute calls via other available routes. An on-line monitoring system of a quality based routing is publicly available for a demo traffic. Post-dial delay is the time from dialing the last digit to the time a caller hears ringing.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the papers}} in Key and Smith defines channel holding time as being equal to the average holding time divided by {{the average number of}} handovers per call plus one.Usually an {{exponential}} model is preferred to calculate the channel holding time for simplicity in simulations.

The exponential model may not be correctly modelling the channel holding timedistribution as other papers may try to prove, but it gives an approximation.

40|$|AbstractModern {{high-performance}} communication networks pose {{a number}} of challenging problems concerning the efficient allocation of resources to connection requests. In all-optical networks with wavelength-division multiplexing, connection requests must be assigned paths and colors (wavelengths) such that intersecting paths receive different colors, and {{the goal is to}} minimize the number of colors used. This path coloring problem is proved NP-hard for undirected and bidirected ring networks. Path coloring in undirected tree networks is shown to be equivalent to edge coloring of multigraphs, which implies a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for trees of constant degree as well as NP-hardness and an approximation algorithm with absolute approximation ratio 43 and asymptotic approximation ratio 1. 1 for trees of arbitrary degree. For bidirected trees, path coloring is shown to be NP-hard even in the binary case. A polynomial-time optimal algorithm is given for path coloring in undirected or bidirected trees with n nodes under the assumption that the number of paths touching every single node of the tree is O((logn) 1 −ε). Call scheduling is the problem of assigning paths and starting times to calls in a network with bandwidth reservation such that the maximum completion time is minimized. In the case of unit bandwidth requirements, unit edge capacities, and unit <b>call</b> <b>durations,</b> <b>call</b> scheduling is equivalent to path coloring. If either the bandwidth requirements or the <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> can be arbitrary, call scheduling is shown NP-hard for virtually every network topology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{threat of}} voice spam, {{commonly}} known as Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is a real and contemporary problem. If the problem remains unchecked then it may become as potent as email spam today. In this paper, we present two approaches to detect and prevent SPITting over the Internet. Both of our approaches {{are based on the}} anomaly detection of the distributions of selected call features (i. e., day and time of <b>calling,</b> <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> etc.). The first approach uses Maha-lanobis Distance as a summarization tool and it is able to reliably detect individual spam VoIP calls at a microscopic level. The second approach is designed to detect groups of (potentially collaborating) VoIP spam calls at a macroscopic level. By computing entropy of <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> of groups of calls, we are able to build profile of normal calls and reliably detect the deviation from normal human call behavior that are caused by bulk spam calls. We empirically validate our VoIP spam call detec-tion approaches with real VoIP call traces obtained from a VoIP service provider network. Our experimental results show that call feature dis-tributions can be used to build a fairly general and effective anomalous call behavior detection framework...|$|R

50|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the species Pseudacris triseriata (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, P. t. maculata and P. t. triseriata, due to {{speciation}} events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type. Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.|$|E
