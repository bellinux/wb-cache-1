25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a <b>corporate</b> <b>network</b> into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E
500|$|On October 24, 2017, some {{users in}} the Russian Federation and the Ukraine {{reported}} a new ransomware attack, named [...] "Bad Rabbit", which follows a similar pattern to WannaCry and Petya by encrypting the user's file tables and then demands a BitCoin payment to decrypt them. ESET believed the ransomware to have been distributed by a bogus update to Adobe Flash software. Among agencies that were affected by the ransomware included Interfax, Odessa International Airport, Kiev Metro, and the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine. As it used <b>corporate</b> <b>network</b> structures to spread, the ransomware was also discovered in other countries, including Turkey, Germany, Poland, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Experts believed the ransomware attack was tied to the Petya attack in the Ukraine, though the only identity to the culprits are the names of characters from the Game of Thrones series embedded within the code.|$|E

40|$|The {{strategic}} role of R&D-spillovers within vertical <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> (intra-group R&D-spillovers) is neglected in the innovation theory of Industrial Organization. In a two-industry model we formalize {{the effects of}} R&D-competition between two vertical <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> on supplier-market structures, technological opportunities and on the introduction time of new products. It can be shown that lower transaction costs of organizing vertical <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> {{increase the size of}} networks and reduce the concentration on supplier-markets. This raises the level of supplier's R&D-activities and lowers the time of development. Additionally, manufacturers have incentives to strategically generate R&D-spillovers within their networks. which improve the technological opportunities of suppliers and increase manufacturers probabilities to win the R&D-competition. This kind of R&D-spillovers can explain the often observed differences of firms' technological opportunities within a given supplier-market.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{analytical}} framework is developed {{to examine the}} emergent spatial and functional reorganizations of large firms that are intimately related {{to the use of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>networks.</b> The framework is developed through a systematic analysis of the various types of relationships between information technology and corporate reorganization, and the identification of the key elements and dimensions of corporate reorganizations. It allows for specific organizational changes to be understood within the overall context of corporate reorganization in the firm, and most of all, to be easily seen as in some way related to the use of <b>corporate</b> <b>networks.</b> Unlike previous studies in which the role of space and place has mostly been marginalized, in this inquiry geography is regarded {{as an integral part of}} the development of <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>corporate</b> reorganizations. By centrally focusing on the intersections between <b>corporate</b> <b>networks,</b> large firms, and geography, I conceptualize a wide range of phenomena that are observed in real organizations, and speculate on their implications for the future form of organizations and urban and regional development. ...|$|R

30|$|Although <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> have {{extensively}} been {{analyzed in}} terms of network topology (Vitali et al. 2011 b), centrality (Takes and Heemskerk 2016) and community detection (Heemskerk and Takes 2016), few papers deal with detecting motifs in <b>corporate</b> <b>networks.</b> In Ohnishi et al. (2010), interfirm relationships based on materials and services exchanged are investigated up to size three, counting V-shaped and triangle-shaped network structures, essentially limiting the study to one-layer motifs of size three. Within the field of board interlock research some studies have attempted to look at pre-defined well-known motif like patterns such as star and pyramid configurations (Windolf and Beyer 1996) and subsequently counting their occurrence in networks of interlocks (Heinze 2004) or studying the sequences of such patterns over time (Stark and Vedres 2006).

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> in Argentina and Italy from 1913 to 1990, using an interlocking directorates technique applied to six benchmark years and the largest 25 banks and 100 non-financial companies in both countries. The descriptive statistics of the companies and directors in the sample provide input for a network connectivity analysis of the two systems, integrated with historical and structural analyses. Furthermore, this article provides the first assessment of syndics – special auditors for firms – to the network analyses. Relying on a recently established analytical framework, the authors show that the Argentine and Italian <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> exhibit different structures and evolutions over time. This research broadens the extant analytical framework by exploring how syndics contribute to <b>corporate</b> <b>networks</b> and how the interaction of macro, meso, and micro levels affects {{the evolution of}} syndicatures in the two countries. Finally, the detailed taxonomy of syndics offers evidence of companies’ selection strategies and the historical uses of syndicature as a governance mechanism...|$|R
