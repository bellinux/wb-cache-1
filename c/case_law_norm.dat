40|$|Both {{geographic}} and normative constraints restrict access to surrogate {{international human rights}} protection for those seeking a haven from serious human rights abuses. Primary among territorial restrictions has been the fall-out from the US Supreme Court’s decision in Sale v. Haitian Council Centers in which the court explicitly ruled that nothing in US statutory law, or in the 1951 Convention on Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, precluded the interdiction of Haitian refugees in international waters and their return to the country of origin without an effective interview on their protection clams. This ruling is in transparent contradiction to the general international <b>law</b> <b>norm</b> of non-refoulement according to modern scholarship and emerging <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> This paper concludes that Sale should be overturned by statute as should related pre-screening practices.

As a matter of policy, when should mistakes of noncriminal law exculpate? Should they always be treated in the same manner as an analogous mistake of fact? Sometimes? Answering these questions is a complex matter; the article identifies some relevant factors. Conversely, when should a mistake of noncriminal law inculpate, creating attempt liability? In the parallel scenario of factually impossible attempts, liability is frequently imposed. But I suggest caution before recognizing attempt liability here. Classifying a mistake as one of criminal or noncriminal law is especially difficult in three scenarios: the incorporation of a civil schedule of prohibited items within a criminal law, the criminalization of acts that violate a civil regulatory prohibition, and criminal law terms whose meaning draws from both criminal law and civil law. A final section questions the view that we should always give symmetrical treatment to (1) exculpatory mistake and ignorance (precluding liability for the completed crime) and (2) inculpatory mistake and ignorance (producing liability for the attempt). This view is especially implausible when applied to categories of mens rea other than belief or knowledge. Ignorance, for example, will often exculpate, but it will rarely inculpate...|$|R

50|$|Ukraine also {{lacks the}} {{procedure}} for correcting court errors. The analysis of the Supreme Court of Ukraine practices and of the respective procedural law leads one to the following conclusions. The competences vested in the Supreme Court of Ukraine attempt to combine the control over norms with court protection in the criminal cases by means of court rulings’ revision. However, the legal levers available to the Supreme Court are not enough for the exercising of the said competences. The use of the means with subjective components (arbitrary application of the <b>norms</b> of material <b>law)</b> and the institute of cases’ submission to the SC substantially complicated practical exercising of public right to court protection and decreased its efficiency. Removing some of the SC competences (i.e. the use of procedural <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> and some portion of material <b>law</b> <b>norms)</b> is contrary to logic and the principles of legal determination and constitutional status of the SC. These developments made the SC competences “partial”, while the use of authority to revise the procedural <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> led to incapacity in fulfilling the competences the SC enjoys as judicial entity. Therefore, {{the essence of the}} SC competences does not fully agree with its constitutional status and rights of public to court protection guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the legal challenges arising {{in the context}} of the ‘fragmentation or unity of public international law’. The question of the so-called fragmentation of public international law mainly refers to the phenomenon of diversification and expansion of public international law. In recent years, the proliferation of international bodies entrusted with the task of monitoring States’ compliance with their international obligations has increased the possibility of conflicting interpretations of similar or identical rules of international law. In this context, it is claimed that international courts with limited ratione materiae and personae jurisdiction fragment international law and threaten its unity. This thesis examines the question of the fragmentation of public international law from the perspective of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In the view of the present author, the European Court has developed the autonomous interpretative principle of taking cognisance of public international <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> when interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ECtHR employs this interpretative principle in a fashion that is distinct from other seminal interpretative principles, namely the so-called comparative interpretation, the dynamic interpretation and the principle of effectiveness. Furthermore, this thesis provides in depth analysis of the ECtHR’s legal reasoning. It reaches conclusions on the type of public international <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> that the ECtHR takes into account and the conditions a norm must satisfy to qualify as ‘relevant’ and ‘applicable in the relations between the parties’. This thesis also provides an overall assessment of the different uses of public international <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> in the ECtHR’s reasoning, when expanding or restricting the scope of the rights and freedoms of the ECHR. It stresses the importance of the ECtHR’s practice of relying upon public international <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> in order to (re-) interpret the ECHR and overrule its previous case-law. Finally, this thesis explores the boundaries that should be set to restrict the impact of other relevant public international <b>law</b> <b>norms</b> on the construction of the ECHR. The study concludes that, in principle, the ECtHR does not threaten the unity of international law, but reads the ECHR harmoniously to public international law. The findings of this thesis also furnish evidence that the ECtHR has competence to pronounce on questions relating to international law and that, on certain occasions, it develops and enriches the scope and content of international law.

By empirically studying how the Court uses its own <b>case</b> <b>law</b> as a source of law, we explore the correlation between, on the one hand, the characteristics of a CJEU case— type of action, actors involved, and area of law—and, on the other hand, the judgment’s “embeddedness” in previous <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and value as a precedent in subsequent cases.

40|$|Abstract. In a <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> regime Courts {{have more}} {{flexibility}} {{than in a}} Statute Law regime. Since Statutes are inevitably incomplete, this confers an advantage to the <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> regime over the Statute Law one. However, all Courts rule ex-post, after most economic decisions are already taken. Therefore, the advantage of flexibility for <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> is unavoidably paired {{with the potential for}} time-inconsistency. Under <b>Case</b> <b>Law,</b> Courts may be tempted to behave myopically and neglect ex-ante welfare because, ex-post, this may afford extra gains from trade for the parties currently in Court. The temptation to behave myopically is traded off against the effect of a Court’s ruling, as a precedent, on the rulings of future Courts. When <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> matures this temptation prevails and <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> Courts succumb to the time-inconsistency problem. Statute Law, on the other hand pairs the lack of flexibility with the ability to commit in advance to a given (forward looking) rule. This solves the time-inconsistency problem afflicting the <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> Courts. We conclude that when the nature of the legal envi-ronment is sufficiently heterogeneous and/or changes sufficiently often, the <b>Case</b> <b>Law</b> regime is superior: flexibility is the prevailing concern. By the same token, when the legal environment is sufficiently homogeneous and/or does not change very often, the Statute Law regime dominates: the ability to overcome the time-inconsistency problem is the dominant consideration...|$|R
40|$|A perverse side-effect of our {{interconnected}} {{world is}} that also crime crosses more and more borders. As a result, judicial cooperation in criminal matters is crucial before and after a criminal sentence. The increased global connectivity also gave rise to new paradigms in social sciences. As such, the paradigm of cosmopolitanism {{has been researched extensively}} in social sciences but has been largely neglected in criminology. By analyzing <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> European detention <b>norms</b> and EU legal instruments the submission critically evaluates cosmopolitanism in the area of EU judicial cooperation in criminal matters and more specifically to the transfer of prisoners. Cosmopolitanism is perfectly reflected in the mutual recognition principle as the cornerstone to develop the EU area of freedom, security and justice, based on notions of equivalence and trust. This principle is justified because every member state signed the European Convention of Human Rights and is a party of the EU Charter on Human Rights. On the other hand, reality revealed that mutual recognition is not absolute and mutual trust cannot be blind. An IRCP study, published in 2011, highlighted the various and often detrimental material prison conditions in different member states. These variances undermine the assumed mutual trust between member states although European detention norms - such as the European Prison Rules and CPT reports’ already exist. These norms aren’t legally binding and are still considered as “soft law”, simultaneously they gain importance due to increased reference in the ECtHR judgments. The cosmopolitan outlook by the member states related to the transfer of prisoners is in this submission highlighted as being both problematic and promising. Hereby it appears as if the EU rhetoric being a “unity in diversity”, by applying mutual recognition, is dominantly used to accommodate member states purposes rather than giving a central role to the individual...|$|R
40|$|Is the {{application}} of international law unjust in prominent <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of the Court of Justice of the European Union? In answering this question the thesis explains that Justice comprises both legal certainty, which seeks clear rules to govern future conduct, and [j]ustice, which seeks the correct outcome in an individual case. There is a frequent tension between these aims. Moreover, {{there is not an}} accepted model of Justice which resolves how to balance legal certainty and justice. Any loss in one aspect may be justified by a gain in the other. On this basis the analysis of legal certainty and justice is divided in the thesis. Legal certainty can be measured objectively, but the appropriate level of legal certainty which any legal system should achieve is contested. It is argued that legal certainty in internal <b>case</b> <b>law</b> - <b>case</b> <b>law</b> not applying international law - is the appropriate measure of legal certainty in external <b>case</b> <b>law</b> - <b>case</b> <b>law</b> applying international treaty and customary international law. This is implicit in scholarship and has been expressly approved by the Court itself. The thesis will identify that external <b>case</b> <b>law</b> is les certain than internal <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> [j]ustice cannot be measured objectively and is contested in its substantive or 'thick' form. However, formal, or 'thin' justice, which is encapsulated in the obligation to treat like cases alike and unalike cases unalike to the extent of their unalikeness, is widely accepted. Accordingly, the thesis compares internal <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> which reveals strong and consistent conceptions of justice across EU <b>law,</b> to external <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> It identifies differing justice conceptions in external as copared to internal <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> Based on a 'thin' model of justice these justice modifications must be accounted for based on the context of applying international law; the extent of the unalikeness. It will be identified that unalikeness in the context of applying international law cannot account for the justice modifications in external <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and a fortiori the lower levels of legal certainty. Accordingly, this thesis endeavours to show that {{the application}} of international <b>law</b> in prominent <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of the Court of Justice of the European Union in unjust...|$|R
