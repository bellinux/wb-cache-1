5|$|On June 1, a {{tropical}} depression formed off western Cuba from an organized <b>cloud</b> <b>system.</b> It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category1 hurricane, {{one of the}} earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into {{a tropical}} storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto {{is an example of a}} storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never make landfall, which is an unusual event.|$|E

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has been}} established as a technology for providing needs-orientated and use-dependent IT resources, which now are being used more frequently for business information systems. Particularly in terms of integration of decentralized information <b>systems,</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> are providing a stable solution approach. Still, data security {{is one of the}} biggest challenges when using <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> and a main reason why many companies avoid using cloud services. The question we are facing is how <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> for integration of decentralized information systems have to be designed, in terms of technology and organization, so that privacy laws of the cloud user can be guaranteed. This contribution summarizes the results of a system comparison of decentralized <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> in social networks, a requirements analysis based on a literature analysis, and a model for organizational levels of <b>cloud</b> <b>systems,</b> derived from the requirements analysis.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} time scales of deep clouds, diurnal {{variation}} {{is found to}} be prominent over the tropics. The present study examines the diurnal variation in the number and area cover associated with the <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> over the tropical Indian region using INSAT- 1 B pixel data. Three periods, namely, April-May 1988, July-August 1988, and January-February 1989 are considered. The dependence of diurnal characteristics on the temperature threshold, life duration and size of <b>cloud</b> <b>systems,</b> and land-sea contrast has been explored. The diurnal characteristics of <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> living for more than a day have been studied for the first time. It is shown that <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit strong diurnal dependence at the coldest temperature threshold used (201 K). Also, the diurnal variation is more for larger <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> and for longer living systems. In general,more deep cloud activity is found from the satellite data during the predawn and early morning hours. Precipitation is enhanced during morning to early noon hours. Further, using data from a recent field experiment, clear evidence of diurnal variation in precipitation over the Bay of Bengal is also presented...|$|R
40|$|The cloud is {{a modern}} {{computing}} paradigm {{with the ability to}} support a business model by providing multi-tenancy, scalability, elasticity, pay as you go and self-provisioning of resources by using broad network access. Yet, <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> are mostly bounded to single domains, and collaboration among different <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> is an active area of research. Over time, such collaboration schemas are becoming of vital importance since they allow companies to diversify their services on multiple <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> to increase both uptime and usage of services. The existence of an efficient management process for the enforcement of security policies among the participating <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> would facilitate the adoption of multi-domain <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> An important issue in collaborative environments is secure inter-operation. Stemmed from the absence of relevant work in the area of cloud computing, we define a model checking technique that {{can be used as a}} management service/tool for the verification of multi-domain cloud policies. Our proposal is based on NIST's (National Institute of Standards and Technology) generic model checking technique and has been enriched with RBAC reasoning. Current approaches, in Grid systems, are capable of verifying and detect only conflicts and redundancies between two policies. However, the latter cannot overcome the risk of privileged user access in multi-domain <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we provide the formal definition of the proposed technique and security properties that have to be verified in multi-domain <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, an evaluation of the technique through a series of performance tests is provided. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
500|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on July11. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, and finally began to show consistent evidence of a <b>cloud</b> <b>system</b> center. Deep convection associated with the wave became concentrated on satellite images on July17, and it is estimated that the disturbance became Tropical Depression Five around 0600UTC on that day while centered about [...] east of Barbados. The tropical depression moved west-northwestward and started showing signs of falling apart on July18. Early on the following day, the depression degenerated into a tropical wave. Recon observations before the storm fell apart suggested that it may have briefly reached tropical storm strength. The tropical wave continued westward without regenerating and lost its identity on July23 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, a {{tropical}} wave entered the eastern Pacific. An area of convection developed {{when it was}} [...] west of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Peninsula. A trough axis extended southward from the low {{to the west of the}} convection. By September 15, the area of disturbed weather included some convective bands. The organization of the convection improved and the <b>cloud</b> <b>system</b> became Tropical Depression Eleven-E the next day. The trough that was near the depression moved the cyclone to the north-northwest and during that period it strengthened and became Tropical Storm Ignacio, all on the same day. With time, the influence of the trough over Tropical Storm Ignacio diminished. The track of the tropical storm transcribed a small clockwise loop, and Ignacio reached the northernmost point of the loop on September 17. The storm was centered about 28miles (45km) offshore and was near its peak intensity, [...] Further intensification was precluded by the storm's proximity to land and by shear associated with the upper level low near the Baja California peninsula. As Ignacio turned toward the east, its forward motion slowed. When the storm began moving to the south, it lost its identity very rapidly. Ignacio weakened to depression status and dissipated six hours later. The remnants of Ignacio moved toward the west-southwest over the next two days.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cloud {{computing}} and the IoT are converging ever stronger, {{enabling the}} proliferation of diverse large-scale IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> Such novel IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> offer numerous advantages for the variety of involved stakeholders. However, due to scale, complexity, and inher-ent geographical distribution of IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems,</b> governing new IoT cloud resources and capabilities poses numerous challenges. In this paper, we introduce GovOps – a novel approach and a conceptual model for cloud-based, dynamic governance of software-defined IoT cloud sys-tems. By introducing a suitable GovOps reference model and a dedi-cated GovOps manager, it simplifies realizing governance processes and enables performing custom governance tasks more efficiently in practice. We introduce real-world case studies in the building automation and vehicle management domains, to illustrate the main aspects and prin-ciples of our approach to governance of large-scale software-defined IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{resource}} scaling is {{one advantage}} of <b>Cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Cloud</b> <b>systems</b> are able to scale the number of physical machines depending on user requests. Therefore, accurate request prediction brings a great improvement in Cloud systems' performance. If we can make accurate requests prediction, the appropriate number of physical machines that can accommodate predicted amount of requests can be activated and <b>Cloud</b> <b>systems</b> will save more energy by preventing excessive activation of physical machines. Also, <b>Cloud</b> <b>systems</b> can implement advanced load distribution with accurate requests prediction. We propose an algorithm that predicts a probability distribution parameters of requests for each time interval.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{version of}} the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) Model is used to simulate convective systems that developed in various geographic locations. Observed large-scale advective tendencies for potential temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, and horizontal momentum derived from field campaigns are used as the main forcing. By examining the surface energy budgets, the model {{results show that the}} two largest terms are net condensation (heating/drying) and imposed large-scale forcing (cooling/moistening) for tropical oceanic cases. These two terms arc opposite in sign, however. The contributions by net radiation and latent heat flux to the net condensation vary in these tropical cases, however. For <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> that developed over the South China Sea and eastern Atlantic, net radiation (cooling) accounts for about 20 % or more of the net condensation. However, short-wave heating and long-wave cooling are in balance with each other for <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> over the West Pacific region such that the net radiation is very small. This is due to the thick anvil clouds simulated in the <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> over the Pacific region. Large-scale cooling exceeds large-scale moistening in the Pacific and Atlantic cases. For <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> over the South China Sea, however, there is more large-scale moistening than cooling even though the <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> developed in a very moist environment. though For three <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> that developed over a mid-latitude continent, the net radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes play a much more important role. This means the accurate measurement of surface fluxes and radiation is crucial for simulating these mid-latitude cases...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} development of IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems,</b> existing research and industry have produced numerous infrastructure, platform and software services as well as frameworks and tools [1 – 6]. These advances set a cornerstone for proliferation of (unified) IoT cloud platforms and infrastructures, which offer a myriad of IoT cloud capabilities and resources. Lately, we have been exploring software defined approaches and introduced a design methodology {{and a set of}} software defined principles for IoT cloud [7] in {{order to facilitate}} utility-oriented delivery of the IoT cloud resources, provide elasticity support for the IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> and enable automated and logically centralized provisioning of the geographically distributed IoT cloud infrastructure. Generally, the software-defined IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> abstract from low-level resources (e.g., hardware) and enable their programmatic management through well-defined APIs. They allow for refactoring the underlying IoT cloud infrastructure into finer-grained resource components whose functionality can be (re)defined in software, e.g., applications, thus enabling more efficient resource utilization and simplifying management of the IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> However, most of the contemporary approaches dealing with IoT cloud are intended for platform/infrastructure providers and operations managers. Therefore, from the developer’s perspective {{there is a lack of}} structured, holistic approach to support development of the IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems</b> and applications.
