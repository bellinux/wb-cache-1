5|$|The <b>companion</b> {{which is}} {{supposed}} to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass <b>companion.</b> The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is to be expected, considering a <b>companion</b> is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a <b>companion,</b> but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of <b>companion</b> for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E

40|$|We perform N-body {{simulations}} of young triple systems {{consisting of two}} low-mass <b>companions</b> orbiting around a significantly more massive primary. We find that, when the orbits of the <b>companions</b> are coplanar and not too widely separated, {{the chance of a}} collision between the two <b>companions</b> can be as high as 20 per cent. Collisions between one of the <b>companions</b> (always the less massive) and the primary can also occur in systems with unequal-mass <b>companions.</b> The chance of collisions is a few per cent in systems with more realistic initial conditions, such as with slightly non-coplanar orbits and unequal-mass <b>companions.</b> If the <b>companions</b> start widely separated then collision are very rare except in some cases when the total mass of the <b>companions</b> is large. We suggest that collisions between members of young multiple systems may explain some unusual young multiple systems such as apparently non-coeval <b>companions.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any <b>companion</b> of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a <b>companion</b> having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed <b>companion.</b> More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this <b>companion,</b> but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E

5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled.

5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) <b>companion,</b> who can assist in combat.
