40|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{concepts}} currently is the use of stem cells in the regenerative therapy which replaces the lost or dysfunctional part in a human body. In order for a patient to benefit from such therapies, the stem cell source should be always made available. Therefore, it is important to preserve these cells so that they are always available for treatments. Cryopreservation is one of the important methods to preserve cells and tissues where it can be used for the recovery of damaged tissues and organs. Cryopreservation of stem cells is mainly to minimize any form of damage to biological materials at very low temperatures while freezing and also during storage. This issue can be addressed {{with the addition of a}} <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent.</b> Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a common <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent</b> which is a polar compound originally created for the use as a solvent. However the use of DMSO may result in the toxicity of cells. The bird’s nest or also known as edible bird’s nest (EBN) is a health food with many traditional medicinal properties. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficiency of EBN to act as a <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent,</b> to evaluate the differentiation ability to express the following lineages; osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic after cryopreservation with the respective cryoprotectants (10...|$|E

In this study we investigated the osmotic tolerance limits of the bovine oocyte oolemma and metaphase II spindle. Oocytes were exposed to solutions (75 – 3000 milliosmolal) for 10 min, then cultured for 1 h. Oolemma integrity was assessed visually prior to fixation. The structure of the metaphase II spindle was as-sessed using immunocytochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of spindle disruption as a function of solution osmolality. Few cells experienced oolemma rup-ture or spindle disorganization between 200 and 1800 milliosmolal. Higher levels of osmotic stress caused rup-ture of the oolemma and disruption of the spindle structure.

40|$|Cryopreservation is {{a process}} that {{preserves}} organelles, cells, tissues, or any other biological constructs by cooling the samples to very low temperatures. The responses of living cells to ice formation are of theoretical interest and practical relevance. Stem cells and other viable tissues, which have great potential for use in basic research as well as for many medical applications, cannot be stored with simple cooling or freezing for a long time because ice crystal formation, osmotic shock, and membrane damage during freezing and thawing will cause cell death. The successful cryopreservation of cells and tissues has been gradually increasing in recent years, with the use of <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agents</b> and temperature control equipment. Continuous understanding of the physical and chemical properties that occur in the freezing and thawing cycle will be necessary for the successful cryopreservation of cells or tissues and their clinical applications. In this review, we briefly address representative cryopreservation processes, such as slow freezing and vitrification, and the available <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agents.</b> In addition, some adverse effects of cryopreservation are mentioned...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{optimise}} methods of cryopreserving human articular cartilage (AC) tissue for {{the isolation of}} late chondrocytes. Human AC specimens from osteoarthritis patients who had undergone total knee replacement were used to optimise the chondrocyte isolation process and the choice of <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent</b> (CPA). For AC tissue cryopreservation, intact cored cartilage discs (5 mm diameter) and diced cartilage (0. 2 - 1 mm cubes) from the same sized discs were step cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen for up to 48 h before chondrocyte isolation and in vitro assay of cell viability and proliferative potential. The results showed that 10 % dimethyl sulphoxide in 90 % foetal bovine serum was a successful CPA for chondrocyte cryopreservation. Compared with intact cored discs, dicing of AC tissue into 0. 2 - 1 mm cubes significantly increased the viability and proliferative capacity of surviving chondrocytes after cryopreservation. In situ cross-section imaging using focused ion beam microscopy revealed that dicing of cored AC discs into small cubes reduced the cryo-damage to cartilage tissue matrix. In conclusion, modification of appropriate factors, such as {{the size of the}} tissue, <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent,</b> and isolation protocol, can allow successful isolation of viable chondrocytes with high proliferative capacity from cryopreserved human articular cartilage tissue. Further studies are required to determine whether these cells may retain cartilage differentiation capacity and provide sufficient chondrocytes for use as implants in clinical applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} in vitro the viability of isolated and non-isolated pulpal tissue of immature third molars after cryopreservation. This study was divided in three different experiments. Experiment 1 : Pulpal tissue isolated from 19 third molars was divided in horizontal segments. Each segment was cultured separately in order to evaluate whether differences in growth capacity within the tissue could be found. Experiment 2 : Pulpal tissue isolated from 27 third molars was divided in a mesial and a distal part. One part was cryopreserved before culturing, the other part was cultured immediately. Growth capacity of cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved tissue was evaluated and compared. Experiment 3 : 43 third molars were cryopreserved. After thawing, the dimension of the apical foramen was measured and the pulp was isolated and segmented horizontally. The different parts were cultured and growth capacity was evaluated and compared. Results of experiment 1 and 2 showed no significant difference in growth capacity between fibroblasts originating from different pulpal segments of the same tooth without cryopreservation and between fibroblasts originating from cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved isolated pulpal tissue. In experiment 3 it was demonstrated that the dimension of the apical foramen and pulpal viability after cryopreservation are positively correlated. A minimum dimension of 9. 42 mm(2) enables the <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent</b> to penetrate sufficiently and to protect the pulpal tissue from apex to crown.

Since most of the optimum DMSO concentrations for the different cells and tissues cryopreservations are similar, we predict the reason for the optimum DMSO concentration by measuring the thermodynamic properties of culture medium including DMSO and by observing the toxicity of DMSO on the neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. The melting point measurements suggest that the larger DMSO concentration medium has lower melting points, which would prevent the cell damage by ice reformation during the thawing process.

40|$|Cryopreservation is a {{practical}} method for maintaining {{a broad range of}} microalgae over long periods of time. The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) currently successfully maintains over 1300 strains of algae under cryopreservation, although many other strains at UTEX cannot yet be cryopreserved or else survive with very low viability. The ability of a culture of microalgae to survive freezing and thawing is strongly dependent on the conditions under which it is frozen, including the nature and concentration of a <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent</b> added to the algal culture prior to freezing. Experiments using the unicellular microalga Chlorococcum texanum Archibald et Bold (UTEX # 1788), demonstrate that methanol is transported across the plasma membrane faster than water, while dimethyl sulfoxide is transported more slowly than water. These differences cause very different volumetric excursions of algal cells in response to the added <b>cryoprotective</b> <b>agent.</b> This may help explain why different algae respond differently to methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, although both are widely used as cryoprotective agents. An often overlooked parameter during cryopreservation of algae is the culture density at the time of freezing. Studies using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dangeard (UTEX # 89) demonstrate that low culture density during freezing is important for high viability after thawing from liquid nitrogen. The low viability of C. reinhardtii cultures cryopreserved at high cell density is caused by an unidentified water-soluble substance that is released into the medium from cells that are killed during cryopreservation. At sufficiently high concentration the substance is lethal to other cells in the medium when the cryopreserved culture is thawed. The inhibitory substance is small, water soluble and heat-stable, but its release from cells is prevented by heat-denaturing the algal cells prior to their freezing and thawing...|$|E

Cryoprotectants levels do not peak in northern populations until 4 - 6 weeks after first frost. In southern populations the accumulation profile is characterized by a high initial rate of synthesis, a protective overshoot and pronounced seasonal fluctuations. The relative survival advantages of each strategy are discusse...|$|R
