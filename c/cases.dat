5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated <b>cases,</b> but may also occur in epidemics. Many <b>cases</b> of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 <b>cases</b> reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 <b>cases</b> reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 <b>cases</b> reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all <b>cases</b> attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to poison control centers.
