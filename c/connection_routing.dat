40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} packet scheduling in a network with small router buffers. The objective {{is to provide a}} statistical bound on the worst-case packet loss rate for a traffic aggregate (<b>connection)</b> <b>routed</b> along any network path, given a maximum permissible link utilization (load). This problem is argued to be of interest in networks providing statistical loss-rate guarantees to ingress–egress connections with fixed bandwidth demands. We introduce a scheduling algorithm for networks using perpacket transmission reservation. Reservations allow loss guarantees at the aggregate level to hold for individual flows within the aggregate. The algorithm employs randomization and traffic regulation at the ingress, and batch local scheduling at the links. It ensures that a large fraction of packets from each connection are consistently subject to small loss probability at every link. These packets are therefore likely to survive long paths. To obtain the desired loss-rate bound, we analyze the performance of the algorithm under global routing and bandwidth allocation scenarios that maximize the loss rate of a <b>connection</b> <b>routed</b> along an arbitrary network path. We compare the bound to that obtained using the scheduling algorithm that combines the FCFS service discipline and the drop-tail policy. We find that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the constraints on link utilization and path length necessary to achieve strong loss-rate guarantees...|$|R

However, content has remained, for the most part, separate from connection and routing. This paper finds that changes in the cost of caching, bandwidth and more standardized technical knowledge led cable companies toward the integrated approach favored by telephone companies, and changes in regulation facilitated integrated provision by telephone companies.

40|$|Fast {{restoration}} is {{an important}} feature of both MPLS and optical networks. The main mechanism for achieving fast restoration is by locally routing around failures using pre-setup detour paths. Signaling and routing protocol extensions to implement this local bypass ability are currently being standardized. To make use of this ability, dynamic schemes that jointly route primary paths and all link detours for links used by the primary paths have been previously proposed. These schemes also permit sharing of reserved restoration capacity for achieving efficiency. However, this joint computation places a significantly larger computational load on the network elements than that imposed by the shortest path computation variants typically used for unprotected network <b>connection</b> <b>routing.</b> In this paper, we propose a new scheme that is operationally much simpler, shares capacity used for restoration, and permits the network to route the primary paths {{in a manner that}} is oblivious to restoration needs. Restoration of all carried traffic is guaranteed by a new link capacity partitioning scheme that maximizes the working capacity of the network without requiring any knowledge of the traffic that will be imposed on the network. Being traffic independent for a priori link capacity partitioning and being oblivious to restoration needs for on-line network routing makes this scheme operationally simple and desirable in the sense of placing no additional routing load on the constrained computing resources at the network nodes. To compute the link capacity partitions, we develop a fast combinatorial algorithm that uses only iterative shortest path computations, and is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), i. e., it achieves a (1 + #) -factor approximation for any #> 0 and ru [...] ...|$|E
