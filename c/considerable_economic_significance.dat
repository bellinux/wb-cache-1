This lake is of <b>considerable</b> cultural and <b>economic</b> <b>significance</b> as it supports a commercially important walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery that has experienced large fluctuations since the 1940 s, {{the causes of}} which are poorly understood. Here we used paleolimnology to describe long-term environmental changes in the lake that {{may have contributed to}} recent collapses in walleye populations. The sub-fossil remains of diatoms and chironomids were used to assess changes in turbidity, nutrients, and oxygen levels, all of which are important to walleye. Minimal changes have occurred in diatom assemblages from the early 1920 s to present, suggesting that turbidity and nutrients have not changed markedly in the lake. Hypoxia-tolerant chironomid taxa were found throughout the sediment record, and our modern water chemistry showed that oxygen levels were supersaturated in the summer, but close to the lower tolerance limit of walleye in winter. An increase in sedimentary chlorophyll-a since ~ 1940 suggests Tathlina Lake is affected by recent climate warming. Our findings indicate that walleye populations are likely regularly exposed to hypoxic winter conditions, which may increase the sensitivity of the population to other interacting stressors that occur with recent climate warming. Long-term records of environmental change in large, shallow northern lakes are rare, and paleolimnology provides a framework to reconstruct missing monitoring data, especially in lakes that are economically and culturally important to northern communities...|$|R

40|$|Nutritional ecology {{has been}} linked to crop raiding {{behavior}} in a number of wildlife taxa. Here our goal is to explore the role nutrition plays in cacao crop raiding by Tonkean macaques Macaca tonkeana in Sulawesi, Indonesia. From June – Sept 2008 we collected fruit samples from 13 species known to be important Tonkean macaque foods and compared their nutritional value to that of cacao Theobroma cacao, an important cash crop in Sulawesi. Cacao pulp was significantly lower in protein, but lower in dietary fiber, and higher in digestible carbohydrates and energy content compared to forest fruits. These findings, combined with the fact that cacao fruits are spatially concentrated and available throughout the year, likely explain why Tonkean macaques are attracted to this cultivated resource. We use these data along with published feeding ecology data to propose strategies to minimize human-macaque conflict. Namely, we recommend the deliberate protection of Elmerillila tsiampaccca, Ficus spp. and Arenga pinnata, fruit species known to be regularly consumed and of considerable nutritional value. We also identify the A. pinnata palm as a potential buffer resource to curb cacao crop raiding by macaques. Cacao is a hard-to-process food because the pods have a thick outer skin that encases the seeds and pulp. Aren palm fruit, although lower in digestibility, is easier-to-process, higher in protein, and also available year round. In addition, because the palm has <b>considerable</b> cultural and <b>economic</b> <b>significance</b> for local people, the strategy of planting Aren palm in a buffer corridor is likely to garner local community support [Current Zoology 59 (2) : 160 – 169, 2013]...|$|R

We investigated current uses of morels in Alaska, the potential for and constraints to development of an Alaska morel industry and potential resource management and business development implications. We found that the morel mushroom industry in Alaska is small with few morel harvesters. Morels are harvested for personal and commercial use. Commercial morel harvesting is minimal due to the inaccessibility and unreliable production of morels and the long distances to markets. Permits are rarely issued by state or federal land managers for morel harvesting. The high capital investment for buyers, delayed return on the investment, need for direct product-marketing and creative marketing skills and an inconsistent supply of morels are prominent reasons there are not more businesses involved in an Alaska morel industry. Alaska appears to be best suited for a dried morel industry and a limited fresh morel market near cities and in local communities {{where there is a}} demand in local restaurants. Dried morels from Alaska could be marketed creatively and developed as a small cottage industry that capitalizes on the existing unique opportunities in Alaska such as wild food production, tourism and organic and Alaska Native product marketing. ...|$|E

Due to the increase in use of jack-ups in harsher environments, analysis techniques assuming quasi-static and linear structural behaviour have had to be reassessed. This thesis is concerned with non-linear dynamic analysis methods appropriate for a jack-up assessment. Jack-up modelling requires realistic representation of the structure, the foundations and the environmental loading, together with the implementation of appropriate dynamic analysis algorithms. Techniques for each of these aspects of jack-up analysis are reviewed and the implementation of several of the methods in an advanced plane frame analysis program called JAKUP is described. Geometric non-linearity in the structure and work hardening plasticity at the foundations are accounted for in the program. Test cases are presented to verify the implementation of the methods and then some illustrative plane frame quasi-static and dynamic analyses are described. These simple models highlight the importance of accounting for dynamic motions in a jack-up analysis. For the quasi-static analyses, the assumption of pinned footing behaviour is seen to always result in the most conservative displacement and moment predictions. However, the analyses show that this is not always the case when dynamic amplification is accounted for...|$|E

Prior to the present study, the mechanism by which such compounds inhibited growth of beer-spoilage {{lactic acid bacteria}} was unknown. A range of hop compounds (colupulone, (-) -humulone, (-) -cohumulone) and hop-derived compounds (trans-isohumulone, trans-isocohumulone, trans-humulinic acid, dehydrated humulinic acid) was prepared and analysed using several spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR spectrometry; mass spectroscopy; 1 H-NMR f 13 C-NMR spectroscopy). The ability of these weak acids to ionise in solution was studied. The lack of agreement between pKa values measured using potentiometric, conductimetric, spectroscopic and solubility methods suggests that, in aqueous solution, the compounds formed covalent hydrates. Antibacterial activity of the compounds against Lactobacillus brevis IFO 3960 was pH-dependent: the undissociated form of each compound was the active antibacterial moiety and the ionised form had little activity. The antibacterial activity of the undissociated forms {{of each of the}} compounds was similar.

40|$|Early-age cracking, {{which occurs}} {{during the first}} several hours after casting of the {{concrete}}, is of <b>considerable</b> <b>economic</b> <b>significance</b> in the concrete construction industry. It can have serious consequences in respect of the durability, strength, and aesthetics of concrete structures. This is of particular concern in those structures with high exposed surface areas, such as highway pavements, bridge decks, industrial and residential floors, wharves and parking structures. The current trend of increasing use of concrete mixes with lower water-binder ratios, lower bleed capacities, and higher contents of cement and fine materials, increases the susceptibility of concrete structures to early-age cracking, {{especially if they are}} insufficiently cured. Early-age cracking {{is the result of a}} complex interaction between many variables that change rapidly over time. Therefore, despite the significant expenditure of much research effort by earlier researchers, there remain many areas that should be investigated further. Specifically, there is currently a lack of basic understanding of suctions and their effects on the early-age cracking of concrete. There is also a serious lack of reliable data on the properties of early-age concrete, particularly those relating to its tensile behaviour. The main objective of this thesis is to address these issues. In order to achieve this, a combination of theoretical, experimental, and numerical approaches was adopted. The major contributions of the work reported in this thesis can be summarised as follows. First, the thesis unifies and clarifies the concepts underlying the equations commonly used to estimate the total, matric, and osmotic suctions, which are important for the study of the behaviour of early-age concrete, including early-age cracking. The thesis then demonstrates for the first time the negligible role of osmotic suction in early-age cracking of concrete, and thus justifies the focus of earlier researchers on matric suction only. A special test apparatus and experimental procedures were developed for the thesis that provided reliable data on the complete tensile stress-strain curves of concrete specimens at ages as early as 1. 5 h after mixing. A number of mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of concrete at these very early ages that are crucial for the study of its earlyage cracking were evaluated using these data. These include the age-dependent stressdisplacement curve, tensile strength, Young’s modulus, strain at maximum stress, characteristic length, fracture energy, and their inter-relationships. Importantly, the high fracture energy obtained, which is an order of magnitude or more greater those of its major constituents, suggests strongly that early-age cracking of concrete involves a significant zone of plastic straining or microcracking in the vicinity of the crack tip. The above findings of the thesis provide more solid scientific background to and improved theoretical understanding of the problem of early-age cracking, and hence enable a better control and minimisation of its occurrence. Parallel research was also undertaken to assess the effectiveness of two different types of admixtures purported to reduce the permeability, and hence enhance the durability of concrete, including cracked concrete. The results obtained suggest that the incorporation of an admixture characterised by hydrophobic and pore-blocking effects improves considerably the durability of concrete in respect of chloride-induced corrosion. The inclusion of an admixture characterised by crystallisation activity, however, seems to have almost no detectable effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the working career of John Ridley (1806 - 1887), and with his contributions to the flour-milling industry of South Australia, to wheat harvesting technology, and to {{the progress of the}} colony generally. Ridley emigrated to South Australia from the north of England in 1840, and remained there until early 1853. Although still a relatively young man, he then returned to England to live in semi-retirement. The following text will show that Ridley contributed substantially to the technical and economic progress of the young- colony in at least two separate ways :- (i) He built the first flour-mill in South Australia in the year 1840, and subsequently operated it as a very successful business until he left the colony in 1853. The mill was steam-driven, of substantial capacity for the time, and of <b>considerable</b> <b>economic</b> <b>significance</b> to the colony. The local flour-milling industry which grew up soon afterwards freed the colony from crippling expenditures for imported flour and other breadstuffs, thus permitting a sound local economy to be developed. During 1842 Ridley leased a second (inoperative) flourmill near Adelaide, completely refitted it, and brought it too into successful operation. As well as helping to alleviate the financial difficulties of the colony at the time, these two mills provided a timely stimulus to local wheat growing. Ridley exerted a considerable influence upon the early development of South Australia's flour-milling industry, by virtue of the high standards for efficiency, operating reliability, and sound profitability he established in his own businesses. The competitors he attracted were forced to achieve similarly high standards in order to survive. His work was thus of importance in helping to secure a sound base for the future growth of the industry. (ii) In late- 1843 Ridley invented, constructed, and demonstrated a unique mechanical harvester for gathering grain crops. This machine, later known as the "Ridley Reaper" or the "South Australian Stripper", was subsequently manufactured and used in thousands within the colony. For {{more than half a century}} the machine played a major part in stimulating wheat production in the region by providing the simplest and cheapest harvesting method in the world at that time. Ridley's invention embodied a principle of operation which was entirely novel at the time it was introduced. In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries this same principle was incorporated into the designs of many other widely used grain harvesters. Ridley's machine therefore occupies an important place in the evolution of modern grain-harvesting machinery. The first two machines (both built by Ridley) were directly responsible for averting a serious harvesting crisis in South Australia at the 1843 - 44 season. Afterwards, when ever-increasing numbers of the machines went into service, a dramatic expansion of the colony's wheat-growing industry became possible. This in turn led to the development of a large export trade in wheat, and thus to an enviable economic prosperity for the colony. Whilst there is unanimous agreement that Ridley constructed and demonstrated the first successful machine of the "Stripper" type, his claim to have also invented the principle of its operation has been disputed. John Wrathall Full, another. pioneer South Australian settler, insisted that he and not Ridley originated the fundamental principle. In fact, he directly accused Ridley of stealing his idea and putting it into practice. The resulting controversy is examined in detail, and Bull's claim shown to be falsely based. Two further points of historical interest are also made and substantiated. Firstly, the "Stripper" was the first ever harvesting machine to successfully combine the operations of gathering and threshing the grain. And secondly, Ridley's "Stripper" was the first machine in the world to substantially displace hand-methods of cereal harvesting in its region. In the light of all the above considerations, it is suggested that Ridley's machine has not received either fair or sufficient notice in the histories of agricultural technology published to date. John Ridley's importance in the story of the development of mechanical harvesting has thus been unjustly neglected. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
