40|$|<b>Dairy</b> <b>foods</b> contain complex {{nutrients}} which {{interact with}} the host. Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot digest lactose in adulthood. Such a ubiquitous trait has differential effects on humanity. The literature is reviewed to explore how the divide affects lactose handling by lactase non persistent persons. There are two basic differences in digesters. Firstly, maldigesters consume less <b>dairy</b> <b>foods,</b> and secondly, excess lactose is digested by colonic microflora. Lactose intolerance in maldigesters may occur with random lactose ingestion. However, lactose intolerance without maldigestion tends to detract from gaining {{a clear understanding of}} the mechanisms of symptoms formation and leads to confusion with regards to <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> consumption. The main consequence of intolerance is withholding <b>dairy</b> <b>foods.</b> However, regular <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> consumption by lactase non persistent people could lead to colonic adaptation by the microbiome. This process may mimic a prebiotic effect and allows lactase non persistent people to consume more <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> enhancing a favorable microbiome. This process then could lead to alterations in outcome of diseases in response to <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> in lactose maldigesters. The evidence that lactose is a selective human prebiotic is reviewed and current links between <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> and some diseases are discussed within this context.

The aim of the present paper is to describe dietary intake from <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> for Australian children aged 2 – 16 years in 2007. Secondary analysis of a quota-sampled survey using population-weighted, 1 d (24 h) dietary recall data. Australian national survey conducted from February to August 2007. Children (n 4487) aged 2 – 16 years. Most Australian children consumed <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> (84 – 98 %), with the proportion consuming tending to decrease with age and males consuming significantly more than females {{from the age of}} 4 years. Milk was the most commonly consumed <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> (58 – 88 %) and consumed in the greatest amount (243 – 384 g/d). Most children consumed regular-fat dairy products. The contribution of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> to total energy intake decreased with age; from 22 % of total energy at age 2 – 3 years to 11 % at age 14 – 16 years. This trend was similar for all nutrients analysed. <b>Dairy</b> <b>food</b> intake peaked between 06. 00 and 10. 00 hours (typical breakfast hours) corresponding with the peak in dairy Ca intake. Australian children (older than 4 years) did not reach recommendations for <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> intake, consuming ≤ 2 servings. The under-consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> by Australian children has important implications for intake of key nutrients and should be addressed by multiple strategies.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{data about}} the role of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> in body weight management, as a physiological explanation are shown in this paper. There is accumulating evidence about inverse association between body weight and dairy intake. Research showed that obese individuals consume fewer dairies than normal weight people. Also three servings of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> per day in a reduced calorie diet may help accelerate body fat loss when compared to a calorie-restricted diet low in <b>dairy</b> <b>foods.</b> Calcium plays the main role and is present in great amounts in <b>dairy</b> <b>foods.</b> Its anti-obesity effect is attributed to its impact on lypogenesis and lipolysis in adipocytes. Calcium supplements do not have such effect as dairy calcium, possibly due to the effects of other bioactive components in <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> such as conjugated linoleic acid, whey peptides, branched aminoacids and lactose which amplify anti-obesity effect.

40|$|Published online: 21 May 2012 OBJECTIVE: Strategies {{are needed}} to address the {{shortfall}} in children's <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> and Ca intakes. The present review identified interventions targeting an increase in children's <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> or Ca intakes, and determined characteristics associated with successful intervention. DESIGN: A systematic literature search identified fourteen intervention studies, published in English, between 1990 and 2010. Studies were evaluated for study population, setting and mode of delivery, dietary targets and outcome measures, measures of intervention intensity, intervention description, the use of behaviour change techniques and intervention effectiveness. SETTING: Interventions targeting an increase in <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> or Ca intake. SUBJECTS: Children aged 5 - 12 years. RESULTS: Ten of the fourteen studies {{were considered to be}} effective. Studies focusing on encouraging intake of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> or Ca alone were all effective, compared with 55 % of studies promoting dairy {{within the context of a}} healthy diet. Effective interventions tended to be higher in intensity, provide <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> and were delivered across a variety of settings to a range of primary targets. The number of behaviour change techniques used did not differentiate effective and ineffective interventions, but the use of taste exposure and prompting practice appeared to be important for effective intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that target an increase in children's <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> or Ca intake could potentially increase children's <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> intake by about one serving daily. Research conducted outside the USA is needed. The review has identified some promising strategies likely to be part of effective interventions for improving dairy and Ca intakes in countries where children's intake is insufficient.

40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{debilitating}} disease that afflicts an estimated 25 million Americans, especially women. Suboptimal intakes of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D contribute to development of osteoporosis.

40|$|Background This review {{provides}} a reappraisal {{of the potential}} effects of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods,</b> including <b>dairy</b> fats, on cardiovascular disease (CVD) /coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Commodities and foods containing saturated fats are of particular focus as current public dietary recommendations are directed toward reducing the intake of saturated fats {{as a means to}} improve the overall health of the population. A conference of scientists from different perspectives of dietary fat and health was convened in order to consider the scientific basis for these recommendations. Aims This review and summary of the conference focus on four key areas related to the biology of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> and fats and their potential impact on human health: (a) the effect of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> on CVD in prospective cohort studies; (b) the impact of dairy fat on plasma lipid risk factors for CVD; (c) the effects of dairy fat on non-lipid risk factors for CVD; and (d) the role of dairy products as essential contributors of micronutrients in reference food patterns for the elderly. Conclusions Despite the contribution of dairy products to the saturated fatty acid composition of the diet, and given the diversity of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> of widely differing composition, there is no clear evidence that <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> consumption is consistently associated with a higher risk of CVD. Thus, recommendations to reduce <b>dairy</b> <b>food</b> consumption irrespective {{of the nature of the}} dairy product should be made with caution...|$|R

40|$|Among dietary {{risk factors}} for {{developing}} osteoporosis, calcium intake in the primary prevention of osteoporosis has received much attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine dietary {{risk factors for}} later osteoporosis in Croatian young women (mean age 22 years), especially <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> consumption, a food group that is the best calcium source because of its calcium content and bioavailability. Dietary assessment methods used were Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (n= 1372) and Quantified Food Frequency Questionnaire (Q-FFQ) (n= 480). Daily consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> reported 76. 0 % subjects and 11. 6 % subjects consume <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> less than once a month.

40|$|Fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> such as yoghurt {{and cheese}} are {{commonly}} found in the Mediterranean diet. Recent landmark research has confirmed {{the effect of the}} Mediterranean diet on reducing the CVD risk, but the relative contributions of fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> have not been fully articulated. The present study provides a review of the relationship between fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> consumption and CVD risk {{in the context of the}} whole diet. Studies show that people who eat healthier diets may be more likely to consume yoghurt, so there is a challenge in attributing separate effects to yoghurt. Analyses from large population studies list yoghurt as the food most negatively associated with the risk of weight gain (a problem that may lead to CVD). There is some suggestion that fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> consumption (yoghurt or cheese) may be associated with reduced inflammatory biomarkers associated with the development of CVD. Dietary trials suggest that cheese may not have the same effect on raising LDL-cholesterol levels as butter with the same saturated fat content. The same might be stated for yoghurt. The use of different probiotic cultures and other aspects of study design remain a problem for research. Nevertheless, population studies from a range of countries have shown that a reduced risk of CVD occurs with the consumption of fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>foods.</b> A combination of evidence is necessary, and more research is always valuable, but indications remain that fermented <b>dairy</b> <b>foods</b> such as cheese and yoghurt are integral to diets that are protective against CVD...|$|R
