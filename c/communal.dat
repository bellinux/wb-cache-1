5|$|The second kingdom's {{economy was}} based on both {{agriculture}} and trade. The economy was centralized and directed through a <b>communal</b> organization, where grains were stored in <b>communal</b> granaries, and distributed amongst the population according to social statues. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some people were directly connected to the palace instead of the <b>communal</b> organization, those included the metal and textile producers and the military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari's position made it an important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|After Gandhi {{returned}} from Second Round Table conference, {{he started a}} new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune.

Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.|$|E

5|$|Early Lingbao ritual {{was mostly}} done on an {{individual}} basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house.

5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the <b>communal</b> polarisation {{that followed the}} demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, making it the largest party in parliament.

5|$|Lemmons {{was full}} of impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers, {{painters}} and inventors; even the dogs and cats shared a <b>communal</b> basket, and there were always stray writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling.

5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have <b>communal</b> nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in <b>communal</b> warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E

5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, {{but it is not}} uncommon to see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have <b>communal</b> toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These <b>communal</b> latrines may have up to 100 droppings in them.|$|E
5|$|Rhondda had {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of <b>communal</b> activity, exemplified by workmen's halls, miners' institutes and trade unions.

5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of <b>communal</b> singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of <b>communal</b> singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
5|$|The Duchy of Lancaster {{continued}} {{to improve and}} expand the property through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. John of Gaunt had windows glazed in the <b>Communal</b> Hall and the Great Chamber in 1392/3, along with other works.

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill.

5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, <b>communal</b> rites. One {{of these}} <b>communal</b> rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|The {{reformed}} legislative council, {{introduced in}} 1921 by the British, {{was based on}} principles of <b>communal</b> representation, which led the Tamils {{to realize that they}} were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a member of their own community. It was under this <b>communal</b> representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast's {{relations}} with his cathedral chapter were good, and no disputes arose during his episcopate. It {{was not until}} late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple archdeaconries, which appears to have happened in 1133. Warelwast instituted the two offices of treasurer and precentor for the cathedral chapter, {{as well as the}} first sub-archdeacons, who were under the archdeacons. Sub-archdeacons are not attested again at Exeter until the episcopate of Bartholomew Iscanus, who was bishop from 1161–1184. William of Malmesbury felt that during Warelwast's episcopate the cathedral chapter relaxed its <b>communal</b> living, which previously had been strong. It is likely that during Warelwast's episcopate the canons of the cathedral chapter quit living in a <b>communal</b> dormitory.|$|E
