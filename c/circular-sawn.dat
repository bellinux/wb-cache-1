50|$|The Smokehouse {{stands on}} the east side of the main house. It is a one-bay, gable- roofed frame {{building}} of weatherboards with a slate roof. It is built entirely of <b>circular-sawn</b> members and probably dates from the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Interior {{walls were}} covered with felt slip sheets and wallpaper. Floorboards are <b>circular-sawn</b> tongue-and-groove, {{attached}} directly to the floor joists. The stairway consists of wedge-shaped cedar treads with closed risers in a tight 180-degree turn with no handrails. The back-to-back fireplaces are made of Tenino sandstone mantels with fire brick fireboxes and wood surrounds.|$|E
50|$|Clifton is a {{historic}} home located at Kilmarnock, Northumberland County, Virginia. It was built about 1785, and is a two-story, Georgian style frame dwelling with brick nogging. It is topped by a gable roof and the exterior is finished in plain, <b>circular-sawn</b> weatherboards. It is a rare example of a four-square plan with central chimney, combined with a front passage and paired stairs.|$|E

5000|$|Band saw blade: A long band welded into a circle, {{with teeth}} on one side. Compared to a <b>circular-saw</b> blade, it {{produces}} less waste {{because it is}} thinner, dissipates heat better because it is longer (so there is more blade to do the cutting, and is usually run at a slower speed.|$|R
50|$|A second {{method of}} {{sidewall}} coring is rotary sidewall cores. In this method, a <b>circular-saw</b> assembly is lowered to {{the zone of}} interest on a wireline, and the core is sawed out. Dozens of cores may be taken this way in one run. This method is roughly 20 times as expensive as percussion cores, but yields a much better sample.|$|R
3000|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} machining processes on surface roughness and on adhesive tensile strength of end-grain-bonded spruce wood specimens was studied. Surfaces {{that had been}} cut with two different circular saws containing 48 and 96 teeth were compared with those that had been further processed by smoothing with a microtome, machine planing, or sanding. Two different adhesives and two different spreading quantities were used to join the test specimens by their end-grain surfaces. Increasing tensile strength of the bonded specimens was observed with increased surface roughness, which was ascribed to an enlarged bonding area {{in the case of}} <b>circular-sawn</b> samples with a rough surface. On the other hand, more pronounced starving of the bond line and thus decreased bond strength was observed in the more open cells of the smoothed end-grain surfaces. A positive effect regarding tensile strength was further observed with increased spreading quantity of the adhesives. Machining was found to particularly affect earlywood tracheids, whereas surface roughness of latewood tracheids was comparable for the differently treated end-grain surfaces [...]...|$|E
40|$|Hope Park Mill i s a small, three-story {{timber-frame}} structure {{sitting on}} the west bank of Piney Branch, Fairfax County, Virginia. The exact date of construction i s unknown, but i t was mentioned in an 1815 sale notice as being "in good repair. " A study of the mill, done in 1972 by preservationist Russell Wright, placed the mill's construction at c. 1800. Rectangular in plan (34 ' 6 " x 20 ' 1 1 "), the mill i s built on a high stone foundation which forms the end wall of the west elevation and part of the north and south walls. The foundation was consolidated {{at some point in the}} mid-twentieth century, with new mortar in evidence, and a l l exterior siding was replaced c. 1963. The west wall i s covered with circular sawn_clapboard, 7 " to the weather, and a l l other wall surfaces are <b>circular-sawn</b> vertical siding, random width, applied to express the change in floor levels. The present roof i s covered with wood shingles and, while they are not original, nailing strips attached to the rafters suggest that wood shingles were the original covering. The water wheel i s missing, but photographs taken by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1936 show a 12 -spoke overshot wheel, approximately 18 feet in diameter. Sections of the millrace remain. The Historic American Buildings Survey photos also show two frame structures, a one-story wing attached to the east end of the south elevation and a two-story frame wing attached to the north wall. The remova...|$|E
50|$|The game puts {{a player}} in control of Ash, the prince of Hell, as he sets out across Hell on a self-imposed quest to restore his dignity by killing a number of monsters. He accomplishes this {{with the use of}} a large <b>circular-saw</b> blade jetpack that serves as both his primary weapon and his main mode of transportation. Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit {{received}} mixed reviews upon its release. The game was praised for its visuals, but widely criticized for its control scheme.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{dependence}} of using basic types of machining technologies on the surface quality of most common wood. In wood-processing industry, cutting by <b>circular-saw</b> blades and milling are the most often used technology to machining wood materials. The quality and accuracy of the machining are derived from the machine construction, shape {{and the amount of}} saw teeth, kind of wood species, feed per tooth {{and the size of the}} tool. Research was carried out on an experimental milling stand at setting various feed speeds and the spindle rpm, on an experimental cutting stand at using three types of <b>circular-saw</b> blades in the field of optimum and resonance rpm. Evaluation of the surface quality was carried out on a top multisensor apparatus Taylor Hobson-Talysurf CLI 1000 using a contactless method by a confocal sensor. Software equipment of a powerful computer was provided by the Talymap platinum program. Tree species were evaluated generally from the aspect of roughness and waviness altogether. An expert evaluation is carried out from two aspects. The first aspect is selection of the best technology for actual wood and the second aspect is selection of the best species for the actual technology. Particular relationships between wood and technology are evidently best described by graphs...|$|R
5000|$|Machine Beast Mothership Fog Mother (Kikaijū Bokan Foggu Mazā): The Fog Mother, {{an alien}} {{parasite}} in a gold battle fortress who sends her three oldest children {{to obtain a}} human sacrifice for their unborn siblings to feed on before devouring {{the rest of the}} human race, is responsible for exterminating the dinosaurs. Her machine body can shoot gatling guns, shoot a laser from her right eye, emit <b>circular-saw</b> blades from her left eye, lower pincers to grab and emit insect-like legs from her torso to attack. She can feel pain if her machine is attacked. After Garai is killed, Fog Mother attempts to digest J but he enlarges and kills her newborn offspring. He impales the Fog Mother with his fist to pull out Kana. J frees himself from her clutches, breaking her pincers and insect-like legs and using a Jumbo Rider Kick to damage her body as it begins to self-detonate. In a last effort to destroy Kamen Rider J, she drags him back into her body but he frees himself and kills her with a Rider Punch as her machine body explodes.|$|R
40|$|Liquid nitrogen-cooled diamond-wire {{concrete}} cutting {{can be used}} to {{cut through}} thick concrete walls, floors, and structures without using water to cool the cutting wire. The diamond wire is cooled with liquid nitrogen in a 0. 9 -m (3 -ft) long by 7. 6 -cm (3 -in.) diameter pipe housing. The nitrogen evaporates, so no contaminated liquid waste is generated. Other than the use of liquid nitrogen, the system is a conventional diamond-wire saw assembly with remote hydraulic controls. Setup of the hydraulic-powered drive wheel and the diamond wire for cutting requires {{a relatively short period of}} time using people with minimal training. Concrete dust generated during the cutting is considerable and requires control. The production rate of this improved technology is 0. 78 m{sup 2 }/hr (8. 4 ft{sup 2 }/hr). The production rates of traditional (baseline) water-cooled diamond-wire cutting and circular saw cutting technologies are 1. 11 m{sup 2 }/hr (12 ft{sup 2 }/hr), and 0. 45 m{sup 2 }/hr (4. 8 ft{sup 2 }/hr), respectively. The liquid nitrogen-cooled system costs 189 % more than conventional diamond-wire cutting if contaminated liquid wastes collection, treatment, and disposal are not accounted for with the baseline. The new technology was 310 % more costly than a conventional diamond circular saw, under the conditions of this demonstration (no wastewater control). For cutting a 0. 9 -m x 3. 7 -m (3 -ft x 12 -ft) wall, the improved technology costs $ 17, 000, while baseline diamond-wire cutting would cost $ 9, 000 and baseline <b>circular-saw</b> cutting would cost $ 5, 500. The improved system may cost less than the baseline technologies or may be comparable in cost if wastewater control is included...|$|R
