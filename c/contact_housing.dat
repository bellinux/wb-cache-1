40|$|This article {{describes}} a follow-up study of 232 individuals who underwent psychiatric assessment by a Criminal Justice Mental Health Team (CJMHT) in 2001 / 2002, and also draws upon in-depth interviews conducted with 26 of the cohort. At assessment {{many people are}} identified with substance misuse problems, as homeless and {{with a history of}} psychiatric contact but in the main their problems are of insufficient severity to merit diversion to psychiatric hospital. The study mapped service <b>contact,</b> <b>housing</b> and offending in the 12 months following assessment and compared this to the 12 months prior to assessment, and found increased levels of service contact but also increased levels of offending and no decrease in homelessness. Thus assessment by the CJMHT brought few discernible advantages for the majority of clients. This was also the perception of the 26 clients who were interviewed. Their own perceptions of their lifestyle and the support that they deemed most valuable are described to identify means of enhancing the efficacy of court assessment. ...|$|E

It is the first major ONS social survey to explore disability {{in terms of the}} social barriers to participation that people experience. The survey compares the experiences of disabled people with those of nondisabled people. Background: The last major survey of disability in Great Britain was the Disability Follow-up to the 1996 / 97 Family Resources Survey (available at the UK Data Archive under SN 4090). Prior to that were the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) national surveys of disability carried out during 1985 - 88 (available from the Archive under GN 33214). In 2005, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) sponsored a feasibility study which recommended that a new dedicated disability survey was required. The new survey was needed to meet the following long term information needs on experiences of disabled people living in Great Britain: dynamics of disability over time, including the factors associated with transitions and onsets of impairment social participation by disabled people up-to-date prevalence rates of impairments In 2007 the Office for Disability Issues (ODI) commissioned the ONS to develop a new longitudinal survey of disability. Longitudinal design: The LOS is a longitudinal survey. This means it will track the experiences of disabled people over time to assess transitions through key life stages, such as moving from childhood to adulthood or in and out of work. The longitudinal design enables three distinct groups to be followed over time: disabled group comparison group of non-disabled people a larger non-disabled group, monitored for the onset of impairment over time Respondents will be interviewed every 12 months, whether they are resident in the original household or have since moved. Following the baseline survey only the first two groups will be interviewed face-to-face. The third group will be monitored over time via a shorter telephone interview to check for the onset of an impairment. If any member of the household has experienced the onset of impairment, they will be invited {{to take part in a}} face to face interview. Further information about the LOS series is available from the ONS LOS web pages. End User Licence and Special Licence LOS data: Users should note that there are two versions of each LOS study. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement, and the other is a Special Licence (SL) version. The SL version contains geographic variables (Country, Government Office Region and Local Authority), deciles, age bands, a rural/urban indicator, and more information on household relationships, country of previous residence, medical conditions and occupations. The EUL version contains less detailed variables. For example, there is no spatial unit and age is top-coded at 80. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Therefore, users are strongly advised to order the standard version of the data. In order to help users choose the correct dataset, 'Special Licence Access' has been added to the dataset titles for the SL versions of the data. The Special Licence version of the Life Opportunities Survey is held under SN 6654. For the fifth edition (March 2016), data and documentation from Wave 3 (the final wave) of the survey were added to the study. Main Topics : The LOS questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first part is the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) core module. The core module collects basic demographic information and other household information for all members of the household. The second part of the questionnaire is the LOS module. This module is administered to each adult in the household and they are asked questions about: education and training employment economic life and living standards transport leisure, social and cultural activities social <b>contact</b> <b>housing</b> accessibility in the home accessibility of public services domestic life and social care discrimination crime impairments and health conditions disability as defined by the Disability Discrimination Act income and benefits Information about impairments and health conditions of children aged 11 to 15 was collected by parental proxy. <br...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{research}} has rarely considered {{the significance of}} the home and neighbourhood context of where business owners live for their business. Conversely, urban and neighbourhood {{research has}} overlooked how housing and neighbourhood shape business and entrepreneurship outcomes. This paper investigates the importance of housing and neighbourhood resources for microbusinesses using a random sample of microbusinesses in Edinburgh (UK) including those that are informal and home-based, and various characteristics of the neighbourhood in which the business owner lives were attached to the survey records. The data capture whether business owners have business premises outside their homes, and have used neighbourhood <b>contacts,</b> <b>housing</b> equity or space in the house for their business. In short, housing and neighbourhood resources are used by a large majority (82 %) of microbusinesses. The findings challenge a number of common assumptions on the separation of commercial and residential functions, how neighbourhoods feature in the evolution of businesses, the nested conceptualization of home within a neighbourhood and on the nature of home-based businesses. It is concluded that multi-use (rather than mixed-use) neighbourhood planning would help foster more flexible and dynamic use of neighbourhoods and urban districts, although recognizing that this is a political issue...|$|R
