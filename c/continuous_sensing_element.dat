40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} {{improving}} human hand pose sensing device performance by exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands in grasping tasks. In a companion paper we studied the problem of maximizing the reconstruction accuracy of the hand pose from partial and noisy data provided by any given pose sensing device (a sensorized "glove") taking into account statistical a priori information. In this paper we consider the dual {{problem of how to}} design pose sensing devices, i. e. how and where to place sensors on a glove, to get maximum information about the actual hand posture. We study the continuous case, whereas individual <b>sensing</b> <b>elements</b> in the glove measure a linear combination of joint angles, the discrete case, whereas each measure corresponds to a single joint angle, and the most general hybrid case, whereas both <b>continuous</b> and discrete <b>sensing</b> <b>elements</b> are available. The objective is to provide, for given a priori information and fixed number of measurements, the optimal design minimizing in average the reconstruction error. Solutions relying on the geometrical synergy definition as well as gradient flow-based techniques are provided. Simulations of reconstruction performance show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal design. Comment: Submitted to International Journal of Robotics Research 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Continuous</b> <b>sensing</b> {{applications}} (e. g., mobile {{social networking}} applications) are appearing on new sensor-enabled mobile phones {{such as the}} Apple iPhone, Nokia and Android phones. These applications present significant challenges to the phone’s operations given the phone’s limited computational and energy resources {{and the need for}} applications to share real-time <b>continuous</b> <b>sensed</b> data with back-end servers. System designers have to deal with a trade-off between data accuracy (i. e., application fidelity) and energy constraints in the design of uploading strategies between phones and back-end servers. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of several techniques to optimize the information uploading process for <b>continuous</b> <b>sensing</b> on mobile phones. We analyze the cases of continuous and intermittent connectivity imposed by low-duty cycle design considerations or poor wireless network coverage in order to drive down energy consumption and extend the lifetime of the phone.

We present the implementation and the experimental evaluation of these uploading techniques based on measurements from the deployment of a <b>continuous</b> <b>sensing</b> application on 20 Nokia N 95 phones used by 20 people for a period of 2 weeks.
