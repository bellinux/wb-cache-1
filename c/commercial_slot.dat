By {{the end of the}} 1970s, the slot car hobby had diminished significantly, especially public tracks operating larger scale cars, and modeling in general was on the decline (HO Slot Car Racing 1999-2011). One website attributes the weakening of the pastime to both the ageing of the baby-boomers along with the fragile economics of the slot car industry and the closing of many <b>commercial</b> <b>slot</b> car tracks perhaps as toy companies offered smaller sets to be used at home (Slotblog 2007). A wide variety of electrically powered vehicles, however are available today - in various forms.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>commercial</b> <b>slot</b> {{cars were}} made by Lionel (USA) and {{appeared}} in their catalogues from 1912, drawing power from a toy train rail sunk in a trough or wide slot between the rails. They were surprisingly similar to modern slot cars, but independent speed control was available only as an optional extra. Production was discontinued after 1915. Sporadically over the next forty years, several other electrically powered commercial products came and went. Although a patent was registered {{as far back as}} March 1936 for a slot car, until the late 1950s, nearly all powered toy vehicles were guided by raised rails, either at the wheels (railroad-style), or at the lane center, or edge.|$|E

In 1955, the Model Automobile Racing Association of Kalamazoo, Michigan, built the first track for electric rail-racing (the short-lived immediate predecessor to slot racing) in the US. Unlike the seminal Southport (UK) track that inspired it, the MARA table was designed for 1:24 as well as 1:32 competition. With that beginning, the US adopted 1:24 as the primary scale for serious competition during the heyday of slot car racing in the 1960s, while Britain and Europe favored 1:32, and have continued to do so.|$|E

5000|$|Circa 1966, Audience Studies Institute of Hollywood, California {{developed}} a proprietary analog ARS system {{for evaluating the}} response of a theater audience to unreleased motion pictures, television shows and commercials. This early ARS was used by ASI's clients - major motion picture and television studios and advertising agencies - {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of whatever it was they wanted to accomplish: for example, selling more products, increasing movie ticket sales, and achieving a higher fee per <b>commercial</b> <b>slot.</b> Often, a client would show different versions to different audiences, e.g. different movie endings, to gauge their relative effectiveness. ASI would give out free tickets on the street to bring people into the theater, called the [...] "Preview House," [...] for particular showings where each attendee would fill out a questionnaire and then be placed in a seat with a [...] "dial" [...] handset outfitted with a single knob that each attendee would turn to a position to indicate his or her level of interest.

50|$|The {{table of}} probabilities for a {{specific}} machine is called the Probability and Accounting Report or PAR sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician Michael Shackleford revealed the PARS for one <b>commercial</b> <b>slot</b> machine, an original International Gaming Technology Red White and Blue machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one midsize payout {{that is designed to}} give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take his winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 643=262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several midsize payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.|$|E

40|$|Addiction is {{considered}} to be a brain disease caused by chronic exposure to drugs. Sensitization of brain dopamine (DA) systems partly mediates this effect. Pathological gambling (PG) {{is considered}} to be a behavioral addiction. Therefore, PG may be caused by chronic exposure to gambling. Identifying a gambling-induced sensitization of DA systems would support this possibility. Gambling rewards evoke DA release. One episode of slot machine play shifts the DA response from reward delivery to onset of cues (spinning reels) for reward, in line with temporal difference learning principles. Thus, conditioned stimuli (CS) play a key role in DA responses to gambling. In primates, DA response to a CS is strongest when reward probability is 50 %. Under this schedule the CS elicits an expectancy of reward but provides no information about whether it will occur on a given trial. During gambling, a 50 % schedule should elicit maximal DA release. This closely matches reward frequency (46 %) on a <b>commercial</b> <b>slot</b> machine. DA release can contribute to sensitization, especially for amphetamine. Chronic exposure to a CS that predicts reward 50 % of the time could mimic this effect. We tested this hypothesis in 3 studies with rats. Animals received 15 x 45 -min exposures to a CS that predicted reward with a probability of 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100 %. The CS was a light; the reward was a 10 % sucrose solution. After training, rats received a sensitizing regimen of 5 separate doses (1 mg/kg) of d-amphetamine. Lastly they received a 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg amphetamine challenge prior to a 90 -min locomotor activity test. In all 3 studies the 50 % group displayed greater activity than the other groups in response to both challenge doses. Effect sizes were modest but consistent, as reflected by a significant group x rank association ( =. 986, p =. 025). Chronic exposure to a gambling-like schedule of reward predictive stimuli can promote sensitization to amphetamine much like exposure to amphetamine itself...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this Master of Science Thesis project are the design, develop-ment {{and implementation of}} an innovative wireless electronic controller for digital slot car applications. A slot vehicle is an electrical powered model that is guided by a groove or slot in the track on which it runs. The slot controller designed allows an accurate con-trol of the change lane, brake and throttle actions in slot vehicles and it resolves the pre-sent problems of <b>commercial</b> <b>slot</b> car controllers. This project focuses on the complete development of the electronic hardware interface dedicated to control digital slot vehicles. The development was performed using an electronic platform that combines a low cost and high performance microcontroller, which is equipped with conditioning electronics necessary to achieve the adjustment of slot vehicles parameters. The control interface, conditioning electronics and the neces-sary electronics for wireless communication are topics to considerer. The development of the system software is also broached in this project, which is re-sponsible for providing different driving modes possibilities for users depending on the performance required by the characteristics of each slot racing circuit. For this devel-opment, the main slot car controllers on the market have been analysed and the most common components in the multifunction control units of the circuits to perform a de-sign that implements a microcontroller, which gives intelligence and enables to have an advanced control in digital slot car systems. The complexity of the project carried out is clear because it involves starting from scratch in research {{and the use of}} a large number of knowledge of different subjects and the real demonstration of proper operation. It is noteworthy that despite develop a good theoretical basis of the problem to be solved, its proper functioning in practise presents additional difficulties with respect to the theoretical model developed. The results have been satisfactory to achieve the proposed tasks from the beginning. The slot controller has a colour screen that provides an intuitive interface with the placement of the push buttons. The wireless communication allows more independence and different driving modes give to the controller new features never seen in previous slot car systems. The best reward is the development of a Master’s Thesis project that has interest to the people. Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería IndustrialUniversidad Politécnica de Cartagen...|$|E

PTVS was delayed until the 1978-79 season due to advertisers that were cautious of purchasing <b>commercial</b> <b>slots</b> on the planned network. This plan was aborted when executives decided the venture would be too costly, with no guarantee of profitability.

5000|$|Measurement used in {{planning}} a television media buy {{based on the}} cost of a <b>commercial</b> time <b>slot</b> and the rating of the program where the time slot is positioned. If, for example, the cost of a <b>commercial</b> time <b>slot</b> during prime time was $1000 and the program rating for that time was 10 (which means that 10% of the total potential audience was tuned to that program), then the cost per GRP would be $1000 divided by 10%, or $100. The CPGRP measurement is a way of measuring the efficiency of media cost, as compared to measuring the cost per thousand (CPT) and is generally used when making comparisons of the various broadcast vehicles.

5000|$|The {{radio station}} owners soon {{realized}} they could earn more money by selling sponsorship rights to other businesses, {{especially as the}} patents expired and most people already owned a radio. By the 1930s, it was common practice for programs to be owned and produced by the advertiser, who in turn leased production facilities and air time from the network. The advertiser frequently got top billing over the star, as in The Pepsodent Show starring Bob Hope or The Chase and Sanborn Hour starring Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.

The basic idea of the show was to extend the concept of style so that ALL types of music would be considered appropriate. One {{of the most}} unusual juxtapositions attempted by Parnell during these early stages was to combine an obscure wordless choral composition by Sergei Rachmaninoff with Janis Joplin's recording of the song Mercedes Benz. This was considered rather shocking to some of the station's dyed-in-the-wool listeners, however, it did serve to attract a number of younger listeners as well as older listeners with open minds who were interested in hearing new ideas. The station had often been criticized as a dinosaur and the announcing style was viewed as stodgy. Its opening tagline, spoken each week by host Carl Princi was [...] "Welcome to Global Village, a meeting place for the I and the ear."
