60|$|I {{received}} my 100, in advance, with profound delight. It {{was a positive}} and most welcome increase to my income, and might probably {{be regarded as a}} first real step on the road to substantial success. I am well aware that there are many who think that an author in his authorship should not regard money,--nor a painter, or sculptor, or composer in his art. I do not know that this unnatural sacrifice is supposed to extend itself further. A barrister, a clergyman, a doctor, an engineer, and even actors and architects, may without disgrace follow the bent of human nature, and endeavour to fill their bellies and clothe their backs, and also those of their wives and children, as comfortably as they can by the exercise of their abilities and their crafts. They may be as rationally realistic, as may the butchers and the bakers; but the artist and the author forget the high glories of their calling if they condescend to make a money return a first object. They who preach this doctrine will be much offended by my theory, and by this book of mine, if my theory and my book come beneath their notice. They require the practice of a so-called virtue which is contrary to nature, and which, in my eyes, would be no virtue if it were practised. They are like clergymen who preach sermons against the love of money, but who know that the love of money is so distinctive a characteristic of humanity that such sermons are mere platitudes called for by customary but unintelligent piety. All material progress has come from man's desire to do the best he can for himself and those about him, and civilisation and Christianity itself have been made possible by such progress. Though we do not all of us argue this matter out within our breasts, we do all feel it; and we know that the more a man earns the more useful he is to his fellow-men. The most useful lawyers, as a rule, have been those who have made the greatest incomes,--and it is the same with the doctors. It would be the same in the Church if they who have the choosing of bishops always chose the best man. And it has in truth been so too in art and authorship. Did Titian or Rubens disregard their pecuniary rewards? As far as we know, Shakespeare worked always for money, giving the best of his intellect to support his trade as an actor. In our own century what literary names stand higher than those of Byron, Tennyson, Scott, Dickens, Macaulay, and Carlyle? And I think I may say that none of those great men neglected the pecuniary result of their labours. Now and then a man may arise among us who in any calling, whether it be in law, in physic, in religious teaching, in art, or literature, may in his professional enthusiasm utterly disregard money. All will honour his enthusiasm, and if he be wifeless and childless, his disregard of the great object of men's work will be blameless. But {{it is a mistake to}} suppose that a man is a better man because he despises money. Few do so, and those few in doing so suffer a defeat. Who does not desire to be hospitable to his friends, generous to the poor, liberal to all, munificent to his children, and to be himself free from the <b>casking</b> fear which poverty creates? The subject will not stand an argument;--and yet authors are told that they should disregard payment for their work, and be content to devote their unbought brains to the welfare of the public. Brains that are unbought will never serve the public much. Take away from English authors their copyrights, and you would very soon take away from England her authors.|$|E

40|$|A {{spent fuel}} storage <b>cask</b> must {{efficiently}} transfer the heat released by the fuel assemblies through the <b>cask</b> walls to the environment. This heat must be transferred through passive means, limiting the energy transfer mechanisms from the <b>cask</b> to natural convection and radiation heat transfer [...] Natural convection is essentially independent {{of the characteristics of}} the array of <b>casks,</b> provided there is space between <b>casks</b> to permit a convection loop. Radiation heat transfer, however, depends on the geometric arrangement of the array of <b>casks</b> because the peripheral <b>casks</b> will shadow the interior <b>casks</b> and restrict radiant heat transfer from all <b>casks</b> to the environment. The shadowing of one <b>cask</b> by its neighbors is determined by a view factor that represents the fraction of radiant energy that leaves the surface of a <b>cask</b> and reaches the environment. This paper addresses the evaluation of the view factor between a centrally located {{spent fuel storage}} <b>cask</b> and the environment. By combining analytic expressions for the view factor of (1) infinitely long cylinders and (2) finite cylinders with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2 to represent spent fuel storage <b>casks,</b> the view factor can be evaluated for any practical array of spent fuel storage <b>casks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinase (MAGUK) proteins {{interact with}} several synaptogenesis-triggering adhesion molecules. However, direct {{evidence for the}} involvement of MAGUK proteins in synapse formation is lacking. In this study, we investigate the function of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (<b>CASK),</b> a MAGUK protein, in dendritic spine formation by RNA interference. Knockdown of <b>CASK</b> in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces spine density and shrinks dendritic spines. Our analysis of {{the time course of}} RNA interference and <b>CASK</b> overexpression experiments further suggests that <b>CASK</b> stabilizes or maintains spine morphology. Experiments using only the <b>CASK</b> PDZ domain or a mutant lacking the protein 4. 1 –binding site indicate an involvement of <b>CASK</b> in linking transmembrane adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton. We also find that <b>CASK</b> is SUMOylated. Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO 1) to <b>CASK</b> reduces the interaction between <b>CASK</b> and protein 4. 1.

40|$|The Canister Transfer System {{receives}} transportation <b>casks</b> containing {{large and}} small disposable canisters, unloads the canisters from the <b>casks,</b> stores the canisters as required, loads them into disposal containers (DCs), and prepares the empty <b>casks</b> for re-shipment. <b>Cask</b> unloading begins with <b>cask</b> inspection, sampling, and lid bolt removal operations. The <b>cask</b> lids are removed and the canisters are unloaded. Small canisters are loaded directly into a DC, or are stored until enough canisters are available to fill a DC. Large canisters are loaded directly into a DC. Transportation <b>casks</b> and related components are decontaminated as required, and empty <b>casks</b> are prepared for re-shipment. One independent, remotely operated canister transfer line is provided in the Waste Handling Building System. The canister transfer line consists of a <b>Cask</b> Transport System, <b>Cask</b> Preparation System, Canister Handling System, Disposal Container Transport System, an off-normal canister handling cell with a transfer tunnel connecting the two cells, and Control and Tracking System. The Canister Transfer System operating sequence begins with moving transportation <b>casks</b> to the <b>cask</b> preparation area with the <b>Cask</b> Transport System. The <b>Cask</b> Preparation System prepares the <b>cask</b> for unloading and consists of <b>cask</b> preparation manipulator, <b>cask</b> inspection and sampling equipment, and decontamination equipment. The Canister Handling System unloads the canister(s) and places them into a DC. Handling equipment consists of a bridge crane hoist, DC loading manipulator, lifting fixtures, and small canister staging racks. Once the <b>cask</b> has been unloaded, the <b>Cask</b> Preparation System decontaminates the <b>cask</b> exterior and returns it to the Carrier/Cask Handling System via the <b>Cask</b> Transport System.

40|$|A crush pad {{has been}} {{designed}} and analyzed to absorb the kinetic energy of an accidentally dropped spent nuclear fuel shipping <b>cask</b> into a 44 ft. deep <b>cask</b> unloading pool. Conventional analysis techniques available for evaluating a <b>cask</b> for tipping due to lateral seismic forces assume that the <b>cask</b> rests on a rigid surface. In this analysis, the <b>cask</b> (110 tons) sits on a stainless steel encased (0. 25 in. top plate), polyurethane foam (4 ft. thick) crush pad. As the <b>cask</b> tends to rock due to horizontal seismic forces, the contact area between the <b>cask</b> and the crush pad is reduced, increasing the bearing stress, and causing the pivoting corner of the <b>cask</b> to depress into the crush pad. As the crush pad depresses under the <b>cask</b> corner, the pivot point shifts from the corner toward the <b>cask</b> center, which facilitates rocking and potential tipping of the <b>cask.</b> Subsequent rocking of the <b>cask</b> may deepen the depression, further contributing to the likelihood of <b>cask</b> tip over. However, as the depression is created, the crush pad is absorbing energy from the rocking <b>cask.</b> Potential tip over of the <b>cask</b> was evaluated by performing a non-linear, dynamic, finite element analysis with acceleration time history input. This time history analysis captured {{the effect of a}} deforming crush pad, and also eliminated conservatisms of the conventional approaches. For comparison purposes, this analysis was also performed with the <b>cask</b> sitting on a solid stainless steel crush pad.

Specific criteria are required in the selection of <b>casks</b> and the storage facility to house the <b>casks</b> on site. The selection criteria for <b>casks</b> and the storage facility were determined and technically evaluated in this dissertation. The selected <b>casks</b> were evaluated in terms of SNF criticality, radiation shielding, decay heat removal and heat transfer.

40|$|When the warship Vasa {{was raised}} in 1961, wooden <b>casks</b> were found in nearly every area of the ship. Unfortunately, this {{important}} find category was not subject to detailed recording and study until now. This thesis explains the use and distribution of <b>casks</b> aboard Vasa, and their place in seventeenth-century northern European cooperage. Recording of individual <b>cask</b> attributes {{formed the basis for}} these subsequent analyses. This shows there were at least 145 <b>casks</b> of five main types aboard when the ship sank in 1628. The majority of <b>casks</b> were made of oak timber; the remainder of pine. The most common type of <b>cask</b> could hold between 117 and 146 liters and featured square bungholes. These <b>casks</b> contained salt meat, and likely beer. The dimensions of these <b>casks</b> conform to multiples of the Swedish foot, suggesting they were produced locally or at least according to Swedish specifications. Distribution of the containers shows a clear stowage plan, with the majority of provision <b>casks</b> in the hold and <b>casks</b> of personal possessions on the gundecks above. A study of period art reveals that <b>casks</b> with square bungholes were common across seventeenth-century northwestern Europe, but have hitherto been underrepresented archaeologically. This iconographic evidence also supports the contention that many of the oak <b>casks</b> held beer. The <b>casks</b> from Vasa remain an important tool for understanding shipboard organization and the naval supply process during the seventeenth century.   M. A...|$|R

40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +) /calmodulin (CaM) -dependent kinase II (CaMKII) {{activity}} plays {{a fundamental}} role in learning and memory. A key feature of CaMKII in memory formation {{is its ability}} to be regulated by autophosphorylation, which switches its activity on and off during synaptic plasticity. The synaptic scaffolding protein <b>CASK</b> (calcium (Ca 2 +) /calmodulin (CaM) associated serine kinase) is also important for learning and memory, as mutations in <b>CASK</b> result in intellectual disability and neurological defects in humans. We show that in Drosophila larvae, <b>CASK</b> interacts with CaMKII to control neuronal growth and calcium signalling. Furthermore, deletion of the CaMK-like and L 27 domains of <b>CASK</b> (<b>CASK</b> β null) or expression of overactive CaMKII (T 287 D) produced similar effects on synaptic growth and Ca 2 + signalling. <b>CASK</b> overexpression rescues the effects of CaMKII overactivity, consistent with the notion that <b>CASK</b> and CaMKII act in a common pathway that controls these neuronal processes. The reduction in Ca 2 + signalling observed in the <b>CASK</b> β null mutant caused a decrease in vesicle trafficking at synapses. In addition, the decrease in Ca 2 + signalling in <b>CASK</b> mutants was associated with an increase in Ether-&# 224;-go-go (EAG) potassium (K+) channel localisation to synapses. Reducing EAG restored the decrease in Ca 2 + signalling observed in <b>CASK</b> mutants to the level of wildtype, suggesting that <b>CASK</b> regulates Ca 2 + signalling via EAG. <b>CASK</b> knockdown reduced both appetitive associative learning and odour evoked Ca 2 + responses in Drosophila mushroom bodies, which are the learning centres of Drosophila. Expression of human <b>CASK</b> in Drosophila rescued the effect of <b>CASK</b> deletion on the activity state of CaMKII, suggesting that human <b>CASK</b> may also regulate CaMKII autophosphorylation...|$|R

40|$|<b>CASK</b> is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved multidomain protein {{composed of}} an N-terminal Ca 2 _/calmodulin-kinase domain, central PDZ and SH 3 domains, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase domain. Many potential activities for <b>CASK</b> have been suggested, including functions in scaffolding the synapse, in organizing ion channels, and in regulating neuronal gene transcription. To better define the physiological importance of <b>CASK,</b> {{we have now}} analyzed <b>CASK</b> ‘‘knockdown’’ mice in which <b>CASK</b> expression was suppressed by _ 70 %, and <b>CASK</b> knockout (KO) mice, in which <b>CASK</b> expression was abolished. <b>CASK</b> knockdown mice are viable but smaller than WT mice, whereas <b>CASK</b> KO mice die at first day after birth. <b>CASK</b> KO mice exhibit no major developmental abnormalities apart from a partially penetrant cleft palate syndrome. In CASK-deficient neurons, the levels of the CASK-interacting proteins Mints, Veli/ Mals, and neurexins are decreased, whereas the level of neuroligin 1 (which binds to neurexins that in turn bind to <b>CASK)</b> is increased. Neurons lacking <b>CASK</b> display overall normal electrical properties and form ultrastructurally normal synapses. However, glutamatergic spontaneous synaptic release events are increased, and GABAergic synaptic release events are decreased in CASK-deficient neurons.

50|$|The 19th {{century was}} the {{pinnacle}} of Cooperage technology, the regulation of <b>cask</b> size and production had a streamlining effect on maritime trade and industry.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{analyses}} were performed to assess the structural response of spent nuclear fuel dry <b>casks</b> subjected to various handling and on-site transfer events. The results of these analyses are {{being used by the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to perform a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). Although the PRA study is being performed for a specific nuclear plant, the PRA study is also intended to provide a framework for a general methodology that could also be applied to other dry <b>cask</b> systems at other nuclear plants. The dry <b>cask</b> system consists of a transfer <b>cask,</b> used for handling and moving the multi-purpose canister OLIIpC that contains the fuel, and a storage <b>cask,</b> used to store the MPC and fuel on a concrete pad at the site.

40|$|In 2003, {{representatives from}} the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) {{requested}} development of a project {{with the objective of}} determining the performance of a concrete spent nuclear fuel storage <b>cask.</b> Radiation and environmental effects may cause chemical alteration of the concrete that could result in excessive cracking, spalling, and loss of compressive strength. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) project team and CRIEPI representatives identified the Ventilated Storage <b>Cask</b> (VSC- 17) spent nuclear fuel storage <b>cask</b> as a candidate to study <b>cask</b> performance, because it had been used to store fuel as part of a dry <b>cask</b> storage demonstration project for more than 15 years. The project involved investigating the properties of the concrete shield. INL performed a survey of the <b>cask</b> in the summers of 2003 and 2004. Preliminary <b>cask</b> evaluations performed in 2003 indicated that the <b>cask</b> has no visual degradation. However, a 4 - 5 mrem/hr step-change in the radiation levels about halfway up the <b>cask</b> and a localized hot spot beneath an upper air vent indicate that there may be variability in the density of the concrete or localized cracking. In 2005, INL and CRIEPI scientists performed additional surveys on the VSC- 17 <b>cask.</b> This document summarizes the methods used on the VSC- 17 to evaluate the <b>cask</b> for compressive strength, concrete cracking, concrete thickness, and temperature distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{investigate}} the potential for damage to the MCO during impact from an accidental drop from the MHM into the shipping <b>cask.</b> The MCO is dropped from a height of 8. 2 feet above the <b>cask</b> enters the <b>cask</b> concentrically and falls the additional 12. 83 feet to the <b>cask</b> bottom. Because of the interface fit between the MCO and the <b>cask</b> and the air entrapment the MCO fall velocity is slowed. The shipping <b>cask</b> is resting on an impact absorber {{at the time of}} impact. The energy absorbing properties of the impact absorber are included in this analysis...|$|R

At the end of the aging period (12, 18, or 25 years) a small portion is drawn from the smallest <b>cask</b> and each <b>cask</b> is then topped up with the contents of the preceding (next larger) <b>cask.</b> Freshly reduced cooked must is added to the largest <b>cask</b> and in every subsequent year the drawing and topping up process is repeated. This process where the product is distributed from the oldest <b>cask</b> and then refilled from the next oldest vintage <b>cask</b> is called solera or in perpetuum.|$|R
