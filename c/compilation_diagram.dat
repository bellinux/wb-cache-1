Based on VS 2005 platform, this scheme implements the construction of Ladder <b>Diagram,</b> <b>compilation,</b> simulation and other functions. This paper focuses on researching the construction method of Ladder Diagram, converting Ladder Diagram into Boolean equation and generating VHDL program by Boolean equivalence. The construction method of Ladder Diagram based on parallel-series hierarchical nested list and the implementing method of Boolean equivalence based on double-layer lists are proposed. Finally the correctness of the scheme is verified through an example.    </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe correct <b>compilation</b> of block <b>diagram</b> {{languages}} like Lustre, Scade, and {{a discrete}} subset of Simulink is important {{since they are}} used to program critical embedded control software. We describe the specification and verification in an Interactive Theorem Prover of a compilation chain that treats the key aspects of Lustre: sampling, nodes, and delays. Building on CompCert, we show that repeated execution of the generated assembly code faithfully implements the dataflow semantics of source programs. We resolve two key technical challenges. The first is the change from a synchronous dataflow semantics, where programs manipulate streams of values, to an imperative one, where computations manipulate memory sequentially. The second is the verified compilation of an imperative language with encapsulated state to C code where the state is realized by nested records. We also treat a standard control optimization that eliminates unnecessary conditional statements...|$|R

5000|$|Indeed, Nightingale is {{described}} as [...] "a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart {{now known as the}} polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a <b>compilation</b> of such <b>diagrams</b> a [...] "coxcomb", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. She later became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.|$|R

40|$|Designers often cite {{unfamiliar}} notation as one {{obstacle to}} wider acceptance of formal methods. Formalizations of design notations, such as timing diagrams, promise {{to bridge the}} gap between design practice and formal methods. How to use such formalizations effectively, however, remains an open question. Developing new tools around design notations might provide better support for reasoning at the level of the preferred notations. On the other hand, translating the formalizations into established notations enables leveraging off of existing tools. This decision of whether to treat design notations as interfaces depends largely on computational tradeoffs. This paper explores this issue in the context of specifying properties for automata-theoretic verification using timing diagrams. Automata-theoretic algorithms perform a tableau construction to convert properties into Büchi automata. We contrast direct <b>compilation</b> of timing <b>diagrams</b> into Büchi automata with an approach that uses linear-time temporal logic (LTL) as an intermediate language during translation. Direct compilation generally produces much smaller automata and scales signi cantly better with variations in key timing diagram parameters. We attribute this to combination of a correspondence between timing diagrams and weak automata and certain shortcomings in current LTL-to-Büchi algorithms...|$|R
