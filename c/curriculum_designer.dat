Qualitative approach with specific design of exploratory case study was employed to investigate the problem. Data was extracted from documents, observations and structure interviews. The interview was conducted with 6 respondents (2 <b>curriculum</b> <b>designers,</b> 4 recruiters). Data were classified into two categories (1) perception of <b>curriculum</b> <b>designers</b> and (2) perception of recruiters.

40|$|Curricular {{implementations}} {{are unlikely}} to deliver the anticipated benefits for mathematics learners if written guidance to teachers is interpreted and enacted differently from the ways that policymakers and <b>curriculum</b> <b>designers</b> intend. One way in which this could happen is {{in relation to the}} mathematics tasks that teachers deploy in the classroom. Teachers and <b>curriculum</b> <b>designers</b> have developed an extensive vocabulary for describing tasks, using adjectives such as ‘rich’, ‘open’, ‘real-life’, ‘engaging’ and so on. But do teachers have a shared understanding of what these adjectives mean when they are applied to mathematics tasks? In Study 1 we investigated teachers’ appraisals of adjectives used to describe mathematics tasks, finding that task appraisals vary on seven dimensions, which we termed engagement, demand, routineness, strangeness, inquiry, context and interactivity. In Study 2, focusing on the five most prominent dimensions, we investigated whether teachers have a shared understanding of the meaning of adjectives when applied to mathematics tasks. We found that there was some agreement about inquiry and context, some disagreement about routineness, and clear disagreement about engagement and demand. We conclude that at least some adjectives commonly used to describe tasks are interpreted very differently by different teachers. Implications for how tasks might be discussed meaningfully by teachers, teacher educators and <b>curriculum</b> <b>designers</b> are highlighted...|$|R

An innovative language <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer,</b> Rassias started, in the early 1980's, immersion language programs for continuing education purposes. These highly efficient 10-day summer programs have enabled adult language learners to make significant gains in their command of the oral and written foreign language {{in a short period of}} time. Some rank beginners have even been able to reach the Intermediate-Low level (ACTFL scale) during the program, an achievement which usually requires three to four semesters in college curricula. At Dartmouth and other U.S. post-secondary institutions, the Rassias Method has been used to teach more than 25,000 students in language acquisition courses. Through the Inter-American Partnership for Education (IAPE) over 1.5 million students of all ages in Mexico have been impacted by faculty trained in the Rassias Method. Finally, language learners worldwide continue to receive instruction in the method through workshops and classes offered through the Rassias Center.|$|E
40|$|Building on {{existing}} {{research into the}} affective domain in legal education, volition and self-determination theory (SDT), we explain how to categorise student motivation types and design a curriculum which meets and supports, or at least does not undermine or damage, students' intrinsic or extrinsic motivations. This categorisation process allows the <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> to obtain a fresh insight into student engagement, particularly by appreciating how to enhance the active forms of extrinsic student motivation, which leads students to internalize their goals, take over the responsibility for their learning and develop {{a strong sense of}} value for their choices. That insight, coupled with an appreciation of SDT's identification of the three human motivational needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness), allows the <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> consciously to address learning, teaching and assessment at a macro- and micro-design level. As one method of approaching curriculum design, we show how to change the learning culture; the environment enables a stronger understanding of students’ behaviours, volition and motivation, creating new ways for the students to internalise their extrinsic motivation (own their learning), leading to fully self-determined actions...|$|E
40|$|This chapter explores mental {{complexity}} theory {{in relation to}} curriculum design and development, {{and its relationship to}} implementation as interactive distance learning. The authors propose that a particular philosophical mindset leads a <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> to choose learning designs that fit within a particular thinking paradigm. The learning strategies designers choose in constructing the curriculum impact significantly on how their learners approach and gain from these experiences. The study explores philosophical paradigms relating to how a curriculum might be conceived and communicated. The authors offer a framework for creating curriculums that help learners to develop skills, knowledge and attitudes appropriate for dealing with greater degrees of intellectual, social and environmental complexity. In this argument, different forms of mental complexity are linked to three learning metaphors and learning design strategies associated with distance learning. The reflections of a <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> demonstrate a changing mental structure. The authors suggest that a curriculum should work on and improve learners' brain agility so they can deal with new and complex issues without being dependent on pre-determined knowledge or solutions. 16 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Curriculum theory’s re-conceptualist movement, {{exemplified}} by William Pinar and Madeleine Grumet’s notion of currere, shifted the field’s emphasis from making curriculum to understanding it. The stream of curriculum thought was diverted {{away from the}} technical formation of curriculum and toward explorations of the lived-experiences of students and teachers. This study reconnects the re-conceptualists’ general neglect of the conversation about making curriculum with their historic move toward understanding. Using currere—a re-conceptualist method of self-conceptualization—the author explores his own lived-experience as a <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> and his scholarly re-conceptualization of curriculum design. The conceptual foundation of currere as a study of educational experience is explored as a prototype of curriculum design’s re-conceptualization. Currere as a method is posited to be a design, which acts to design the author’s autobiographical study of design, folding back upon itself, and becoming in part {{the subject of this}} study. Currere’s designing power iteratively gives shape to the author’s self-conceptualization as a re-conceptualist <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> in four moments of inquiry: (1) the regressive, (2) the progressive; (3) the analytical; and (4) the synthetical. Currere’s designing power acts to problematize the author’s experience of Tylerian curriculum design by revealing its technological irresponsibility as a negation of the future, a neglect of the temporality of lived-experience. Then, the temporality of currere’s design helps recover what has been lost. In his experience of currere as a theorizing of re-conceptualized curriculum design the author recovers a presence of beingness—his being-in-the-world as a biographically situated <b>curriculum</b> <b>designer</b> that is present with the lived-contexts of teaching and study. Re-made by this conceptual journey of currere a new understanding of curriculum design emerged: 1) the productive understanding that brings forth curriculum; 2) a co-evolution of understanding and making curriculum, which identifies and takes responsibility for what is lost; 3) an ensemble of co-created texts made by, and made to fit well with the contingencies and indeterminacies of, the lived-contexts of students and teachers; and 4) something produced from people’s lives...|$|E
