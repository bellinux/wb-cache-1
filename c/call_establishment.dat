5000|$|In {{order to}} show how an SBC works one can compare a simple <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> {{sequence}} with a <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> sequence with an SBC. [...] In the simplest session establishment sequence with only one proxy between the user agents the proxy’s task is to identify the callee’s location and forward the request to it. The proxy also adds a Via header with its own address to indicate the path that the response should traverse. The proxy does not change any dialog identification information present in the message such as the tag in the From header, the Call-Id or the Cseq. Proxies also do not alter any information in the SIP message bodies. Note that during the session initiation phase the user agents exchange SIP messages with the SDP bodies that include addresses at which the agents expect the media traffic. After successfully finishing the session initiation phase the user agents can exchange the media traffic directly between each other without {{the involvement of the}} proxy.|$|E
5000|$|X.25 {{supports}} {{two types}} of virtual circuits, virtual calls (VC) and permanent virtual circuits (PVC). Virtual calls are established on an as-needed basis. For example, a VC is established when a call is placed and torn down after the call is complete. VCs are established through a <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> and clearing procedure. On the other hand, permanent virtual circuits are preconfigured into the network. [...] PVCs are seldom torn down and thus provide a dedicated connection between end points.|$|E
50|$|A {{back-to-back}} {{user agent}} (B2BUA) {{is a logical}} network element in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications. SIP is a signaling protocol to manage multimedia Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone calls. A back-to-back user agent operates between both end points of a phone call or communications session and divides the communication channel into two call legs and mediates all SIP signaling between {{both ends of the}} call, from <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> to termination. As all control messages for each call flow through the B2BUA, a service provider may implement value-added features available during the call.|$|E

Mussolini allowed Pavelić to live in exile in Rome and train his paramilitaries for war with Yugoslavia.

The [...] "fast select with restricted response facility" [...] is intermediate between full <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> and connectionless communication. It is widely used in query-response transaction applications involving a single request and response limited to 128 bytes of data carried each way. The data is carried in an extended call request packet and the response is carried in an extended field of the call reject packet, with a connection never being fully established.|$|E
50|$|Layer 1(CCITT) ITU-G703 {{defines the}} {{physical}} and electrical interface. G704 defines the Frame structure of the 2,048 Mbs sent across the link. G732 defines the allocation of that frame structure into the 32 discrete 64Kbit 'channels', of which 0 is used for alignment of the frames and 16 is (by convention only) allocated to common channel signaling. Speech is carried as G711.Layer 2 Timeslot 16, 64Kbs operates as HDLC LAPB, to support up to 60 PVCs or DLCs (data link connections) (30 directly associated with the bearer channels and 30 for unrelated messages) as the specification describes them. Therefore, at maximum operation, each potential traffic channel can have two simultaneous data channels available for messages. Note that HDLC operates as a statistical multiplexing system. When traffic deltas are low, a single <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> message {{will have access to}} the full 64Kbs (allowing for overheads).DPNSS is a layer 3 protocol functioning as common channel signaling. The functionality is divided into Levels (confusingly nothing to do with OSI layers.) Levels 1-6 deal with simple <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> (make call/break call) and are the minimum requirements by which a PBX can be said to be DPNSS compatible. The remaining levels are allocated to telephony features, supplementary services or to administrative features. Note that support of 'levels' by a PBX is not necessarily incremental. Some levels are interdependent but a PBX may omit support of some levels (above 6) and support others.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{principles}} of crossbar switching existed. One early method {{was based on}} the selector principle, and used the switches as functional replacement for Strowger or stepping switches. Control was distributed to the switches themselves. <b>Call</b> <b>establishment</b> progressed through the exchange stage by stage, as successive digits were dialed. With the selector principle, each switch could only handle its portion of one call at a time. Each moving contact of the array was [...] to corresponding crosspoints on other switches to a selector in the next bank of switches. Thus an exchange with a hundred 10×10 switches in five stages could only have twenty conversations in progress. Distributed control meant there was no common point of failure, but also meant that the setup stage lasted for the ten seconds or so the caller took to dial the required number. In control occupancy terms this comparatively long interval degrades the traffic capacity of a switch.|$|E

The <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> tests showed that the H. 323 protocols could establish calls successfully under severely impaired conditions. The listening tests showed that uncontrolled jitter was the most destructive parameter to listening quality. Packet loss was also influential, though somewhat less dramatically.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{possibility}} of establishing a secure VoIP telephone call using SIP. Different security services relevant for VoIP are presented and we argue that end-to-end authentication and encryption should be provided by default. For media protection we evaluate {{the possibility of}} using either SRTP or IPSec, and we examine several alternatives of how a secure VoIP call can be established. The solution we suggest is based on SRTP for media protection, S/MIME and MIKEY for end-to-end authentication and keying, and TLS for hop-by-hop protection of SIP messages. We also present measurements of secure <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> for MIKEY, SRTP and IPSec using our own SIP user agent (minisip). Our conclusion is that the <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> delay will not be significantly affected by introducing these security protocols. ...|$|E
