This paper {{introduces}} the NooJ module for the Wolof {{language and the}} implemented electronic dictionary. the linguistic resources used are common usage dictionaries including Arame Fall’s and Jean Léopold Diouf’s dictionaries, {{as well as the}} Wolof lexicon available at <b>CLAD</b> (<b>Centre</b> de linguistique Appliquée de Dakar). The present work will first focus on the socio-linguistic situation of the Wolof language while describing its alphabet before, in a second part, introducing the complex morphology of this language. The third part will be devoted to explaining how the core of the dictionary has been constructed and describing the flexional and derivation rules used to implement it in NooJ. Finally, the first results achieved with NooJ will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The article offers {{information}} on the observations made on the Society of College, National and University Libraries' visit to the University of Glasgow Library and Glasgow Caledonian University Saltire Centre in Scotland in December 2006. A number of discussions were held prior to the actual visit {{with a focus on}} the principles for design and functionality of the buildings. It was reported that Glasgow University Library is 12 stories tall built in 1968 and suffers from a number of problems including a leakage in exterior <b>cladding.</b> Saltire <b>Centre</b> in Glasgow Caledonian University wielded a non-traditional outlook with a lot of flexibility in space usage and prominent use of wood in interior design were among the key features of the building...|$|R
2500|$|The common method {{they all}} used was to <b>clad</b> the timber <b>centring</b> (also known as falsework) with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid {{parallel}} with the abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch. The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of}} the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the stones, cutting them to shape as required.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{irregular}} shaped structure and additions are discernible in {{variations in the}} construction and fabric. The original section comprises corrugated iron walls and roof on a concrete base and is located directly {{to the west of}} the main building and parallel to it. The next stage was constructed at the southern end of this section. Later additions were erected on the north western side, causing the site to be extended. The largest addition faces Lamington Street and comprises concrete walls with a sloping corrugated iron roof. This abuts a taller gable roofed section in the <b>centre,</b> <b>clad</b> in corrugated iron. Large openings at the southern and northern ends of the building allow for machinery access.|$|R
60|$|As Alice {{came into}} the room, her eyes fell upon the carpenter, who was {{standing}} near its <b>centre,</b> <b>clad</b> in green woollen jacket, a pair of loose breeches, open at the knees, and with a long pocket for his rule, {{the end of which}} protruded; it was as proper a mark of the artisan's calling as Mr. Pyncheon's full-dress sword of that gentleman's aristocratic pretensions. A glow of artistic approval brightened over Alice Pyncheon's face; she was struck with admiration--which she made no attempt to conceal--of the remarkable comeliness, strength, and energy of Maule's figure. But that admiring glance (which most other men, perhaps, would have cherished as a sweet recollection all through life) the carpenter never forgave. It must have been the devil himself that made Maule so subtile in his preception.|$|R
6000|$|Inside the Egyptian Hall {{there was}} a subject for Hayter--the [...] {{diminutive}} stature of the Queen, covered with diamonds, and her [...] countenance lighted up with the kindest benevolence; Mrs. Fry, her [...] simple Quaker's dress adding to the height of her figure--though a [...] little flushed--preserving her wonted calmness of look and manner; [...] several of the bishops standing near; the platform crowded with waving [...] feathers, jewels, and orders; the hall lined with spectators, gaily [...] and nobly <b>clad,</b> and the <b>centre</b> filled with hundreds of children, [...] brought there from their different schools to be examined. A murmur [...] of applause ran through the assemblage as the Queen took Mrs. Fry by [...] the hand. The murmur {{was followed by a}} clap and a shout, which was [...] taken up by the multitudes without till it died away in the distance.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of {{instrumentation}} technology, the Halden Project has developed several different types of sensors enabling on-line measurement of fuel rod behaviour such as mechanical deformation of fuel stack and cladding, and fuel rod temperature and pressure. In-core measurements using a linear voltage differential transformer as a base instrument enables on-line monitoring of parameters such as fuel stack elongation, <b>cladding</b> elongation, fuel <b>centre</b> temperature and fuel rod pressure. Other on-line information, for example build-up of cladding oxide layer and detection of the point of dry-out {{can be derived from}} the measurements outlined above. Multiple instrumentation, i. e. having instruments in both ends of one or several fuel rods is possible, giving extensive on-line information on fuel rod behaviour during power operation in the reactor. Another sophisticated instrument, especially developed for in-core monitoring, is the diameter gauge which enables on-line measurement of cladding diameter changes due to pellet cladding interaction and creep. For high burn-up applications it is desirable to utilise standard light water reactor fuel rod...|$|R
60|$|A tall, thin, shrivelled, but {{exceedingly}} stately old {{man on a}} gray {{horse was}} in the <b>centre.</b> <b>Clad</b> in a purple velvet mantle, and bowing as he went, he looked truly the Kaisar, to whom stately courtesy was second nature. On one side, in black and gold, with the jewel of the Golden Fleece on his breast, rode Maximilian, responding gracefully to the salutations of the people, but his keen gray eye roving {{in search of the}} object of Sir Kasimir's salute, and lighting on Christina with such a rapid, amused glance of discovery that, in her confusion, she missed what excited Dame Johanna's rapturous admiration--the handsome boy on the Emperor's other side, a fair, plump lad, the young sovereign of the Low Countries, beautiful in feature and complexion, but lacking the fire and the loftiness that characterized his father's countenance. The train was closed by the Reitern of the Emperor's guard--steel-clad mercenaries who were looked on with no friendly eyes by the few gazers in the street who had been left behind in the general rush {{to keep up with the}} attractive part of the show.|$|R
5000|$|Skew bridges are not {{a recent}} invention, having been built on {{exceptional}} occasions since Roman times, but they were little understood and rarely used {{before the advent of}} the railway.One notable exception is an aqueduct, designed by British engineer Benjamin Outram, constructed in masonry and completed in 1798, which still carries the Ashton Canal at an angle of 45° over Store Street in Manchester. Outram's design is believed to be based on work done on the Kildare Canal in Ireland in 1787, in which William Chapman introduced the segmental oblique arch to the design of Finlay Bridge at Naas, employing an arch barrel based on a circular segment that is smaller than a semicircle and which was repeated by Thomas Storey in 1830 in the bridge carrying the Haggerleases branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless near Cockfield, County Durham with a skew angle of 63° and a skew span of 42 ft, resulting in a clear span of 18 ft and a rise of 7 ft.The common method they all used was to <b>clad</b> the timber <b>centring</b> (also known as falsework) with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid parallel with the abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch. The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of the}} crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the stones, cutting them to shape as required.|$|R
40|$|The Flamenco {{dance is}} an {{intricate}} blend of elegant, flowing movement and staccato rhythmic motives. This {{is the concept}} that is abstractly represented by my design for a Flamenco Dance Centre {{in the heart of}} Madrid. The rhythmic displacement of the timber batten <b>cladding</b> enriches the <b>Centre</b> with gradual flowing curves. This design feature allows for a delicate manipulation of light and shade within the building, creating mesmerising patterns to inspire the dancers. Nestled within the eastern facade of Madrid’s well-known Plaza Mayor, this centre for dance provides a cultural hub for the historical square. The design espouses two complementary uses for the building, seamlessly intertwined. During the day it is a specialised museum of Spanish dance, while at night the exhibition spaces become a backdrop for passionate Flamenco dance classes. The presence of sliding mirrored built-ins make this transition possible as they hide the museum after sunset. The building also features a small theatre where performances can be enjoyed. This flows into a ‘Sunrise’ cocktail bar with sweeping views over Madrid. The café downstairs is there for those wishing to absorb the atmosphere of the Plaza, with animated shade and a sense of enclosure provided by the cantilevering shade structure. This design is a contemporary reinterpretation of the traditional stone collonade that wraps the square. The structure is mechanised {{so that it can be}} closed, creating a unique facade and transition space in the evenings. The new timber ‘arch’ and ephermal qualities of glass are used to reflect the buildings rich context. The atrium to the south draws in natural sunlight through the flowing rhythmic cladding while providing legibility to all floors. The roof terrace enjoys maximized north light and a magnificent view of the plaza, the shade evoking the unravelling loose threads of a Flamenco dress. The building intends to provide a vibrant, inspiring cultural hub that promotes Madrid’s rich identity and contributes to the city’s bustling ‘night’ lifestyle.
