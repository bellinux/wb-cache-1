5|$|The {{two teams}} met for a Thursday night game at Blacksburg, {{a time and}} site where the Hokies have {{traditionally}} excelled. In the first quarter, Maryland drove 56yards, but was held to a 46-yard field goal attempt, which was missed by Obi Egekeze. In the next series, Tech quarterback Sean Glennon led the Hokies on an 80-yard drive that culminated in a short pass to Greg Boone for a score. The next series went into the second quarter, and Maryland was again forced to attempt a field goal, which was made good. Hokies tailback Darren Evans then broke away for a 50-yard <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> the Maryland 30-yard line, and later capped it with a one-yard rush into the endzone. Before the half, Tech managed a field goal to expand their lead, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{subsequent}} kickoff, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, allowing Nebraska {{to kick off}} from the 50-yard line instead of the regulation 35-yard line. The kick resulted in a touchback, and Tech started from its 20-yard line. Oxendine picked up nine yards on a rush, and Parker earned another seven yards for a first down at the Tech 36. Oxendine then ran three consecutive times for 17 yards and a first down. After Parker was stopped for no gain, Druckenmiller ran the ball himself for a seven-yard gain and a first down at the Nebraska 40-yard line. Oxendine gained one yard on a <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> the left, but on the next play, Druckenmiller was sacked for an 11-yard loss, negating the minor gain. Druckenmiller then completed a 24-yard pass to Oxendine, but the play was negated by a holding penalty against Virginia Tech, effectively resulting {{in a loss of}} 34 yards and pushing the Hokies back to their 33-yard line. On the first play after the holding penalty, Druckenmiller fumbled the football after he was jarred by Nebraska defender Mike Rucker. The loose ball was picked up by Cornhusker Jason Peter, who ran 31 yards for a defensive touchdown. The score gave Nebraska a 177 lead with 3:36 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} to cut Nebraska's lead before halftime. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback, and Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 20-yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> the left. From the Tech 40-yard line, Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska's {{half of the}} field. Nebraska committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty. Virginia Tech was forced to use a timeout {{in order to stop}} the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third-down play. With 57 seconds remaining in the first half, Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a five-yard pass to Cornelius White, but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line, Tech was again forced to call a timeout to stop the clock with 25 seconds remaining. On the next play, Druckenmiller completed a six-yard pass to Shawn Scales for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The score came with 19 seconds remaining in the first half, and the extra point was good, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714.|$|E

25|$|The {{enormous}} {{distances and}} lack of useful navigation points in the Pacific Ocean led to widespread use of LORAN for both ships and aircraft during the Pacific War. In particular, the accuracy offered by LORAN allowed aircraft {{to reduce the amount}} of extra fuel they would otherwise have to <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> ensure they could find their base after a long mission. This reduced fuel load allowed the bombload to be increased. By the end of World War II there were 72 LORAN stations, with over 75,000 receivers in use.|$|E

We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E

25|$|Bat-pollinated flowers tend to {{be large}} and showy, white or light coloured, open at night and have strong musty odours. They are often large and {{bell-shaped}} or a ball of stamens. Flowers are typically borne away from the trunk or other obstructions. Bats drink the nectar, and these plants typically offer nectar for extended periods of time. Sight, smell, and echo-location are used to initially find the flowers, and excellent spatial memory is used to visit them repeatedly. In fact, bats can identify nectar-producing flowers using echolocation. In the New World, bat pollinated flowers often have sulfur-scented compounds, {{but this does not}} <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> other parts of the world. Bat-pollinated plants have bigger pollen than their relatives.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{jumped to}} an early 3–0 lead with a 32-yard field goal by Gary Anderson. On the first play of the second quarter, Hoge ripped off a 45-yard run, the longest of his career. He ended up rushing for 60 yards on the Steelers drive, {{including}} a 7-yard touchdown <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> increase the Steelers lead to 10-0. Denver responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive to score on Bratton's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the lead to 10-7. But the Steelers stormed right back, with Bubby Brister completing a 25-yard pass to tight end Mike Mularkey and rookie running back Tim Worley contributing a 19-yard carry {{on the way to}} a 9-yard scoring reception by Louis Lipps. Shortly before the end of the half, Broncos kicker David Treadwell made a 43-yard field goal, putting the score at 17-10 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|Things {{kept getting}} worse for Detroit as Danielson threw two more interceptions {{on each of}} their next two possessions, first to safety Dwight Hicks and then to linebacker Keena Turner. However, their defense managed to prevent the 49ers from {{converting}} {{either one of them}} into points. On their next drive, running back Billy Sims took off for a 56-yard <b>carry</b> <b>to</b> the San Francisco 1-yard line before being tackled by Eric Wright. Despite a first and goal on the 1, Detroit could not get into the end zone and settled for Murray's second field goal, cutting the score to 14–6. Following a 49ers punt, Detroit moved the ball to San Francisco's 37-yard line in the closing seconds of the half, where Murray made a playoff record 54-yard field goal that made the score 14–9 going into halftime.|$|E
