25|$|NATO {{decided in}} 1957 to build arsenals {{for nuclear weapons}} in all member countries, {{including}} Norway. Because the weapons were to be operated only by American personnel, this was in violation with Norwegian base policy. However, foreign personnel was allowed to be based in Norway during war, and therefore infrastructure {{would be allowed to}} be built in Norway to allow nuclear weapons to operate from Norway in such a scenario. Norway approved that seven air stations, including Torp, would have <b>conventional</b> <b>ammunition</b> storages that could be converted to nuclear weapons storage facilities in war, and allow the weapons to be transported into Norway following the declaration of war. The arsenals were built underground in bedrock with reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance <b>conventional</b> <b>ammunition</b> and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E

500|$|In 1963, Germany and the United States {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a joint tank program, known as the MBT-70. The new tank carried a three-man crew, with the driver in the turret, an automatic loader for the main gun, a [...] autocannon as secondary armament, an active hydropneumatic suspension and spaced armour on the glacis plate and the front turret. The new tank concept also had improved armament, a [...] missile-launching main gun, designed to fire the MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank missile. However, the German Army was interested in a tank gun which could fire <b>conventional</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Although there were attempts to modify the [...] tank gun to do so, the process proved extremely difficult, and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall 120mm gun instead.|$|E

A 2A72 30mm dual feed autocannon with 500 (300 HEI and 200 APT) rounds and a rate of fire of 350 to 400 RPM, and a 7.62mm PKT machine gun with 2,000 rounds, all mounted coaxially in the turret. The main gun elevates from −5° to +60°. There are also two 7.62mm PKT bow machine guns, again with 2,000 rounds each.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis is to analyze the Requirements Determination procedures in the Navy's <b>Conventional</b> Gun <b>Ammunition</b> System {{in an attempt to}} identify areas for potential improvement. The <b>Conventional</b> Gun <b>Ammunition</b> System involves a logical progression of steps initiated on an annual basis. The Secretary of Defense begins the process by issuing broad guidance for the development of documentation to support budget submissions for combat and non-combat ordnance. The methods and procedures which are then used for determining procurement and renovation requirements involve extensive interactions between the Naval Sea Systems Command, the Ships Parts Control Center, and the Naval Ammunition Production Engineering Center. These interactions are being facilitated by a move toward a real time information system. Finally, areas for Navy concentration such as linking the procurement and renovation budget programs and minimizing delays in inspection and disposal are recommended to help make the future Requirements Determination system more efficient than the present one.

40|$|A roll-decoupled course {{correction}} fuze with canards {{can improve}} the hit accuracy of <b>conventional</b> unguided <b>ammunitions.</b> The fuze increases accuracy by reducing the effect of angular and translational motion produced by the cyclical yawing forces applied on the projectile. In order to investigate the influence of yawing forces on angular motion, a theoretical solution of the total yaw angle function with the cyclical yawing forces is deduced utilizing the 7 degrees of freedom (7 -DOF) model designed for this calculation. Furthermore, a detailed simulation is carried out to determine the influence rules of yawing force on angular motion. The calculated results illustrate that, when the rotational speed of the forward part {{is close to the}} initial turning rate, the total yaw angle increases and the flight range decreases sharply. Moreover, a yawing force at an appropriate frequency is able to correct the gun azimuth and elevation perturbation to some extent...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are some}} {{inconsistencies}} in {{the classification of}} submachine guns. British Commonwealth sources often refer to SMGs as [...] "machine carbines". Other sources refer to SMGs as [...] "machine pistols" [...] because they fire pistol-caliber ammunition, for example, the MP-40 and MP5, where [...] "MP" [...] stands for Maschinenpistole ("Submachine gun" [...] in German, but cognate with the English term [...] "Machine pistol"). However, the term [...] "machine pistol" [...] {{is also used to}} describe a handgun-style firearm capable of fully automatic or burst fire, such as the Stechkin, Beretta 93R and the H&K VP70. Firearms like the FN P90 and H&K MP7 are also referred to as Personal Defense Weapons because the small-caliber, high-velocity ammunition is claimed to offer superior performance to <b>conventional</b> pistol <b>ammunition.</b> In addition, some compact assault rifles, such as the Colt XM177, HK53 and AKS-74U, have been historically referred to as submachine guns as they served in the latter's role.|$|R
5000|$|The {{need for}} even lighter weight than the T-92 {{presented}} the design with a particularly difficult problem; guns capable of defeating modern tanks at reasonable ranges were {{so large that}} they demanded a large vehicle to carry them, so large that they couldn't {{be used as a}} [...] "light" [...] tank. The use of HEAT rounds instead of <b>conventional</b> penetrating <b>ammunition</b> could address this, but HEAT rounds work better at larger calibers. Gun weight is typically the product of caliber and muzzle velocity, so {{in the case of the}} XM551 they sacrificed the muzzle velocity, producing the low-velocity but relatively large-caliber 152 mm M81. HEAT rounds fired by the M81 could defeat any contemporary tank at shorter ranges, but its low velocity made it difficult to use at longer ranges, especially against moving targets. The large low-velocity gun was also ideal for infantry support, where higher performance anti-tank guns would often fire right through soft targets and their small-caliber guns left little room for explosive filler. The M81 would thus be ideal for both direct fire support as well as short-distance anti-tank engagements.|$|R

Penetration dropped to 43 mm at 1000 m and 33 mm at 1500 m. The APCBC round was ineffective at 2000 m. The rarer tungsten Panzergranate 40 armor-piercing composite rigid (APCR) round could penetrate 91 mm at 100 m, but only 49 mm at 500 m. Penetration dropped to 24 mm at 1000 m.
