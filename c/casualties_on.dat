5|$|Swiftsure {{had taken}} {{significant}} damage to its masts, rigging and sails during {{the exchange of}} fire, a deliberate ploy by the French captains to limit the ship's movement and prevent its escape. This had minimised <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> deck by distracting the gunfire, {{and as a result}} only two men were killed and eight wounded, two of whom subsequently also died. French losses were more severe, with four <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Août, although neither ship was significantly damaged in the action.|$|E

5|$|Although the Serbian Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended.

5|$|On 20 December, UB-10 sank {{the last}} two ships under Steinbrinck's command. The 512-ton Belford and the 1,153-ton Huntly were both torpedoed off Boulogne; there were no <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> Belford, but two men on Huntly died in the attack. The Huntly was the former German {{hospital}} ship Ophelia, which had been seized by English naval forces and renamed the previous year.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1950 Tibor Rubin {{was serving}} as a rifleman in Korea when his unit was forced to retreat and {{he was ordered to}} stay behind and keep the road open for the {{withdrawing}} unit. During the 24-hour battle he single-handedly fought off an overwhelming number of North Korean troops, inflicting severe <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> the attacking unit and assisted in the capture of many prisoners. A few months later Chinese forces staged a night-time assault on his unit and Rubin manned a machine gun allowing the unit to retreat southward, again inflicting heavy <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> the attacking unit. During the battle he was severely wounded and was eventually captured by Chinese forces. Although the Chinese offered to release him early and return him to his native Hungary, he refused, remaining a prisoner and risking his life repeatedly by sneaking out at night to get food and medical supplies for other wounded prisoners.|$|E

5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day.

Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E

5|$|At 02:45, the Chinese began a {{sixth and}} final attack {{with a heavy}} mortar barrage which inflicted heavy <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> the {{remaining}} Rangers, including Cummings, who was killed instantly by a mortar shell and Puckett, who was severely wounded. The Chinese then sent a reinforced battalion of 600 infantry at the hill, while simultaneously striking other elements of Task Force Dolvin, preventing artillery from providing effective support. Without artillery support of their own, and low on ammunition, they were overwhelmed by the subsequent Chinese attack. The Chinese forces swarmed the hill in overwhelming numbers, {{and many of the}} Rangers were shot and killed in their foxholes or stabbed with bayonets. The company was destroyed in the fighting, with the survivors retreating from the hill. Three Rangers later chased away Chinese troops as they tried to capture the severely wounded Puckett. The remaining Rangers gathered at an assembly area {{at the base of the}} hill under First Sergeant Charles L. Pitts, the highest ranking unwounded member of the company, and withdrew. The Rangers suffered over 80 percent <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> Hill 205; of the 51 who captured the hill, 10 were killed or missing and another 31 wounded.|$|E
5|$|At Zama, Scipio {{arranged}} his {{men into}} columns, side by side, with large lanes in between.

Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.|$|E

The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty <b>casualties</b> <b>on</b> each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E
