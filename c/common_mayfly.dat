40|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{definitive}} studies, researchers generally assume that preservatives do not alter the size of aquatic invertebrates, and thus seldom correct for any effect of preservation {{on the size of}} studied specimens. We determined the effects of preservation in ethanol (70 %, 95 %) and formaldehyde (5 %, 10 %) on the body length of the larvae of two <b>common</b> <b>mayfly</b> species, Baetis rhodani and Ephemerella ignita. Changes in body length varied depending on the species and preservative used but were not related to specimen size. Length of individuals of both species did not show any further change with increasing time of preservation. The estimation of biomass through length-mass regressions was biased up to 38 % because of sample preservation. Preservation in 5 % formaldehyde did not affect individual lengths of the 2 species and should be used in cases when measures are unfeasible on unpreserved animals. JRC.

40|$|Mining of sulfide-rich pyritic ores {{produces}} acid mine drainage {{waters and}} has induced major ecological problems in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Biomining utilizes microbes to extract metals from the ore, {{and it has}} been suggested as a new sustainable way to produce metals. However, little is known of the potential ecotoxicological effects of biomining. In the present study, biomining impacts were assessed using survival and behavioral responses of aquatic macroinvertebrates at in situ exposures in streams. The authors used an impedance conversion technique to measure quantitatively in situ behavioral responses of larvae of the regionally <b>common</b> <b>mayfly,</b> Heptagenia dalecarlica, to discharges from the Talvivaara mine (Sotkamo, Northern Finland), which uses a biomining technique. Behavioral responses measured in 3 mine-impacted streams were compared with those measured in 3 reference streams. In addition, 3 -d survival of the mayfly larvae and the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in the study sites. Biomining impacts on stream water quality included increased concentrations of sulfur, sulfate, and metals, especially manganese, cadmium, zinc, sodium, and calcium. Survival of the invertebrates in the short term was not affected by the mine effluents. In contrast, apparent behavioral changes in mayfly larvae were detected, but these responses were not consistent among sites, which may reflect differing natural water chemistry of the study sites...|$|E

50|$|A gonopore, {{sometimes}} called a gonadopore, is a genital pore in many invertebrates. Hexapods, including insects {{have a single}} <b>common</b> gonopore, except <b>mayflies,</b> which have a pair of gonopores.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{effect of}} {{anthropogenic}} disturbance on river systems is gaining attention, {{and concerns about}} the state of freshwater natural resources are increasing globally, as are efforts to restore habitat that has been degraded by disturbance. In rivers, non-point source pollution affects the physical characteristics of the habitat and the endemic biotic assemblages. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are numerous and exhibit graded responses to various types of disturbance in the river, and may be used as indicators of habitat conditions. In this dissertation, macroinvertebrates were examined as bioindicators in the Umatilla River in eastern Oregon. The first study is a bioassessment of the impacts of agriculture on the benthic macroinvertebrate community in adjacent streams. The results of this study show that there are physical differences in habitat associated with adjacent land use, and the macroinvertebrate communities responded to these differences with changes in taxa richness and evenness. Indicator species analysis identified thirteen taxa which were indicative of habitat conditions associated with ideal habitat used as a reference condition, degraded habitat associated with agricultural land use, and transitional habitat associated with conservation/restoration management. The second study is a laboratory study in which the effects of temperature of a <b>common</b> <b>mayfly</b> nymph, Epeorus albertae (McDunnough) (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae) were evaluated. The study showed that not only the developmental rate of the nymphs was affected by temperature treatment (within a range of 18 °C and 28 °C), but the location of accumulated body tissues over time varied by temperature, with significant difference in the type of growth observed for insects held at the highest temperature. The third study examined the response of six indicator taxa to environmental variables as predictors of abundance in a non-parametric multiplicative regression. This study found that for all taxa examined, the two best predictors of abundance in the Umatilla River were turbidity and conductivity. Increased turbidity and conductivity are common effects of intensive agriculture in streams located in agro-ecosystems, but may potentially be mitigated by vegetative buffer strips and sustainable land use practices. Long term agricultural disturbance in the landscape has been shown to have lasting effects in the ecosystem which may be further exacerbated as global climate change increases dependence on freshwater resources. Understanding anthropogenic impacts on organismal communities and natural resources is vital to establishment of effective conservation, restoration, and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{are especially vulnerable}} to human impacts associated with agricultural land-use, which provide multiple stressors altering community composition, important ecosystem functions and human valued properties of freshwaters. However, the increased occurrence of excessive levels of nitrate-nitrogen has raised major concerns about toxicity and stress on aquatic life, especially in regions such as the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. The aims of this thesis were to identify nitrate-nitrogen effects on stream communities, and additionally provide field data to inform proposed national bottom lines for nutrients in New Zealand streams. A field survey was conducted on 41 small streams on the Canterbury Plains spanning a nitrate-nitrogen gradient (mean 0. 4 – 11. 3 mg/L). Spot nitrate-nitrogen was collected {{during and after the}} field survey to measure temporal variation in stream nitrate-nitrogen concentration for six months. This showed nitrate-nitrogen concentration varied between season and sub-region, where concentrations increased in winter and Ashburton had higher nitrate-nitrogen than Rangiora and Lincoln, respectively. These regimes of nitrate-nitrogen showed similar patterns in mean, median and maximum concentrations. To be confident my spot nitrate-nitrogen provided a true representation of long-term water chemistry, I compared Environment Canterbury 12 monthly data with my six monthly data in a sub-set of 15 sites. This comparison showed similar nitrate-nitrogen patterns and range of values between the two datasets. I then compared 12 common benthic invertebrate biotic metrics with my nitrate-nitrogen data and found none were correlated with this contaminant. For example, the Macroinvertebrate Community Index and quantitative variant (QMCI) derived to measure the response to organic pollution provided inconsistent results when applied to my streams. Nevertheless, gut content stoichiometry of the <b>common</b> <b>mayfly</b> grazer Deleatidium spp. indicated improvement in food quality (lower C:N ratio) with higher nitrate-nitrogen concentrations. These results indicated either nitrate-nitrogen does not alter invertebrate structural metrics across this nitrate-nitrogen gradient, or that these biotic metrics measure community structure aspects not affected by nitrate-nitrogen. I then investigated possible community composition patterns across the nitrate-nitrogen gradient. Unconstrained ordination (on presence/absence data) showed invertebrate communities at my sites were influenced primarily by discharge and shade, with the next most important driver being nitrate-nitrogen. A constrained ordination (on the same data) testing the singular effect of nitrate-nitrogen showed a marginally non-significant change in composition, with higher variability in community composition at higher nitrate-nitrogen concentrations. A further aim of my study was to test the draft nitrate-nitrogen bands proposed by Hickey (2013). These nitrate-nitrogen bands may advise guidelines to protect aquatic organisms as required by the National Policy Statement on Freshwater. Analysis of my invertebrate communities showed differences in composition, particularly at 6. 9 mg/L bands. Several predatory caddisfly taxa: Triplectides, Neurochorema and Oeconesus were identified as potential indicator species of communities associated with low nitrate-nitrogen. These findings show that nitrate-nitrogen effects are difficult to detect, and {{that it is not the}} main driver of community composition in Canterbury streams. However, nitrate-nitrogen may be an important stressor for sensitive benthic invertebrate communities, as effects were observed on pollution tolerant organisms in this study. Therefore, this research has implications for freshwater ecologists and environmental managers striving to improve the health of streams on the Canterbury Plains...|$|E
