40|$|The new {{paradigm}} for distributed computing over the Internet {{is that of}} Web services. The goal of Web services is to achieve universal interoperability between applications by using standardized protocols and languages. One of the key ideas of the Web service paradigm {{is the ability of}} building complex and value-added service-based applications by composing preexisting services. For a service-based application, in addition to its functional requirements, Quality of service (QoS) requirements are important and deserve a special attention. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-event modeling approach for service-based application. This approach is oriented towards QoS assurance through discrete-event simulation. considered as an example of service aggregators [4]. Multiple and different services such as calling services (e. g., call forwarding and <b>call</b> <b>barring),</b> messaging services (e. g., text messaging and video messaging), and internet services (e. g., chat and e-mail) are brought together and offered via telephone. For an SBA, in addition to its functional requirements, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are important and deserve a special attention. QoS requirements for SBAs include response time, throughput, availability and security [4, 5]. Being able to characterize SBAs based on QoS has three distinct advantages [6]: Keywords: Web Services, Service-based applications, QoS assurance, Discrete-event simulation...|$|E
