40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} the SOC (State of Charge) and the charging–discharging process on the thermal runaway of 18650 lithium-ion batteries. A series of experiments were conducted on an electric heating and testing apparatus. The experimental results indicate that 6 W is the critical heating power for 40 % SOC. With a 20 W constant heating rate, the thermal runaway initial temperature of the lithium-ion battery decreases with the increasing SOC. The final thermal runaway temperature increases with the SOC when the SOC is lower than 80 %. However, a contrary conclusion was obtained when the SOC was higher than 80 %. Significant mass loss, accompanied by an intense exothermic reaction, took place under a higher SOC. The critical <b>charging</b> <b>current,</b> beyond which the thermal runaway occurs, was found to be 2. 6 A. The thermal runaway initial temperature decreases with the increasing <b>charging</b> <b>current,</b> while the <b>intensity</b> of the exothermic reaction varies inversely. Mass ejection of gas and electrolytes exists during thermal runaway when the <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> is higher than 10. 4 A, below which only a large amount of gas is released. The thermal runaway initial temperature of discharging is higher than that of non-discharging...|$|R

Previous studies showed that electrical stimulation of prelymbic produced different effects on morphine-induced condition place preference. In this study, we investigated the electrical stimulation with different <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> on spatial memory in rats. Materials and Methods: In this study, male Wister rats weighing approximately 200 – 300 g were used. The effect of prelymbic electrical stimulation with 25 and 150 μA <b>currents</b> <b>intensities</b> in healthy and addicted rats on spatial memory was studied. Spatial memory was investigated using the Morris water maze test in addicted rats after 9 days of electrical stimulation. Results: Our findings have shown that morphine reduces the memory and learning, whereas the present results indicated that electrical stimulation of prelymbic area with <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> of the 25 μA shortened the time and distance to reach to platform that indicated improvement in spatial memory on addicted rats. Whereas the electrical stimulation of prelymbic area with the <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> of 150 μA has special weakening effects on spatial memory and prolongs the time and distance to reach the platform. Conclusions: The electrical stimulations of prelymbic with 25 μA <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> improved the spatial memory in addicted rats while with 150 μA <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> weakened spatial memory in rats.

40|$|Neuromuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (NMES) {{has been consistently}} demonstrated to improve skeletal muscle function in neurological populations with movement disorders, such as poststroke and incomplete spinal cord injury (Vanderthommen and Duchateau, 2007). Recent research has documented that rapid, supraspinal central nervous system reorganisation/neuroplastic mechanisms are also implicated during NMES (Chipchase et al., 2011). Functional neuroimaging studies have shown NMES to activate a network of sub-cortical and cortical brain regions, including the sensorimotor (SMC) and prefrontal (PFC) cortex (Blickenstorfer et al., 2009; Han et al., 2003; Muthalib et al., 2012). A relationship between increase in SMC activation with increasing NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> up to motor threshold has been previously reported using functional MRI (Smith et al., 2003). However, since clinical neurorehabilitation programmes commonly utilise NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> above the motor threshold {{and up to the}} maximum tolerated <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> (MTI), limited research has determined the cortical correlates of increasing NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> at or above MTI (Muthalib et al., 2012).

However, the relationship between NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> and activation of the motor cortical network, including SMC and PFC, has not been clarified. Moreover, it is of scientific and clinical relevance to know how NMES affects the central nervous system, especially in comparison to voluntary (VOL) muscle activation. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} utilise multi-channel time domain fNIRS to compare SMC and PFC activation between VOL and NMESevoked wrist extension movements...|$|R

Objective: To investigate the effects of skinfold thickness (SFT) on maximal NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensity,</b> NMES-evoked torque, and NMES-induced discomfort. Method: First, we compared NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensity,</b> NMES-induced discomfort, and NMES-evoked torque between two subgroups of subjects with thicker (n= 10; 20. 7 mm) vs. thinner (n= 10; 29. 4 mm) SFT.

The NMES-evoked torque was normalized to the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque. The discomfort induced by NMES was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS). Results: NMES-evoked torque was 27. 5 % lower in subjects with thicker SFT (p= 0. 01) while maximal <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> was 24. 2 % lower in subjects with thinner SFT (p= 0. 01).

METHODS: Six New Zealand female rabbits (2 - 3 kg) were placed on mechanical ventilation. Then, a laparotomy was performed {{in order to identify}} the motor points in each hemidiaphragm, followed by the implantation of the electrodes for diaphragmatic stimulation. We tested two types of electrodes according to the conduction of electrical stimulation: unipolar and bipolar. The electrodes were placed on different occasions in the same animals and tested with <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> of 20, 26 and 32 mA. Each <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> was repeated three times for 10 respiratory cycles with 1 minute interval between each cycle, and 5 minutes for new <b>current</b> <b>intensity.</b> We recorded the relationship between <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> and inspiratory volume. RESULTS: The electrodes adequately stimulate the diaphragm and obtain inspired volumes using different <b>intensity</b> <b>currents.</b> The bipolar electrode generated inspiratory volumes as high as 4. 5 times of baseline while the unipolar electrode reached up to 3. 5 times of baseline. CONCLUSION: This model has proved to be effective for studying the performance of the diaphragm under different electrical stimulations using different set of electrodes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{conventional}} {{symbol for}} current is , which originates from the French phrase intensité de courant, (<b>current</b> <b>intensity).</b> <b>Current</b> <b>intensity</b> {{is often referred}} to simply as current. [...] The [...] symbol was used by André-Marie Ampère, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating Ampère's force law (1820). [...] The notation travelled from France to Great Britain, where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using [...] to [...] until 1896.|$|R
40|$|A full-charge {{indicator}} for battery chargers, {{includes a}} transistor {{which is in}} a conductive state as long as <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> to the battery {{is not less than}} a level which indicates that the battery did not reach full charge. When the battery reaches full charge, a voltage drop in a resistor in the <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> path is not sufficient to maintain the transistor in a conducting state, and therefore it is switched off. When this occurs an LED is turned on, to indicate a full charge state of the battery. A photocoupler together with a photocoupler transistor are included. When the transistor is off, the photocoupler activates the photocoupler transistor to shunt out a resistor, thereby reducing the <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> to the battery to a float <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> and prevent the battery from being overcharged and damaged...|$|R
