40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{on the basis}} of distributions of fish resources and temperatures observed during surveys in the Barents Sea over the period 1983 - 1987. It is found to be useful (although not detailed enough, due to lack of data) for predicting fish migrations at least two to three months ahead of the last survey. This might, for instance, be of great interest for predicting contacts between fish stocks and oil slicks in scenarios of possible oil pollution in the Barents Sea. The model is based on general knowledge of seasonal fish migration modified by seasonal variations in average sea temperature at 50 - 200 m depth. It is postulated that the fish migrate towards a "preference" temperature, either directly, in order to satisfy metabolic requirements, or indirectly, as when attracted by concentrations of food organisms. The highest "preference" temperature, 5. 5 °C, is estimated for southwards winter migration of mature <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> (e. g. to the spawning grounds in the Lofoten-Vesterålen area). For mature capelin 3. 5 °C seems to be the "preference" temperature in the model for southwards winter migration (mainly towards the spawning grounds near Finnmark). During summer the older <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock,</b> preferring the higher temperatures, migrate a shorter distance northwards to feed than do the younger mature and the immature fish of these species. In the model 5. 5 °C is, therefore, used as the "preference" temperature for the northeastwards summer migration of old <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock,</b> while 3. 0 °C is applied as the best "feeding migration" temperature during the same period for younger fish of these species. As capelin in summer may live far north of <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock,</b> the "preference" temperature for northwards summer migration is expected to be lower than for <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock.</b> In the model 1 °C is used as the "preference" temperature for "feeding migration" of immature capelin...|$|R

40|$|In North Norway the {{dominant}} method of exchange for fresh and frozen fish at the ex-vessel level is by direct (contract) sale, whereby price is negotiated between fish processors and the fishermen. More recently, an auction for frozen fish has been introduced. In this paper we investigate {{the relationship of}} prices between these methods of exchange and, in particular, whether the prices develop in a stable pattern between auction and direct sale {{by means of a}} cointegration analysis. Monthly prices of size-graded <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> landed in the period 1997 - 2003 are analysed. For most months, frozen fish sold through auctions realised the highest price, followed by direct sales of fresh and frozen, respectively. Fish sold by auction exhibits a larger monthly variation in price than fish sold directly. Prices for cod were cointegrated to a larger degree than for <b>haddock,</b> <b>and</b> the cointegration was strongest for frozen cod. The analysis also demonstrates that the auction prices for frozen <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> drive the direct sale prices of similar fish, both frozen and fresh, even though the quantity sold via direct sales is greater than that of auctions.

The acoustic recordings showed a considerable diurnal vertical migration of <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock.</b> The fish seemed to stay close to bottom by night and lift off from bottom by day.

40|$|<b>Cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> {{captured}} {{with commercial}} trawling gear were taken immediately after landing on deck to on-board storage in dry bins for measuring brain and heart activity, and behaviour. Other groups were first stored in holding tanks and then electrically stunned with a prototype "dry stunner". For stunning 52 V-rms was applied on individual fish for 1 s. As a result, the <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> received an electrical current of 0. 34 +/- 0. 09 and 0. 36 +/- 0. 12 A(rms), respectively. Electrical {{activity in the}} brain and heart was measured before and after electrical stunning. The fish remained conscious for at least 2 h after landing and during on-board storage as indicated by the electrical activity measured in brain and heart. Behavioural responsiveness to administered stimuli was absent in both species. After electrical stunning, both species showed a general epileptiform insult which was characterised by a tonic phase followed by a clonic phase and terminating with an exhaustion phase. Since the fish remained conscious after landing and storage, electrical stunning and subsequent killing with a throat cut, may provide an option for improving fish welfare on-board commercial fishing vessels. In particular, we recommend to stun <b>and</b> kill wild <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> as soon as possible after landing on deck using a dry stunner applying 52 V-rms (coupled AC/DC current) for more than 3 s.

The cod end of the trawl, which I {{have had the opportunity to}} examine on board the "Borgenes", was tied with 16 knots pr. 24 inches when new and waterproofed. A somewhat older cod end in use had 1 or 2 more knots pr. 24 inches, which proves some shrinking of the net by usage. On board the boat I procured some pieces of net made of new waterproofed twine and I found out that mesh of the size of 14 knots pr. 24 inches would allow small haddock of about 30 cm to escape. My impression is that something would be gained by the introduction of a size of mesh in the cod end of 2 - 3 knots less pr. 24 inches than the one now generally used by the British trawlers. That the limitation of the size of mesh is a step in the right direction appears correct, judging from the experiments performed by attaching a piece of fine meshed net to the bag of the trawl. This has not only been tried during the investigations of S/S "Borgenes" last winter, but in addition several times on the cruises of "Michael Sars" during previous years. This moderate form of regulating the trawling operations for the protection of the fry, will be of benefit not only to the <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> population, but will also protect several other varieties of fish.
