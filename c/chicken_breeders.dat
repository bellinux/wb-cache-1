40|$|The {{development}} of business world today has undergone much progress. Various types of businesses {{have started to}} pop up. Speaking of livestock, the livestock sector {{is an integral part}} of agricultural sector development prioritized to meet the needs of food and nutrition. The {{development of}} livestock sector is part of the overall development which aims to provide food in the form of meat, milk, and eggs which have high nutritional value as well as increasing the farmer's or breeder’s income and expand the employment opportunity. The chickenbroiler is a very effective chicken to produce meat. In general, the main weaknesses in this business lie in the relatively small capital, lack of knowledge on maintaining the management capability, and relatively high price of feed. Another problem that occurs in this business is the field of marketing. One of the best ways that can be recommended in the development of broiler chicken agribusiness is the implementation of vertical coordination system with the partnership pattern. The problem discussed by the author in this study is about the partnership concept application between PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia through its subsidiary of PT.

DNA-based marker-assisted selection could help <b>chicken</b> <b>breeders</b> to accelerate genetic improvement for comb or related economic characters by early selection. Although a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes have been identified with advances in molecular genetics, candidate genes underlying comb traits are limited. The aim {{of the study was}} to use genome-wide association (GWA) studies by 600 K Affymetrix chicken SNP arrays to detect genes that are related to comb, using an F 2 resource population. For all comb characters, comb exhibited high SNP-based heritability estimates (0. 61 - 0. 69). Chromosome 1 explained 20. 80 % genetic variance, while chromosome 4 explained 6. 89 %. Independent univariate genome-wide screens for each character identified 127, 197, and 268 novel significant SNPs with CL, CH, and CW, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the consequences of splitting sequencing effort over multiple breeds for imputation accuracy from a high-density SNP chip towards whole-genome sequence. Such information would assist for instance numerical smaller cattle breeds, but also pig and <b>chicken</b> <b>breeders,</b> who have to choose wisely how to spend their sequencing efforts over all the breeds or lines they evaluate. Sequence data from cattle breeds was used, because there are currently relatively many individuals from several breeds sequenced within the 1, 000 Bull Genomes project. The advantage of whole-genome sequence data is that it carries the causal mutations, but the question is whether it is possible to impute the causal variants accurately. This study therefore focussed on imputation accuracy of variants with low minor allele frequency and breed specific variants. Results Imputation accuracy was assessed for chromosome 1 and 29 as the correlation between observed and imputed genotypes. For chromosome 1, the average imputation accuracy was 0. 70 with a reference population of 20 Holstein, and increased to 0. 83 when the reference population was increased by including 3 other dairy breeds with 20 animals each. When the same amount of animals from the Holstein breed were added the accuracy improved to 0. 88, while adding the 3 other breeds to the reference population of 80 Holstein improved the average imputation accuracy marginally to 0. 89. For chromosome 29, the average imputation accuracy was lower. Some variants benefitted from the inclusion of other breeds in the reference population, initially determined by the MAF of the variant in each breed, but even Holstein specific variants did gain imputation accuracy from the multi-breed reference population. Conclusions This study shows that splitting sequencing effort over multiple breeds and combining the reference populations is a good strategy for imputation from high-density SNP panels towards whole-genome sequence when reference populations are small and sequencing effort is limiting. When sequencing effort is limiting and interest lays in multiple breeds or lines this provides imputation of each breed...|$|E

Feather colour of local poultry is variable but the partridge (18. 55 %), the black (12. 52 %), the light brown (9. 05 %) and the brown (8. 13 %) are dominants. The comb is predominantly with a simple type (99 %) and essentially the pink (59. 58 %) and light pink (29. 26 %) colour are encountered. The ear lobes are pink (45. 40 %) and white (36. 80 %). The beak colour goes from white (0. 3 %) through yellow (9. 61 %) and black (27. 45 %) to brown (40. 27 %). The skin is essentially pink, light pink but legs are white and grey. Eyes are most orange (70. 14 %) and brownish (27. 75 %). The two sexes {{were not significantly different}} for body measurements. The hen weighs 773. 04 g ± 322. 71 and the coq 745. 84 g ± 353. 7. The region had an effect on body measurements because Dassa’s chickens had average value globally higher than the one in Toffo.

This study was carried out on eight broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chicken</b> flocks with a history of MG challenge {signs, post mortem, and serology [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ]}. Tilmicosin (Provitil powder ® 30 mg/kg body weight) was used to limit MG infection in these flocks, and was given to birds for 3 successive days every 5 weeks for 4 months. 136 serum samples were collected from these flocks (16 - 18 samples per flock) before starting tilmicosin treatment and the same number of serum samples were collected following each three treatment course at 5 weeks interval. Mycoplasma gallisepticum ELISA was performed on these samples for the purpose of detecting MG antibodies in these flocks and analyzing data subsequently. The first and second course of tilmicosin treatment did not have any significant effect on MG ELISA results (GMT) (P> 0. 05), while after the third course, GMT had dropped significantly (P< 0. 05) in all tested flocks compared to results gained prior starting treatment with tilmicosin. The overall sero-prevalence of MG in broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chicken</b> population involved in the study was 80. 43 % and 44. 09 % before and after completing medication with tilmicosin respectively, while the percentage of antibody positive chickens among flock samples ranged from 38. 88 - 100 % and 18. 75 - 56. 25 % before and after complete medication with tilmicosin respectively (P< 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT Amino acid {{requirements}} of broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chickens</b> are notwell known. The indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique was adapted {{for use in}} broiler breeders as a rapid and sensitive method to determine amino acid requirements. During IAAO, phe-nylalanine oxidation decreases, inversely to the changes in protein synthesis, as the intake of the limiting test amino acid increases from deficient to adequate. Above the adequate level, phenylalanine oxidation remains con-stant. Before IAAO can be employed, the optimum prim-ing and constant infusion doses of phenylalanine must be determined. Prelaying catheterized birds aged 20 to 24 wk were placed in closed oxidation chambers attached to a breath collection apparatus. A constant L-[1 - 14 C]phe-nylalanine dose of 3. 5 µCi/kg BW/h and priming doses of 4. 5, 5. 5, and 7. 0 µCi/kg BW {{were used to determine}} (Key words: amino acid, requirement, infusion dose, indicator amino acid oxidation, broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chicken...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite {{the great}} efforts poultry {{breeding}} companies made towards eradication of pathogenic mycoplasmas from poultry flocks, Still Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection is of continuing economic concern in commercial broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chicken</b> flocks. Control of MG infection in broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chicken</b> flocks by chemotherapy {{is the most}} practical way to minimize economical losses. Tilmicosin {{is one of the}} most important antimicrobial agent used for treatment and control of MG infection. This study was carried out on eight broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chicken</b> flocks with a history of MG challenge {signs, post mortem, and serology [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ]}. Tilmicosin (Provitil powder ® 30 mg/kg body weight) was used to limit MG infection in these flocks, and was given to birds for 3 successive days every 5 weeks for 4 months. 136 serum samples were collected from these flocks (16 - 18 samples per flock) before starting tilmicosin treatment and the same number of serum samples were collected following each three treatment course at 5 weeks interval. Mycoplasma gallisepticum ELISA was performed on these samples for the purpose of detecting MG antibodies in these flocks and analyzing data subsequently. The first and second course of tilmicosin treatment did not have any significant effect on MG ELISA results (GMT) (P> 0. 05), while after the third course, GMT had dropped significantly (P< 0. 05) in all tested flocks compared to results gained prior starting treatment with tilmicosin. The overall sero-prevalence of MG in broiler breeder chicke...|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} the intestinal microflora balance in animals {{it is important}} to prevent diseases by controlling the overgrowth of potentially patho-genic bacteria. The control of infections through a nonantibiotic approach is urgently requested. The natural bacterial flora (e. g. probiotic bacteria) rep-resents a promising alternative therapy. Probiotics were defined as “living microorganisms that upon ingestion in certain numbers exert health effects beyond inherent basic nutrition ” (Guarner and Schaafsma, 1998). They have been the object of studies at an international scale since the middle of the twentieth century. The use of probiotics in poultry was pioneered by Tortuero (1973), who re-ported an increase in growth rate in chicks given a Lactobacillus acidophilus culture in drinking water for 11 days from hatching. Similar results on the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus cultures on the growth of chickens were also reported by several researchers (Kalbane et al., 1992; Jin et al., 1998). Nahashon et al. (1996) described a positive effect of the applied Lactobacillus on egg produc-tion. The exclusion of pathogenic bacteria is espe-cially important in newly hatched broiler <b>chickens.</b> <b>Breeder</b> vaccinations are routinely used in broiler breeders to provide the newly hatched chicks with yolk-derived maternal antibodies. Because in mod-ern production methods the newly hatched chick has no contact with maternal faeces and thus no maternal spectrum of antigens is present, allow-ing the development of an active immune system.

40|$|A 14 -year {{study of}} the {{epizootiology}} of chicken salmonellosis was described on a broiler farm keeping a closed flock of New Hampshire <b>breeder</b> <b>chickens</b> and conducting a breeder-hatcher plan. Pullorum disease was eradicated by the serological method. The agglutination test adopted for <b>breeder</b> <b>chickens</b> was no value for elimination of Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella newington or Salmonella senftenberg infection. The single cloacal swab culture test was carried out {{every year for the}} detection of carriers from <b>breeder</b> replacement <b>chickens</b> by the age of about 50 days on the basis of results from an experiment on shedding Salmonella in feces and the duration of infection in growing chickens naturally infected with S. newington.

The significance of wild rat (Rattus norvegicus) as a carrier in chicken salmonellosis was indicated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of Newcastle disease (ND) in commercial chickens in Malaysia {{was associated with}} infiltration of myeloid cells in the organs of the affected chickens {{which has not been}} reported previously and was consistent to those of Avian Leukosis Sub-group J (ALV-J) infection. However, {{little is known about the}} disease and it was the objective of the study to determine the sero-prevalence and lesions of ALV-J infection in broiler <b>chickens.</b> Broiler <b>breeders</b> (120) of 66 -week-old from two breeder farms in Selangor and Malacca were used in the study. They were divided into 4 groups namely groups A 1 (30 hens) or A 2 (30 cocks) and B 1 (36 hens) or B 2 (24 cocks) of chickens from Selangor and Malacca, respectively. The broiler chickens (125) of 5 -week-old were sampled from four broiler farms in Johor identified as groups C, D, E and F. The clinical signs were recorded and serum samples were collected for ALV-J antibody detection using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) technique. On necropsy, the gross lesions were recorded. Samples of brain, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, ribs and sciatic nerve, and bursa of Fabricius were collected from the broiler breeders and broilers, respectively for histopathology. The study showed that 10 % of the broiler breeder had mild lameness, mainly due to bumble foot (83 %). Fatty livers (12 %), Pasteurella multocida infections (4 %) and splenomegaly (2. 5 %) were also recorded. The chickens in the group C and D had complicated chronic respiratory disease (CCRD). Histologically, infiltrations of myeloid cells were found in the liver of a bird from the group A 1. Infiltration of myeloid cells in the follicles of the bursa of Fabricius was also observed in chickens from groups C (10 %), D (20 %), E (50 %) and F (30 %). Moderate to severe lesion scoring of the bursa of Fabricius was recorded. The ALV-J antibody was detected in <b>breeder</b> <b>chickens</b> in groups A 1 (27 %), A 2 (27 %), B 1 (36 %) and B 2 (42 %), but was not detected in the broiler chickens. It was concluded that broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chickens</b> in Malaysia is not free from ALV-J infections. The overall sero-prevalence of ALV-J in the broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>chickens</b> was 33 % with no differences between the hens and cocks. The presence of myeloid cells infiltration in the follicles of the bursa of Fabricius, 10 to 50 % of the samples examined suggests that broiler chickens are at high risk of ALV-J infection...|$|R
