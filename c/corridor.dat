40|$|Abstract: We analyze {{global and}} Annex I {{emissions}} <b>corridors</b> {{for the st}} century. Emissions <b>corridors</b> repre-sent the range of admissible emissions futures which observe some predefined constraints. They are calculated on the conceptual and methodological basis of the tolerable windows approach. We assess {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>corridors</b> to limits on the non-intolerable magnitude of climate change, the acceptable rate of emissions reduc-tions and the feasible transition pace towards a decarbonizing economy. In addition we consider the influence of climate sensitivity on the <b>corridors.</b> While we calculate the global emissions <b>corridors</b> for the idealized as-sumption of a single global emitter, the Annex I emissions <b>corridors</b> are computed for the case of two emitters that have to obtain equal per capita emissions rights as of the year 2050. Results show a large dependence of the <b>corridors</b> on the climate change limit and the climate sensitivity. When the limits are varied within their plausible range, we move from a climate policy regime with vanishing emissions <b>corridors</b> to a regime, where no action seems necessary. The economic parameters have a much larger impact on the the Annex I <b>corridors</b> than on the global emissions <b>corridors.</b> Due to the long term requirement of equal per capita emissions rights, the size of Annex I emissions <b>corridors</b> is strongly influenced by the emissions reductions capabilities of the Annex I countries in the long {{as well as in the}} short run...|$|R
