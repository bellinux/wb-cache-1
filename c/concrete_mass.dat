500|$|Hunt's {{pedestal}} design {{contains elements}} of classical architecture, including Doric portals, {{as well as}} some elements influenced by Aztec architecture. The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail, in order to focus attention on the statue. In form, it is a truncated pyramid, [...] square at the base and [...] at the top. The four sides are identical in appearance. Above the door on each side, there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states (between 1876 and 1889, there were 38 U.S. states), although this was not done. Above that, a balcony was placed on each side, framed by pillars. Bartholdi placed an observation platform {{near the top of the}} pedestal, above which the statue itself rises. According to author Louis Auchincloss, the pedestal [...] "craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty". The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work. Construction on the [...] foundation began in 1883, and the pedestal's cornerstone was laid in 1884. In Hunt's original conception, the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite. Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans; the final design called for poured concrete walls, up to [...] thick, faced with granite blocks. This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in Branford, Connecticut. The <b>concrete</b> <b>mass</b> was the largest poured to that time.|$|E

50|$|Some {{commercial}} buildings {{are designed to}} take advantage of thermal mass which is heated or cooled during off peak hours when utility rates are lower. With the heating/cooling system turned off during the day, the <b>concrete</b> <b>mass</b> and room temperature drift up or down within the desired comfort range.

40|$|The {{construction}} of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> elements poses several risks {{with regard to}} thermal damage, which results from the thermal characteristic and size of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> elements. If the heat of hydration generated in <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> is not controlled or dissipated properly, thermal damage may result by means of thermal cracking and/or delayed ettringite formation. The objectives of the present research are: (1) to {{have an understanding of}} how different mix proportions, construction, and environmental conditions affect the thermal development of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete.</b> (2) To identify and compare the similarities and differences of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> specifications for different agencies throughout the United States. (3) To explore a tool for effectively analyzing temperature development and cracking potential of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete.</b> (4) Provide rational recommendations for improving current <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> specifications. In this study, a literature and specification survey was conducted to determine typical construction practices, and to identify conditions that typically have the largest effect on the thermal development of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete.</b> A case study was developed for two typical Midwest boarder bridges, and was utilized to calibrate and verify ConcreteWorks. ConcreteWorks is a concrete thermal analysis software program, capable of predicting the early age thermal behavior of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete.</b> ConcreteWorks was then utilized to validate conditions that are believed to have the largest effect on the thermal development of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete.</b> The research also provides two case studies of typical Midwest boarder bridges that may be used to calibrate other thermal analysis software programs. Through the sensitivity study, the research also verifies conditions that have the largest effect on the thermal development of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> for Midwest boarder bridges. The research determined: (1) How different mix proportion, construction, and environmental conditions affect the thermal development of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete.</b> (2) There is little consistency between <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> specifications between state agencies. (3) ConcreteWorks is capable of effectively analyzing the temperature development and cracking potential of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> elements. (4) Performance based specifications should be utilized to allow contractors more flexibility {{in the design of the}} {{construction of}} <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> placements. Furthermore, additional specification requirements should be implemented for the thermal monitoring of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> elements to assure accurate temperature readings. This research contributes to the current knowledge of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> by providing recommendations for specification improvement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The factor {{distinguishing}} between normal <b>concrete</b> and <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> is the thermal characteristics. <b>Mass</b> <b>concrete</b> {{is defined as}} “any volume of concrete with dimensions large enough to require that measures be taken to cope with generation of heat from hydration of the cement and attendant volume change to minimize cracking. ” Use of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> has been in existence {{over the last two}} centuries, and it has lately been reaching its full potential in the construction industry. The proper design and construction of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> placements is essential to ensure the durability and serviceability of the structure. <b>Mass</b> <b>concrete</b> is required in massive structures containing beams, columns, piers, dams where its volume is of such a magnitude as to require special means for coping with the generation of heat and which is followed by volume change. This paper explains the factors influencing generation of heat of hydration (cracking) along with the different ways to lower the heat of hydration and then the methods to be implemented for its reduction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{an engineering}} experience {{of solving the}} problem of thermal cracking in <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> by using a large project, Zhongguancun No. 1 (Beijing, China), as an example. A new method is presented for controlling temperature cracks in the <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> of a foundation. The method involves controlled cycles of water circulating between the surface of <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> foundation and the atmospheric environment. The temperature gradient between the surface and {{the core of the}} <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> is controlled at a relatively stable state. Water collected from the well-points used for dewatering and from rainfall is used as the source for circulating water. <b>Mass</b> <b>concrete</b> of a foundation slab is experimentally investigated through field temperature monitoring. Numerical analyses are performed by developing a finite element model of the foundation with and without water circulation. The calculation parameters are proposed based on the experiment, and finite element analysis software MIDAS/CIVIL is used to calculate the 3 D temperature field of the <b>mass</b> <b>concrete</b> during the entire process of heat of hydration. The numerical results are in good agreement with the measured results. The proposed method provides an alternative practical basis for preventing thermal cracks in <b>mass</b> <b>concrete...</b>|$|R

In contrast to conventional concrete core activation, the capillary tubes used in thermal building component activation lie about 5 mm close under the ceiling surface. This arrangement ensures a fast reaction and a high transmission performance of up to 90 W/m² (at 10 K temperature difference, see above), and also uses the <b>concrete</b> <b>mass</b> as a thermal accumulator. Capillary tube mats {{can be used for}} the construction of very thinly built-up heating surfaces as underfloor or wall heating. A layer thickness of less than 15 mm is quite feasible.

These are full containment vessels with an inner nickel-steel alloy and an outer pre-stressed concrete wall with a reinforced concrete roof. The tanks were constructed in the north-west part of the site {{to the north of the}} existing tanks. Each tank has a <b>concrete</b> <b>mass</b> of 72,000 tonnes and is supported on 1,560 piles, 600 mm in diameter and a depth of 24 metres. The new facilities included eight submerged combustion water bath vapourisers. These heat and vapourise LNG flowing in stainless steel coils from minus 162°C to 6°C. Two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) gas turbines provide power to the site, and the waste heat is piped to the adjacent vapourisers, to reduce the gas required for firing. The cost of the Phase 2 facilities was £350m. The capacity was sold to three customers: Sonatrach (Algeria), Centrica and Gaz de France. Under phase 2, a further 6.5 million tonnes per year of capacity was contracted on a long term basis from December 2008.
