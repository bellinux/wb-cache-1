40|$|Demand-Adaptive Systems (DASs) offer demand {{responsive}} services {{within the framework}} of traditional scheduled bus transportation. A DAS bus line serves a set of <b>compulsory</b> <b>stops</b> according to a predefined schedule, which specifies the time windows associated with each stop. Passengers may issue requests for transportation involving optional stops, that induce detours in the vehicle route. The design of a DAS line is therefore a complex planning process that requires to select the <b>compulsory</b> <b>stops</b> and to determine the line master schedule in terms of a time window for each such stop. In this paper, we focus on determining the master schedule for a single DAS line. We propose a mathematical description and a solution method based on probabilistic approximations of several DAS line core characteristics. Results of numerical experiments are also given and analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Karl Reindler was spun by Paul Morris on {{the opening}} lap while Brad Lowe pitted with a {{steering}} problem. Jason Richards, Steven Johnson and Michael Patrizi pitted early in the race getting the <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> for either race out of the way.

50|$|As {{with the}} station {{buildings}} at Bodiam and Northiam, a corrugated iron structure was provided at Wittersham Road, {{but this time}} lacking a platform awning. Unlike however all the Rother Valley stations, the station building at Wittersham Road was built at a right-angle to the platform. According to a 1948 timetable, the station was a <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> for all trains from at least 1929 and possibly even earlier.|$|E
50|$|Following {{from the}} restart, Jack Perkins had engine problems, {{stalling}} at turn 11 and {{being hit by}} Paul Dumbrell causing his retirement and a penalty to Dumbrell which caused the second safety car on lap 8.

50|$|Within {{weeks of}} Paulhan's victory, the Daily Mail offered a new prize; £10,000 {{to the first}} aviator to cover a 1,000-mile (1,609-km) circuit of Britain in a single day, with 11 <b>compulsory</b> <b>stops</b> at fixed intervals. The {{challenge}} was completed by M Beaumont on 26 July 1911, in about 22½ hours. Paulhan and Grahame-White competed again later in 1910, for the newspaper's prize of £1,000 for the greatest aggregate cross-country flight, which Paulhan won.|$|R
50|$|Bus {{services}} are extensive and Blaydon Bus Station is a <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> for all routes operating through the town.

50|$|The {{branch line}} has 8 level {{crossings}} along its length, {{all of which}} are protected by <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> signs. Issues with these were raised in the community in 2004 as legally traffic has to stop even though trains seldom ran more than once a month. The Land Transport Safety Authority (now NZTA) would not allow Give Way signs and reinstating bells and lights had been reported as costing over $250,000 per crossing (almost the purchase price of the entire line in 1999) making installation unlikely for foreseeable future. Rail operations have become more frequent since then but motorists failing to stop for the societies trains is still an issue.|$|E
50|$|The 1911 race {{took place}} on 22 July and was a 1010 mi event with 11 <b>compulsory</b> <b>stops</b> and a {{circular}} route starting and finishing at Brooklands in Surrey.The winner was Jean Conneau in a Blériot XI who took 22 hours, 28 minutes to complete the course, an average speed of 45 mph and received the first prize of £10,000.

5000|$|Leendert Hasenbosch {{was likely}} born in The Hague, Holland in 1695. Around the year 1709 his father, a widower, moved {{himself and his}} three daughters to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (Modern Indonesia) while Leendert stayed in Holland. On 17 January 1714, Hasenbosch became a soldier of the Dutch East India Company, (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, {{henceforth}} VOC) and boarded the flute-ship [...] "Korssloot" [...] in Enkhuizen bound for Batavia where he served for about a year. From 1715 to 1720 he served in Cochin, a Dutch possession at the time. In 1720 he returned to Batavia and was promoted to corporal. He later became a military writer, responsible for small-scale bookkeeping. In 1724, he took a position aboard a VOC ship as the ship's bookkeeper. On 17 April 1725, Hasenbosch was convicted of sodomy following the ship's <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> in Cape Town. On 5 May 1725, he was set ashore on Ascension Island as punishment.|$|E
50|$|Vettel caught Alonso and {{the pair}} battled over second while Webber {{continued}} {{to extend his}} lead. The Australian's task was made much more difficult {{by the presence of}} backmarkers on the short, tight circuit, but when he pitted on lap 42, he emerged five seconds ahead of Alonso. The only other major position change came when Rubens Barrichello - the second front-running driver who did not pit as a response to Liuzzi's safety car - made his <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> from fifth position. Williams had been attempting a similar strategy to BMW Sauber with Kamui Kobayashi in Valencia by having Barrichello pit late and charge back up through the field on super-soft tyres. Unlike Webber, Barrichello was unable to preserve his position and slipped down the order to eleventh behind Schumacher. He then attempted to glide through the field with ease, but quickly became trapped behind his former team-mate. Things came to a head late in the race when Barrichello was able to get close enough to pass Schumacher on the main straight, but Schumacher attempted to pin Barrichello to the wall and force him to back off. However, Schumacher's move came too late, and Barrichello was already alongside him when the Mercedes driver moved over. Barrichello very nearly made contact with the concrete pit wall and was forced across the pit exit, but took the place from Schumacher, who was placed under investigation by the stewards for dangerous driving. He was later issued a ten-place grid penalty for his actions, to be taken at the next race in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} {{organised}} by the Royal Aero Club, and would run from RAF Mildenhall in East Anglia to Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne, approximately 11300 mi. There were five <b>compulsory</b> <b>stops</b> at Baghdad, Allahabad, Singapore, Darwin and Charleville, Queensland; otherwise the competitors could {{choose their own}} routes. A further 22 optional stops were provided with stocks of fuel and oil by Shell and Stanavo. The Royal Aero Club put some effort into persuading the countries along the route to improve the facilities at the stopping points.|$|R

5000|$|Changes {{were made}} to the race regulations, with the soft {{compound}} tyre being used {{in the race for the}} first time and the number of <b>compulsory</b> pit <b>stops</b> being reduced from four to three. The requirement for cars to make four <b>compulsory</b> pit <b>stops</b> had been introduced for the 2013 race, when the engines used by Nissan Motorsport and Erebus Motorsport (which was then running Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs) struggled to match the fuel economy of the Ford and Holden engines. With Erebus Motorsport switching to Holden VF Commodores for the 2016 season and Nissan Motorsport improving the performance of its engines, the decision was made to reduce the number of <b>compulsory</b> pit <b>stops.</b> Nissan Motorsport were unconcerned by the change, with team owner and driver Todd Kelly saying: [...] "We have gone ahead in leaps and bounds in economy since the four stops were implemented - everyone has...If we were worried about it we would have put something up to the commission, which we haven’t done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} Toledan presence in the film is the Cathedral—or, rather, the bell of the Cathedral--featured repeatedly in {{the sights and sounds}} of the movie. The bell is most prominent as a nightmare (and later a fantasy), as Tristana dreams that the clapper has metamorphosed into the severed head of her guardian. The first occurrence of the nightmare signals the impending consummation of the sexual relationship between Tristana and Don Lope, and the last, his impending death. The bell, then, is an omen, but also a reminder:The itinerary of Tristana is that of her own life, which, in a rapid finale to the movie, passes before us like an oneiric dream turned nightmare in the identity of the head-bell of Don Lope signifying the unchangeable ringing of a stagnant society…However, underlying that static world, mummified and without exit, Buñuel exposes the turbulent movement of the subconscious. That which is real is arrested, but that which is imaginary seethes in desire and vengeance.In his own Toledan explorations, Buñuel returned frequently to the bell tower, considering it a <b>compulsory</b> <b>stop</b> in the nocturnal activities of the Order. In the film, this reverence is evident, as the bell’s metronomic tolls, both conscious and unconscious, evoke the memory of the Order in its surrealist wanderings between waking and dreaming. Tristana is based on a novel of the same name published by Benito Pérez Galdós in 1892. The setting of the novel was late-19th century Madrid. By translating the story to early-20th century Toledo, Buñuel makes not only a spacial return to that sacred city, but also a spiritual and temporal return to the Toledo that the Order knew. This return, however, is not explicit, nor is it complete. The Toledo of the era of the Order had changed irrevocably in the succession of wars, Franco, and modernity. Buñuel had changed too, and the fact was that in his lifetime he would never make a complete return; his time in Spain lasted only as long as it took to shoot his films.|$|E
50|$|Just {{before the}} race, it was {{announced}} that the second pit stop window will be between laps 25 and 33. The race start at 15:00, local time.
