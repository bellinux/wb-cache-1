5|$|On 8 January 1999, Pakistan's Judicial Commission held {{a hearing}} in Melbourne into bribery and match-fixing. The {{commission}} had originally summoned Waugh and Warne to Pakistan but the ACB instead decided to offer them court privileges in Australia. Both Warne and Waugh gave evidence at the public hearing. Waugh seemed nervous and uncertain, whereas Warne appeared assured and <b>confident.</b> <b>They</b> were questioned for approximately 80 and 45 minutes respectively. The Pakistani investigators attempted to link the Australians' dealings with John to various games between Pakistan and Australia in 1994, over which they had suspicions of match-fixing.|$|E

"Gore {{talked about}} 2005 and 2004 being very strong seasons, {{and if you}} weren't paying attention, you could be left with the {{impression}} that there was a direct cause and effect, but he was very careful to not say there's a direct correlation," [...] Schmidt said. [...] "There is a difference between saying 'we are <b>confident</b> that <b>they</b> will increase' and 'we are <b>confident</b> that <b>they</b> have increased due to this effect,'" [...] added Steig.

25|$|Many of {{the whites}} and free people of color who left Saint-Domingue for the United States settled in {{southern}} Louisiana, adding many new members to its French-speaking, mixed-race, and black populations. The exiles causing {{the greatest amount of}} alarm were the African slaves who came with their refugee owners. Some southern planters grew concerned that the presence of these slaves who had witnessed the revolution in Haiti would ignite similar revolts in the United States. However other planters were <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> had the situation under control.|$|E
25|$|He also {{describes}} how his first chronological victim was actually Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drugs trafficker who anonymously purchased {{the island and}} arranged the invitations on his behalf. Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island. Wargrave's intention {{is that when the}} police arrive they will find ten bodies, with evidence that someone had been alive after each death, but nobody else on the island, and no way to trace the killer through his invitations or preparations. He states that, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the correct killer, he is <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> will be unable to do so and that the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is retrieved.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the loss}} of the Sydney Test the Australians were still <b>confident,</b> <b>they</b> had won by an innings, England had won {{narrowly}} {{in the absence of the}} Australian captain Ian Johnson and the great all-rounder Keith Miller, who now returned to the team. Miller was playing despite the advice of his doctor who warned him not to bowl on his injured knee and said himself that he didn't think his back could take the strain of bowling. Len Maddocks replaced Gil Langley as wicket-keeper as the latter had been hit in the eye by a bail in a Sheffield Shield match. England received Denis Compton at the expense of Tom Graveney, but faced a crisis on the first day of the Test when Len Hutton refused to leave his bed because of his fibrositis and a heavy cold. The manager Geoffrey Howard, George Duckworth, Bill Edrich and Godfrey Evans had to persuade him to play so as to not damage the morale of the team, especially as the series was locked at 1–1. Finally Hutton agreed to play and went to the ground. The wicket was worse than Sydney. After the MCC's match against Victoria it had broken up completely had had to be repaired and was covered with cracks even before the Test began.|$|E

40|$|Objective Examine {{correlates}} of asthma self-management among 12, 154 adolescents with physician-diagnosed asthma. Methods All 7 th and 8 th grade students in North Carolina completed a survey to assess asthma prevalence and self-management behaviors {{among those with}} asthma. Results Adolescents who were allowed to carry their inhaled medication at school, shown {{how to use a}} peak flow meter, and had access to more asthma care resources were more <b>confident</b> that <b>they</b> could prevent an asthma exacerbation. Adolescents who were allowed to carry their inhaled medication at school and who had a private doctor were more <b>confident</b> that <b>they</b> could control their symptoms. Adolescents taking anti-inflammatory medicine were less <b>confident</b> that <b>they</b> could prevent an exacerbation and control their symptoms. Conclusions Various indicators of autonomy and control were associated with greater self-efficacy for managing asthma. Adolescents who require anti-inflammatory medicines would benefit from additional intervention efforts to improve their asthma management self-efficacy...|$|R

Kent Nilsson, coming off a 131-point season for the Calgary Flames, Thomas Steen, Ulf Nilsson and Börje Salming {{were expected to be}} the team's leaders. [...] With only five returning players from their appearance in the 1976 final and suffering from the defections of the Šťastný brothers – Peter, Marián and Anton – to Canada, the Czechoslovakian team entered the tournament {{in the midst of a}} rebuilding phase and were not considered contenders in 1981.|$|E

[...] Greeley reported to Lincoln that the emissaries lacked accreditation by Davis, but were <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> could bring both sides together. Lincoln sent Hay to Ontario with {{what became known as the}} Niagara Manifesto: that if the South laid down its arms, freed the slaves, and reentered the Union, it could expect liberal terms on other points.

On 25 March 2009 Detective Chief Inspector Phil McTavish, heading the investigation, announced that the DNA profile had been checked against the United Kingdom National DNA Database but no matches had been found. He said [...] "A number of key witnesses have already been located, interviewed and are assisting the investigation. All persons screened to date have been eliminated against the DNA profile. We will screen {{as many people as}} we consider necessary." [...] On 11 August 2009 McTavish released a statement that a prime suspect had been identified, adding, [...] "While work is ongoing to maximise DNA evidence, the inquiry team is <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> are on the right track and hopefully could be close to solving this 30 year old murder".|$|E
500|$|Because Perfect Dark Zero was {{intended}} to be an Xbox 360 launch title, the last stage of development was very challenging and several features had to be canceled so that the game could meet the launch deadline. The number of players in multiplayer matches had to be reduced from 50 to 32, and a [...] "dataDyne TV" [...] mode that would have allowed players to upload and watch multiplayer matches over Xbox Live was eventually rejected. Final development for the Xbox 360 was very rushed. The order was given to produce the discs five days before the Microsoft certification was complete. Rare later stated they felt very <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> would pass, but it was a significant risk producing 700,000 disks if a bug turned up. According to Botwood, [...] "very few people believed we could make launch, but everything came together in time and it was out there for day one." ...|$|E

After leaving Ann, she visits Dave's house {{to tell him that}} she was nervous about their upcoming date, but now realizes he is lucky to have her because of how [...] "awesome" [...] she is. A seemingly annoyed Dave brings Leslie home. The next day, Leslie feels horrible for ruining her chances with Dave. He arrives at her office later and she starts to apologize, but he says she can make it up to them on their second date, thereby reassuring her the first date is already over. Leslie once again feels cheered up.|$|E

He said that a system of passes would be arranged {{to address the issue of}} idle time caused by delays. He entreated the men that if the situation could not be resolved, it must [...] "bring want and suffering upon all; suffering from which you and your families cannot hope to be exempt." [...] He asserted that, although 90 percent of rail workers had accepted the reduction, the whole business of the railroad and city had been halted due to the 10 percent rejecting them, and resolving to not allow the rest of the men to continue work. He said the rescinding of the wage cuts were [...] "entirely out of the question" [...] and requested the men either return to work, or allow those who would to resume working.

[...] Eirik Knutzen of The Repository found Shannon to be [...] "a self-centered twit," [...] and she was also called a [...] "spoiled daddy's girl." [...] Boone describes her as a [...] "self-centered little bitch." [...] On her first night on the Island, Shannon is <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> will be rescued, refusing to help the others organize the luggage. She does not care Rose (L. Scott Caldwell) has lost her husband, and spends {{much of her time}} sunbathing. She manipulates Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) into catching a fish for her, after which Boone apologizes on behalf of Shannon for [...] "using this poor guy like [...] use everyone else." [...] In [...] "Whatever the Case May Be," [...] Boone says to Shannon, [...] "Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke.

500|$|Tapping's former Stargate SG-1 co-star Michael Shanks guest starred as Jimmy in [...] "Penance". Shanks had an {{interest}} in playing Jimmy because of the edgeness of the character. Shanks also suggested Aleks Paunovic, actor and part-time boxer, for the part as the diacon Duke; being a boxer fit into the character's violent nature. Paul McGillion returns as Wexford in the season finale. McGillion first appeared as Wexford in the original webisodes, and since then the producers wanted him to return. Tapping believed that placing him in the finale was [...] "the perfect place for him." [...] Callum Blue was cast as the finale's antagonist, Edward Forsythe, as the producers believed Blue could portray somebody who is both charming and evil. In the same episode, Sahar Biniaz was cast as Kali; Biniaz was chosen as the producers believed her physical appearance was goddess-like. Balinder Johal played a cult member; she {{was the first person to}} audition for the part, and the producers cast her as she was spiritual, calm, and soft in her appearance. Johal taught the cast how to speak Hindi in parts of the dialogue. The producers were hoping to cast David Hewlett, another Stargate alum, in a guest spot; however, this was met by scheduling issues, as he was shooting a film at the time. Despite this the producers were <b>confident</b> <b>they</b> would cast Hewlett [...] "eventually." ...|$|E

500|$|It became {{increasingly}} clear to both Potiorek and Putnik that Austro-Hungarian supply lines were over-extended and so, on 1 December, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army {{to stop and}} wait for the 5th Army to secure its supply lines east of the Valjevo railway, resulting in a short pause to all Austro-Hungarian military operations. Mišić exploited this brief respite by [...] withdrawing the Serbian 1st Army a full [...] from the front line and ensured that his soldiers had an opportunity to rest. The Serbian Army then converged around Mount Rudnik, where it received long-promised supplies from its allies via the Niš–Salonika railroad. Putnik's confidence in the ability of his army to launch a counterattack was restored. On 2 December, he ordered his forces to attack the Austro-Hungarians all along the front and informed his officers that the offensive was to have the specific purpose of improving Serbian morale. Determined to play his part, the aging Serbian king, Peter I, took a rifle and accompanied his troops to the front. The Serbian offensive caught the Austro-Hungarians by surprise, and {{at the time that the}} attack was launched they were holding a large military parade through the streets of Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarians now found themselves defending along an over-extended front as Potiorek had just begun strengthening his left flank, leaving the front line very lightly held. Potiorek knew that he could avoid a serious reversal on the battlefield by preventing the Serbian 1st Army from reaching the watershed of the Kolubara and Morava rivers, but the Serbs were <b>confident.</b> <b>They</b> discovered that the Austro-Hungarians had failed to adequately prepare for a Serbian counterattack, as their artillery was positioned well behind the front line. This meant that the Austro-Hungarian defenders would be unable to use their heavy guns to break up any Serbian advance. Rested and resupplied, the Serbs pushed forward towards Belgrade. By the night of 2 December, the Serbian 1st Army pushed several kilometres past Austro-Hungarian lines, taking a large number of prisoners and inflicting heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians. The 2nd and 3rd armies captured a number of important positions on high ground, while the Užice Army met fierce resistance but was ultimately able to push the Austro-Hungarians back.|$|E

2500|$|For the Finnish Social Democrats {{it seemed}} as though the bourgeoisie was an {{obstacle}} on Finland's road to independence {{as well as on the}} proletariat's road to power. The non-Socialists in Tokoi's Senate were, however, more <b>confident.</b> <b>They,</b> and most of the non-Socialists in the Parliament, rejected the Social Democrats' proposal on parliamentarism (the so-called [...] "Power Act") as being too far-reaching and provocative. The act restricted Russia's influence on domestic Finnish matters, but didn't touch the Russian government's power on matters of defence and foreign affairs. For the Russian Provisional government this was, however, far too radical, exceeding the Parliament's authority, and so the Provisional government dissolved the Parliament.|$|E
