50|$|At around 5:45 am on 2 July 1937, two <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> men (Herman Payne and William Beardmore) {{were working}} when Beardmore noticed a flame. The flame spread quickly across the coalface into a deadly wall of fire. The two men quickly fled and {{actually}} survived the disaster {{which was about}} to strike.|$|E
5000|$|While an {{engineer}} with Jeffery Mining and Manufacturing Company of Columbus, Ohio, Dierdorff developed insulation {{that could be}} packed around electric motor housings to suppress sparking found on early electrical motors. This allowed the first safe electric seam cutting tool in underground mining. This tool was capable of cutting anthracite coal and {{was known as the}} Congo <b>Coal</b> <b>Cutter</b> https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/32677/1/OH_MIN_JNL_v23_125.pdf after its success for the Congo Mining Company, of Corning, Ohio.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1915, all {{the coal}} at Whitfield {{had to be}} hewn from the coal face {{without the aid of}} machinery. In that year, however, {{electrically}} driven <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> and compressed air shaker conveyors were introduced to help remove some of the physical work required to mine and transport the coal from the face.|$|R

50|$|By 1932 all {{underground}} haulage {{had been}} mechanised and most pit ponies {{taken out of}} the pit. Steel supports began to replace the traditional timber pit props. These originally were not universally accepted because miners complained that whereas timber supports creaked when they began to break, which acted as a warning, steel supports did not. Eventually, however, steel supports were accepted. There were also technological advances with <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> and conveyors which were becoming increasingly necessary as tonnage began to increase.|$|R
50|$|The <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> {{consists}} of a rotating part {{with a number of}} teeth or picks. When these picks hit a pocket of hard rock such as pyrites or quartz they can generate a finely divided powder which is heated by friction. Blunt picks are more likely to produce this grinding and heating than sharp ones. Sparking from the cutters in the Duckbill district had been observed before, but as nothing had followed from the sparking it was ignored.|$|E
50|$|The spoil {{from the}} shaft was emptied into the tipping wagon {{which was then}} pushed along the spoil heap on the tracks to the end where it was tipped off, thus forming the {{characteristic}} 'finger' spoil heaps of most small Black country pits. The machine also on the rails behind the spoil wagon is an early electrical <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> the arm extending from the front moved through an arc and cut a corresponding arc in the coal seam which then allowed the coal to drop down in big lumps. One the shaft was established the sinking engine would either be dismantled and sold on or kept to use in an emergency.|$|E

50|$|Between 1910 and 1920, mining {{operations}} jumped around to several seams {{and the number}} of miners fluctuated between a low of 54 in 1910 and a high of over 600 in 1914. In 1913 the mechanical <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> used previously were supplanted by hand picks. A new church building for St. Nicholas was completed in 1916. The 1920 Alabama coal strike, combined with a global depreciation in the coal market, led to a shutdown of the mine. When the strike was settled in 1921, Brookside mine was never re-opened.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 a drift was sunk to the Wavehill seam in a hill to {{the west}} of the {{existing}} shafts. This drift was known as Waratah Colliery No.2 drift and was a mechanised mine using Mavour & Coulson <b>coal</b> <b>cutters,</b> Joy 14BU loaders & Joy battery operated shuttle cars. The shuttle cars loaded the coal onto a conveyor belt which transported the coal to a new set of screens & loading point close to the original screens. No.2 drift was closed on 19 May 1961 after working out all economic coal reserves.|$|R
50|$|Hope Pit was sunk {{close by}} in 1827 and the Blossom Pit on the {{opposite}} side of the Wakefield to Austerlands turnpike road, the A642, was sunk by 1840. Hope Pit's shaft descends 215 yards and produced coal after 1829. The coal was wound by horse gins until the 1920s. It was one of the earliest Yorkshire coal mines to use electrical <b>coal</b> <b>cutters.</b> The Inman Water Shaft was sunk to 97 yards in about 1840 to pump water from Hope Pit and its beam engine house survives. The shaft was later deepened to the New Hards Seam. The pits were originally ventilated by furnaces at the shaft bottoms.|$|R
50|$|The Jeffery Manufacturing Company {{steadily}} grew until 1940. In 1904, Jeffery {{purchased the}} Ohio Malleable Iron Company {{to ensure a}} reliable supply of iron {{for the production of}} their barrows and hand trucks. Ohio Malleable was located along the same railroad track as Jeffery a few blocks north of First Avenue. In 1926, Jeffery purchased a British company called the Diamond <b>Coal</b> <b>Cutter</b> Company, which was renamed the British Jeffery Diamond Limited. A couple years later, J.A. Jeffery retired and president of the company, Robert Gillespie stepped up. His first action as the figurehead was to invest two million dollars into the purchase of Galion Iron Works, a manufacturer of road rollers and graders for sale to local and state governments. Jeffery Manufacturing survived the Great Depression and company prosperity continued into the immediate post war years. However, a new company called Jay Manufacturing moved into central Ohio and began challenging Jeffery Manufacturing. Jeffery began to fail when the company neglected to replace its underground coal hauler with the new rubber tired hauler, an innovation that would save the company time and money because the rubber tires did not require built tracks as mine shafts were extended. As the Jeffery main branch began to fail, its subsidiaries excelled and kept the company afloat. In 1961, Jeffery Manufacturing completely merged with the British Galion Company, creating the new corporate name of Jeffery Galion, Inc.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Milburn {{worked as}} a <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> at the nearby colliery. Jackie Milburn later told his son, Jack Jr., that [...] "I used to shiver as he {{disappeared}} into that deep shaft leading to the coalface". When he was eight years old, Milburn was given his first pair of football boots as a Christmas present from his parents and from that point [...] "football dominated his life". The young Milburn idolised Joe Hulme, and hoped to emulate him. Although an initially confident boy, Milburn recalled an incident where, having already won the sprint, sprint relay, long jump and high jump at his school sports day, his father arrived {{just in time to}} see him win the 440 yard race. Exhausted, he collapsed to the floor - a gesture his father mistook for showboating and resulted in him receiving [...] "a real hiding". Reflecting later, Milburn contended that [...] "maybe my father's intentions were the best in the world...but that thrashing laid the foundations for an inferiority complex I've fought all my life to overcome". When he was twelve, Milburn moved to Hirst East Senior Boys School and was selected to play right-wing for the school football team. His father promised to award him a penny for every goal he scored. He duly earned two pence for scoring twice on his debut in a 6-4 win against Linton School. He was selected for East Northumberland Schools, and he scored in a 3-2 semi-final defeat by Lancashire at Maine Road.|$|E

50|$|In 1938, 1,261 {{men were}} {{employed}} underground and a further 283 on the surface. Electric <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> {{had been in}} use for some time, but the coal was still being hand loaded, although now onto conveyor belts on the coal face rather than directly into tubs. The new seams were considerably thinner than the 5.5 ft. thick Top Hard and it was anticipated that a larger quantity of small coal would be created. In order to process this, a 150-ton per hour washery plant was constructed {{a few hundred yards}} to the south-west. This plant was to {{play a key role in}} subsequent years when mechanized loading was introduced and the demand for small coal for power generation soared.|$|R
50|$|The {{executives}} of the Coal Owners Association included a chairman, vice chairman and secretary.Secretaries included Alexander Dalziel (1874-84), W. Gascoyne Dalziel (1884-1916), Finlay A. Gibson (1916-46) and Iestyn R. Williams (1947-50). Each of the three districts of Cardiff, Newport and Swansea had a chairman and vice-chairman.There was a chairman of the Sliding-Scale committee, a chairman of the Finance committee and a solicitor. Other committees were the Conciliation Board, District Boards, Commercial Committee, Disputes Committee and <b>Coal</b> <b>Cutters</b> and Conveyers Committee.At meetings of the association and district boards, each member in good standing had votes weighted depending on their mines' assured tonnage. Membership fees were also based on assured tonnage, so the larger owners paid more and had a greater say in decisions.|$|R
5000|$|Longwall mining - A set of {{longwall}} mining equipment {{consists of a}} coal shearer mounted on conveyor operating underneath a series of self-advancing hydraulic roof supports. Almost the entire process can be automated. Longwall mining machines are typically 150-250 metres in width and 1.5 to 3 metres high. Longwall miners extract [...] "panels" [...] - rectangular blocks of coal {{as wide as the}} face the equipment is installed in, and as long as several kilometres. Powerful mechanical <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> (shearers) cut <b>coal</b> from the face, which falls onto an armoured face conveyor for removal. Longwalls can advance into an area of coal, or more commonly, retreat back between development tunnels (called [...] "gateroads") As a longwall miner retreats back along a panel, the roof behind the supports is allowed to collapse in a planned and controlled manner.|$|R
30|$|To {{solve the}} problem of safety and high-efficiency {{supporting}} for thin coal seam with unsteady thickness, we introduce intelligent coupling technology between hydraulic support and surrounding rock, automatic mining patter and supporting system cooperative control with automatic organization (Hargrave et al. 2017). We develop the comprehensive multi-index intelligence adjusting height decision-making mechanism and three-dimensional navigation automatic adjusting straightness technology based on shearer cutting height memory association, cutting power parameters, vibration and video information, which {{solve the problem}} of the hydraulic support followed the <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> moving by automatic control and the <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> cleaning the float coal after beveling cutting the tringle coal automatically. We also invent the super large-scale magnification ratio hydraulic support, which adopts the new structure design of panel top beam, the double linkage and double equilibrium jack fold the position, and the double-telescopic prop with single liquid into the mouth to break through the minimum mining height limit. The super large-scale magnification ratio hydraulic support, which fits in with the 0.5 – 1.4  m coal seam, is built to tackle the technical challenges of small size equipment, superpower, and automatic control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Through {{the system}} {{reliability}} theory, {{the reliability of}} each subsystem of fully mechanized working face was got. The reliability of the working face was 0. 82. By using the reliability of redistribution, the reliability of weak links of the system was improved to 0. 966, so that {{the reliability of the}} working face was raised to 0. 86. The reliability of the working face was enhanced and the mining production was stable. Production System Reliability of Fully Mechanized Working Face Selection of Working Face Indexes. The production system of fully mechanized working face mainly includes <b>coal</b> <b>cutter,</b> scraper conveyor, roof support, gate transportation and electrical equipments. Only when these five parts all work normally, can the working face run smoothly. The Working face production system can't operate properly {{as long as there is}} any problem. [1] Thus the production system can be considered one series system consist of the five parts [1, 2]. Production System Reliability of Working Face. Due to the production system reliability data of working face was not so much, appraisal and distribution method was used to calculate the system reliability. Suppose production system of fully mechanized working face consists of five subsystems, <b>coal</b> <b>cutter,</b> scraper conveyor, roof support, gate transportation and electrical equipments. Complexity, technology development, working time and environmental conditions of each subsystem were scored by experienced engineers. The score of various influence factors was between 1 and 10, as is shown in Table 1...|$|E

By using HL 105 brazing piece as {{filler metal}} {{and the water}} soluble copper brazing agent made by self, we welded the <b>coal</b> <b>cutter</b> by {{induction}} brazing, which was used 42 CrMo steel as the body and YG 15 hard alloy as the head. By studying the microstructure and mechanical property of brazing seam, {{we found that the}} bending strength of the joint welded by using the home-made fluxes had achieved a superior level. The quality of brazing seam on the condition of the fluxes and water in a four-to-six ratio was superior to that when the fluxes is dewatering borax or the fluxes and water in a half-to-half ratio...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{tangentially}} impacted potential coal-cutter bit shank materials against sandstone {{to investigate}} {{the potential of the}} materials to ignite natural gas by a friction-generated hot streak. The shank material samples were mounted in a 24 -in, 550 -lb flywheel, which was rotated at surface speeds of 400 to 900 sfpm. The sandstone was advanced toward the rotating flywheel at feed rates of 1 mil per impact. The atmosphere mixture was 7 vol pct natural gas in air. Three grades of polycarbonate resin, an ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene, and a zinc alloy (ZA 27) were among the potential materials. None of these materials caused ignition of the methane at any of the three test speeds (400, 600, and 900 sfpm), but the above materials do not have sufficient strength to hold a carbide tip during coal cutting. Of the materials having sufficient strength to hold a carbide tip, three nickel-based alloys proved less likely to cause a natural gas ignition than did iron-based alloys such as 4340 (a commonly used shank material for <b>coal</b> <b>cutters)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research to develop preliminary engineering data necessary if the cobalt-rich manganese crusts {{that occur in}} the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Hawaiian Archipelago are to be mined. The research was divided into the following sections: (1) physical, mineralogical, and chemical descriptions; (2) mechanical property testing, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, and a rippability index; and (3) mechanical cutting characteristics, including average and peak cutter forces, the specific energy, and cuttings size distribution. Section 1 utilized microscope, X-ray powder diffractometer, and electron microprobe analyses. Section 2 utilized standard mechanical property testing techniques. Section 3 utilized a converted planer mill with full-size <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> to fragment the crust and substrate samples. The manganese crust samples were mainly manganese and iron oxides and hydroxides with an average cobalt content of 1 pct and had a nucleus or substrate of rock or sediment. The significant results shown by the mechanical property and cutting tests are that the crust and all but two types of substrates (basalt and trachyte) are weak materials and easily cut with standard drag cutters. The crusts are generally comparable to medium hard coal in strength and in their resistance to cutting...|$|R
40|$|Approximately one {{thousand}} coal miners working in dusty environment for 5 years {{and over in}} Hokkaido were examined on the occurrence of pneumoconiosis by means of mass roentgenography and of cardio-pulmonary function tests. Results obtained in this survey were as follows; (1) The presence of disease was detected in the following proportions; Coal miner's pneumoconiosis 27. 6 %, Simple antracosis 11. 2 %, Minimal stage of anthraco-silicosis 6. 8 %, Initial stage 7. 6 %, Moderate stage 1. 4 %, Advanced stage 0. 6 %. (2) Prevalence of coal-miner's pneumoconiosis rose {{in accordance with the}} rise of their age and with the increase in the duration of the period of their engagement, but the tendency of such rises of the prevalence was definitely sharper in the younger workers. The same relation was observed also in the cases of anthracosilicosis, (3) Minimal and initial stages of anthracosilicosis were recognized in relatively early periods after engagement and also in younger ages, but the moderate and advanced cases were detected in the workers who had been engaged in work over 10 years and also in those of 45 years and over. (4) Prevalence of anthracosilicosis was higher in the rockdrillers and in those who had been working in metal mines in the past than in the <b>coal</b> <b>cutters</b> and attendant labours but a certain individual disposition for the occurrence of anthracosilicosis also seemed to exist, (5) Complication of pulmonary tuberculosis increased remarkably with the advance of anthracosilicosis, but such complications were rare in simple anthracosis.

40|$|To {{determine}} the rational order of disk tools placement on the working body {{is necessary to}} know {{the maximum amount of}} rock, destroyed by the disk tool in benching cutting mode depending on the tool geometry parameters, physical and mechanical parameters of rocks. The article contains the definition of rational parameters of cutting disk tools as well as power and energy parameters of the destruction process by cutting disks and by executive body of the <b>coal</b> <b>cutter.</b> The rational geometric parameters of cutting discs are specified. It was found that each step of cutting with a minimum depth of penetration has its own maximum height of bench outcrop. The dependence of the volumes of large items destroyed by the disk tool on the cutting step height was determined. The existence of the cyclic alternation of destruction phases, regardless the fracture parameters, the height of the ledge outcrop, and tools like free cutting geometry were found. In contrast to the free cutting in benching mode of destruction two large fragments of rocks in one cycle were observed. Consequently, the cyclical nature of the destruction process in the benching mode will be characterized by two chips and crushing, and this cycling repeats throughout the destruction process with the same parameters of destruction...|$|E
