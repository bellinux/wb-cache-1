5|$|Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, {{such as the ability}} to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E
5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E

5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E
25|$|Chloramines {{should be}} removed from water for dialysis, aquariums, hydroponic applications, and homebrewing beer. Chloramines can {{interfere}} with dialysis, <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> aquatic animals, and can give homebrewed beer a medicinal taste by forming chlorophenols. In hydroponic applications, it will stunt the growth of plants.|$|E
25|$|Standard cost {{accounting}} <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation. Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E

25|$|Safina is an {{aggressive}} baseliner {{who likes to}} take {{the ball on the}} rise with full power on every shot. Her sharp angled forehand can force a return that she can hit with a big and heavy forehand for a winner. Her backhand can be flat, heavy, and devastating. She boasts a powerful first serve that sometimes lacks consistency in tight moments. Her primary weakness is her mental toughness, particularly in Grand Slam finals, although it has improved. Her emotions on court <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> her game. A tenacous fighter, Safina made several notable comebacks, including at the 2008 French Open: down 6–7, 2–5 against Maria Sharapova, she fought off match point and won 6–7, 7–6, 6–2. She was also {{regarded as one of the}} most healthy and fit players on tour. Though an adequate lateral mover, she is less nimble moving forward and tends to avoid net play.|$|E
25|$|The series {{focuses on}} several social themes such as faith, organ {{donation}} {{and the treatment}} of middle-aged men. However, the main philosophy seen across the story is the individualism, the stance which emphasizes the moral worth of an individual. Subaru and Hokuto believe that nobody can fully understand another person's suffering. Despite his belief in this philosophy, Subaru is a resigned individual who worries more about others than himself. This is because Subaru believes he <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> others {{with the idea that}} he will never understand other people. The same problem comes from the fact Subaru and Hokuto are twins and as a result try to live in order to see each other as different people. Across the plot, Subaru develops as an individual as his actions are deemed as arrogant by Seishiro for taking the guilt. Additionally, he starts taking actions that he believes are immoral despite his reasons for them such as lying to a mother about her daughter's wish to stop her from taking revenge.|$|E

Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E

500|$|Ed Sheeran wrote [...] "Photograph" [...] in May 2012 with Johnny McDaid, instrumentalist and {{background}} vocalist of the British band Snow Patrol. Sheeran toured with the band, {{for whom he}} provided opening performances in select North American dates. McDaid had a three-note piano loop that became the basis of [...] "Photograph". The song's development began when Sheeran, while {{in a hotel room}} in Kansas City, was humming [...] "loving <b>can</b> <b>hurt,</b> loving can hurt" [...] to the loop that was playing on McDaid's laptop.

I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> me? You don't know about power.

[...] In chapter 49, High says that when Loki witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a woman. In his disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only mistletoe can, for it seemed to her too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Cautionary Tales", Elle {{comes back}} to the United States. Former Company {{employee}} Noah Bennet captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, Claire. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties her bare feet together and puts them in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He <b>can</b> <b>hurt</b> you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E
