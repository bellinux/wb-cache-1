50|$|The RDA {{is located}} {{in an area of}} several square miles just South of the city of Lamar, Colorado, in the United States, part of the area {{proposed}} for Auger North. It consists of surface detectors (water tanks instrumented with photomultiplier tubes and readout electronics), communication towers, and a building housing the data concentrator and computing. The ten water tanks are instrumented with one photomultiplier tube each to detect the Cherenkov radiation generated by particles in cosmic ray air showers. (The water tanks currently used in the southern Pierre Auger observatory use three photomultiplier tubes each.) The communication towers will test a new way to transport data from the water tanks to the data concentrator. A higher bandwidth will benefit many possible upgrades to the southern site. A new communication system is also needed to allow the proposed northern detector array to cover a larger area than the existing southern observatory. In the existing system all surface detectors directly transmit to a single point. In a larger array this would not be feasible. Surface detectors would communicate with their nearest neighbors and surface detectors close to the single data <b>concentrator</b> <b>station</b> would relay the data from surface detectors that are further away.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{personal}} handyphone system (PHS) service {{began in}} Japan in 1995. As this new communication service matched social needs well, {{the number of}} subscribers quickly reached 7 million in just two years.

2500|$|Given {{the large}} amount of {{sunlight}} Mildura receives, it has been proposed as the site for several proposals for large scale solar power in Australia including a massive solar updraft tower proposal in 2004 and 2010. [...] In 2013, Mildura Solar <b>Concentrator</b> Power <b>Station,</b> a 1.5MW demonstration plant, was commissioned by Silex Systems and it was expected to be expanded to 100MW by 2017. However, in August 2014, the project was abandoned by Silex, due to lack of commitment to renewable energy by the Abbott government, with plans to scrap the praised Renewable Energy Target (RET) in Australia cited as {{one of the main reasons}} for the abandonment of the project. This decision has been extensively criticised by international scientists, who claim Australia risks being [...] "left behind the rest of the world" [...] if it cuts its plans for renewable energy. The decision to not build the plant may also cause electricity prices to rise significantly in the country.|$|R
50|$|The Alamosa Solar Generating Plant is a 37 MWp (30.72 MWAC) <b>concentrator</b> {{photovoltaics}} power <b>station,</b> {{the largest}} in the world when it was completed, in May 2012.

It uses all three of the methods available to increase efficiency—dual-axis tracking, concentrating photovoltaics, and multi-junction cells. The systems are certified for operation for 50 years, but the multi-junction cells will need to be replaced in 25 years. The output is being sold to Public Service of Colorado, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, under a long term Power Purchase Agreement.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed to predict the thermal distortion of the solar dynamic <b>concentrator</b> for Space <b>Station</b> Freedom in low earth orbit and to evaluate the effects of that thermal distortion on concentrator on-orbit performance. The analysis required substructural finite element modeling of critical concentrator structural subsystems, structural finite element modeling of the concentrator, mapping of thermal loading onto the structural finite element model, {{and the creation of}} specialized postprocessors to assist in interpreting results. Concentrator temperature distributions and thermally induced displacements and slope errors and the resulting receiver flux distribution profiles are discussed. Results determined for a typical orbit indicate that concentrator facet rotations are less than 0. 2 mrad and that the change in facet radius due to thermal flattening is less than 5 percent. The predicted power loss due to thermal distortion effects is less than 0. 3 percent. As a consequence the thermal distortions of the solar dynamic concentrator in low earth orbit will have a negligible effect on the flux distribution profiles within the receiver...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Concentrator Advanced Development Project has {{successfully}} designed, fabricated, and tested a full scale prototypical solar dynamic <b>concentrator</b> for space <b>station</b> applications. A Truss Hexagonal Panel reflector {{was selected as}} a viable solar concentrator concept {{to be used for}} space <b>station</b> applications. This <b>concentrator</b> utilizes a modular design approach and is flexible in attainable flux profiles and assembly techniques. The detailed design of the concentrator, which included structural, thermal and optical analysis, identified the feasibility of the design and specific technologies that were required to fabricate it. The needed surface accuracy of the reflectors surface was found to be very tight, within 5 mrad RMS slope error, and results in very close tolerances for fabrication. To meet the design requirements, a modular structure composed of hexagonal panels was used. The panels, made up of graphite epoxy box beams provided the strength, stiffness and dimensional stability needed. All initial project requirements were met or exceeded by hardware demonstration. Initial testing of structural repeatability of a seven panel portion of the concentrator was followed by assembly and testing of the full nineteen panel structure. The testing, which consisted of theodolite and optical measurements over an assembly-disassembly-reassembly cycle, demonstrated that the concentrator maintained the as-built contour and optical characteristics. The facet development effort within the project, which included developing the vapor deposited reflective facet, produced a viable design with demonstrated optical characteristics that are within the project goals...|$|R
