5|$|In the 1970s {{four of the}} Universal-produced films {{fell into}} the public domain when their {{copyright}} was not renewed. These four films were restored and colourised. Some of the films in the series had become degraded over time, {{with some of the}} original negatives lost and others suffering from nitrate deterioration because of the unstable <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> film. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the series, putting the films onto modern polyester film, in a process that was jointly paid for by UCLA, Warner Bros. and Hugh Hefner.|$|E
5|$|The two 20th Century Fox films—The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes—had survived {{complete}} {{and in good}} condition, but those in the Universal series suffered badly over the years, as they passed through the hands of different copyright owners. In 1993 the UCLA Film and Television Archive started a restoration project on the series after the unstable <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> film {{was found to be}} suffering from deterioration. Restoration on the first six films—The Woman in Green, The Pearl of Death, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Scarlet Claw, Terror by Night and The Spider Woman—took four years from 1993; the costs for the restoration were met by UCLA and Hugh Hefner, who was a fan of the Rathbone-Holmes series. From 1998 Warner Bros. matched Hefner's funding and the remaining six films—Dressed to Kill, Pursuit to Algiers, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, The House of Fear, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror and Sherlock Holmes in Washington—were then restored, a process that was completed in 2001.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{reaction}} between <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrates</b> and alkali has been frequently studied, the conditions used invariably brought about severe degradation and produced low molecular products. Nevertheless, the nitrate {{groups in the}} second, third and sixth positions of the glucose residues constituting cellulose almost certainly differ in reactivity. Proper experimental conditions should therefore {{make it possible to}} remove one nitrate group selectively without substantially affecting the rest. The discovery of such conditions was the initial object of the present research, which forms part of the confidential N. R.

For these studies, an all-glass apparatus was constructed which recovered the reaction products quantitatively, and with which it was possible to work at fairly low pressures and at a variety of temperatures. This equipment was designed to accentuate the primary decomposition reaction. Analytical methods are adapted for estimating the composition of the reaction products, both volatile and non-volatile.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, most Sunset Boulevard prints were in poor condition, {{and as the}} film was shot using <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> filmstock, much of the {{original}} negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it digitally restored. This restored version was released on DVD in 2002. In 2012, the film was digitally restored by Paramount Pictures for Blu-ray Disc debut. Frame-by-frame digital restoration by Prasad Corporation removed dirt, tears, scratches and other defects.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{its ability}} to {{dissolve}} (most) oxides and silicates, hydrofluoric acid is useful for dissolving rock samples (usually powdered) prior to analysis. In similar manner, this acid is used in acid macerations to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks.

40|$|Marked {{differences}} were noted among 14 antibiotics in their filterability through collodion (<b>nitrated</b> <b>cellulose)</b> membranes. The findings {{could not be}} attributed to differences in molecular weight or degree of serum protein binding, although the latter factor imposed an additional restraint on the passage of certain agents. Poorly filtered antibiotics appeared to be absorbed by the collodion. Some of these observations might {{be accounted for by}} the known ability of <b>nitrated</b> <b>cellulose</b> to interact with anions. However, the extreme differences in filterability among the various penicillins and the very restricted passage of certain cationic antibiotics appeared to be better explained by intrinsic differences in the diffusibility of these agents through water. Although differential filtration offers a means of assaying samples containing certain mixtures of antibiotics, the degree of separation exhibited by collodion membranes is not sufficient to make them useful for clinical purposes...|$|R

The molecular structure of AO is shown in Scheme 1. In a typical process, 2.0 mg purified CNTs were added to an aqueous solution containing 2 mg AO and sonicated {{at room temperature for}} at least 2 h to reach a maximum adsorption.

2500|$|Parkesine (nitrocellulose) is {{considered}} the first man-made plastic. The plastic material was patented by Alexander Parkes, In Birmingham, UK in 1856. [...] It was unveiled at the 1862 Great International Exhibition in London. Parkesine won a bronze medal at the 1862 World's fair in London. Parkesine was made from cellulose (the major component of plant cell walls) treated with nitric acid as a solvent. The output of the process (commonly known as <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> or pyroxilin) could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated.

2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the initial fire, its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E

40|$|The scribe box {{under study}} {{dates back to}} the old kingdom. It was {{excavated}} by the Italian expedition in Qena (1935 - 1937). The box consists of the lid and the body. The inner side of the lid is decorated with ancient Egyptian inscriptions written with a black pigment. The box was made by using several panels assembled together by wooden dowels and secured with vegetable ropes. The entire box is covered with a red pigment. This study aims to use analytical techniques to identify and have deep understanding for the box compo-nents. Moreover, the authors were significantly interested in using infrared reflectance transmission imaging (RTI-IR) to improve the hidden inscriptions on the lid. The visual observation and assessment were done to understand the condition of this box. 3 D dimensions software was used to illustrate wood joints techniques. Optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence portable (XRF) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used in this study in order to identify wood species, remains of insects bodies, red pigment, vegetable fibers and previous conservation adhesives, also RTI-IR technique was effec-tive to improve hidden inscriptions. The results proved that wooden panels and dowels were Acacia (Acacia nilotica), wooden rail is willow (Salix sp). The insects are the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne) and spider beetle (Gibbium psylloids), the red pigment is Hematite, while the vegetable fibers were linen and previous adhesive was identified as <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrates.</b> RTI-IR technique was effective to improve hidden inscriptions.

40|$|Effects of the {{availability}} of nitrate nitrogen and different carbon sources on N 2 O and CO 2 emission from soil of typical farmland in the North China were studied. The static culture systems were adopted in an indoor experiment. The results illustrated that, compared with single nitrate nitrogen fertilizer, combined different carbon sources and nitrate nitrogen fertilizer increased the emission of N 2 O from soil, except for cellulose; combined different carbon sources and nitrate nitrogen fertilizer increased the accumulated emission of CO 2 from soil. The emission flux of N 2 O by treatment of pectin peaked 1383. 42 μg N·kg- 1 ·d- 1 on day 1.

CAN contains the energetic nitro groups found in nitrocellulose (NC), but also acetyl functionalities, which lowered the polymer's sensitivity to heat and shock, and therefore improved its IM properties relative to NC. The formulation, development and small-scale characterization testing of several CAN-based propellants were done. The formulations, using insensitive energetic solid fillers and high-nitrogen modifiers in place of nitramine were completed. The small scale characterization testing, such as closed bomb testing, small scale sensitivity, thermal stability, and chemical compatibility were done. The mechanical response of the propellants under high-rate uni-axial compression at, hot, cold, and ambient temperatures were also completed. Critical diameter testing, hot fragment conductive ignition (HFCI) tests were done to evaluate the propellants' responses to thermal and shock stimuli.
