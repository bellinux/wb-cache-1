40|$|Introduction: <b>Choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> is a newly {{developed}} choline salt of fenofibric acid, {{which is more}} hydrophilic than fenofibrate. This study was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <b>choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> in comparison to micronized fenofibrate among Indian patients of mixed dyslipidemia. Methods: A multicenter, open-label, randomized, active controlled, comparative, parallel group study was conducted at around 10 centers spread all across the country. Mixed dyslipidemia patients (serum triglycerides [TG] levels between 150 and 500 mg/dl), aged 18 – 70 years and taking stable statin dose for 8 weeks were randomized to <b>choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> 135 mg delayed release tablets and micronized fenofibrate 160 mg tablets once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint {{of the study was}} percentage change in serum TG level at the end of 12 weeks. Results: A total of 226 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 116 patients were administered <b>choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> and 110 patients were administered micronized fenofibrate. At the end of 12 weeks, there was a significant reduction in TG level (34. 24 % in <b>choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> group and 38. 13 % reduction in micronized fenofibrate group). However, the difference between group was not statistically different (P = 0. 471). Similarly, there was a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at the end of 12 weeks (10 % increase in <b>choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> group and 9 % increase in micronized fenofibrate group); but the difference between the group was not statistically significant (P = 0. 598). Both the treatment was safe and well tolerated. Conclusion: <b>Choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> delayed release 135 mg is as safe and effective as 160 mg of micronized fenofibrate in Indian patients with mixed dyslipidemia...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Elevated {{triglycerides}} (TG) and low {{high-density lipoprotein}} cholesterol (HDL-C) levels contribute to cardio-vascular disease risk {{and can be}} effectively treated with feno-fibric acid. A trial is under way to evaluate the effect of once-daily fenofibric acid or placebo on carotid intima-media thick-ness (CIMT) progression in patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved through atorvastatin treatment, but with high TG and low HDL-C levels. Methods In this multicenter, double-blind study, 682 patients were randomized to once-daily delayed-release capsules of <b>choline</b> <b>fenofibrate</b> 135 mg (fenofibric acid [Trilipix®; Abbott, North Chicago, IL]) or placebo plus atorvastatin treatment after a 2 - to 10 -week diet and atorvastatin run-in period. Key inclu-sion criteria included age ≥ 45 years; posterior-wall common CIMT ≥ 0. 7 mm {{on at least one}} side at baseline; fasting results of TG ≥ 150 mg/dL, and HDL-C ≤ 45 mg/dL for men or HDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for women at screening while receiving atorva-statin; controlled LDL-C; and known coronary heart disease (CHD) or a CHD risk equivalent. The primary efficacy vari-able is the rate of change from baseline through week 104 in the mean posterior-wall intima-media thickness of the com-mon carotid arteries (composite value of left and right sides). Conclusions This trial is the first to examine the effect of fenofibric acid on CIMT and the first CIMT trial to select patients with controlled LDL-C and elevated TG and low HDL-C as inclusion criteria. Also, this trial will prospec-tively evaluate the effect of treatment on LDL particles and address shortcomings of previous CIMT trials. Key words Atorvastatin. CIMT. Dyslipidemia. Fenofibric acid.
