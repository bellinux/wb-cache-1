5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} <b>cancer</b> <b>to</b> other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms.

5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from <b>cancer</b> <b>to</b> erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E

5000|$|Basal-like breast <b>cancers</b> tend <b>to</b> have poorer {{outcomes}} {{than other}} types of breast <b>cancer</b> due <b>to</b> a lack of targeted therapies. These breast cancers do not express human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 or receptors for estrogen or progesterone, making them immune to [...] Trastuzumab/Herceptin and hormonal therapies , which are very effective against other breast <b>cancer</b> types.

50|$|A {{different}} {{effect on}} staging arises from evolving {{technologies that are}} used to assign patients to particular categories, such that increasingly sensitive methods tend <b>to</b> cause individual <b>cancers</b> <b>to</b> be reassigned to higher stages, making it improper <b>to</b> compare that <b>cancer's</b> prognosis <b>to</b> the historical expectations for that stage.|$|R
5|$|Cervical cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E

5|$|With {{a capital}} of seven million florins, the West India Company was granted {{exclusive}} authority and trade privileges in the Dutch possessions {{of the two}} Americas, {{as well as the}} coast of Africa from the Tropic of <b>Cancer</b> <b>to</b> the Cape of Good Hope.

5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat <b>cancer</b> <b>to</b> aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast <b>cancer</b> <b>to</b> under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E
