40|$|As {{homelessness}} {{has become}} a prominent domestic issue, numerous advocates have called for constitutional recognition of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s unconditional right to enjoy a minimum level of shelter. I argue here that these advocates have failed {{to deal with the}} fundamental fact that a society must maintain incentives to work. Both theory and data indicate that an unconditional shelter right, presumably coupled with ironclad rights to enjoy other material benefits, would be counterproductive, even for the poor. My stance is grounded on policy considerations, not on a preference for constitutional minimalism. Indeed, after criticizing the proposed right to shelter, I will identify and praise two momentous, but little-heralded, original endowments that our current constitutional scheme guarantees to each citizen. My remarks will touch on three overarching issues in the design of a constitution 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bill</b> of rights. First, should a bill of rights protect only 2 ̆ 2 negative liberties, 2 ̆ 2 that is, rights against government intrusions, or should it also affirm specified 2 ̆ 2 positive liberties, 2 ̆ 2 such as entitlements to a minimum level of material welfare? Second, should a constitution 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bill</b> of rights be complemented with a 2 ̆ 2 bill of duties 2 ̆ 2 that specifies each citizen 2 ̆ 7 s civic responsibilities? Finally, what rights in a federal system are appropriately placed only in a state constitution 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bill</b> of rights...|$|R

40|$|In the {{innocent}} closing {{years of the}} 1950 s, the American public fastened on union democracy as the most burning issue of the day. No other subject produced as much mail for Congress. The 229 - 201 count by which the Landrum-Griffin bill was substituted for the House Labor Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bill</b> on labor-management reporting and disclosure constituted the largest total vote {{in the history of}} the House of Representatives. Significantly, however, that vote had little if any bearing on union members 2 ̆ 7 rights. What distinguished Landrum-Griffin from the Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bill</b> was its stiff new curbs on picketing and boycotts. As Senator John Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s advisor, Archibald Cox, caustically observed, business groups backing the legislation had no genuine interest in labor reform.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{child labor}} in Bangladesh, referring to Harkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bill</b> and the Memorandum of Understanding Type schooling programs. Bangladesh {{is considered to}} be one of the child-labor abundant countries. The Child Labor Survey, 1995 - 96 estimates that the number of children in the labor force is 6. 58 million out of the 34. 45 million children in the age group of 5 - 14 years. Harkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bill</b> concentrates on prohibition, rather than on regulation, and fails to take into account the situation of acute poverty that forces children to enter the labor force. That is why many developing countries opposed such global prohibition of child labor. These countries consider these initiatives to be a kind of disguised protectionism and claim that their children are being used to protect jobs in the developed countries. Naturally, the bill appeared as a great threat to the Bangladeshi garments industry. The U. S. and other foreign buyers declared that they would boycott this exportable item of Bangladesh as long as children below the minimum age for employment are being used by this industry...|$|R
