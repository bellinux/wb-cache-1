50|$|Commonly used {{indicator}} bacteria include total <b>coliforms,</b> or {{a subset}} of this group, fecal <b>coliforms,</b> which {{are found in the}} intestinal tracts of warm blooded animals. Total <b>coliforms</b> were used as fecal indicators by public agencies in the US as early as the 1920s. These organisms can be identified {{based on the fact that}} they all metabolize the sugar lactose, producing both acid and gas as byproducts. Fecal <b>coliforms</b> are more useful as indicators in recreational waters than total <b>coliforms</b> which include species that are naturally found in plants and soil; however, there are even some species of fecal <b>coliforms</b> that do not have a fecal origin, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Perhaps the biggest drawback to using <b>coliforms</b> as indicators is that they can grow in water under certain conditions.|$|R
30|$|Water samples {{collected}} from the storage tanks were plated aseptically onto MacConkey agar for total <b>coliforms</b> and faecal <b>coliforms</b> following the standard protocols as described by Cheesbrough (2006). Incubation was carried out at 37  °C for 24  h for total <b>coliforms</b> and 44.5  °C for 24  h for faecal <b>coliforms</b> and count was carried out following the standard microbiological procedures by APHA (2005).|$|R
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when <b>coliform</b> bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|On Twomile Run {{above the}} acid mine drainage, {{a total of}} 19 macroinvertebrate taxa {{including}} 5 members of the orders Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera were observed in 1998.

In 1992 it had approved pH, aquatic weeds and algae, and dissolved oxygen TMDLs for the Bear Creek watershed. In December 2008, DEQ developed two TMDLs for the Rogue River basin (except the tributaries {{with their own}} TMDLs); a temperature TMDL was meant to protect salmon and trout from elevated water temperatures, and a fecal contamination TMDL was intended to safeguard people using surface waters for recreation.|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the PetrifilmTM and TEMPO® systems compared to the conventional method for counting microorganisms in pasteurized milk. A total of 141 samples of pasteurized milk were analyzed by counting mesophilic aerobic, <b>Coliforms</b> at 35 ºC, <b>Coliforms</b> at 45 ºC, and Escherichia coli microorganisms. High correlation was found between the methods for counting <b>Coliforms</b> at 35 ºC, but low correlation was found for counting mesophilic aerobic, <b>Coliforms</b> at 45 ºC, and Escherichia coli. No significant statistical difference was found among the three methods for counting <b>Coliforms</b> at 35 ºC; however, the mean counts of mesophilic aerobic, <b>Coliforms</b> at 45 ºC, and Escherichia coli showed significant statistical difference.

5|$|The clear-cutting {{of forests}} in the 19th century {{adversely}} affected {{the ecology of the}} Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while fecal <b>coliform</b> bacteria count limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, a joint {{study by}} Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found {{high levels of}} human fecal {{bacteria}} in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as {{with most of the}} river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost sampling site in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second-highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings. Most of the high <b>coliform</b> readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy, the bacteria may be less likely to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams.|$|E
25|$|Untreated {{organic matter}} that {{contains}} fecal <b>coliform</b> can {{be harmful to}} the environment. Aerobic decomposition of this material can reduce dissolved oxygen levels if discharged into rivers or waterways. This may reduce the oxygen level enough to kill fish and other aquatic life. Reduction of fecal <b>coliform</b> in wastewater may {{require the use of}} chlorine and other disinfectant chemicals, or UV disinfection treatment. Such materials may kill the fecal <b>coliform</b> and disease bacteria. They also kill bacteria essential to the proper balance of the aquatic environment, endangering the survival of species dependent on those bacteria. So higher levels of fecal <b>coliform</b> require higher levels of chlorine, threatening those aquatic organisms.|$|E
