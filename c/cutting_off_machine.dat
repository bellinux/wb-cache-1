40|$|Abstract — Traditionally, {{automatic}} cutting-off machines, of metallic pipes or bars, use {{a constant}} cutting velocity mode. This mode of operation, constant cutting velocity combined with different profiles of materials to be cut, exposes the cut-ting saw to variable cutting forces. Therefore, the <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> <b>machine</b> is usually {{set for the}} worst expected conditions, oth-erwise excessive wear of the saw and machine will occur. Fur-ther, traditional cutting-off machines require the adjustment {{of the position of}} a limit switch in order to automatically detect when the cut of a piece has been completed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the application of control algorithms to the process of cutting-off metallic pipes or bars, with variable pro-files, implemented in an industrial cutting-off machine, com-mercially available. The presented algorithms concern real-time cutting control and automatic detection of the cutting end. The algorithms are implemented in a low cost Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), allowing its use in industrial applica-tions without significant increase on machine cost. All algo-rithms were developed having in mind safety issues relative to the operation of the cutting machine in order to prevent catas-trophic failure. Also, all process related relevant parameters are monitored on a Personal Computer using OPC (Objec...|$|E

50|$|Thousands {{of years}} ago, the {{advanced}} city of Poseidos was plotting {{to take over}} the rest of Dinotopia. One boy, Gideon Altaire, who loved the forbidden mainland, defied the law and stole the Ruby Sunstone from the Air Scorpion, a new vessel built for conquest, <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> the <b>machine's</b> source of power. In the process, he discovers four trapped Pterosaurs, Catapult, Scimitar, Zanzibar, and Avatar. Avatar was a great skybax leader and made a connection with Gideon as soon as they met. Gideon frees the pterosaurs and escapes to the mainland.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: After {{investigating}} {{the operation of}} the TRT system of the blast furnace and analyzing the structure of the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve, the functions of the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve are decomposed by using the reverse fishbone diagram and function analysis. From {{the point of view of}} the system function, the problems of the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve are described. After the new principle solution is confirmed by effects and the function structure is improved by trimming, the solution to the problems existing in the speedy <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> valve is put forward...|$|R

This {{appears to have been}} the case on 27/28 January 2011 during the 2011 Egyptian protests, in what has been widely described as an [...] "unprecedented" [...] internet block. About 3500 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 22:10 to 22:35 UTC 27 January. This full block was implemented without <b>cutting</b> <b>off</b> major intercontinental fibre-optic links, with Renesys stating on 27 January, [...] "Critical European-Asian fiber-optic routes through Egypt appear to be unaffected for now." [...] Full blocks also occurred in Myanmar/Burma in 2007, Libya in 2011, and Syria during the Syrian civil war.|$|R
