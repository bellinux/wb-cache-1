40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and behavior}} of living exoerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium gallinaceum and P. fallax were studied {{by the use of}} tissue cultures, phase contrast microscopy, and time-lapse <b>cinephotomicrography.</b> The morphology of exoerythrocytic stages of these two species was essentially that previously observed in fixed, stained material, with the following exceptions: (1) the presence of a filament {{on one end of the}} merozoite, (2) the absence of clefts in the cytoplasm of the large schizonts, and (3) the absence of a vacuole-like space around the parasite. The following behavior was observed either directly or in time-lapse sequences: (1) emergence of merozoites from mature schizonts, (2) progressive motility of free merozoites, (3) entry of merozoites, both actively and passively, into host cells, (4) nuclear division in the parasite, (5) the various stages of schizogony, including final production of merozoites, (6) massive infection of host cells, and (7) phagocytosis of merozoites and attempted phagocytosis of mature schizonts by macrophages. Exoerythrocytic stages of P. fallax differed from those of P. gallinaceum in that the merozoites of the former were (1) somewhat more curved in shape and (2) present in fewer numbers in mature schizonts. The use of tissue culture, phase contrast microscopy, and time-lapse <b>cinephotomicrography</b> promises to solve many of the remaining problems concerning exoerythrocytic stages of malarial parasites and their interrelationships with host cells...|$|E
40|$|Time-lapse <b>cinephotomicrography</b> of mouse {{embryonic}} fibroblasts {{before and}} shortly after perfusion of tissue cultures reveals that the elongation of mitochondria caused by coenzyme A results from the terminal association of many shorter rods into {{a smaller number of}} long filaments. These are not permanent associations, but they reflect an exaggeration of the cohesive tendency of mitochondria, which in untreated cells is counterbalanced by frequent disjoinings and breakings of the anastomotic network. Our own observations and a survey of the literature suggest that elongate mitochondria with rapid movement and high metabolic activity tend to accompany proliferation in tissue cultures, and that mitotic inhibition of cultured cells may go together with short, slow mitochondria of low metabolic activity. The movement of mitochondria may be both active, reflecting metabolic exchanges with the cytoplasm, and passive, the result of hyaloplasmic currents...|$|E
40|$|Recent data {{indicate}} that the chromatoid body typical of rat spermatogenesis may contain RNA synthesized in early spermatids by the haploid genome. Analyses of living step- 1 and step- 3 spermatids by time- lapse <b>cinephotomicrography</b> {{have shown that the}} chromatoid body moves in relation to the nuclear envelope in two different ways. Predominantly in step 1, the chromatoid body moves along the nuclear envelope on a wide area surrounding the Golgi complex and has frequent transient contacts with the latter organelle. In step 3, the chromatoid body was shown to move perpendicular to the nuclear envelope. It was seen located very transiently at the top of prominent outpocketings of the nuclear envelope with apparent material continuities through nuclear pore complexes to intranuclear particles. The rapid movements of the chromatoid body are suggested {{to play a role in}} the transport of haploid gene products in the early spermatids, including probably nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport...|$|E
40|$|Actin {{filament}} based cell functions {{were examined}} in freshly isolated hepatocytes using phalloidin as an inhibitor. In particular, cell motility events, namely, surface bleb formation and canalicular contractile movements, were assessed and compared with morphologic changes in the cells. Phalloidin (in 0. 1, 1. 0, and 10. 0 micrograms/ml dosages) {{was added to the}} culture medium 4 hours after isolation of the hepatocytes. Cell motility was recorded with time-lapse <b>cinephotomicrography,</b> and the morphologic changes were evaluated by phase-contrast optics and by transmission electron microscopy of serial sections. Membrane-bound pericanalicular cytoplasmic vacuoles appeared first, followed by cytoplasmic protrusions at the cell surface. Vacuolar membrane continuities with the canalicular membrane were noted, and later, with other regions of the cell surface, such that large tortuous irregular membrane-bound canals are seen on serial sectioning to link extracellular and canalicular spaces. These findings suggest a possible disturbance in membrane flow. Canalicular motility was greatly reduced and was dose-dependent. The time-based difference in the changes at the canalicular and sinusoidal surfaces may be indicative of different functions and/or sensitivities of the actin filaments within the liver cell...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Chlamydomonas mutant vfl- 3 lacks normal {{striated}} {{fibers and}} microtubular rootlets. Although the flagella beat vigorously, the cells rarely display effective forward swimming. High speed <b>cinephotomicrography</b> reveals that flagellar waveform, frequency, and beat synchrony {{are similar to}} those of wild-type cells, indicating that neither striated fibers nor microtubular rootlets are required for initiation or synchronization of flagellar motion. However, in contrast to wild type, the effective strokes of the flagella of vfl- 3 may occur in virtually any direction. Although the direction of beat varies between cells, it was not observed to vary for a given flagellum during periods of filming lasting up to several thousand beat cycles, indicating that the flagella are not free to rotate in the mature cell. Structural polarity markers in the proximal portion of each flagellum show that the flagella of the mutant have an altered rotational orientation consistent with their altered direction of beat. This implies that the variable direction of beat is not due to a defect in the intrinsic polarity of the axoneme, and that in wild-type cells the striated fibers and/or associated structures are important in establishing or maintaining the correct rotational orientation of the basal bodies to ensure that the inherent functional polarity of the flagellum results in effective cellular movement.

40|$|The {{role of the}} Golgi {{apparatus}} in wall {{formation of}} vegetative cells of a marine chrysophyte, Pleurochrysis scherffelii, is described. Wall fragments are synthesized within the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. A single Golgi apparatus is always located at the cell periphery, and the distended cisternae are oriented toward the cell surface. A highly-ordered body found near the inflated cisternae is associated with spherical, membrane-bounded bodies which {{may be involved in}} the progressive degeneration of cisternal membranes which release wall fragments. Protoplast movement has been detected by time-lapse <b>cinephotomicrography</b> and is correlated at the ultrastructural level with change in positions of the Golgi cisternae. Wall-synthesizing capacity is greatest during transverse wall formation. Senescent cells lack a Golgi apparatus with inflated cisternae. In addition, wall fragments are not present in the Golgi cisternae at this stage. Zoosporogenesis results in a temporary loss of the wall-forming capacity of the Golgi apparatus; this activity then resumes with the formation of a different morphological entity, the scale. Preliminary quantitative measurements of the turnover capacity of the Golgi apparatus have been made. From these data it has been determined that between 41 and 82 Golgi generations are required to synthesize the cell wall of an actively growing cell; this estimate indicates that approximately one cisterna is produced every 2 min, provided the cell generation time is 3 days. The time-lapse cinephotomicrographic data confirm that the rate of production of Golgi cisternae is at least one cisterna every 2 min...|$|E
