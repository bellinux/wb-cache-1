5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure <b>culture</b> <b>on</b> agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E

Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism is compared in secondary cultures of mouse mammary epithelial cells maintained on plastic or type I collagen gel substrates. The incorporation of 35 SO 42 - into GAG during brief labeling indicates no difference between substrates {{in the rate of}} GAG synthesis. During prolonged labeling, however, accumulation of [35 S]GAG in <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> colllagen exceeds that of <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> plastic. This increased accumulation is due to a markedly reduced rate of GAG degradation. GAG degradation does not occur in the medium, indicating that degradation is localized to the cells. The <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> collagen contain a slowly degrading cell-associated [35 S]GAG pool and a ruthenium red-stained basal lamina, neither of which is present in <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> plastic.

5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} <b>culture</b> <b>on</b> a large scale in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate {{a wide range of}} conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists {{developed}} the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern Mediterranean cultures by analysing {{the origin of}} artifacts (for example, items from Crete, mainland Greece, Cyprus or Canaan) found in each archaeological layer. If an artifact's origin can be accurately dated, it gives a reference date for the layer {{in which it is}} found. If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA (LMIA) <b>culture</b> <b>on</b> Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with Late Cycladic I (LCI) and Late Helladic I (LHI) cultures, but predates Peloponnesian LHI.

5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian <b>culture</b> <b>on</b> the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E

To purify and expand human PSC-derived HBCs, human PSC-derived HBCs were cultured on dishes coated with various types of human recombinant laminins (LN). Human PSC-derived HBCs attached to human laminin- 111 (LN 111) -coated dish via integrin alpha 6 and beta 1 and were purified and expanded by <b>culturing</b> <b>on</b> the LN 111 -coated dish, but not by <b>culturing</b> <b>on</b> dishes coated with other laminin isoforms.

It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set.

40|$|ABSTRACT When mouse mammary {{epithelial}} cells are cultured on a plastic substratum, no basal lamina forms. When cultured on a type I Collagen gel, {{the rate of}} glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis is unchanged, but the rate of GAG degradation is markedly reduced and a GAG-rich, basal laminalike structure accumulates. This effect of collagen was investigated by comparing the culture distribution, nature, and metabolic stability of the 355 -GAG-containing molecules produced by cells on plastic and collagen. During 48 h of labeling with 3550 4, <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> collagen accumulate 1. 4 -fold more 355 -GAG per microgram of DNA. In these cultures, most of the extracellular 355 -GAG is immobilized with the lamina and collagen gel, whereas in <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> plastic all extracellular 35 S_ GAG is soluble. On both substrata, the cells produce several heparan sulfate-rich 35 S-proteoglycan fractions that are distinct by Sepharose CL- 4 B chromatography. The culture types contain similar amounts of each fraction, except that Collagen cultures contain nearly four times more of a fraction that is found largely bound to the lamina and Collagen gel. During a chase this proteoglycan fraction is stable in <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> Collagen, but is extensively degraded in <b>cultures</b> <b>on</b> plastic. Thus, Collageninduced formation of a basal lamina correlates with reduced degradation and enhanced accumulation of a specific heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan fraction.
