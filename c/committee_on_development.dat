500|$|According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, of Arad's 23,300 2005 population, 82% were Jews, {{and another}} 17.2% were other non-Arabs. 11,100 (~47.6%) were men and 12,200 were women. 42.9% (the second {{highest in the}} country) were {{immigrants}} since 1990. Arad's population peaked in 2002 at 24,500. in Localities Numbering Above 5,000 Residents |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |work=55th Statistical Yearbook |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229093427/http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton55/st02_14.pdf |archivedate=29 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} Arad's former mayor, Moty Brill, said {{that the reason for}} the city's decline is its failure to absorb the massive immigration from Russia. In early 2007, a study ordered by the Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry found that Arad suffered from a negative image, and described it a [...] "settlement that drives residents away". In March, The Ministerial <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> <b>Development</b> in the Negev and Galilee approved a plan to move the State Archives from Jerusalem to Arad and to subsidize the costs of land development for reserve soldiers, anticipating the IDF's plan to relocate its training bases to the Negev.|$|E
500|$|The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, {{commonly}} known as the Sakharov Prize, honours individuals and groups of people who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights and freedom of thought. Named after Russian scientist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, the prize was established in December 1988 by the European Parliament. A shortlist of nominees is drawn up annually by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> <b>Development,</b> with the winner announced in October. The prize is accompanied by a monetary award of €50,000. [...] The first prize was awarded jointly to South African Nelson Mandela and Russian Anatoly Marchenko. The 1990 award was given to Aung San Suu Kyi, but she could not receive it until 2013 {{as a result of her}} political imprisonment in Burma. The prize has also been awarded to organisations, the first being the Argentine Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1992. Three Sakharov laureates were subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize: Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, and Malala Yousafzai.|$|E
