60|$|The Indians {{offered no}} opposition, {{but at that}} moment another yell rose from the hushes, and about thirty mounted Indians, who had been {{concealed}} behind a projecting <b>cliff,</b> <b>sprang</b> forward and closed up the only place of escape with a formidable array of spears. From their not using their arrows it was evident that they wished to capture the white men alive, for the purpose, no doubt, of taking them home to their wigwams, there to put them to death by slow torture with the assistance of their squaws.|$|R

There would be time enough for this before the steamer sailed. When she read this brief note, Mrs. <b>Cliff</b> <b>sprang</b> out of bed.|$|R

6000|$|Quite at the top, {{and just}} before the rocky face of the <b>cliff</b> <b>sprang</b> above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the country as [...] "Cluny's Cage." [...] The trunks of several trees had been wattled across, the {{intervals}} strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which grew out from the hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof. The walls were of wattle and covered with moss. The whole house had something of an egg shape; and it half hung, half stood in that steep, hillside thicket, like a wasp's nest in a green hawthorn.|$|R

At the same time echoes innumerable, which had lain dormant since creation, or at best had given but sleepy response to the bark of walruses and the cry of gulls, took up the shot in lively haste and sent it to and fro from cliff to crag in bewildering continuation.|$|R

50|$|The Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness (BRCW) {{is located}} in western Colorado with a small portion {{extending}} into eastern Utah, USA, within the arid Colorado Plateau region approximately 15 mi west of Grand Junction, Colorado. The wilderness lies on the northwest flank of the Uncompahgre Plateau. It {{is characterized by the}} high, east-west trending Black Ridge dissected by seven major canyon systems, draining into the Colorado River in Ruby Canyon. Elevations range from 4700 ft above sea level along the river to 6800 ft. Canyons vary in length from several miles to twelve miles in length and may contain interesting side canyons. Geological features in these canyons include spires, windows, giant alcoves and desert varnish. Canyons may reach a depth of almost 1000 ft, forming spectacular redrock <b>cliffs.</b> <b>Spring</b> runoff and summer thunderstorms create glistening waterfalls and plunge pools. Rattlesnake Canyon contains the second largest concentration of natural arches in the country. Mee Canyon is even more remote, and contains Arch Tower.|$|R

The Limestone Ridge target complex includes 10 discrete sites totaling approximately 245 acres along an existing unimproved road network between Limestone Ridge and the Belted Range. The target complexes would consist of reconfigurable target arrays and associated roads and trails with vehicles, downed aircraft, and silhouettes. Targets would be either dragged or hauled into place from existing roads or 2 -track trails, and placed along or adjacent to existing roads, under trees or adjacent to steep slopes to provide natural cover for the targets. The Saucer Mesa target array would employ both largescale live and inert munitions, and the Limestone Ridge sites would employ large-scale inert munitions; both target sites would employ small-scale live munitions. Targets would support airdropped munitions and ground-fired munitions operations. Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) teams would be inserted in the area from helicopters and traverse the target areas...|$|R

6000|$|All this Ulysses knew, for Circe {{had warned}} him. But {{he also knew}} that {{on the other side of}} the strait, where the sea spray for ever flew high above the rock, was a whirlpool, called Charybdis, which would swallow up his ship if it came within the current, while Scylla could only catch some of his men. For this reason he bade the {{helmsman}} to steer close to the rock of Scylla, and he did not tell the sailors that she lurked there with her body hidden in her deep cave. He himself put on his armour, and took two spears, and went and stood in the raised half deck at the front of the ship, thinking that, at least, he would have a stroke at Scylla. Then they rowed down the swift sea stream, while the wave of the whirlpool now rose up, till the spray hid the top of the rock, and now fell, and bubbled with black sand. They were watching the whirlpool, when out from the hole in the <b>cliff</b> <b>sprang</b> the six heads of Scylla, and up into the air went six of Ulysses' men, each calling to him, as they were swept within her hole in the rock, where she devoured them. 'This was the most pitiful thing,' Ulysses said, 'that my eyes have seen, of all my sorrows in searching out the paths of the sea.' ...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the special}} nature of the chalky soil, there are many rare plants in the area, {{particularly}} several varieties of orchid which are at their best in early summer. In particular, the tall lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) grows under the staircases leading down to the beach. The chalk also provides a distinctive light green tint to the beech trees {{along the top of}} the <b>cliffs,</b> maintaining their <b>spring</b> hues throughout the summer season. In the hilly park which stretches a couple of kilometers inland, there are a number of ponds and marshes, many populated by trees. Several signposted circuits provide opportunities for walkers, riders and cyclists to discover the surroundings.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the overall}} Gap Analysis mission to compile {{information}} in support of biodiversity maintenance, individual Gap projects may conduct analyses focusing on special features of states or regions. Special feature analysis may be used to capture location information for specialized or localized habitat features such as caves, <b>springs,</b> <b>cliffs,</b> certain tree species, etc. These special features may not normally be found in statewide land cover and habitat datasets but may be important factors in the distribution of certain wildlife species. In addition, the assignment of Gap management status (level of protection) may also be specifically tailored to the special features analyzed. A case study describing West Virginia Gap Analysis (WV-GAP) work on amphibians and mammals utilizing cave habitats will be presented. In addition to standard Gap Analysis methods, WV-GAP used existing datasets for cave locations and cave accessibility to determine the gap analysis status of cave species in the state. Additional examples of special features of interest will also be discussed...|$|R

It was quickly evident that its owner had discovered Om-at for immediately he started upward in pursuit. Without a word Tarzan and Ta-den sprang forward toward the foot of the cliff. The pithecanthropus was the first to reach it and the ape-man saw him spring upward for a handhold on the lowest peg above him. Now Tarzan saw other pegs roughly paralleling each other in zigzag rows up the <b>cliff</b> face. He <b>sprang</b> and caught one of these, pulled himself upward by one hand until he could reach a second with his other hand; and when he had ascended far enough to use his feet, discovered that he could make rapid progress.

60|$|Frank promised {{implicit}} {{obedience to}} these instructions, {{and the whole}} party then set to work to pile the goods on a ledge in the steep <b>cliffs</b> behind the <b>spring,</b> so that a fortress was soon formed, which, with two such stout and courageous men as Moses and Oostesimow, armed with two guns each, a brace of pistols, two cutlasses, and an ample supply of ammunition, could have stood a prolonged siege from much more practised enemies than Indians or Esquimaux. After having completed these defensive arrangements, and provided occupation for those who remained in camp, by laying on them the duty of having the goods examined, {{in order to see}} that nothing had been damaged by wet or rough usage, the two canoes pushed from the shore, and bounded lightly away, while the men sang merrily at their easy labour; for now that the canoes were light, they might have been propelled by two men. Frank directed his course obliquely up the river, towards the island already alluded to, and Stanley proceeded with the current towards the narrows beyond which he expected to catch sight of the sea.|$|R

5000|$|Chalma {{is a small}} {{community}} of 1701 people (as of the 2005 census), {{which is part of}} the municipality of Malinalco. [...] It lies eleven km east of the municipal seat of Malinalco, 65 km from the state capital of Toluca and 95 km from Mexico City. [...] The town is surrounded the dense vegetation, mountains, <b>cliffs,</b> glens, fresh-water <b>springs</b> and Chalma and Tlaxipehualco rivers. [...] A number of these hills and cliffs are dotted with crosses, with some over 7 meters in height. These crosses supposedly scare evil spirits. Each cross belongs to a specific group of worshippers who take the crosses down to the sanctuary every year to paint and adorn them. Then they are taken back up to their place on the mountain side, and the ritual ends with singing and dancing, guarding the cross all night.In addition to the Sanctuary of Chalma, there are two other attractions in the small town. The first is the Agua de Vida (Water of Life) Park, built by the State of Mexico and intended to be a kind of prelude to the sanctuary itself. Next to the park are caves dedicated to God the Father, God the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Plaza de los Peregrinos (Plaza of the Pilgrims), was constructed with various levels, stairs, arches, terraces, a place to pray with the purpose of giving pilgrims a place to rest. Cultural and religious activities also take place here. It also features a mural in relief with religious themes.Festival days in the community of Chalma are distinguished by the construction of large panels decorated with colorful flowers and seeds. Local inhabitants make arches from tissue or crepe paper to decorate atriums, squares and streets.Almost all of Chalma’s small population makes its living from the pilgrimages, with the street leading to sanctuary completely filled with shops and street vendors, with no vehicular traffic allowed. Most of these vendors sell religious trinkets, plastic bottles for the spring water, and traditional Mexican cuisine.|$|R
