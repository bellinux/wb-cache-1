40|$|AbstractObjective: The first {{generation}} of pericardial valves was withdrawn from the market because of {{a high rate of}} premature failure. With an original design, Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves promised improved results. Methods: One hundred fifty patients who underwent isolated mitral valve replacement, between July 1984 and December 1993, with Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprostheses in our institution were followed up. Patient mean age was 62. 9 ± 11. 9 years. Operative mortality was 3. 3 %. All but three patients were followed up for an average of 4. 7 years after operation, and total follow-up was 710 patient-years. Results: At the time this article was written, over 80 % of patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II. After 10 years, actuarial survival rate was 71 % (<b>confidence</b> <b>limit</b> 61 % to 81 %). Valve-related complications included the following: six valve-related deaths (0. 8 % patient-year), five thromboembolic episodes (0. 7 % patient-year), three cases of endocarditis (0. 4 % patient-year), four reoperations (0. 5 % patient-year), and four structural valve failures with calcification and stenosis (0. 5 % patient-year). After 10 years, freedom from valve-related complications was 66 % (<b>confidence</b> <b>limit</b> 46 % to 86 %), from valve-related death 94 % (<b>confidence</b> <b>limit</b> 89 % to 99 %), from reoperation 90 % (<b>confidence</b> <b>limit</b> 82 % to 98 %), and from valve failure 76 % (<b>confidence</b> <b>limit</b> 62 % to 90 %). Conclusions: With a low rate of valve-related events at 10 years and a low rate of structural deterioration with no leaflet tear, this prosthesis is a reliable choice for patients over 60 years of age.

40|$|Estimating {{uncertainty}} in lifetime cancer risk for human exposure to space radiation {{is a unique}} challenge. Conventional risk assessment with low-linear-energy-transfer (LET) -based risk from Japanese atomic bomb survivor studies may be inappropriate for relativistic protons and nuclei in space due to track structure effects. This paper develops a Monte Carlo mixture model (MCMM) for transferring additive, National Institutes of Health multiplicative, and multiplicative excess cancer incidence risks based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data to determine excess incidence risk for various US astronaut exposure profiles. The MCMM serves as an anchor point for future risk projection methods involving biophysical models of DNA damage from space radiation. Lifetime incidence risks of radiation-induced cancer for the MCMM based on low-LET Japanese data for nonleukemia (all cancers except leukemia) were 2. 77 (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 0. 75 - 11. 34) for males exposed to 1 Sv at age 45 and 2. 20 (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 0. 59 - 10. 12) for males exposed at age 55. For females, mixture model risks for nonleukemia exposed separately to 1 Sv at ages of 45 and 55 were 2. 98 (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 0. 90 - 11. 70) and 2. 44 (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 0. 70 - 10. 30), respectively. Risks for high-LET 200 MeV protons (LET= 0. 45 keV/micrometer), 1 MeV alpha-particles (LET= 100 keV/micrometer), and 600 MeV iron particles (LET= 180 keV/micrometer) were scored on a per particle basis by determining the particle fluence required {{for an average of}} one particle per cell nucleus of area 100 micrometer(2). Lifetime risk per proton was 2. 68 x 10 (- 2) % (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 0. 79 x 10 (- 3) %- 0. 514 x 10 (- 2) %). For alpha-particles, lifetime risk was 14. 2 % (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 2. 5 %- 31. 2 %). Conversely, lifetime risk per iron particle was 23. 7 % (90 % <b>confidence</b> <b>limit,</b> 4. 5 %- 53. 0 %). Uncertainty in the DDREF for high-LET particles may be less than that for low-LET radiation because typically there is very little dose-rate dependence. Probability density functions for high-LET radiation quality and dose-rate may be preferable to conventional risk assessment approaches. Nuclear reactions and track structure effects in tissue may not be properly estimated by existing data using in vitro models for estimating RBEs. The method used here is being extended to estimate {{uncertainty in}} spacecraft shielding effectiveness in various space radiation environments...|$|R
