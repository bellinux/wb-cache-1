5|$|Today {{physicists}} <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{for applications}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in fluid dynamics into problems in general relativity.|$|E

25|$|In some species, larvae are {{attended}} {{and protected}} by ants while feeding on the host plant, and the ants receive sugar-rich honeydew from them, throughout the larval life, {{and in some}} species during the pupal stage. In other species, only the first few instars are spent on the plant, and {{the remainder of the}} larval lifespan is spent as a predator within the ant nest. It becomes a parasite, feeding on ant regurgitations, or a predator on the ant larvae. The caterpillars pupate inside the ant's nest and the ants <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after the pupa. Just before the adult emerges the wings of the butterfly inside the pupal case detach from it, and the pupa becomes silvery. The adult butterfly emerges from the pupa after three to four weeks, still inside the ant nest. The butterfly must crawl out of the ant nest before it can expand its wings.|$|E

25|$|Kittens develop {{very quickly}} from {{about two weeks}} of age until their seventh week. Their {{coordination}} and strength improve. They play-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens' mother or other adult cats, who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the adult cats demonstrate hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate. As they reach {{three to four weeks}} old, the kittens are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks. Kittens generally begin to lose their baby teeth around three months of age, and have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months. Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers. Some mother cats will scatter their kittens as early as three months of age, while others <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after them until they approach sexual maturity.|$|E
500|$|... 1–4 months: Primary Circular Reactions – Babies notice {{objects and}} start {{following}} their movements. [...] They <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> where an object was, but {{for only a}} few moments. They 'discover' their eyes, arms, hands and feet in the course of acting on objects. This stage is marked by responses to familiar images and sounds (including parent's face) and anticipatory responses to familiar events (such as opening the mouth for a spoon). The infant's actions become less reflexive and intentionality emerges.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, in the Northern Isles the Scandinavian {{connection}} is still celebrated, {{one of the}} best-known such events [...] being the Lerwick fire-festival Up Helly Aa. In particular, Shetland's connection with Norway has proven to be enduring. When Norway became independent again in 1905 the Shetland authorities sent a letter to King Haakon VII in which they stated: [...] "Today no 'foreign' flag is more familiar or more welcome in our voes and havens than that of Norway, and Shetlanders <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon Norway as their mother-land, and recall with pride and affection the time when their forefathers were under the rule of the Kings of Norway." [...] At the 2013 Viking Congress held in Shetland the Scottish Government announced plans to strengthen Scotland’s historic links with Scandinavia.|$|E

After quoting the poem in full, the writer claimed, [...] "If Blake had lived in Germany, by this time {{he would have had}} commentators of the highest order upon every one of his effusions; but here, so little attention is paid to works of the mind".|$|E

Hamilton as saying: [...] "We don't know who authorized [...] We've asked that question 50 times." [...] A May 26 article in The Hill quoted another Commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke's claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: [...] "It doesn't seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... I just don't think that the questions are resolved, {{and we need to}} dig deeper... Clarke sure didn't seem {{to say that he was}} the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for some more answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{transplantation}} therapies, islet transplantation is also handicapped by {{the limited}} donor pool. The numbers are striking; at least 1 million Americans have {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus, {{and only a few}} thousand donor pancreata are available each year. To circumvent this organ shortage problem, researchers <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for ways to [...] "grow" [...] islets—or at least cells capable of physiologically regulated insulin secretion—in vitro, but currently only islets from cadaveric donors can be used to restore euglycemia. Further exacerbating the problem (and unlike kidney, liver, and heart transplants, where only one donor is needed for each recipient) most islet transplant patients require islets from two or more donors to achieve euglycemia. Lastly, the current methods for islet isolation need improvement, since only about half of attempted isolations produce transplant-ready islets.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1982, Iraq {{was removed}} from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the {{transfer}} of dual-use technology to that country. According to investigative journalist Alan Friedman, Secretary of State Alexander Haig was [...] "upset at the fact that the decision had been made at the White House, even though the State Department was responsible for the list." [...] "I was not consulted," [...] Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82—seeking [...] "a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East"—and in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: [...] "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." [...] Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was [...] "the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq," [...] and sparked a short-lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetton to [...] "get the hell out of Iraq," [...] but Iraqi military intelligence—"having already drooled over it and having said repeatedly how valuable it was"—subsequently informed Twetton [...] "we'll <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at your information, and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way." [...] Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984. [...] "On November 26, 1984, Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations." ...|$|E
