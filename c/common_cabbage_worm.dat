50|$|Cotesia rubecula parasitizes the <b>cabbage</b> <b>worm</b> caterpillar, {{generally}} in {{the stage of}} first instar, with the female wasp stinging and laying between 20 and 50 eggs within the host instar. The defense mechanism of the caterpillars can sometimes kill the eggs. If they do not, the caterpillar does not die until the larvae of the wasp emerge. The impact on the host population can vary greatly, from a small percentage to up to 75% of the caterpillars in a given habitat.|$|R
5000|$|The caterpillar, a {{measuring}} worm, {{is smooth and}} pale green with white stripes {{and is one of}} many species called <b>cabbage</b> <b>worm.</b> It is called a [...] "looper" [...] because it arches its body as it crawls, inchworm-style. This species is very destructive to plants due to its voracious consumption of leaves. It is not restricted to cole crops; other plant hosts include tomato, cucumber, thyme, collard greens, and potato. The adult of the species is a nocturnal brown moth.|$|R
40|$|The green {{caterpillar}} of the Large <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Worm</b> Pieris rapae, {{with its}} narrow orange or yellow dorsal stripe, {{emerges from the}} soil for two to four weeks in order to feed on the leaves of many different species of cabbages. It then returns underground to reappear 15 days later as a white butterfly. An understanding of this life-cycle shows how the pest can be controlled {{without the use of}} chemicals. The first step is to practice crop rotation by alternating carrots or maize, for example, with cabbages. The caterpillars are then starved of their food source. By turning over the soil around the cabbage plants several times, both at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the season, the caterpillars are desiccated through exposure to air. If some escape they can be retrieved manually and destroyed. The butterflies can be controlled by using a sticky, yellow trap placed in the middle of the crop, or they can be discouraged by cultivating plants that have a strong and, to the butterflies, unpleasant, odour (onion, garlic, sage, mint, cinnamon). Other non-chemical means of control include the use of a garlic concoction made with crushed garlic cloves (five cloves to four litres of water) or by macerating neem seeds (two handfuls of crushed seed to ten litres of water over 12 hours) or even by scattering a mixture of one part salt to two parts flour on the plants after rain. The caterpillars gorge themselves on this mixture and become so bloated that they die. Another strong ally is a small wasp which lays its eggs among those of the Large <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Worm</b> and on which the young wasps feed. Wasps can be attracted by planting, for example, mint or parsley, but insecticides must be avoided because the wasps are particularly sensitive to them. However, with this array of weapons ranged against the pest, chemicals should be unnecessary.

40|$|Elevated {{jasmonic acid}} (JA) {{concentrations}} {{in response to}} herbivory can induce wounded plants to produce defences against herbivores. In laboratory and field experiments we compared the effects of exogenous JA treatment to two closely related cabbage species on the host-searching and oviposition preference of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. JA-treated Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris) was less attractive than untreated Chinese cabbage to ovipositing DBM, while JA-treatment of <b>common</b> <b>cabbage</b> (B. oleracea) made plants more attractive than untreated controls for oviposition by this insect. Similar effects were observed when plants of the two species were damaged by DBM larvae. In the absence of insect-feeding, or JA application, Chinese cabbage is much more attractive to DBM than <b>common</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Inducible resistance therefore appears to occur in a more susceptible plant and induced susceptibility appears to occur in a more resistant plant, suggesting a possible balance mechanism between constitutive and inducible defences to a specialist herbivore...|$|R
40|$|The term ‘dead-end trap cropping' has {{recently}} been proposed to identify a plant that is highly attractive for oviposition by an insect pest, but on which offspring of the pest cannot survive. The potential of the wild crucifer Barbarea vulgaris R. Br. to allure {{and serve as a}} dead-end trap crop for the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.), an important pest of cruciferous crops worldwide, was examined in laboratory experiments. When P. xylostella adults were provided with a dual-choice of plants of B. vulgaris, and Chinese cabbage Brassica campestris (L.), in one arena, adult moths laid 2. 5 - 6. 8 times more eggs on the former than on the latter. When P. xylostella adults were provided with a dual-choice of plants of B. vulgaris and <b>common</b> <b>cabbage</b> Brassica oleracea L., adult moths laid virtually all their eggs on the former and ignored the latter. Nearly all P. xylostella eggs laid on the three species of plants hatched successfully, but nearly all individuals on plants of B. vulgaris died as neonates or early instar larvae, while 87 - 100 % of the larvae on Chinese <b>cabbage</b> and <b>common</b> <b>cabbage</b> survived to pupation.

50|$|Traditionally {{known in}} the United States as the {{imported}} <b>cabbage</b> <b>worm,</b> now more commonly the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black pints, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During {{the first and second}} instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow {{but the rest of the}} head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.|$|R

In some locations consumers demand that greenhouse growers stop the use of certain pesticides. This demand has reached greenhouse growers and spurred interest in the use of biocontrol in New York’s Capital Region. The goal of this implementation project was to provide an understanding of the challenges and benefits of using biocontrol in greenhouse production to the major players in the bedding plant industry: consumers, growers, and educators. Specifically, I hoped to improve retailer and grower biocontrol communication to consumers, give consumers knowledge of biocontrol, and increase grower confidence applying biocontrol products. Biocontrol demonstration was implemented at the Schenectady County Horticulture Education Center (SCHEC) where educational workshops were held to explain what the biocontrol agents are, the packaging they arrive in, understand the complexity of biocontrol systems, and ask questions.

Females displayed strong olfactory and oviposition preferences for herbivore-induced <b>common</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L. cv. sugarloaf) plants over intact plants; these preferences decreased with time and disappeared by the 7 th day after induction. In herbivore-induced <b>common</b> <b>cabbage</b> plants, eggs were clustered near feeding damage on the younger leaves (leaves 5 - 7), whereas in intact plants, eggs were clustered on the stem and lower leaves (leaves 1 - 4). However, as the time interval between larval feeding and oviposition increased, more eggs were laid on the lower leaves of induced plants. This demonstrates a change in egg distribution from the pattern associated with induced plants to that associated with intact plants. In contrast, females displayed strong olfactory and oviposition preferences for intact Chinese cabbage [Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis (Lour.) Hanelt cv. Wombok] plants over induced plants; these preferences decreased with time and disappeared by the 5 th day after induction. More eggs were laid on the upper leaves (leaves 4 - 6) than on the lower leaves (leaves 1 - 3) of intact Chinese cabbage plants at first, but the distribution changed over time until {{there were no significant}} differences in the egg count between upper and lower leaves by the 4 th day post induction. For both host plant species, pre-alighting responses of moths were reliable indicators of post-alighting responses on the first 2 days post induction.
