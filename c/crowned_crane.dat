In December, 1903, Lord and Lady William Cecil attended Princess Henry of Battenburg {{to return}} to Egypt, having been members of her household for many years. Her second season was not as productive and her work was overshadowed by a discovery made on Elephantine Island of a papyrus engagement contract. The document, in Aramaic script, contained important descriptions of the fortress and city of Aswan {{in the era of}} Artaxerxes I and Darius II and Lady William worked diligently with Howard Carter and others to try to get it published. In 1904, she published Bird Notes from the Nile, which she offered for sale to benefit the parish church of St Mary's Church in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The book inspired the black <b>crowned</b> <b>crane,</b> balearica pavonia ceciliae to be named in her honour. Other charitable works Lady William supported included the Children's Invalid Aid Fund; London's Queen's Hospital for Children, for which she was one of only two women directors; and the ambulance and hospital works of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, for which she also served as a Lady Justice. Lady William and her husband spent the next several years travelling, visiting Australia in 1905.|$|E
