With coal or ore exploitation into deep underground mine environments, high {{temperature and humidity}} creates risks because of large amounts of heat generated from geothermal heat, mining machines, groundwater and mine water. There have been many assessment methods for underground mine environment, such as dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature. However, none of the current methods can comprehensively evaluate the underground mine environment since most methods consider only {{one or a few}} defined factors and neglect others. In order to evaluate the human body‟s thermal status in terms of both personal and environmental viewpoints, this investigation firstly discusses the new upper limits of dry-bulb temperature with the support of some simulated results of indicators from ISO 7933, and then adopts both mean skin temperature and dry-bulb temperature to establish a zone diagram. The calculation of mean skin temperature is based on the heat balance of the human body with the ambient environment. Then existent regulations on underground mine environments and some typical condition parameters in underground mines are applied to circumscribe different thermal zones.

For the first analysis a calculation of arithmetic mean values representing EI-Nino, La-Nina and Normal condition has been performed. Next, a fuzzy clustering analysis is applied to these mean values. The clustering analysis consists of two steps.

This simplifies the enforcement of comfort, which can be directly imposed through appropriate constraints on the control inputs. Furthermore, a model that is easily scalable in the number of zones and convex {{as a function of the}} control inputs is derived based on energy balance equations.

The main contribution of the work presented here is the new formulation to account SLR correlations in ISO 13790, obtained for sunspaces, but generalizable for other solar systems with known SLR functions. Simulation models are used to perform a sensitivity analysis of internal gains and heat transfer through solar collector surfaces, both issues that distinguishes ISO 13790 from Load Ratio methods. The analysis shows that internal gains {{can be added to}} the heat source term or subtracted to heat transfer term without influencing the utilization factor dependence with the gain-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, the SLR assumption that solar collector surfaces are neutral elements and, therefore, not added to the heat transfer term, results in large inconsistencies between SLR and ISO 13790 methods. The detailed monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fairly reproduces results obtained by simulation. However, predictions from the simplified monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fail in mid season months and coldest months...|$|R
