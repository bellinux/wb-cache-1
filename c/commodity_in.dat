5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued <b>commodity</b> <b>in</b> ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E
40|$|This paper finds that, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} rapid growing index investment <b>in</b> <b>commodities</b> markets since early 2000 s, futures prices of different <b>commodities</b> <b>in</b> the US became increasingly correlated {{with each other and}} this trend was significantly more pronounced for <b>commodities</b> <b>in</b> the two popular GSCI and DJ-UBS commodity indices. This finding reflects a financialization process of commodities markets and helps explain the synchronized price boom and bust of a broad set of seemingly unrelated <b>commodities</b> <b>in</b> the US in 2006 - 2008. <b>In</b> contrast, such <b>commodity</b> price comovements were absent in China, which refutes growing commodity demands from emerging economies as the driver. ...|$|R

5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) {{has been an important}} <b>commodity</b> <b>in</b> human activities, as testified by the English word salary, referring to salarium, money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.|$|E

60|$|It is, however, of {{the utmost}} {{importance}} to observe that excess of all <b>commodities,</b> <b>in</b> the only sense in which it is possible, means only a temporary fall in their value relatively to money. To suppose that the markets for all <b>commodities</b> could, <b>in</b> any other sense than this, be overstocked, involves the absurdity that <b>commodities</b> may fall <b>in</b> value relatively to themselves; or that, of two commodities, each can fall relatively to the other, A becoming equivalent to B-x, and B to A-x, at the same time. And it is, perhaps, a sufficient reason for not using phrases of this description, that they suggest the idea of excessive production. A want of market for one article may arise from excessive production of that article; but when <b>commodities</b> <b>in</b> general become unsaleable, it is from a very different cause; there cannot be excessive production of <b>commodities</b> <b>in</b> general.|$|R

25|$|In 1810, {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars, Mauritius passed to British hands, as {{confirmed}} in the Treaty of Paris, {{at a time}} when the British Empire was expanding its influence in the Indian Ocean region.

25|$|The labor {{theory of}} product-value is wrong, which obviates {{the bulk of}} Marx's argument. Marginal utility theory predicts that a {{relatively}} high rate of profit attracts further investment, but each additional unit of production will generally tend to be of less utility (and therefore less value) to the market, causing the overall rate of profit to fall absent any technological innovation increasing productivity. The <b>commodity</b> <b>in</b> question will lose its appeal to investors, who will then invest in other, newer lines of production offering higher returns.|$|E
