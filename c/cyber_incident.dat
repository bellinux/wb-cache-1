30|$|There {{could be}} a variety of {{heterogeneous}} IoT devices (e.g., smart meters, smart inverters) clustered in a microgrid which represent extensive entry points and communication links that are unintentionally exposed to potential attackers. Without an inherent cybersecurity design, intra-microgrid communications are vulnerable to a multitude of <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents.</b> For example, attackers are likely to compromise smart meters they can easy access for discovering private power consumption profiles (e.g., by installing malware) [49]. <b>Cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> (e.g., malware infection, denial-of-service) originated in a compromised IoT device can quickly propagate and overwhelm the entire microgrid communication and control system due primarily to their ubiquitous connectivity. Consequently, traditional solutions designed for securing Internet services are deemed inadequate for protecting microgrid communications from potential <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents.</b> The diverse properties of hardware components and software applications further complicate the design and implementation of microgrid-specific cybersecurity enhancement solutions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Information is a {{critical}} asset on which all modern organizations depend to meet their mission objectives. Military organizations, in particular, have embedded Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) into their core mission processes {{as a means to}} increase their operational efficiency, exploit automation, improve decision quality, and enable real-time situational awareness. However, an extreme dependence upon ICT results in an environment where a <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> can result in severe mission degradation, or possibly failure, with catastrophic consequences to life, limb, and property. In this paper, we present the initial results of an experiment designed to measure the utility of a <b>Cyber</b> <b>Incident</b> Mission Impact Assessment (CIMIA) notification process. CIMIA is focused upon minimizing the consequences following an information incident by maintaining real-time situational awareness of mission critical resources so appropriate contingency actions can be taken in a timely manner to assure mission success. The results of the experiment show that implementing a CIMIA notification process significantly reduced the response time required for subjects to recognize and take proper contingency measures. The research confirms that timely and relevant notification following a <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> is an essential element of mission assurance.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe National <b>Cyber</b> <b>Incident</b> Response Plan stipulates the state homeland security advisor as the contact {{point for a}} significant <b>cyber</b> <b>incident.</b> But {{this may not be}} the most effective method of response because the state homeland security advisors are not domain experts for cyberspace. A questionnaire was sent to state chief information officers and/or state chief information security officers to determine current capability and procedures for responding to a national cybersecurity incident. Nineteen states replied with 227 responses relating to information sharing between states and the federal government; use of established cybersecurity event and response definitions, coordination and control mechanisms, and terms; use of risk-based approaches to <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> planning, including remediation based on workflows and procedures; establishment of thresholds when predefined boundaries are crossed; and instigation of varying courses of action. As a result of the survey, the author recommends increasing knowledge and information flow between state and federal agencies regarding national cyber incidents; the establishment of regional cybersecurity hubs throughout the nation; and the creation of a national <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> teleconferencing network and prearranged protocols for situational awareness and communication of courses of action following a cybersecurity incident.

40|$|The 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey: Systems of National Interest was {{designed}} and conducted to obtain {{a better understanding of}} how <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> are affecting the Australian businesses that form part of Australia’s systems of national interest, including critical infrastructure. These businesses and industries underpin the social and economic wellbeing of the nation and deliver essential services, including banking and finance, communications, energy, resources, transport and water. The findings from this survey provide a picture of the current cyber security measures these businesses have in place; the recent <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> they have experienced; and their reporting of them. These findings also provide baseline data from which the results of future annual surveys can be compared, to help ascertain overall trends. Importantly, business is taking cyber security seriously. This is paramount for the security of the individual organisation and its clients, as well as the industry sector, and the business community more broadly. However, the survey results also indicate that many organisations are not confident that cyber security is sufficiently understood and appreciated by staff, management and boards. In terms of <b>cyber</b> security <b>incidents,</b> more than half the organisations considered attacks on their organisation to be targeted. This indicates a shift from previous views or conceptions, that most attacks are non-targeted or indiscriminate. And while the majority of attacks were reported to come from external sources, the fact that 44 % originated from within organisations serves as a reminder that internally-focused cyber security controls and measures are also important. Reporting of <b>cyber</b> security <b>incidents</b> – which is critical to the effectiveness of the government-business partnership – clearly requires further attention. The CERT needs to articulate to business the benefits of reporting <b>cyber</b> security <b>incidents</b> to CERT Australia and to law enforcement, and that all information provided to the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.
