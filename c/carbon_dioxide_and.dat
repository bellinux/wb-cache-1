5|$|The {{material}} {{ejected from}} the volcano mainly consisted of water vapor, along with smaller amounts of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide. Further study by airborne monitors suggests that the materials were not oxidized much, and little of the concentration contained sulfates, less than 20%.|$|E
5|$|Yeast is the {{microorganism}} that {{is responsible}} for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> <b>and</b> thereby turns wort into beer.

5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved {{them to be}} a mixture of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.|$|E

5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|Sponges' cells absorb oxygen by {{diffusion}} {{from water}} into cells as water flows through body, into which <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> other soluble waste {{products such as}} ammonia also diffuse. Archeocytes remove mineral particles that threaten to block the ostia, transport them through the mesohyl and generally dump them into the outgoing water current, although some species incorporate them into their skeletons.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure on Earth's surface averages 101.325kPa, with a scale height of about 8.5km. It has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace {{amounts of water}} vapor, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> <b>and</b> other gaseous molecules. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8km at the poles to 17km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.|$|E

By having many trees, we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees, which will help reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the {{effects of climate change}} and urban heat islands.|$|E
5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor {{and found them}} to be a mixture of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them.|$|E
5|$|Barium, as a {{metal or}} when alloyed with aluminium, {{is used to}} remove {{unwanted}} gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> <b>and</b> water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E

5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E

Is there a biofactory that can convert <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> water, <b>and</b> sunlight into fuels? Yes, several species of cyanobacteria are known to produce and secrete low levels of alkanes <b>and</b> alkenes using <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> water, <b>and</b> sunlight (Schirmer et al. 2010).|$|R
5|$|In addition, the {{vaporizing}} {{metal and}} flux materials expose welders to dangerous gases and particulate matter. The smoke produced contains particles {{of various types}} of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest welding masks are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium metal is {{slightly}} unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound {{is known to}} absorb water and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> <b>and</b> {{may be used to}} remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction. Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|Methane {{can exist}} in the Martian {{atmosphere}} for only a limited period before it is destroyed—estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6–4 years. Its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Volcanic activity, cometary impacts, {{and the presence of}} methanogenic microbial life forms are among possible sources. Methane could be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization involving water, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> <b>and</b> the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars.|$|E
