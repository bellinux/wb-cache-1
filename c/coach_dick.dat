5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the last}} Super 12 final in 2005, a panel of experts picked the Crusaders team of the decade, which was {{published}} by the Christchurch Press. The experts chosen to select the team were: Tane Norton (former All Blacks captain), Vance Stewart (first Crusaders <b>coach),</b> <b>Dick</b> Tayler (president of supporters club), Bob Schumacher (former Christchurch Press rugby writer) and Tony Smith (Christchurch Press rugby writer).|$|E
5|$|The game's on-ice officials, Richard, Laycoe, Montreal {{assistant}} general manager Ken Reardon, Boston general manager Lynn Patrick, Montreal <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Irvin, and NHL referee-in-chief Carl Voss attended the March 16 hearing. In his defence, Richard contended that he was dazed and thought Thompson was one of Boston's players. He did not deny punching or attacking Laycoe.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 {{winning season}} would be {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith. After starting the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him {{for a majority of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{came into}} {{the game with a}} 911 record that {{included}} an unusual win over the Temple Owls, who were forced to forfeit a victory to Virginia Tech after using an ineligible player. Facing the Hokies in the Peach Bowl were the 18th-ranked Wolfpack from North Carolina State University. N.C. State was led by head <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Sheridan and had a regular-season record of 821 that included five wins over Atlantic Coast Conference teams.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, Campbell {{appeared}} at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens' first game after Richard's suspension. His presence provoked a riot at the Forum that spilled into the streets. The riot caused an estimated $100,000 in property damage, thirty-seven injuries, and 100 arrests. Tensions eased after Richard made a personal plea accepting his punishment and promising to return the following year to help the team win the Stanley Cup. The incident likely cost Richard the 1954–55 scoring title (an honour Richard never achieved in his NHL career) and {{played a role in}} the off-season departure of longtime Canadiens head <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Irvin.|$|E

5|$|On the game's next play, Chapman {{passed the}} ball deep, {{toward the end}} zone. Though the pass fell incomplete, a game {{official}} called a 15-yard pass interference penalty against NC State. This moved {{the ball to the}} NC State 23-yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game-winning 40-yard field goal with four seconds remaining. Though NC State <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Sheridan called a timeout in an attempt to ice Chris Kinzer, the kick sailed through the uprights and Virginia Tech won a 2524 victory as time expired.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe did not want to see the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former <b>coach,</b> <b>Dick</b> Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, Plante {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil—their top goaltender—had {{fractured}} his jaw. Plante played for three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. <b>Coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's first bowl win {{in school}} history came in a {{dramatic}} 25–24 win over the No. 18 North Carolina State Wolfpack in the 1986 Peach Bowl. Tech came into {{the game with a}} 9–1–1 record that included an unusual forfeit win over Temple. The Owls, who had played the game with an ineligible player, won the game on the field, but later forfeited the victory to Virginia Tech. Facing the Hokies in the 1986 Peach Bowl were the 18th-ranked Wolfpack from North Carolina State University. N.C. State was led by head <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Sheridan and had a regular-season record of 8–2–1 that included five wins over Atlantic Coast Conference teams.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, Johns Hopkins {{dominated}} the series, winning 12 of 13 games, including nine {{by an average}} margin of 5.6 points. During this period Hopkins, led by head coach Henry Ciccarone, won three national titles. By 1987, Maryland's fourth-year head <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Edell had helped revitalize the Terrapins as a national power. Maryland posted an 11–0 record during the regular season, where the win over Hopkins, 11–7, was the only game decided by less than six goals. In the NCAA tournament, Maryland defeated Penn in the quarterfinals, 12–8, and advanced to again meet Hopkins in the semifinals. Despite having recorded its first three-loss season in over a decade, and having edged North Carolina in the quarterfinals, the Blue Jays upset the Terrapins, 13–8. Hopkins, led by goalkeeper Quint Kessenich, advanced to win the national title against then undefeated Cornell in the final.|$|E

5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under <b>coach</b> <b>Dick</b> Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of double or triple teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{selected}} eighteen unprotected players, {{two from}} each of the nine other NBA teams. On {{the first day of the}} draft, they selected players from the Eastern Division teams; on the second day, they picked from the Western Division teams. The Bulls' selections included former first overall pick Bob Boozer, three-time All-Star Johnny Kerr and one-time All-Star Len Chappell. Kerr retired from playing prior to the start of the season, and was later named the franchise's first head coach. Another expansion draft pick, Al Bianchi, also retired as a player and was later named the team's assistant <b>coach.</b> <b>Dick</b> Klein had been planning to hire Kerr and Bianchi as coaches before the draft even took place, but because they were still under playing contracts with other teams, Klein needed to draft them instead of hiring them outright. Ten players from the expansion draft joined the Bulls for their inaugural season, but only six played more than one season for the team. Guy Rodgers—whom the Bulls acquired in exchange for Jim King and Jeff Mullins—and Jerry Sloan were named to the 1967 All-Star Game, becoming the franchise's first All-Stars.|$|E

Then, after the team's first season, Steinbrenner signed Ohio State University All-American Jerry Lucas. In the latter case, the signing enraged the rival National Basketball Association (NBA), which attempted to lure Steinbrenner and the Pipers into jumping leagues. The mounting debts and costs of that move proved {{too much for the}} then-young Steinbrenner, who folded the team just months later.|$|R
50|$|After the 1985 Championship season, the Bears {{remained}} competitive {{throughout the}} 1980s {{but failed to}} return to the Super Bowl under Ditka. Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of Lovie Smith, the Bears had two head <b>coaches,</b> <b>Dick</b> Jauron and Dave Wannstedt. While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.|$|R
