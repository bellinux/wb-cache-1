40|$|This thesis reports work {{carried out}} to {{investigate}} {{some aspects of the}} structure and magnetic properties of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) films. Such MTJ films are of great technological importance since they can be used as high density magnetic read heads and non-volatile magnetic memory devices. The basic MTJ comprises simply two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating layer. In MTJ devices, current flows perpendicular to the layers. If the coercivities of the ferromagnetic layers are different, the MTJ will possess a two-stage magnetization reversal characteristic. Fabrication of the MTJ films using magnetron sputter deposition as well as patterning of the MTJ films using <b>contact</b> <b>shadow</b> mask and photolithographic techniques are presented. High resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) have been used to study the microstructure and the magnetic domain structures of the MTJ films respectively. LTEM in-situ magnetizing experiments have also been performed to observe the magnetization process of the MTJ films in real time. Hysteresis loops for the MTJ films have been measured using alternating gradient force magnetometry (AGFM). Four different Al-oxide layer preparation methods are presented and discussed. Observations of the microstructure, magnetic domain structure, and magnetization process of NiFe and Co thin films and NiFe/Al-oxide/Co junction films are reported. The two-stage magnetization reversal process and reversal mechanism of the NiFe/Al-oxide/Co junction system are particularly discussed. The effect of ferromagnetic bilayer (FMB) structure on the magnetization process of FMB/insulator/ferromagnet type junction film is reported; and for this study, two junction film structures, (NiFe/Co) /Al-oxide/NiFe and (Co/NiFe) /Al-oxide/NiFe, have been investigated. HREM results show that the FMBs possess different microstructures, therefore the magnetization reversal mechanisms of the FMBs as well as the magnetization process of the junction films are different. It has been reported that various seed layer materials can induce a strong texture on the adjacent layer. The effect of Ti seed layer on the microstructure and thus on the magnetization process of Co/NiFe/Al-oxide/NiFe junction films is reported and discussed. The LTEM results are consistent with the hysteresis loop measurement using AGFM on the junction films studied. Simmons formula, which can be used to explain the electric tunnel effect in junction films, is described. Experimental current-voltage characteristic data for patterned NiFe/Al-oxide/Co junctions are modelled using the Simmons formula to obtain the effective junction barrier heights and widths. HREM studies confirm the effective junction barrier widths obtained and hence the validity of the MATLAB program prepared for data fitting.

In this paper we present an image-based algorithm to render visually plausible anti-aliased soft shadows in real time. Our technique employs a new shadow pre-filtering method {{based on an}} extended exponential shadow map-ping theory. The algorithm achieves faithful <b>contact</b> <b>shadows</b> by adopting an optimal approximation to exponential shadow reconstruction function. Benefiting from a novel overflow free summed area table tile grid data structure, numerical stability is guaranteed and error filtering response is avoided. By integrating an adaptive anisotropic filtering method, the proposed algorithm can produce high quality smooth shadows both in large penumbra areas and in high frequency sharp transitions, meanwhile guarantee cheap memory consumption and high performance...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Multi-view ambient {{occlusion}} combines {{depth information}} from any available views {{to fill in}} missing occlusion. Screen-space ambient occlusion and obscurance (AO) techniques have become de-facto methods for ambient light attenuation and <b>contact</b> <b>shadows</b> in real-time rendering. Although extensive re-search has been conducted {{to improve the quality}} and performance of AO techniques, view-dependent artifacts remain a major issue. This paper introduces Multi-view Ambient Occlusion, a generic per-fragment view weighting scheme for evaluating screen-space occlusion or obscurance using multiple, arbitrary views, such as the readily available shadow maps. Additionally, it exploits the result-ing weights to perform adaptive sampling, based on the importance of each view to reduce the total number of samples, while maintain-ing the image quality. Multi-view Ambient Occlusion improves and stabilizes the screen-space AO estimation without overestimating the results and can be combined with a variety of existing screen-space AO techniques. We demonstrate the results of our sampling method with both open volume- and solid angle-based AO algo-rithms...|$|R

Measurements of bare solar cells at calibration laboratories demand a procedure which {{is free of}} any influence of lab-specific contacting schemes. For most large area cells with front side <b>contacts</b> <b>shadowing</b> of the active cell area by the contacting unit during current-voltage measurements cannot be avoided. We present an advanced multiple step measurement procedure as performed at the Fraunhofer ISE calibration laboratory which is suitable for many actual metallisation schemes. We explain the requirements for the measurement setup and discuss the influence of contacting resistances. Insights are transferred to current-voltage measurements of cells with an unequal collection of current per busbar. For those cells, we propose a new measurement technique with adjustable resistors to enable homogeneous operating conditions across the cell. We demonstrate the influence on fill factor measurements with circuit simulations and validate our method experimentally with a specially designed solar cell...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel image based {{algorithm}} to render visually plausible anti-aliased soft shadows in a robust and efﬁcient manner. To achieve both high visual quality and high performance, it employs an accurate shadow map ﬁltering method which guarantees smooth penumbrae and high quality anisotropic anti-aliasing of the sharp transitions. Unlike approaches based on pre-ﬁltering approximations, our approach does not suffer from light bleeding or losing <b>contact</b> <b>shadows.</b> Discretization artefacts are avoided by creating virtual shadow maps on the ﬂy according to a novel shadow map resolution prediction model. This model {{takes into account the}} screen space frequency of the penumbrae via a perceptual metric which has been directly established from an appropriate user study. Consequently, our algorithm always generates shadow maps with minimal resolutions enabling high performance while guarantying high quality. Thanks to this perceptual model, our algorithm can sometimes be faster at rendering soft shadows than hard shadows. It can render game-like scenes at very high frame rates, and extremely large and complex scenes such as CAD models at interactive rates. In addition, our algorithm is highly scalable, and the quality versus performance trade-off can be easily tweaked...|$|R
