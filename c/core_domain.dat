25|$|At the 5' and 3' {{ends of the}} RNA are the UTR, {{that are}} not {{translated}} into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES — Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a very long protein containing about 3,000 amino acids. The <b>core</b> <b>domain</b> of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES contains a four-way helical junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot. The conformation of this <b>core</b> <b>domain</b> constrains the open reading frame's orientation for positioning on the 40S ribosomal subunit. The large pre-protein is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into the 10 smaller proteins that allow viral replication within the host cell, or assemble into the mature viral particles. Structural proteins made by the hepatitis C virus include Core protein, E1 and E2; nonstructural proteins include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B.|$|E
25|$|The ABC domain {{consists}} of two domains, the catalytic <b>core</b> <b>domain</b> similar to RecA-like motor ATPases and a smaller, structurally diverse α-helical subdomain that is unique to ABC transporters. The larger domain typically {{consists of}} two β-sheets and six α helices, where the catalytic Walker A motif (GXXGXGKS/T where X is any amino acid) or P-loop and Walker B motif (ΦΦΦΦD, of which Φ is a hydrophobic residue) is situated. The helical domain consists {{of three or four}} helices and the ABC signature motif, also known as LSGGQ motif, linker peptide or C motif. The ABC domain also has a glutamine residue residing in a flexible loop called Q loop, lid or γ-phosphate switch, that connects the TMD and ABC. The Q loop is presumed {{to be involved in the}} interaction of the NBD and TMD, particularly in the coupling of nucleotide hydrolysis to the conformational changes of the TMD during substrate translocation. The H motif or switch region contains a highly conserved histidine residue that is also important in the interaction of the ABC domain with ATP. The name ATP-binding cassette is derived from the diagnostic arrangement of the folds or motifs of this class of proteins upon formation of the ATP sandwich and ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

50|$|Flexibility and {{plasticity}} allow proteins to bind to ligands, form oligomers, aggregate, {{and perform}} mechanical work. Large conformational changes in proteins {{play an important}} role in cellular signaling. Adenylate Kinase is a signal transducing protein; thus, the balance between conformations regulates protein activity. ADK has a locally unfolded state that becomes depopulated upon binding.A 2007 study by Whitford et al. shows the conformations of ADK when binding with ATP or AMP. The study shows that there are three relevant conformations or structures of ADK—CORE, Open, and Closed. In ADK, there are two small domains called the LID and NMP. ATP binds in the pocket formed by the LID and <b>CORE</b> <b>domains.</b> AMP binds in the pocket formed by the NMP and <b>CORE</b> <b>domains.</b> The Whitford study also reported findings that show that localized regions of a protein unfold during conformational transitions. This mechanism reduces the strain and enhances catalytic efficiency. Local unfolding is the result of competing strain energies in the protein.|$|R

IST 1 and its ESCRT-III binding partner, CHMP 1 B, both form higher-order helical structures in vitro, and IST 1 -CHMP 1 interactions are required for abscission. The IST 1 and CHMP 3 structures also reveal that equivalent downstream alpha 5 helices can fold back against the <b>core</b> <b>domains.</b> Mutations within the CHMP 3 core-alpha 5 interface stimulate the protein's in vitro assembly and HIV-inhibition activities, indicating that dissociation of the autoinhibitory alpha 5 helix from the core activates ESCRT-III proteins for assembly at membranes...|$|R

This study sought to develop a competency framework that described the <b>core</b> <b>domains</b> of specialist palliative care nursing. This article explores one key domain of specialist palliative care nursing practice - therapeutic relationships - that was identified as underpinning other domains of practice. A mixed method was used, involving a literature review, a survey including practice exemplars and an interview of specialist palliative care nurses. Seventy-four registered nurses working in designated specialist palliative care nursing roles from each Australian state and mainland territory were involved. The nurses represented metropolitan, regional, rural and remote communities, various inpatient facilities and community practice settings. Five <b>core</b> <b>domains</b> of specialist palliative care nursing practice were identified: complex supportive care, collaborative practice, leadership, improving practice and therapeutic relationships.
