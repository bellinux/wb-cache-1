40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel bit level stream cipher based symmetric key cryptographic technique. At first, sender and receiver agree upon a symmetric key. Then the symmetric key is formed using Greatest Common Divisor (G. C. D) of sum of even or odd bit positional weightth even or odd number and a symmetric key value {{is derived from}} the symmetric by the sender. The symmetric key value is XORed with the ASCII value of the plain text character to get the <b>cipher</b> text <b>character.</b> This is repeated for the entire plain text file. The symmetric key and the entire cipher text file is sent by the sender to the receiver. From the symmetric key, the receiver calculates the symmetric key value. The symmetric key value is XORed with the <b>cipher</b> text <b>character</b> to get back the plain text character. When this process is repeated for every <b>cipher</b> text <b>character,</b> then entire plain text file is formed by the decryption process. This technique has several advantages like formation of symmetric key dynamically, more emphasis on symmetric key value rather than the symmetric key, security and equal applicability for encryption and decryption {{of a large number of}} files of almost any type or extension...|$|R
40|$|The role of Cryptography in today‟s digital {{world is}} significant. It secures {{information}} mathematically by mangling message with key. The privacy of intended sender and receiver information is protected from eavesdropper. The {{objective of the}} paper is playfair cipher. The existing methods of playfair cipher are studied. The restrictions of earlier works a playfair cipher using 5 X 5 matrix, 7 X 4 matrix and 6 X 6 matrix are overcome in the proposed work. The proposed method plays a 16 X 16 matrix giving strength to playfair cipher. The proposed work is an enhancement to the existing algorithms that uses 16 X 16 matrix to pick <b>cipher</b> <b>characters.</b> It makes use of alphabets both lower and uppercase characters, number and special characters for constructing {{the contents of the}} matrix...|$|R

40|$|In today’s digital world {{cryptography}} is used {{to secure}} information {{in order to provide}} the privacy for the intended sender and receiver by managing the message with the public key. The objective of this work is to securing the key of Playfair cipher using RSA algorithm. It is a two stage application, in first stage the existing methods of Playfair cipher modified by increasing in the size of matrix, so that the restrictions of earlier works of PF cipher using 5 × 5 matrix were overcome in the proposed work. The proposed method use a 12 × 8 matrix which contain all alphabetic, numeric and special character use in keyboard as input. This work is an enhancement to the existing algorithms that uses 5 × 5 matrix to pick <b>cipher</b> <b>characters.</b> It makes use of alphabets both lower and upper case characters, number and special characters for constructing the contents of the matrix. In the second stage, RSA public key encryption technique is used for sending the key of the PF ciphers securely. Finally, the security strength of the whole system has been analyzed and tried to fulfil the requirement of security...|$|R
50|$|Classical ciphers are {{typically}} vulnerable to known-plaintext attack. For example, a Caesar cipher {{can be solved}} using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely. A general monoalphabetic substitution <b>cipher</b> needs several <b>character</b> pairs and some guessing if there are fewer than 26 distinct pairs.|$|R

This paper solves this problem by proposing two different encryption techniques. The first proposed technique focus on compression of data by half and the second technique justify Shallon's idea of diffusion by generating different <b>cipher</b> text <b>character</b> for single plaintext character for its different occurrences in the plaintext. The combinatorial effect of using existing symmetric algorithms along with the two proposed algorithms produces a Hybrid Encryption scheme that makes it difficult for adversary to learn any information from the message transmitted over an unsecure transmission medium...|$|R

An [...] "in-game screenshot" [...] of the steel mill level, as well as some concept art, textures and logos from the game have also been posted to Picasa by the lead environment artist, who has since clarified that it is a demo level.

5000|$|When {{encoding}} {{a message}} using a <b>cipher</b> disk, a <b>character</b> is {{always used to}} mean “end of word.” The frequency of said character is abnormally high and thus easily detected. [...] If this character, however, is omitted, then the words run together and it takes much longer for the recipient to read the message. To remedy this, some cipher disks now have multiple characters that stand for [...] "end of word." [...] Similarly a cipher disk may also have multiple characters {{that could be used}} for the letter [...] "e" [...] (the most common letter in English) so that instead of having a character with a frequency of roughly 13%, there would be two characters that stood for [...] "e" [...] - each with a frequency of 6% or so.|$|R
40|$|Network Security {{has become}} very {{important}} in today’s world, {{as a result of}} which various methods are adopted to bypass it. Network administrators need {{to keep up with the}} recent advancements in both the hardware and software fields to prevent their as well as the user’s data. The paper briefly introduces the concept of data security i. e. a manually generated shift key based cryptographic technique which (de) ciphers the fragmented plain text. Here both encryption and decryption methodologies are proposed. The paperwork outlines a cryptographic algorithm based on a user defined shift key modus operandi engendering ciphers at bay. First, it creates an IDT (Induced Dynamic Table) to refer the position of the plain text characters. Then the next cipher is fabricated by setting the ART (Axis Rotation Table) according to the shift key. Subsequently, the further cipher is induced by a FFC (Four Face Cube). Later, the new partial <b>cipher</b> text <b>characters</b> are put into a definite sequence to get the standard color palette in RGB format. Hence, our final cipher with the shift key characters at the additional first and last color respectively in RGB format is generated. During decryption methodology, the color is selected and is opened in the standard color palette. The RGB values of the special characters has their own signature to what makes them different from the other plain characters in the time of decryption. The proposed methodology ensures significant use in both, data transfer and network security...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of film, urban space has often served {{not only as a}} setting, but also as an {{independent}} character or even a protagonist. In his book Faire le noir, Alain Fleischer observed that the term "celebrity" could be applied to cities as well as to actors. Cracow is by far one of the most recognised cities in the Polish cinema. Although in the recent years it has been reduced to the role of ornamental background in Polish TV series (Majka, Julia) and romantic comedy films (Don't Lie to Me, Darling by Piotr Wereśniak), it still remains a source of inspiration for the directors of newly created films (Women Without Shame by Witold Orzechowski). Having analysed a selection of Polish films, Łucja Demby concludes that the images of Cracow oscillate between the world of myth on the one hand, and stereotype or kitsch - on the other. In both cases, however, urban space plays a vital part in the film, sometimes hiding encrypted answers to the questions raised by the <b>characters</b> (<b>Ciphers</b> by Wojciech Jerzy Has) ...|$|R
