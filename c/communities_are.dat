5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> considered to be food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented {{by the fall of}} larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E

5|$|Some Ediacaran strata {{with the}} texture {{characteristics}} of microbial mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils {{are almost always}} found in beds that contain these microbial mats. Although microbial mats were once widespread, the evolution of grazing organisms in the Cambrian vastly reduced their numbers.
