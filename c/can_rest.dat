5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Blue Dragon uses turn-based gameplay elements seen {{in older}} Japanese role-playing video games. The game world contains two major types of areas: towns, {{in which the}} player <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> and purchase items, and dungeon-like areas, with numerous foes to be defeated.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E

5|$|Then, the High Line passes {{under the}} Chelsea Market, a food hall, at 15th Street. A spur {{connecting}} the viaduct to the National Biscuit Company building splits off at 16th Street; this spur is {{closed to the}} public. The Tenth Avenue Square, an amphitheater located on the viaduct, is at 17th Street, where the High Line crosses over Tenth Avenue from southeast to northwest. At 23rd Street, there is the 23rd Street Lawn, a lawn where visitors <b>can</b> <b>rest.</b> Then, between 25th and 26th Streets, a ramp takes visitors above the viaduct, with a scenic overlook facing east at 26th Street. The Philip Falcone and Lisa Maria Falcone flyover, as it is called, is named after two major donors to the park; this ramp was based on plans for a Phase 1 flyover that was never built.|$|E
25|$|Demersal {{fish can}} be divided into two main types: {{strictly}} benthic fish which <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> on the sea floor, and benthopelagic fish which can float in the water column just above the sea floor.|$|E

25|$|Benthic fish, {{sometimes}} called groundfish, are denser than water, so they <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> {{on the sea}} floor. They either lie-and-wait as ambush predators, maybe covering themselves with sand or otherwise camouflaging themselves, or move actively over the bottom in search for food. Benthic fish which can bury themselves include dragonets, flatfish and stingrays.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though it}} has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large {{mountain}} huts where a climber <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba.|$|E

25|$|A dome (from Latin: domus) is an {{architectural}} element that resembles the hollow {{upper half of}} a sphere. The precise definition has {{been a matter of}} controversy. There are also a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. A dome <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> upon a rotunda or drum, and can be supported by columns or piers that transition to the dome through squinches or pendentives. A lantern may cover an oculus and may itself have another dome.|$|E
25|$|Turtles <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> {{or sleep}} {{underwater}} {{for several hours}} at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear. During the night while sleeping and {{to protect themselves from}} potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.|$|E

The interior posts support the roof beam of a clan house {{and include a}} large notch at the top, where the beam <b>can</b> <b>rest.</b> A clan house may have two to four or more house posts, depending on the native group who built it. Carvings on these poles, {{like those of the}} house frontal poles, are often used as a storytelling device for children and help {{tell the story of the}} owners' family history.|$|E

The bomb was targeting Julian Jerome (William deVry), Sonny's rival, but Jason finds out Sonny was not responsible. Jason works with Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) to investigate so that Sam <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> during her pregnancy. Julian, Sam's father, tries to scare Jason off, but he refuses, though he asks Sam and Danny to go to a safe house. Sam refuses because she {{does not want to be}} separated from Jason.|$|E
25|$|After a while, Dunnigan convinces Cosick {{everyone}} {{will leave the}} hotel room so that he <b>can</b> <b>rest.</b> As Cosick steps in, a crazy evangelist sneaks {{into the room and}} Cosick goes back to the ledge. This damages his trust in Dunnigan, as does an effort by police to drop down from the roof and grab him. As night falls, Virginia (Barbara Bel Geddes) is brought to the room, and she pleads with Robert to come off the ledge, to no avail. All the while, the police, under the command of Moksar, are working to grab Robert and put a net below him.|$|E
25|$|Oojam (originally {{localized}} as Orin), he was {{a student}} of Maya and Meena's father that went into hiding after Balzack had killed his teacher. The girls seek him out during Chapter 4 to assist them in their quest for revenge. Oojam provides a powerful physical attack each turn, in addition to being able to pick locks. At the end of Chapter 4, Oojam appears to be mortally wounded fending off the guards of Palais de Léon (originally localized as Castle Keeleon) to allow Meena and Maya to escape, but it is revealed in Chapter 5 that a young woman who was fleeing the castle found him near-dead and managed to get him safely to the town of Vrenor so he <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> and recover.|$|E

25|$|A further {{possible}} {{improvement is}} the use of a second pit which is used in alternation with the first pit. It means that the first pit <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> for the duration of time it takes to fill up the second pit. When the second pit is also full, then the first pit is emptied. The fecal sludge collected in that first pit has in the meantime undergone some degree of pathogen reduction although this is unlikely to be complete. This is a common design for so-called twin-pit pour flush toilets and increases the safety for those having to enter the pit. Also VIPs are sometimes built with two pits, although for VIP toilets one problem can be that the users may not stick to this alternation method and fill up both pits at the same time.|$|E
25|$|New special {{abilities}} for {{characters are}} gained by performing side-quests for creatures called Normins scattered through the land. Equipment assigned to characters {{can be given}} special skills, with one piece of equipment having four skill slots. Certain combinations add additional effects produced by equipment. Some equipment types can only be obtained by fusing two different accessories. A local four-player multiplayer option is also available. Items such as outfits, weapons and armor and items can be bought and sold at shops across the land. Using a certain shop enough levels it up, unlocking higher-end items. During exploration, players visit various regions {{under the control of}} Lords of the Land, which require the protection of the Seraphim. Ensuring this protection gives the player access via the Lords of the Land to abilities such as warping between save points for a fee. Other abilities including various abilities and bonuses unlocked by completing certain objectives in battle and establish further Normin. The player can increase these boons by leveling up the strength of the protection through battles in the area.
