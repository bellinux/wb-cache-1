40|$|International audienceThrough an {{extensive}} and systematic experimental investigation of two geometries of flexible plates in air, it is {{shown that a}} properly defined scaled <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number</b> allows collapsing all drag measurements of the reconfiguration number. In the asymptotic regime of large deformation, it is shown that the Vogel exponents that scale the drag with the flow velocity for different geometries of plates can be predicted with a simple dimensional analysis reasoning. These predicted Vogel exponents are in agreement with previously published models of reconfiguration. The mechanisms responsible for reconfiguration, namely area reduction and streamlining, are studied {{with the help of}} a simple model for flexible plates based on an empirical drag formulation. The model predicts well the reconfiguration observed in the experiments and shows that for a rectangular plate, the effect of streamlining is prominent at the onset of reconfiguration, but area reduction dominates in the regime of large deformation. Additionally, the model demonstrates for both geometries of plates that the reconfiguration cannot be described by a single value of the Vogel exponent. The Vogel exponent asymptotically approaches constant values for small and for very large scaled Cauchy numbers, but in between both extremes it varies significantly over a large range of scaled <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number.</b> Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2010...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} drag reduction {{due to the}} flow-induced reconfiguration of {{a flexible}} thin plate in presence of skin friction drag at low Reynolds Number. The plate is subjected to a uniform free stream and is tethered at one end. We extend existing models in the literature {{to account for the}} skin friction drag. The total drag on the plate with respect to a rigid upright plate decreases due to flow-induced reconfiguration and further reconfiguration increases the total drag due to increase in skin friction drag. A critical value of <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number</b> (Ca) exists at which the total drag on the plate with respect to a rigid upright plate is minimum at a given Reynolds number. The reconfigured shape of the plate for this condition is unique, beyond which the total drag increases on the plate even with reconfiguration. The ratio of the form drag coefficient for an upright rigid plate and skin drag coefficient for a horizontal rigid plate (λ) determines the critical <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number</b> (Ca_cr). We propose modification in the drag scaling with free stream velocity (F_x ∝ U^n) in presence of the skin friction drag. The following expressions of n are found for 0. 01 ≤ Re ≤ 1, n = 4 / 5 + λ/ 5 for 1 ≤ Ca < Ca_cr and n = 1 + λ/ 5 for Ca_cr≤ Ca ≤ 300, where Re is Reynolds number. We briefly discuss the combined effect of the skin friction drag and buoyancy on the drag reduction. An assessment of the feasibility of experiments is presented in order to translate the present model to physical systems...|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} {{model to}} describe the drag and reconfiguration of flexible riparian vegetation is proposed.

After being derived from dimensional consideration, the model is applied to two experimental data sets. The first contains high-resolution drag force and physical property measurements for twenty-one foliated and defoliated full-scale trees, including specimens of Alnus glutinosa, Populus nigra and Salix alba. The second data set is independent and of a different scale, consisting of drag force and physical property measurements for natural and artificial branches of willow and poplar, under partially and fully submerged flow conditions. Good agreement between the measured and predicted drag forces is observed for both data sets, especially when compared to a more typical ‘rigid’ approximation, where the effects of reconfiguration are neglected...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 2 nd November 2018. Flow-vegetation {{interactions}} is an interdisciplinary research area with {{applications in the}} management of coastal waters, lakes, and watercourses. Due to an emerging interest in the cultivation of seaweeds, this study seeks to develop a sound understanding of the physical interactions between flow and seaweeds. This is achieved via experiments in a laboratory flume using plastic-made models of blades of the seaweed species Saccharina latissima. In the experiments, strain gages, a digital camera, and Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters were used for measuring drag forces, blade movements (reconfiguration), and flow velocities. The study involved experiments with single blades and with pairs of tandem blades at different spacing between the blades. The revealed mechanisms controlling the dynamics of seaweed blade models varied depending on the ratio of blade length to eddy length scale. The drag coefficient of seaweed blade models appeared to be dependent on the Reynolds number, the <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number,</b> and the ratio of blade length to integral turbulence length scale. Turbulence had a primary role in controlling blade model dynamics and its drag coefficient. Seaweed blade models affected the flow in their wakes by increasing the turbulence intensity and reducing the mean longitudinal velocity. These effects on the flow are the reason for which, in a pair of tandem blades, the drag force experienced by the downstream blade is lower than that experienced by the upstream blade...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and numerical study {{that describes the}} motion of flexible blades, scaled to be dynamically similar to natural aquatic vegetation, forced by wave-induced oscillatory flows. For the conditions tested, blade motion is governed primarily by two dimensionless variables: (i) the <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number,</b> Ca, which represents {{the ratio of the}} hydrodynamic forcing to the restoring force due to blade stiffness, and (ii) the ratio of the blade length to the wave orbital excursion, L. For flexible blades with Ca ≫ 1, the relationship between drag and velocity can be described by two different scaling laws at the large- and small-excursion limits. For large excursions (L ≪ 1), the flow resembles a unidirectional current and the scaling laws developed for steady-flow reconfiguration studies hold. For small excursions (L ≫ 1), the beam equations may be linearized and a different scaling law for drag applies. The experimental force measurements suggest that the small-excursion scaling applies even for intermediate cases with L ∼ O(1). The numerical model employs the well-known Morison force formulation, and adequately reproduces the observed blade dynamics and measured hydrodynamic forces without the use of any fitted parameters. For Ca ≫ 1, the movement of the flexible blades reduces the measured and modeled hydrodynamic drag relative to a rigid blade of the same morphology. However, in some cases with Ca ∼ O(1), the measured hydrodynamic forces generated by the flexible blades exceed those generated by rigid blades, but this is not reproduced in the model. Observations of blade motion suggest that this unusual behavior is related to an unsteady vortex shedding event, which the simple numerical model cannot reproduce. Finally, we also discuss implications for the modeling of wave energy dissipation over canopies of natural aquatic vegetation...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, two {{practical}} {{models for}} predicting the drag force exerted on flexible riparian vegetation under hydrodynamic loading have been developed. The models were formulated {{based on the}} results of a unique experimental data set that consisted of high resolution force-velocity and physical property measurements for twenty-one full-scale riparian trees, in both foliated and defoliated conditions. One of the models has then been used to numerically simulate the impact of riparian woodland on the flooding characteristics of a mid-catchment river site. Analysis of photographs and video footage of the trees from the experimental study during drag force testing allowed the frontal projected area to be determined, both in still air and as a function of flow velocity. The observed reductions in projected area and drag coeffcient with velocity were normalized using the projected area in still air to provide an empirical relationship between the ‘rigid’ drag coeffcient and area Reynolds number. The resulting drag force predictions were found to be accurate when properly calibrated against the vegetation under consideration. A second, more physically based model to predict the reconfiguration of flexible vegetation has been developed based on dimensional analysis of the relevant parameters, including flexural rigidity. The model utilizes a novel vegetative <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number</b> to determine the extent of the reconfiguration and has been shown to be more accurate than two existing drag force models. The model has also been validated against independent drag force data, demonstrating that it is applicable to vegetation of differing scale, morphology and flexibility. Serial and parallel optimizations of an existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling code have enabled detailed numerical simulations of extreme flood events to be undertaken for a mid-catchment river site in Somerset, UK. The results indicated that riparian vegetation has a minimal impact on the downstream flooding characteristics, at least for the small site investigated herein. Significant reductions in key flow properties, namely velocity and bed shear stress, were however observed within the vegetated areas...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic {{vegetation}} attenuates local currents, dampens {{wave energy}} and promotes sedimentation. Its function as shoreline defence has gained {{strong interest in}} the recent years, since it may offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions to coastal protection problems. Predictions of wave dissipation by macrophytes require understanding of the hydrodynamics, plant motion and the coupling between the two. The Dynveg model focuses on {{the interaction between the}} organisms and the surrounding fluid at the stem-scale. It describes the motion of a blade based on the balance between the parameterized flow-induced loads and the restoring action of the stiffness and the buoyancy of the plant. The present thesis validated its performance for the small deformation regime under oscillatory flows using experimental data. After the validation, the model was used in a one-way coupling by introducing prescribed velocity profiles under varying wave conditions and changing plant properties. The asymmetric plant motion observed in the field by a number of authors was not obtained when depth-uniform oscillatory flows were used as an input. It appeared when linear wave theory was used, before including non-linear effects or the eulerian flow. The results suggest that the driving mechanism of asymmetry in plant posture is the orbital motion, although higher harmonics or the streaming in a canopy may enhance it even further. This may have important implications on the methods use to study plant motions under waves, particularly about the use of U-tubes or depth-averaged models. Neglecting the variations of the velocity along the horizontal coordinate for the tested conditions did not introduce significant errors and in the results, although the differences may be larger for very flexible plants or very energetic waves. Stems with different rigidities were modelled under the same wave condition. Stiffer plants dissipated more energy. Nevertheless, it was found plants with appreciable tip excursions, of about the 20 % of its height, could produce the same amount of work than a completely still plant. Longer plants reduced their relative motion with respect to the flow for a longer fraction of the wave period compared to shorter stems, which remained pronated and still over a longer part of the wave cycle and consequently produced more work. The curves of the dimensionless wave-averaged work {{as a function of the}} <b>Cauchy</b> <b>number</b> for different plant heights showed a good collapse, which may open the possibility of developing more simplified frameworks to account for wave attenuation in large-scale coastal models.
