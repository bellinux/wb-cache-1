5000|$|Estádio José Alvalade is a {{football}} stadium in Lisbon, Portugal, home of Sporting Clube de Portugal, {{one of the}} [...] "Big Three" [...] clubs in Portugal. Having replaced the former Estádio José Alvalade (1956), it {{is the center of}} a complex called Alvalade XXI (which includes a mall called Alvaláxia with a 12-screen movie theater, a health club, the club's museum, a sports pavilion, a clinic, and an office building), designed by Portuguese architect Tomás Taveira. It was classified by UEFA as a 5-star stadium, enabling it to host finals of major UEFA events. The stadium - originally projected to hold only 40,000 spectators at any given time - has a capacity of 50,095 and was acoustically engineered as a venue for major concerts. The stadium has also a total of 1,315 underground parking spaces, including 30 for disabled spectators. Its official opening was on 6 August 2003 when Sporting played and beat Manchester United 3-1. It also hosted the 2005 UEFA Cup Final between Sporting and CSKA Moscow, which CSKA Moscow won 3-1. On the exterior, the stadium features multi-coloured tiles. Seats are also arranged in a random-looking <b>colour</b> <b>mix.</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates how the {{decision}} variables {{of the production}} planning process for a network of firms in the textile-apparel industry, i. e. planning period length, material availability, the link between production orders and customer orders as regards <b>colour</b> <b>mix,</b> can affect the system's time performance, whose measurement has involved the creation of two new indicators. To adhere to reality, we studied and collected actual data {{from one of the}} most important Italian companies, the Benetton Group SpA and using these observations as a basis, a simulation model was built. Only the production planning period compression has been recognized as yielding a significant improvement in the external time performance. A relation between the external time performance and the internal time performance of the network is recognized. The cash flows associated with different lengths of the production planning period are analyzed...|$|E
40|$|In my thesis, I {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} understanding <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> through a so-called Land art at 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd graders. <b>Colour</b> <b>mixing</b> is usually based and on prepared industrial tube colours bought at usual shops. However, nature is an immense source of dyes and colours that offer <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> in the art. In the past the artists prepared pigments from natural substances by themselves. Nowadays various artists in landscape art exploit the potential of natural materials in <b>mixing</b> <b>colours.</b> I have explored this issue through the theoretical and empirical research approach. In the theoretical part, I have analysed the problem of <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> {{in conjunction with the}} appearance of colours in nature (natural pigments, various colour phenomena in nature, the natural materials of different colours, etc.) considering descriptive methods and field literature to establish the advantage of <b>mixing</b> <b>colours</b> in the visual arts. I take into account the analysis of the various contemporary artists who exploit the colours of nature in its landscape art. In the empirical part, I investigated the ability of pupils’ understanding the <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> through the Landscape Art in action survey in three steps. The first step was to present the <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> on an established way of industrial tube paints to students. In a second step, I included the teacher of chemistry; we conducted a cross-curricular link, on the subject of <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> and extraction of natural dyes by extraction. In the third step, students <b>mixed</b> <b>colours</b> using substances found in nature near their school, and this leads to certain characteristics of landscape art. Students created a variety of natural materials available in near school location (the school, where I conducted research is located in the countryside). The study will contribute to art didactics innovative methods of teaching <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> in conjunction with the nature and landscape art. Emphasis was on an open and creative functioning of students {{in a wide range of}} materials and ideas. This will help the students to strengthen environmental awareness and awareness of coexistence with nature...|$|R
40|$|Two quasi-aplanatic free-form solid V-groove collimators are {{presented}} in this work. Both optical designs are originally designed using the Simultaneous Multiple Surface method in three dimensions (SMS 3 D). The second optically active surface in both free-form V-groove devices is designed a posteriori as a grooved surface. First two mirror (XX) design is designed in order to clearly show the design procedure and working principle of these devices. Second, RXI free-form design is comparable with existing RXI collimators; it is a compact and highly efficient design made of polycarbonate (PC) performing very good <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> of the RGGB LED sources placed off-axis. There have been presented rotationally symmetric non-aplanatic high efficiency collimators with <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> property to be improved and rotationally symmetric aplanatic devices with good <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> property and efficiency to be improved.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{application}} of artist driven <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> and multi-layering of pigments using inkjet printing. A standardised colour managment workflow is essential for predicable and repeatable colour for inkjet printing. With the correct implementation of a print methodology, input colour values are rendered through the print driver {{in order to determine}} the combinations of ink channels from which the colours will be constructed. Through this automation, the user surrenders control in the <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> process. From an artists' perspective this is counter-intuitive to artistic <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> methods, this research considers possibilities for colour printing by approaching the inkjet printing process from a from a more traditional <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> methodology. This research investigates the implementation of multi-layering for inkjet printing by reflecting on photomechanical art historical processes from the 19 th Century and {{the application of}} layering of pigments as demonstrated in old master paintings. By mixing inks in ways that are considered to be non-conventional for inkjet printers, but instead by implementing a layering process similar to traditional printing and painting processes, we aim to improve colour output when printing inkjet reproductions of original artworks...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{preliminary}} investigation towards the design of effective colour spaces and colour tools to allow users to quickly and accurately select a given colour in a digital-display environment. It {{has been shown that}} many non-expert users find the RGB colour space to be non-intuitive. The choice of colour space on various visual tasks has also been shown to be an important factor and that experts show greater precision in colour-matching experiments than non-expert observers. We propose that non-experts find manipulation and selection in an RGB colour space to be difficult because they do not possess an appropriate internal model for additive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing.</b> On the other hand, observers from a young age may develop a useful internal model of subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> processes as they experiment with inks and paints. The purpose of this work is to determine whether it is indeed the case that observers possess more useful internal models for subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> than for additive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing.</b> The work reported in this study describes only an assessment of subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing.</b> Three experiments are described whereby expert and naïve observers select matches from a library of colours for individual samples or for imagined subtractive mixtures of paint samples. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are presented to measure the ability of observers to make predictions of subtractive mixing processes. When mixing the subtractive primaries (e. g. cyan with magenta) the performance of expert and naïve observers are the same but in general the expert performance far exceeds that of the naïve observer for other colours...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will describe}} artists, practitioners and scientists, who {{were interested in}} developing a deeper psychological, emotional and practical understanding of the human visual system who were working with wavelength, paint and other materials. From a selection of prints at The Prints and Drawings Department at Tate London, the presentation will refer to artists who were motivated by issues relating to how <b>colour</b> pigment was <b>mixed</b> and printed, to interrogate and explain colour perception and colour science, and in art, how artists have used colour to challenge the viewer and how a viewer might describe their experience of colour. The title Colour in Flux refers, not only to the perceptual effect of the juxtaposition of one colour pigment with another, but also to the changes and challenges for the print industry. In the light of screenprinted examples from the 60 s and 70 s, the presentation will discuss 21 st century ideas on colour and how these notions have informed the Centre for Fine Print Research's (CFPR) practical research in colour printing. The latter part of this presentation will discuss the implications for the need to change methods in mixing inks that moves away from existing colour spaces, from non intuitive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> to bespoke ink sets, <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> approaches and <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> methods that are not reliant on RGB or CMYK...|$|R

The Weddell Colour Discrimination Test was developed for use in this study which was a test that involved <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> with paint. The study used quasi-experimental designs for both a pilot study and a main study. Results indicated a significant difference in the ability to mix paint advantage of groups that used cyan, magenta and yellow. Implications for the use of particular colour triads in art classrooms and methods of teaching colour theory have emerged from this study. The Weddell Colour Discrimination test instrument developed in this study could be useful as both a diagnostic tool and a teaching tool as well as a data gathering method for further research...|$|R

The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of colour can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> and <b>colour</b> schemes to better appreciate colour and its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of colour is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of colour used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion). Insight is also given into colour psychology in relation to creating colour-ways, colour ranges and colour themes and to colour forecasting. Colour terminology is given and discussed throughout the chapter and the following fundamental theories and colour characteristics are also discussed: •	The principles of additive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> and subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> •	The six-hue colour wheel and the twelve-hue colour wheel •	Colour schemes and colour combinations •	Metamerism •	Colour deficiency (colour blindness) •	Colour measuremen...|$|R
