50|$|Before 1974, Lapathos was {{inhabited}} both by Greek <b>Cypriots</b> and Turkish <b>Cypriots.</b> In 1973, {{the population}} of Lapathos was an estimated 661: 435 Greek and 228 Turkish <b>Cypriots.</b> All Greek <b>Cypriots</b> were displaced the following year.

50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Y chromosomes (inherited from father to son) revealed that Turkish and Greek <b>Cypriots</b> {{have a high}} genetic affinity and share primarily a common pre-Ottoman paternal ancestry. Both Turkish and Greek <b>Cypriots</b> have a minor genetic relation with surrounding populations, mainly with Calabrians (southern Italy), Albanians (particularly for Greek <b>Cypriots),</b> Lebanese and Libyans (only for Turkish <b>Cypriots).</b> The genetic affinity between Calabrians and <b>Cypriots</b> could {{be a result of}} a common ancient Greek (Achaean) genetic contribution to both populations.|$|R
50|$|The {{island of}} Cyprus became an {{independent}} state in 1960, with power shared between Greek <b>Cypriots</b> and Turkish <b>Cypriots</b> under the London-Zürich Agreements. But in December 1963, in events that became known as Bloody Christmas, Turkish <b>Cypriots</b> were ousted from the republic and Greek <b>Cypriots</b> began a military campaign against them, leading to 11 years of ethnic clashes. Turkish <b>Cypriots</b> bore the heavier cost in terms of casualties, and some 25,000—about {{a fifth of the}} population of Turkish Cypriots—were internally displaced. They lived as refugees for at least ten years, until the 1974 Turkish invasion. By the late 1960s, approximately 60,000 Turkish <b>Cypriots</b> had left their homes and moved into enclaves. This resulted in an exodus of Turkish <b>Cypriots,</b> with the majority migrating to the United Kingdom and others to Turkey, North America, and Australia.|$|R
5|$|The repute of the {{sanctuary}} was far reaching. <b>Cypriot</b> pilgrims from Paphos left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in Greek and <b>Cypriot</b> syllabary at Astarte's shrine; this stele {{is now in the}} custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a decade}} of <b>Cypriot</b> intercommunal {{violence}} and the coup in Cyprus on 15 July 1974 staged by the EOKA B paramilitary organisation, which overthrew President Makarios and installed the pro-Enosis (union with Greece) Nikos Sampson as dictator, Turkey invaded Cyprus on 20 July 1974 by unilaterally exercising Article IV in the Treaty of Guarantee (1960), but without restoring the status quo ante {{at the end of}} the military operation. In 1983 the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by Turkey, was established. As of 2017, negotiations for solving the Cyprus dispute are still ongoing between Turkish <b>Cypriot</b> and Greek <b>Cypriot</b> political leaders.|$|E
