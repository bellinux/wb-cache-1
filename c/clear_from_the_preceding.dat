30|$|It is <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> {{sections}} that a considerable volume of large-scale non-standard structural fire testing has been performed in recent decades. A range of custom made structural fire engineering testing facilities have been commissioned or are currently under construction, and the SFE community {{appears to be}} actively engaging with the identified gaps in knowledge. Given the considerable research effort which has been undertaken thus far, it is worthwhile to ask where future research in structural fire engineering should be directed, {{particularly in light of}} the novel testing facilities which are soon to be available.|$|E
30|$|Given the {{apparent}} {{gap in the}} literature related to middle leadership in the early childhood sector, this study focused on developing empirically based insights into the practices of a specified group of middle leaders in a particular context. As will be <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> theoretical discussion of practice, middle leading is understood as site-based, and so here the data collection is localised, and the findings will provide a touchstone for others involved in leading in preschools to reflect on their policies and practices. The findings were generated through analysis that was both emerging (i.e. themes that were identified through an open reading of the data) and related to the key foci (i.e. from the theoretical frame and the questions), and this allowed for new insights, and also added specific understanding related to the identified ‘gap’.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{generative}} grammar {{shows that the}} most advanced concepts and theories are only gradually assimilated into Universal Grammar, and the more recent concept of "Chain-composition" is no exception. The previous notion of chain formation algorithm is related to and derived from the Trace theory within the Government-Binding framework and the earlier concept of derivational history of transformations. The Trace theory was an inevitable deduction from the theory for permissible antecedent-anaphor linkings, which was again {{a radical departure from}} a largely derivational paradigm. It has now become <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> researches that the finite Grid-representations of the developing structural system provide each other with a mutual environment and produce reciprocal effects {{as a result of their}} competitive (complementary) and their cooperative interactions. Nothing in the subcomponents of principles in the GB theory is completely autonomous: every part of the conditions, however independent and fundamental it may seem in its isolated form, is dependent on its mutual relations with other parts of the organized system. It is obvious that development of the syntactic structures under the Bounding principles generate new qualities that are more than the sum of the isolated parts under the Binding Theory in the modular view of grammar; thus the complementarity approach through the interactions and interdependence among the subcomponents of the rule system and the subsystems of principles allow us to see and grasp hidden conditions of the Gap-phenomena emerging during development of the syntactic structures at different levels of representation. The present purpose of this paper is to reexamine and capture the essential properties of EC (empty categories) partitioning within Trace and Control theories, which will display certain crucial aspects of EC/Gap functional status modulations through some parametrized interactions between two or more types of movement (Move-α) that result in qualitative changes in Gaps which cannot occur in the isolated ordinary NP-to-NP and COMP-to-COMP movement components, even if we are aware of the more recent move to abandon the functional characterization of empty categories. The mam reason for the present thesis is that we should still refrain from adopting the essence of the approach such that S-structure, Initial stage of derivation, is the 'base-generated' part of grammar, thus leading to the total elimination of D-structure and Move-α. The persistence seems important of the hypotheses regarding control of structural development by "linking" directly transmitted through internodular Grid-junctions or by an intervening element that lineally diffuses across the internodular cleft, within the Grid-representations of Move-α mapping...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients {{with chronic}} stable angina {{often have a}} state of {{sympathetic}} hyperactivity. It is considered associated with myocardial ischemia and disappears after ischemia elimination. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the changes in heart rate variability parameters, a noninvasive technique for the evaluation of the autonomic nervous system activity, after successful revascularization in these patients to evaluate this theory. Methods: The patients were enrolled among those who underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Short- term heart rate variability analyses of all the patients were obtained, and time-domain indices (standard deviation of normal- to-normal intervals [SDNN], standard deviation of differences of successive R-R intervals [SDSD], root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals [rMSSD], percentage of R-R intervals differing > 10 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 10 percentage of R-R intervals differing > 20 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 20], percentage of R-R intervals differing > 30 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 30] percentage of R-R intervals differing > 40 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 40], percentage of R-R intervals differing > 50 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 50 percentage of R-R intervals differing > 60 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 60 percentage of R-R intervals differing > 70 ms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> one [PNN 70]) were analyzed. All the measurements were made before and after percutaneous coronary intervention. Results: This study included 64 patients, comprising 27 men and 37 women at a mean age of 56. 8 ± 9. 1 years. There was a significant difference only between pre- and post-revascularization SDNN (27. 5 ± 19. 72 vs. 41 ± 41. 4; p value = 0. 013). The other parameters showed no significant differences after successful coronary intervention. Conclusion: Our data indicate that the increase in SDNN in patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention seems to be prominent. </p...|$|R
