40|$|Studying a model where {{trade unions}} {{interact}} with endogenously formed partisan political parties, we explain changing political preferences {{for and against}} the unionised labour market regime. We focus on the changes in coalition formation between unskilled and moderately skilled workers, which in turn depend on inequality among workers. When inequality is either very low or very high, moderately skilled workers form a political coalition with unskilled workers to support a unionised labour market regime. In other cases, the economic interest of the moderately skilled workers is {{more in line with}} that of highly skilled workers and capital owners to support a competitive labour market regime. Different societies have different labour market regimes or wage determination mechanisms. Some, such as the US, have relatively unregulated labour markets, while others, such as the Northern European countries, have strong trade unions, where wages are set by a <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>procedure</b> mediated through the unions. As Table 1 shows, union density in 1990 ranged over almost the entire spectrum, from 93. 7 % in Sweden to 9. 3 % in France.

40|$|In {{its recent}} {{decision}} in B. C, Health Services, the Supreme Court of Canada took the monumental step of overruling its own precedents in the Labour Trilogy, by holding that the Charter guarantee {{of freedom of}} association does in fact protect a union 2 ̆ 7 s right to engage in collective bargaining. The author argues that, while the decision marks a new era for labour relations in Canada, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s methodology may have regressive consequences more generally for the interpretation of associational freedom under s. 2 (d) of the Charter. She focuses on three aspects of this methodology. First, in constitutionalizing the right of access to a <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>procedure</b> free from 2 ̆ 2 substantial 2 ̆ 2 government interference (but not the outcomes of that procedure), the decision creates a model of due process which could downgrade the entitlement in s. 2 (d) from a substantive to a procedural one. Second, while {{the imposition of a}} duty on employers to bargain in good faith may appear progressive, recent case law shows that positive rights and obligations can, ironically, be applied restrictively to narrow the scope of fundamental Charter freedoms. Third, by rejecting an abstract view of associational freedom, and favouring instead an approach that is heavily context-dependent, the Court interpreted s. 2 (d) in a way which may have little relevance outside the labour relations setting, and which might be used to deny other types of claims. The author points out, however, that in B. C. Health Services the Court did not attempt to develop a new theory of entitlement for the guarantee. For this reason, she urges that the decision be read as one that is limited to the status of collective bargaining under the Charter, and that the Court has left to another day the task of redefining the conceptual foundation of s. 2 (d). The paper closes by outlining several issues which must be addressed in any reconsideration of the guarantee...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus is}} on the {{protracted}} dispute (2009 - 2011) between British Airways (BA) and its cabin crew and their union BASSA (British Airlines’ Stewards and Stewardesses Association). Against a historical legacy of adversarial employment relations, the dispute was triggered by the company’s imposition, in disregard of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>procedures,</b> of reduced crewing levels, transformed working arrangements and a new ‘mixed fleet’ on inferior terms and conditions. Despite the fact that the company marshalled considerable resou rces against the union, including a ‘strategy of decapitation’ of the BASSA leadership, the cabin demonstrated a profound commitment to collective action that saw very large ballot majorities and 22 days of strike action. The question driving the paper is how to explain such powerful collectivism given the adverse conditions facing the crew. Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA’s and crews’ utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a ‘distributed discourse’ and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions’ ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA’s embeddedness in the work lives of their members...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Owing to {{the dearth}} of studies in Africa on {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) and community satisfaction with them, this study aims to examine the case of WAPCO and its host communities. Design/methodology/approach – Through {{the use of a}} simple structured questionnaire, the authors collected data from key respondents including community development leaders, community chiefs, market women leaders, youth development leaders, religious leaders and other opinion leaders in and around the locations of WAPCO's Plants. The authors also extract some useful information from the company's annual reports. In analyzing the data, both a descriptive approach and some measures of linear association are adopted. Findings – The authors found that, although the proportion of resources committed to CSR is small, CSR expenditure rises with the firm's sales. Further, the host community displays a great knowledge of the adverse effects of the company's operation; however, reactions are minimal. This is attributed to the company's elaborate governance structure and CSR practices as well as to a high level of host community satisfaction with them. However, there is the budding predisposition for the company's activities to generate conflict with workers from the community and {{the community as a whole}} in the future. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited by the facts that some data extracted from the company's annual reports are taken as given, and by an inability to carry out a large-scale survey of opinions as planned due to unwillingness of the community individual members to cooperate. Besides, the study is based on a single firm in the manufacturing industry. Thus, caution should be exercised in the interpretation and generalization of these results. Practical implications – The company's CSR is rated as satisfactory; nonetheless, involving the community more in the design of its CSR programs is imperative. The idea of institutionalization of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>procedures</b> in CSR activities is relevant not just to WAPCO, but also to other companies, especially those with much environmental impact, like the oil companies. It is also suggested that a grassroots approach be taken in studying the CSR profile of companies, especially in a developing economy, like Nigeria; in order to serve as early warning signs of conflicts. Originality/value – The study adopts both theoretical and empirical approaches to associate a company's CSR practice with the immediate community needs or satisfaction so as to forestall the replication of the kind of crisis observed in the Nigerian oil industry. To one's knowledge, no prior study in Africa has taken such a holistic and balanced approach. Communities, Corporate image, Nigeria, Pollution, Social responsibility, Stakeholders...|$|R

In phase one of the study, superintendents in the State of Illinois were asked to complete the Leadership Practices Inventory - Self Assessment (2013) (LPISelf) and a demographic profile to identify the type of bargaining that had been used in the most recent negotiations with the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s union in their district. The LPI-Self yields data to identify a dominant leadership practice among five leadership practices including 2 ̆ 2 Model the Way, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Inspire a Shared Vision, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Challenge the Process, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Enable Others to Act, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Encourage the Heart. 2 ̆ 2 The results of the LPI-Self were analyzed to determine which leadership practices are associated with superintendents that engage in interest-based bargaining. In phase two of the study, five superintendents, one each from the aforementioned leadership practices were interviewed regarding their leadership and <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> experiences. These interviews, along with the <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreements that were in place in each of these districts, were transcribed and coded for keywords based on the five practices. Results of the study indicate that there is not quantitative data to support any one of the leadership practices being associated with interest-based bargaining. However, there is qualitative data that points to the practice of 2 ̆ 2 Enable Others to Act 2 ̆ 2 as being closely associated with superintendents that utilize interest-based bargaining.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the opinions of selected Illinois superintendents, Illinois Education Association and Illinois Federation of Teacher unit presidents, and community parent-teacher association presidents concerning citizen participation in <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> in public education. The study examined the nature of the relationship between the opinions expressed regarding community participation in <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> in Illinois public schools and the group affiliation and school district size associated with the respondents. The study also explored which phase of negotiations, if any, would have the highest degree of group acceptance for the utilization of public participation trilateral <b>bargaining</b> <b>procedures</b> in Illinois. A questionnaire entitled Public Participation in Bargaining Opinionnaire was developed by the researcher to obtain the data for this investigation. A pilot study preceded the major study to establish minimal reliability and construct validity. The final survey instrument was mailed to 200 Illinois superintendents, 200 I. E. A. /I. F. T. local unit presidents, and 200 PTA unit presidents, who were randomly selected for participation in the study. Usable responses were received from 303 (50. 7 %) participants. The opinions expressed by PTA local unit presidents on the PPBO instrument were significantly more positive toward utilization of public participation in educational <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> than the opinions expressed by Illinois superintendents and IEA/IFT unit presidents. Respondents associated with school districts having more than 10, 000 students were significantly more positive toward trilateral procedures of public participation in <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Superintendents and IEA/IFT leaders established that when given the option, they prefer Never to implement trilateral procedures of public participation in <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> The findings of this study suggest that those who are currently involved in the complex <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> process in Illinois public schools are more hesitant to open that process to public scrutiny and participation than those who are currently not involved in the process. These findings support the conclusion that leadership toward increased public access and participation in the bargaining process would most likely come from outside the labor and management roles of the existing bargaining structure in Illinois public schools...|$|R
