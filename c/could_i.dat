5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E

For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E

25|$|Your {{request for}} a small island near Chusan, where your merchants may reside and goods be warehoused, arises from your desire to develop trade... Consider, moreover, that England {{is not the only}} barbarian land which wishes to establish... trade with our Empire: supposing that other nations were all to imitate your evil example and beseech me to present them each and all with a site for trading purposes, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} comply? This also is a flagrant infringement of the usage of my Empire and cannot possibly be entertained.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly I’m here at {{the post}} office. The mail is going out today and how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not write to my Sarenka? Just now, my husband, little Bernhard was here. He looks good and feels well. I’m curious about how you are, how your health is. We are well and plan {{to go to the}} camp. Today is a {{gorgeous}} day, we are in the best of spirits and have great hopes for the future…Don’t worry, girl, it’ll be fine. Be brave, stay well. Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning that}} his {{resignation}} took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said {{farewell to the}} White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, “As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do now?” At Andrews, {{he and his family}} boarded Air Force One to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Strauss was {{admired by}} other {{prominent}} composers: Richard Wagner once {{admitted that he}} liked the waltz [...] "Wein, Weib und Gesang" [...] Op.333.

500|$|Owen Gleiberman {{gave the}} film a [...] "B-" [...] {{in his review}} for Entertainment Weekly and wrote, [...] "The Thin Red Line <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> think, {{turn out to be}} this season's Beloved, a movie too paralyzingly high-minded to connect with audiences". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The heart-piercing moments that punctuate its {{rambling}} are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been".|$|E
500|$|On her Christmas Day 2007 {{television}} show, Martha Stewart {{exhibited the}} nativity scene she made in pottery {{classes at the}} Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia while serving a 2005 sentence. She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five months, I begged because I said I was an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and <b>could</b> <b>I</b> please make the entire nativity scene." [...] She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.|$|E
500|$|Savides' first {{experience}} with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a Motorola commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on Zodiac. Fincher {{wanted to make sure}} that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> went against everything I was supposed to do with the camera." [...] Savides felt comfortable with the camera after discovering its limitations.|$|E

500|$|In 1818, Stephen van Rensselaer, Governor of New York, {{obtained}} {{permission for}} Montgomery's {{remains to be}} moved from Quebec to New York. In June 1818, Montgomery's remains set off for New York City. On July 4 they arrived in Albany and took a boat down the Hudson to New York City. Janet stood out on her porch and watched the boat bring Montgomery's remains down the river, fainting at the sight. When his remains arrived in New York City, 5,000 people attended the procession. His remains were interred on July 8, next to his monument at St. Paul's Chapel in Manhattan, which had been completed in 1776. Janet {{was pleased with the}} ceremony and wrote, [...] "What more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> wish than the high honor that has been conferred on the ashes of my poor soldier." ...|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> worked like crazy these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1856, Stone {{was accused}} in court, {{and spoke in}} defense of a rumor put forward by the {{prosecution}} that Stone gave a knife to former slave Margaret Garner, on trial for the killing of her own child {{to prevent it from}} being enslaved. Stone was said to have slipped the prisoner the knife so that Garner could kill herself if she was forced to return to slavery. Stone was referred to by the court as [...] "Mrs. Lucy Stone Blackwell" [...] and was asked if she wanted to defend herself; she preferred to address the assembly off the record after adjournment, saying [...] "...With my own teeth I would tear open my veins and let the earth drink my blood, rather than wear the chains of slavery. How then <b>could</b> <b>I</b> blame her for wishing her child to find freedom with God and the angels, where no chains are?" ...|$|E

500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E
500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gives George Park, Fred O'Dwyer, and Milton Greene a tour around the backstage area of TGS. Fred tells Kenneth that he resembles a man he served with in the service, which Kenneth says [...] "Well, obviously that's a coincidence. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> be in Normandy?". Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served. Jack shows up where Kenneth and the three men are, and tells Kenneth {{that he would like to}} talk to Milton, prompting Kenneth to tell Jack [...] "As head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request." [...] Jack and Milton are then seen at Jack's office.|$|E
500|$|Following Sonny Bono's {{death in}} a skiing {{accident}} in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him [...] "the most unforgettable character" [...] she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published The First Time, a collection of autobiographical essays of [...] "first-time" [...] events in her life, which critics praised for revealing the singer to be down to earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She later told Rolling Stone, [...] "I couldn't ignore it, <b>could</b> <b>I?</b> I might have if I cared more about what people think than what I know is right for me." ...|$|E
