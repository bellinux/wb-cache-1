The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue.

It cited the difficulty of coordinating a rendezvous, which would lead to vulnerability while the merchant ships {{were in the process of}} assembling, and a greater risk of mines. The Admiralty also showed a distrust of the merchant skippers: they could not manoeuvre in company, especially considering that the ships would have various top speeds, nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> expected to keep station. At a conference in February 1917, some merchant captains raised the same concerns. Finally, the Admiralty suggested that a large number of merchantmen arriving simultaneously would be too much tonnage for the ports to handle, but this, too, was based in part on the miscalculation.|$|E

2500|$|The 1860s {{was a time}} of {{innovation}} in hotel building and architecture. By the mid-19th century, staying in hotels had become much more popular than renting a large house for several months, which had been the norm for Brighton's wealthy visitors over the previous century. [...] The Royal Albion and (original) Bedford Hotels of the 1820s were smaller-scale early examples, but only with the development of the passenger lift <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> built on a grand scale. One of Britain's first lifts—a water-powered [...] "ascending omnibus", as it was called—was fitted in the newly built Grand Hotel on Kings Road in 1864. The following year, the Norfolk Arms was completely rebuilt, retaining nothing of its original form. [...] Architect Horatio Nelson Goulty was commissioned for the job; an important figure in public life in Brighton, {{he was one of the}} founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in 1850 and later in the 1860s designed Congregational churches in Newhaven and Hove. Goulty designed the building (now solely a hotel rather than an inn, and renamed the Norfolk Hotel accordingly) in a similar style to the Grand, albeit [...] "slightly more florid". The author of Moorecroft's Guide (1866), a guidebook about the resort, called the rebuilt hotel [...] "more beautiful than any other building in Brighton" [...] despite offering mild criticism of the Grand's very similar architecture. As originally built, the Norfolk was much smaller than the Grand, with 64 bedrooms arranged over five floors compared to the latter's 150 bedrooms and eight storeys. Nevertheless, it was one of the major hotels of Victorian-era Brighton, which is [...] "one of the few places in Britain where ... grand hotels of the European model can be seen". Along with the Grand and the nearby Metropole (1890), it was one of the [...] "great show hotels on the front", at which only wealthy visitors would have stayed; the thousands of working-class holidaymakers would have used the poorer lodging-houses in less favourable locations.|$|E
