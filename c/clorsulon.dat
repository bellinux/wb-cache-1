In addition, there should adequate therapeutic scope, i.e. span between therapeutic and minimal toxic dose. Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with F. magna. Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, albendazole, diamphenetide, closantel, <b>clorsulon,</b> and triclabendazole, {{have been used in}} control of F. magna infection in cervids. However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for F. hepatica, triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against F. magna. Fascioloidosis of cervids was successfully controlled with triclabendazole in USA, and [...] triclabendazole with levamizole in Hungary, Canada, Austria, and Croatia. In contrast, rafoxanide is commonly used in treatment in Czech Republic [...] Slovakia [...] and Hungary. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that use of rafoxanide in control of F. magna infection should be considered. Unfortunately, rafoxanide in a commercial drug called Rafendazol Premix is the only registered drug for wild ruminants.

50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} {{visible on the}} {{behaviour}} of the host. Infected sheep and cattle become severely anorexic or digest food inefficiently and become unthrifty. Continuous diarrhoea is an obvious indication of heavy infection in the digestive system, thus a primary diagnosis. The fluid faeces are examined to identify immature flukes. Paramphistomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Thus management of infection is based mainly on to reduce the host snail population. There are some treatment strategies demonstrated. A common regime is to drench with hexachloroethane-bentonite-water suspension, which is highly effective against adult parasites. Treatments with reported success (efficacies >90%) are resorantel, oxyclozanide, <b>clorsulon,</b> ivermectin and the combination of bithional and levamisole. Most important commercial anthelmintics are shown to be practically useles, including albendazole, praziquantel, nitroxynil, triclabendazole, profenophos and netobimin; while niclosamide has high efficacy (99%) against immature fluke but not adult fluke, and 2-tertiary-butyl benzthiazole compound (CGA 72630), hexachlorophene and resorantel are highly effective against both adult and immature flukes.

50|$|Amphistomiasis is {{considered}} a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Therefore, management of infestation is based mainly on control of the snail population, which transmit the infective larvae of the flukes. However, there are now drugs shown to be effective including resorantel, oxyclozanide, <b>clorsulon,</b> ivermectin, niclosamide, bithional and levamisole. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes. Since the juvenile flukes are the causative individuals of the disease, effective treatment means control of the immature fluke population. Prophylaxis is therefore based on disruption of the environment (such as proper drainage) where the carrier snails inhabit, or more drastic action of using molluscicides to eradicate the entire population. For treatment of the infection, drugs effective against the immature flukes are recommended for drenching. For this reason oxyclozanide is advocated as the drug of choice. It effectively kills the flukes {{within a few hours}} and it effective against the flukes resistant to other drugs. The commercially prescribed dosage is 5 mg/kg body weight or 18.7 mg/kg body weight in two divided dose within 72 hours. Niclosamide is also extensively used in mass drenching of sheep. Successfully treated sheep regain appetite within a week, diarrhoea stops in about three days, and physiological indicators (such as plasma protein and albumin levels) return to normal in a month.|$|E

Chromatographic separation was achieved on a BDS hypersil C 18 (5 μ, 250 x 4. 6 mm) utilizing mobile phase of filtered and degassed mixture of 60 phosphate buffer (pH 5. 5 adjusted with 1 % O-phosphoric acid) and Methanol (60 : 40 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with UV detection at 234 nm. The method has been validated for linearity, accuracy and precision. In RP-HPLC method, the calibration graphs were linear in the concentration range of 2. 5 - 7. 5 μg/ml for Ivermectin and 25 - 75 μg/ml for <b>Clorsulon</b> with percentage recoveries of 100. 34 % and 99. 76 % for Ivermectin and <b>Clorsulon</b> respectively.

40|$|The Efficacy of the fluckicides albendazole, {{triclabendazole}} and <b>clorsulon</b> {{was tested}} in sheep naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica in a farm from the León province. 45 sheep {{were randomly selected}} and divided into three gropups of 15 each, as follows: G-ABZ (7, 5 mg/kg b. w. albendazole), G-TCBZ (10 mg/kg b. w. triclabendazole) and G-CLORS (2 mg/kg b. w. <b>clorsulon).</b> In 2002 and 2004, faecal and blood samples were individually recovered at days 0, 6, 15 and 30 post-treatment. Faeces were examined by sedimentation technique and the sera by using an indirect-ELISA and excretory-secretory antigens. The efficacy of the fasciolicides was tested by the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and the IgG reduction test (IRT). In 2002, only triclabendazole showed high efficacy (> 95 %) against F. hepatica by means of FECRT, wheareas the efficacy of ABZ and CLOR was lower (85 - 63 % and 95 - 72 %, respectively). The IRT showed that IgG levels decreased during the two first days in animal treated with albendazole and <b>clorsulon,</b> although an increase was observed the last day. At the same time, {{a rise in the}} IgG levels was observed in animals treated with triclabendazole. The analysis of the results of 2004 showed that FECRT had low values with the albendazole (17 to 4 %) and <b>clorsulon</b> (48 to 30 %), and percentages from 82 to 76 % were obtained with the triclabendazole.

40|$|In a {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>clorsulon</b> against Fascioloides magna infection in sheep, 12 ewes were inoculated orally with 100 metacercariae of F magna, and 6 were treated with <b>clorsulon</b> (15 mg/kg of body weight) 8 weeks after inoculation. The sheep were euthanatized 16 weeks after inoculation, flukes were recovered, and the liver and other tissues were subjectively scored for the severity of lesions (0 to 4 +). The number of flukes recovered from the clorsulon-treated group (3. 8 +/- 1. 2 flukes) was significantly (P = 0. 025) lower {{than the number of}} flukes recovered from the group of untreated controls (10. 0 +/- 6. 6 flukes). The severity of lesions was significantly (P = 0. 004) reduced (45. 9 %) in the treated group (2. 0 +/- 1. 1), compared with that in the untreated controls (3. 7 +/- 0. 5). In the untreated group, 3 sheep died and 1 became moribund 14 to 16 weeks after inoculation. The data suggested that a single treatment with <b>clorsulon</b> at a dosage of 15 mg/kg 8 weeks after inoculation was not effective in preventing F magna infection in sheep, because the survival of only a few F magna is potentially fatal in sheep within 6 months after infection...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The {{pharmacokinetics}} of two antimicrobials {{were investigated}} in alpacas. Six healthy alpacas were each administered a single dose of 10 mg/kg of oxytetracycline by IV injection and IM injection. In addition, a single dose of 20 mg/kg of florfenicol by IV administration {{was given to}} alpacas in a separate study. The pharmacokinetic parameters of oxytetracycline and florfenicol in alpacas were compared to the results previously obtained in llamas. There were significant differences between llamas and alpacas in several of oxytetracycline pharmacokinetic parameters {{but there were no}} significant differences in all of florfenicol pharmacokinetic parameters in these two animals. It can be concluded that llamas and alpacas have different oxytetracycline disposition kinetics while they have similar disposition kinetics of florfenicol. The pharmacokinetics of <b>clorsulon,</b> a narrow-spectrum anthelmintic agent, was investigated in llamas following oral administration at a single dose of 14 mg/kg. The plasma levels of <b>clorsulon</b> produced by this dose was lower than the values reported in the <b>clorsulon</b> pharmacokinetic studies carried out in sheep and goats following oral administration at a single dose of 7 mg/kg This suggests the entire dose of <b>clorsulon</b> is not absorbed in llamas. Since the differential equations describing one-compartment system with first-order input and two-compartment system after IV administration with nonlinear elimination kinetics cannot be solved, there is no mathematical expression for the AUC for drugs following these models. The AUC values calculated from the proposed preliminary AUC equations for drugs following these models were compared to the AUC calculated using the trapezoidal rule method based on computer-generated data using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Except for a few exceptions, the predicted AUC from the proposed equations matched the values calculated from the theoretically generated data...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} study, Fasciola hepatica strains of sheep with {{different}} degrees of resistance to anthelmintics were analyzed by sequencing the cytochrome C oxidase (COX 1) and the NADH dehydrogenase (NAD 1) subunits. The strains were as follows: LS, susceptible to all drugs tested; CS, resistant to albendazole and triclabendazole; and SV, resistant to albendazole and <b>clorsulon.</b> The molecular characterization was done in eggs recovered from sheep infected by LS and CS. In relation to SV, eggs were recovered before (SV 0) and after a treatment with albendazole (SVA) and <b>clorsulon</b> (SVC). Nested PCRs were carried out to amplify a fragment of 798 bp of the COX 1 subunit and 870 bp of the NAD 1 subunit. The pairwise sequence identity between eggs was analyzed for each strain. Population diversity indices, neutrality indices, {{and the degree of}} gene flow among the strains were evaluated. As a result, we have shown that there was homogeneity in the demographic expansion of the studied strains, and, according to the pairwise fixation index, these were not genetically differentiated. Although we found that the resistant strains had lower pairwise percentage similarities, higher haplotype diversity, and higher frequencies of specific SNPs, especially in the COX 1 subunit, these differences were not very significant. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of adult flukes resistant to anthelmintics does not result in significant higher genetic diversity in the mtDNA of their eggs. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

Title of diploma thesis: Liver fluke - {{treatment}} and resistence Fasciola hepatica is a parasite of global importance {{that we find}} both in farm animals and in humans. This thesis aims to summarize information on the potential of drugs and treatment alternatives that are suitable for treatment of F. hepatica.

The drugs used to treat fasciolosis are called antitrematodal drugs. They can be divided into five chemical groups, of which the most important group are currently benzimidazoles and their representative triclabendazole. Also other drugs as albendazole, <b>clorsulon,</b> hexachlorophene, closantel, diamphenitide, bithionol, rafoxanide are important. The rate of resistance development is affected by many factors that may be genetic, biological or functional.

40|$|International audienceAnthelmintic {{drugs are}} widely used for {{treatment}} of parasitic worms in livestock but {{little is known about}} the stability of their residues in food under conventional cooking conditions. As part of the European Commission-funded research project ProSafeBeef, cattle were medicated with commercially available anthelmintic preparations, comprising 11 active ingredients (corresponding to 21 marker residues). Incurred meat and liver were cooked by roasting (40 min at 190 °C) or shallow frying (muscle 8 - 12 min, liver 14 - 19 min) in a domestic kitchen. Raw and cooked tissues and expressed juices were analysed using a novel multi-residue dispersive solid phase extraction method (QuECheRS) coupled with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. After correction for sample weight changes during cooking, no major losses were observed for residues of oxyclozanide, <b>clorsulon,</b> closantel, ivermectin, albendazole, mebendazole or fenbendazole. However, significant losses were observed for nitroxynil (78 % in fried muscle, 96 % in roast muscle), levamisole (11 % in fried muscle, 42 % in fried liver), rafoxanide (17 % in fried muscle, 18 % in roast muscle) and triclabendazole (23 % in fried liver, 47 % in roast muscle). Migration of residues from muscle into expressed cooking juices varied between drugs, constituting 0 % to 17 % (levamisole) of total residues remaining after cooking. With the exception of nitroxynil, residues of anthelmintic drugs were generally resistant to degradation during roasting and shallow frying. Conventional cooking cannot, therefore, be considered a safeguard against ingestion of residues of anthelmintic veterinary drugs in beef...|$|E
40|$|Flukicides are {{commonly}} administered at housing to cattle that have grazed fluke-infected pastures or {{that have been}} purchased from endemic areas. The choice of product is determined by numerous factors, {{one of which is}} the stages of Fasciola hepatica that are killed. Flukicides can be categorised into three main groups: (A) those that kill all juvenile stages and adults; (B) those that kill juveniles from six to eight weeks of age and adults and (C) those that kill adults only. This study was conducted on a commercial beef farm in Scotland and was designed to compare the efficacy of flukicides from each of these three classes in terms of their effects on faecal egg output, coproantigen and liveweight gain. The majority of animals in the untreated control group were positive for coproantigen, fluke eggs or both throughout the study duration of 16  weeks. Egg reappearance interval following housing treatment was eight weeks for <b>clorsulon</b> and 13  weeks for nitroxynil, though patent infections in both groups developed in only a small minority of animals; no fluke eggs were recovered from cattle treated with triclabendazole. Coproantigen was detected four weeks before the reappearance of fluke eggs in the dung. Animals treated with flukicides had significantly fewer faecal samples positive for eggs (P&# 60; 0. 006) and coproantigen (P&# 60; 0. 05) following treatment compared with the controls.
