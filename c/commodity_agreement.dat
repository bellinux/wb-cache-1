Secondly, changes in national interests can be measured that result from the individual country's decision to participate in the agreement or to stay outside. This approach compares the situation of participation with that of non-participation in an existing <b>commodity</b> <b>agreement.</b> As the consequences of a national decision are analyzed, it is a normative or decision-oriented approach to measuring national interests. The ICA is a particularly interesting scheme to show the two approaches, as some countries participate in the agreement while others do not.

These negative impacts of commodity trade, which relate closely {{to a number of}} ‘contextual realities’ that currently militate against further trade agreements, may be exacerbated by simple trade liberalisation, and they may therefore intensify opposition to such liberalisation unless they are addressed.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{commodity}} stocks, {{their role in}} price determination for storable commodities, and past efforts of international stockholding arrangements with economic provisions in stabilising world prices.

However, the experience with past international <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> (ICAs) with price band provisions and stockholding obligations suggests that they had only limited success in reducing the volatility of the prices they set out to stabilise, as well as being prone to many other operational problems. The paper also suggests that as a possible response to apparently inadequate private storage, public sector storage would be costly, ineffective in countering price spikes once stocks are fully exhausted, and would crowd out private storage.

40|$|International <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> (ICAs) fit uneasily in a {{world in}} which markets are {{becoming}} globalized and increasingly competitive. Development policy - both as preached by international agencies and as practiced by typically democratically elected and nonsocialist governments in the major producing countries - emphasizes productive efficiency, product quality, and effective marketing. This is a long way from the ideology that gave central place to supply restrictions operating through central marketing boards and quota allocations. In today's less centralized, more competitive world, the winners and losers from commodity stabilization are more evenly distributed across producing and consuming countries. Commodity policy is no longer a matter of redistribution from consumers to producers. This institutional change has been reinforced by the widespread belief - evidenced, for example, by the collapse of the international tin and coffee <b>agreements</b> - that <b>commodity</b> market stabilization through international agreements cannot succeed. In earlier decades, the belief that stabilization could and would improve the position of commodity producers provided the impetus for resolving some of the problems that intervention threw up. Since the collapse of the tin market in 1985, the belief that commodity market stabilization cannot work has undermined producers'willingness to try to resolve difficulties within existing ICAs and has reinforced the suspicion of consumer governments that these agreements were in no one's interests. In the current climate, encouraging competitive markets, state interventions are seen as requiring clear justification in terms of market failure. The existence of active futures markets in all of the industries that have <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> makes justification along these lines problematic. But the"commodity problem"has not disappeared, and producers may look for other mechanisms to raise prices from often very low levels in industries experiencing excess capacity. Developed country governments may be forced to decide whether they prefer to see markets controlled by producer cartels (where they will lack representation) or under the auspices of international <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements.</b> Markets and Market Access,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Theory&Research,Commodities,Access to Markets,Environmental Economics&Policies,Crops&Crop Management Systems,Economic Theory&Research,Markets and Market Access...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the growing rhetoric on {{international}} trade liberalisation that we hear today, developed countries continue to support their agriculture using methods that are harmful to farmers in developing countries. In WTO discussions, `non-trade distortionary` payments are used as a pretext for continuing to displace imports and for exporting products below their own cost of production. Meanwhile, world markets for tropical crops that were actually liberalised have seen a deeper and more protracted price fall than in the 1930 s. This has led to poverty and land degradation, and is the major cause of the debt crisis that has many developing countries in a stranglehold. Voices are now being raised calling for new arrangements aimed at improving the prices of tropical export crops. Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda have placed the issue on the WTO agenda (WTO/CTD 2003). However, many western economists and policy-makers resist such new interventions, claiming that it will reduce welfare and encourage rent seeking. Moreover, in their view, the collapse of international <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> in the 1980 s proved that price-raising controls are doomed to failure. In this paper, we address three questions: - Are supportive arrangements for tropical export crops desirable? - Why did international <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> collapse? - Are sustainable arrangements possible?

And commodities, fuels, grains, and oilseeds are important imports for several countries. The notorious volatility of commodity prices is a major source of instability and uncertainty in commodity-dependent countries, affecting governments, producers (farmers), traders, processors, and financial institutions. Further, commodity price instability has a negative impact on economic growth, income distribution, and poverty alleviation. Early attempts to deal with commodity price volatility relied on buffer stocks, buffer funds, government intervention in commodity markets, and international <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> to stabilize prices. These were largely unsuccessful [...] sometimes spectacularly so. Buffer funds went bankrupt, <b>commodity</b> <b>agreements</b> were suspended, buffer stocks proved ineffective, and government intervention was both costlyand ineffective. As the poor performance of such stabilization schemes became more evident, academics and policymakers began distinguishing between programs that tried to alter price distribution (domestically or internationally) and programs that used market-based approaches for dealing with market uncertainty. This change in approach coincided with a significant rise in the use of market-based commodity risk management instruments [...] aided by the liberalization of markets, the lowering of trade and capital control barriers, and the globalization of commodity markets. by the mid- 1990 s, several governments, state companies, and private sector participants began using commodity derivatives markets to hedge their commodity price risks. Participation in those markets is growing, but important barriers to access remain including counterparty risk, problems small groups (such as farmers) have aggregating risks, basis risks (no correlation of local and international prices), no local reference prices, low liquidity, no derivatives markets for certain products, and low levels of know-how. International institutions, local governments, and the private sector could facilitate developing countries access to derivatives markets and the use of risk management tools to solve public sector problems.
