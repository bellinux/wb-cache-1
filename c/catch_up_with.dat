5|$|After {{building}} boats, Lochry {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Wheeling, hoping to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the main body of}} the expedition. Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E

5|$|As {{promotion}} for the show, Showtime {{posted a}} preview of the pilot on their website. In September 2006, CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership, and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network, including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series, such as Dexter. On October 28, after the first few episodes had aired, Showtime made it easier for viewers to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body can <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, {{an exploration of}} all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E

Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E

5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters caused them to consider him now {{to be a serious}} threat. It did not take them long to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> our obscenity quota.|$|E
5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, and <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{them just}} outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious Cloud hidden away, Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. Cloud manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had done to him. Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E

Since {{he was the only}} Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

Spider-Man is forced to slip out after Harry walks in, and misses Harry drinking an experimental, drug-like formula. A short while later, Peter Parker calls Harry and invites him to a Bleecker Street Halloween carnival along with Gwen, Mary Jane and Liz. Harry accepts the invitation. On his way to the carnival, Peter attempts to sell some Spider-Man photographs to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson, but he refuses and tells him to try selling them to the Globe.|$|E

Admiral Byron, who succeeded Howe {{as head of the}} New York station in September, was also unsuccessful in blockading d'Estaing: his fleet was scattered by a storm when it arrived off Boston, while d'Estaing sailed away, bound for the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Their semi-final was {{a rematch}} of the 1966 Football League Cup Final, with West Ham United the {{opposition}} over two legs. Albion took a commanding {{lead in the}} first leg with a 4–0 victory, a goal from Dennis Clarke and a hat-trick from Jeff Astle. West Ham captain Bobby Moore urged his team to push Albion hard in the second leg, even in the closing stages of the match when they still had all four goals from the first leg to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> Goals from Geoff Hurst and Johnny Byrne for West Ham were cancelled out by goals from Stanley Jones and Clarke by the 60th minute. The match finished with 2–2, thus Albion progressed due to a 6–2 aggregate victory.|$|E

5|$|Decades later, during Bilbo's {{birthday}} celebration, {{the wizard}} Gandalf (William Squire) {{tells him to}} leave the Ring for his relative Frodo (Christopher Guard). Bilbo reluctantly agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses; and Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Pippin (Dominic Guard), Merry (Simon Chandler), and Sam (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths, the hobbits eventually come to Bree, from which Aragorn (John Hurt) leads them to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop Weathertop mountain by the chief of the Ringwraiths, and becomes sickened as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them shortly after they meet the elf Legolas (Anthony Daniels); and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the river.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E
5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily, which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the expedition before it sailed for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila {{after he left the}} island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent to him for help, but he did nothing.|$|E
