Examining how these experiences shaped my professional construct may inform future initiatives to socialize future occupational therapists to the profession...|$|R

2500|$|In 1868, Brocolini {{returned}} to Brooklyn and continued his journalism career, writing editorials for the Brooklyn Eagle by 1875. [...] He {{also began to}} sing in concerts. [...] He appeared as bass soloist at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, in December 1868, and soon thereafter at various churches and other venues.

[...] Brocolini wrote, [...] "The complete <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life was effected in less than three hours.... They put in what money they could themselves, called on my wealthy friends in Brooklyn for subscriptions, and in less than three hours they raised $5500 for me." ...|$|E
