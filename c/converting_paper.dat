For large corpora, sampling strategies are proposed both for estimating conversion costs and for taking advantage of style homogeneity. 1...|$|E

If fission propulsion systems are to be developed to their full potential; however, near-term customers must be identified and initial fission systems successfully developed, launched, and utilized.

40|$|Introduction Observation of any {{organisational}} setting only {{serves to}} confirm that the most pervasive, ubiquitous artefact in support of collaborative work is paper. Even in "hightech " research environments, paper is everywhere. We write on it, read from it, stack it, and file it. We also bring it to meetings, exchange it, distribute it, and discuss it. Far from replacing paper, the emergence of new, digital technologies appears to have encouraged its proliferation, easing the creation of paper copies from digital or paper forms. What is it about paper which makes it such an integral part of work? Why has the paperless office not arrived? There can be no simple answers to these questions. There are reasonable arguments which point to factors such as habit and cultural preference playing a role, as well as technological obstacles to <b>converting</b> <b>paper</b> into electronic forms, or in incompatibility amongst electronic media.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>converting</b> <b>paper</b> maps into digital formats {{is a major}} concern today with the {{emergence}} of geographical information systems (GIS) as replacements of the traditional paper map. One of the major problems in this conversion is that a paper map is nothing more than an abstraction. The information found in maps is mainly symbolic rather than an accurate graphical description of the region covered by the map. A system is presented that utilizes the symbolic knowledge found in the legend of the map to drive geographic symbol recognition. The geographic symbol layer(s) of the map are first scanned. The legend of the map is located and segmented. The geographic symbols are identified, and their semantic meaning is attached to them. This information is used to build an initial training set that is then used to classify geographical symbols in input maps using statistical pattern recognition. User interaction is required at first to assist in building the training set to account for [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Redrawing {{existing}} {{mechanical engineering}} drawings on a CAD system remains a preferable choice to <b>converting</b> <b>paper</b> to electronic form. We propose a time-saving redrawing procedure using image processing techniques. The {{idea is to}} use these techniques to extract the geometric primitives of machine parts and let the redrawing procedure start by editing these primitives. For this purpose, fidelity and precision are not essential; therefore, low resolution is sufficient to obtain satisfactory results. The example shown in this paper uses a resolution of 3 pixel/mm and {{the result could be}} improved by using higher resolution hardware. The image is taken from an actual mechanical engineering drawing and decomposed into squares of maximal size by a maximal square moving algorithm. Then, the object contour of the drawing is detected and isolated by a graph-theoretical algorithm based on a minimal spanning tree. Finally, the geometric primitives are extracted from the isolated object contour and converted into IGES format which is understood by most CAD systems...|$|E
