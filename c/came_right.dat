5|$|The eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627) {{dominated}} {{the court of}} the Tianqi Emperor (r. 1620–1627) and had his political rivals tortured to death, mostly the vocal critics from the faction of the Donglin Society. He ordered temples built in his honor throughout the Ming Empire, and built personal palaces created with funds allocated for building the previous emperor's tombs. His friends and family gained important positions without qualifications. Wei also published a historical work lambasting and belittling his political opponents. The instability at court <b>came</b> <b>right</b> as natural calamity, pestilence, rebellion, and foreign invasion came to a peak. The Chongzhen Emperor (r. 1627–44) had Wei dismissed from court, which led to Wei's suicide shortly after.|$|E
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, {{the second}} quarter featured three turnovers, and at half time, Penn State led 6–3 with two field goals from senior kicker Sam Ficken. On Penn State's first drive in the second half, Allen Robinson returned and caught a screen pass, which he ran for 25 yards, and then a 51-yard touchdown pass to make the score 13–3. On the ensuing drive, however, Syracuse <b>came</b> <b>right</b> back and scored a touchdown via a Jerome Smith 10-yard run. Early in the fourth quarter, Ficken made his third field goal of the day, a career-long 46 yards. Later in the quarter, Hackenberg threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to Eugene Lewis to make the score 23–10. When only down by 6 points, Syracuse got the ball around their own 45-yard line with {{a little over two}} minutes left, but turned the ball over via an interception with under two minutes to play.|$|E
5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they <b>came</b> <b>right</b> up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E

5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. Penn State took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. Penn State moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but their offense went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards. Penn State {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. Penn State <b>came</b> <b>right</b> back with a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive {{brought them to the}} one yard line, but Penn State held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game. Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25. Penn State took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E

The Annick did not flow into the Garnock at this time and the Ardeer peninsula was an island.

25|$|Coming {{off their}} home {{win over the}} Lions, the Seahawks flew to the University of Phoenix Stadium for a Week 10 NFC West rematch with the Arizona Cardinals. Seattle took flight {{in the first quarter}} as running back Justin Forsett got an 11-yard {{touchdown}} run. The Seahawks would add onto their lead in the second quarter with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Carlson. The Cardinals would answer with quarterback Kurt Warner completing a 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Breaston, yet Seattle <b>came</b> <b>right</b> back with a 32-yard field goal from kicker Olindo Mare. Arizona would close out the half with kicker Neil Rackers nailing a 27-yard field goal.|$|E

25|$|Airport {{proposals}} were defeated in two hotly contested ballot initiatives, and further challenges {{took place in}} the courts. A series of demonstration commercial flights from the airport in June 1999 generated less noise than the former military flights, but resulted in much public outcry due to the use of different flight paths from the military, and incessant circling over nearby cities to line up for another approach. Eventually the airport opponents prevailed, and in March 2002, the Department of Defense announced that it would sell the land to private interests to be developed into Orange County Great Park. This decision <b>came</b> <b>right</b> after the military stated that it wanted to return to the base.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their divisional home {{loss to the}} Cardinals, the Seahawks flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 8 {{showdown}} with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Seattle struck first as kicker Olindo Mare got a 43-yard field goal. However, the Cowboys answered with quarterback Tony Romo's 36-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sam Hurd. Dallas would increase their lead {{in the second quarter}} with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Marion Barber. The Seahawks would reply with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Deion Branch, but Dallas <b>came</b> <b>right</b> back with Romo finding wide receiver Roy Williams on a 7-yard touchdown pass.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 2007 a major {{wildfire}} burned {{more than}} , destroying the bird sanctuary, Dante's View, and Captain's Roost, and forcing {{the evacuation of}} hundreds of people.

It was the third fire of the year. The city announced a $50million plan to stabilize the burned slopes. The trees along Canyon Drive were allowed to grow back naturally, having been re-seeded by bird droppings.|$|E

The Huskies <b>came</b> <b>right</b> back with a scoring drive on their own on a 13-yard pass from Locker to Aguilar. The Bears were unable to capitalize on a 65-yard kickoff return by Isi Sofele and a fourth down conversion attempt was halted at the Washington 13-yard line with six and a half minutes left in the third quarter. The Huskies shut down the Bear offense {{for the rest of the}} game, recovering two fumbles by Riley in the fourth quarter and scoring late in the game on a 10-yard run by Chris Polk.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the Loch Earn, after first {{sighting}} the Ville du Havre and realising she was dangerously close, rang the ship's bell and ported his helm. The helm of the Loch Earn was put to starboard, but Ville du Havre <b>came</b> <b>right</b> across the Loch Earn's bow. The Ville du Havre was violently shaken by the collision and noise, and woke all the passengers. Confused, most passengers went on deck, only to discover the ship was rapidly sinking. The captain assured them that all was fine, but in reality the cruiser had been nearly broken in two, and it didn't take long for passengers to realize the situation was desperate. Commotion and chaos overtook panicked passengers. They started grabbing life preservers and trying to push lifeboats into the water. Unfortunately, these had recently been painted, and they were now stuck fast to the deck. Finally {{a few of them}} were yanked loose, and passengers fought desperately {{to be one of the}} few travelers to board those rescue boats.|$|E
25|$|He {{joined the}} staff of Surrey in 1930, and made his {{first-class}} debut the following season. However, he did not play in {{a substantial number of}} matches until 1934, when he made 598 runs with an average of 31.47. In 1935 he was a regular member of the side and passed 1,000 runs for the first time, and scored his first three hundreds. The following year he <b>came</b> <b>right</b> to the fore. He made 2,129 runs at an average of 53.22. He was selected for the Players at Lord's, played in two Test trials and was selected for two Tests against India. He was selected for the following winter's tour of Australia, but missed six weeks through a broken bone in his right hand, and thus missed his chance to press for a Test place. During the 1937 season, he switched to opening the batting for Surrey, and occupied that batting position for most of the remainder of his career. He continued to score heavily, and was selected for a Test trial in 1938, in which he made a hundred, but even so could not force his way into the Test team.|$|E

In the 4th quarter, Manning ran in a play from the Patriot one-yard line to give the Colts a 20–10 lead. However, the Patriots <b>came</b> <b>right</b> back and, {{with the aid of}} a 33-yard reception from Donte' Stallworth, the Pats got their first touchdown of the half off a 4-yard catch by Wes Welker. Forcing a punt by the Colts, Kevin Faulk then gave the Patriots a 24–20 lead off a 13-yard reception to give the Patriots their first lead of the half. The Patriots then stopped a drive by the Colts when Peyton Manning was hit by Jarvis Green and fumbled the ball into the hands of Rosevelt Colvin with just under three minutes to go. On third and ten with no timeouts left for the Colts, the Patriots ended any hope for Indianapolis when Welker made a big 12-yard catch to give the Patriots a first down. The Patriots were able to kneel the ball after that to finish off the Colts and the Colts fell to 7–1, losing their first game of the season.|$|E
