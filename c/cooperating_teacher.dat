30|$|In addition, {{supervision}} by <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> {{and university}} supervisors {{has an important}} role in providing pre-service teachers with opportunities to develop their PCK for teaching science. Based on the findings of Faikhamta and Clarke (2015) and Jantarakantee and Roadrangka (2010), pre-service science teachers rarely receive productive suggestions and feedback from <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> about their teaching. They noted that some <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> did not have any experience or understanding of student-centred approach or constructivist-based teaching and suggested that the pre-service teachers consult with their supervisors. However, it was apparent that the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> need university supervisors to clarify the role of these <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> when they supervise pre-service science teachers in their teaching. <b>Cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> also often feel that teacher education programmes are disconnected from their work. While university supervisors and pre-service teachers work collaboratively, they and <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> have limited opportunities to directly communicate with one another. This problem may be because of traditional models of supervision that are based on a ‘theory into practice’ model. In this model, pre-service teachers learn theories in their university courses and then apply their knowledge in a teaching setting.|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{in the field of}} teacher education has recognized the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> as the most important member of the professional team which supervises the clinical laboratory experience of the student teacher. In fact, various educators have noted that no single individual has so direct an influence as the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> in shaping the attitudes, skills, and ideas of a prospective teacher. In spite of the recognition given to the significant role the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> plays in the daily supervision of the student teacher, information is still missing on the identification and validation of important tasks or competencies necessary for the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> to perform. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify specific competencies of secondary school cooperating teachers, to determine the degree of importance of these competencies, and to analyze the differences in perceptions regarding the most important competencies. Respondents in the study were cooperating teachers, student teachers, and university supervisors associated with student teaching programs at The University of Arizona during the 1978 - 79 academic year. The study was conducted in the following manner: (1) A search of the literature was completed to locate lists of existing <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> competencies. (2) A list of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> competencies published in 1966, by the Association of Teacher Educators was adopted as a starting point for competency identification. (3) A jury of eleven experts critiqued the original 35 competencies for appropriateness and clarity. These experts also offered suggestions for additional competencies. (4) The list of competencies was then revised to include new competencies, strengthen each existing competency, eliminate duplication, and correct grammatical inconsistencies. (5) To insure content validity, the list was next critiqued by two research specialists, who examined the competencies for appropriateness, clarity, and completeness. (6) Revised once again, the final list served as the data gathering instrument for this study. All 32 competencies identified in this study were validated. The most crucial competency identified as necessary/most important for the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> was a human relations competency, that of maintaining communication. In fact, those competencies considered to be more directly related to maintaining interpersonal human relations and those more closely related to classroom interactions were perceived by all groups as more important for the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> than were other competencies. Consistently, cooperating teachers viewed competencies as more important than did student teachers. As a result of their perceptions, university supervisors placed themselves in a middle position with perceptions overlapping those of both cooperating teachers and student teachers. Experience in teaching and subject matter specialization had little effect on perceptual differences regarding competencies. Experience in supervision and amount of graduate study did not impact on perceptual differences at all. Integrating these competencies into teacher education inservice programs would necessitate determining the following: (1) perceived need for developing each competency; (2) current level of competency integration; (3) instructional methods for facilitating competency achievement; (4) criteria for assessing achievement of competencies.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{determine}} whether there was a significant relationship among perceptions of university supervisors, <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> student teachers, and building principals regarding characteristics required to become an effective university supervisor of student teachers. In order to examine the research questions, data were collected from each of the four population groups with a questionnaire consisting of twenty-three supervisory characteristics. Twenty-three null hypotheses were tested by using the Chi square test of independence. The. 05 level of significance was established as the critical probability level for the rejection of hypotheses. Findings 1. There was a statistically significant difference among university supervisors, <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> student teachers, and building principals in their perceptions regarding nineteen of the supervisory characteristics. 2. There was no significant difference among university supervisors, <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> student teachers, and building principals in their perceptions regarding four of the supervisory characteristics. 3. The average number of years teaching experience was 18. 4 for university supervisors, 13. 5 for <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> and 17. 6 for building principals. 4. The average number of years of supervising student teachers was 9. 9 for university supervisors, 5. 2 for <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> and 8. 1 for building principals. 5. There were 46. 4 percent of university supervisors, 7. 8 percent of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> and 22. 2 percent of building principals who possessed supervisory training. 6. Reflecting a positive professional attitude and a real liking and respect for teaching are the most important characteristics needed by university supervisors. 7. There was an observable difference in the perceptions of practitioners regarding characteristics required to be an effective university supervisor of student teachers, when compared to reports in related literature.

Head teacher educator respondents indicated that the number one placement practice for placing student teachers was that of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> having at least three years teaching experience (mean= 4. 61) Teacher educator respondents indicated that a cooperating center having access to the World Wide Web (mean= 4. 79) was the most important element of a cooperating center. Additionally, teacher educators indicated that a <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> who supports other school activities was the most important <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> element (mean= 4. 28). As a whole, student teachers indicated that they learned a great deal from their student teaching experience (mean= 4. 65) and that the student teaching component of their teacher education program was the most valuable component (mean= 4. 54). Statistically siginificant relationships between student teacher perceptions of their cooperating center elements and the quality of their student teaching experience existed. The elements with a positive correlation and statistical significance included cooperating center facilities (r=. 447) and <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and student teacher relationships (r=. 853). The correlation coefficient (r=. 389) between the level of importance of student teaching placement methods and the quality of the student teacher experience indicated a low positive relationship (Davis, 1971, but was not significant at the. 05 alpha level. This indicated that the more time and effort teacher educators spend on placing student teachers may increase the student teacher's quality of experience...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{longitudinal}} study of student teachers ' perceptions of their supervision by cooperating teachers and university supervisors at a small state university. An open-ended survey gathered the opinions of 469 student teachers. Researchers coded survey responses to identify common themes about important skills or characteristics of successful cooperating teachers and university supervisors. Results highlighted 11 themes regarding cooperating teachers ' supervision: guide, feedback, expert, style, power, welcome, support, ideas, <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> choice, evaluation/grades, and triad of student, <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> and university supervisor. There were nine themes regarding supervisors: visits, support, help, feedback, availability, expectations, guide, the triad, and grades. Results suggest that workshops and training materials for cooperating teachers and university supervisors should focus on themes that are both important to student teachers and changeable. It appears that it is importan...|$|E

40|$|PERCEPTIONS OF COOPERATING TEACHERS CONCERNING THE STUDENT TEACHING FIELD EXPERIENCE Dawn Paulson 142 Pages December 2014 This study {{explored}} {{the views of}} <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> on (a) their work with student teachers and university supervisors, and (b) {{ways to improve the}} student teaching process. In a mixed-methods sequential explanatory study, 153 <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> answered closed-and open-ended questions using an electronic survey; then a subset of 12 participated in follow-up interviews. All participants taught at rural or semi-rural middle schools and high schools in Central Illinois; all had experience with student teachers from a mid-sized institution in that area. Major findings of the study included <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 lack of preparation for the semester, <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 beliefs in a need for better selection of student teachers, their desire for feedback, roles they feel they should play (role model, mentor, judge, etc.), and their desire for power and respect. Recommendations include suggestions for university policy regarding candidates, university supervisors, and student teaching...|$|R
40|$|University teacher {{education}} programs often struggle to attract <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers.</b> Given this situation, it is obviously of interest to determine what factors may attract teachers to, or repel them from, the cooperating role. It is also of interest to determine, in general terms at least, what characteristics <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> share. This paper develops a profile of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> who agreed to work with student teachers, and discusses factors that encourage or dissuade them from taking on their important role. Results suggest that teachers’ positive motivations to take practicum students revolve around a solid set of professional commitments to self, students, and the profession. However, the actual experience of working with student teachers can run counter to these positive motivations, and may dissuade teachers from continuing in their cooperating role. The findings have strong implications for developing a cohort of motivated, committed and capable school-based <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> {{to work with the}} future generation of teachers...|$|R
