50|$|The Kiyotaki-Moore {{model of}} credit cycles is an {{economic}} model developed by Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and John H. Moore that shows how small shocks to the economy might be amplified by <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions,</b> giving rise to large output fluctuations. The model assumes that borrowers cannot be forced to repay their debts. Therefore, in equilibrium, lending occurs {{only if it is}} collateralized. That is, borrowers must own a sufficient quantity of capital that can be confiscated in case they fail to repay. This collateral requirement amplifies business cycle fluctuations because in a recession, the income from capital falls, causing the price of capital to fall, which makes capital less valuable as collateral, which limits firms' investment by forcing them to reduce their borrowing, and thereby worsens the recession.|$|E

5000|$|Wall Street {{has become}} synonymous with {{financial}} interests, often used negatively. During the subprime mortgage crisis from 2007 to 2010, Wall Street financing was blamed {{as one of the}} causes, although most commentators blame an interplay of factors. The U.S. government with the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars, but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated, and was criticized by journalists as well as the public. Analyst Robert Kuttner in the Huffington Post criticized the bailout as helping large Wall Street firms such as Citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as Chicago's ShoreBank. One writer in the Huffington Post looked at FBI statistics on robbery, fraud, and crime and concluded that Wall Street was the [...] "most dangerous neighborhood in the United States" [...] if one factored in the $50 billion fraud perpetrated by Bernie Madoff. When large firms such as Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing were found guilty of fraud, Wall Street was often blamed, even though these firms had headquarters around the nation and not in Wall Street. Many complained that the resulting Sarbanes-Oxley legislation dampened the business climate with regulations that were [...] "overly burdensome." [...] Interest groups seeking favor with Washington lawmakers, such as car dealers, have often sought to portray their interests as allied with Main Street rather than Wall Street, although analyst Peter Overby on National Public Radio suggested that car dealers have written over $250 billion in consumer loans and have real ties with Wall Street.

In the post-Keynesian vision, an exit from economic crises requently requires increased demand, specifically through public expenditure and employment.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of high {{interest}} rates for borrowed capital and <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the structural development of four European regions. The method used is the model AgriPoliS which is a spatial-dynamic agent-based model. It is able to provide aggregated results at the regional level, but very individual results as well by considering farms as independent entities. Farms can choose between different investment options during the simulation. Several scenarios with different interest rates for borrowed capital {{on the one hand}} as well as with different levels of <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the other hand are tested and compared. Results show that higher interest rates have less impact on declining production branches than on expanding ones. If they have the possibility farms invest in the most profitable production branch which relative profitability might have changed with high interest rates. <b>Credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> lead farms to choose smaller and cheaper investments than expensive and large ones. Results also show that income losses in both cases due to under-investment compared to the reference situation are partially compensated by lower rental prices. The impacts on structural change also differ depending on the region and the initial situation. In summary, credit subsidies or imperfections on credit markets might have indirect impacts on the type of dominant investment and therefore on the whole regional agricultural sector as well...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the key policy instruments {{to be monitored}} {{in order to avoid}} output collapse in the short run for developing countries that come under the IMF-supported adjustment programmes. Changes in exchange rate and aggregate domestic credit are the standard instruments in a Fund-supported policy package used to target balance of payments (BOP) improvement and inflation reduction. Within a small macroeconometric policy-oriented model of India, this paper carries out optimal control exercises to obtain optimal policies for desired targets. The analysis thus carried out indicates that demand contraction based on domestic <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> leads to improvement in the BOP and reduction in inflation rather than increased output. This paper suggests using instruments such as credit flow to the private sector on the monetary side, and public spending on basic infrastructure on the fiscal side, so as to make adjustment programmes growth-oriented even in the short term. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} shows {{how to use}} a {{simulation}} approach to quantify the effects of making a futures market available on adopting farmers ’ behavior and welfare, and its impact on market variables such as spot prices. Relevant constraints often faced by commodity producers, such as <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> or lack of markets for staple crops, are explicitly considered. Aggregate market effects associated with the adoption of futures by a group of producers are also incorporated. Under the chosen parameterizations, futures availability affects various aspects of adopters ’ behavior. Futures availability renders consumers better off and non-adopting producers worse off. Farmers who adopt futures gain if their market share is small, but lose if their market share is large. However, the magnitudes of adopters ’ gains or losses are quite small, especially when compared to the welfare effects resulting from alternative changes in the market environment faced by farmers, such as the relaxation of <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> or the opening of a market for food crops. The impact of making futures available on the spot market is quite modest, regardless of whether the share of adopters is small or large...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} degree to which Colombian firms face <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> that alter their {{investment}} decisions. It analyzes whether the evolution of the financial sector during the 1990 s, characterized by an intense financial liberalization, an increase in size and a deepening of the activity, reduced the <b>credit</b> <b>restrictions</b> faced by firms and stimulated investment. The paper also explores whether, on the contrary, financial restrictions intensified during the recent 1998 - 2000 crisis. The paper provides empirical evidence suggesting that Colombian firms are indeed restricted by external resources and are compelled to resort to internal resources. The paper demonstrates that financial liberalization and the greater credit availability reduced such restrictions, and that the financial crisis had a strong and negative effect on investment and its financing. It compares the behavior of different groups of firms: (i) firms belonging to conglomerates vs. non-conglomerates, and (ii) firms with direct foreign investment vs. domestic firms. It shows that both groups face fewer financial restrictions and that they benefited less from financial liberalization. Finally, the paper evaluates the effects of indebtedness; the results suggest firms acquire debt before investing and/or that the acquired debt in the past serves as a sign of good credit history for the acquisition of new resources. ...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{literature}} has revealed {{the existence of}} some biases {{in the identification of}} the linkage between the supply of credit and aggregate output in periods of financial turbulence. From this perspective, when a banking crisis occurs a contraction of credit offered by banks generally happens, accompanied by a slowdown in economic activity. In these circumstances, there are different directions of causality that explain the coexistence of these two fundamental phenomena, the credit contraction and the economic slowdown. Throughout the analysis of 76 episodes of systemic banking crises, we research for the main determinants and effects which interested with different intensity 54 countries, in terms of <b>credit</b> <b>restriction</b> and economic slowdown. Evidence obtained from the analysis, by considering different components of demand and supply of credit during financial crises, lead us to significant findings, supporting the hypothesis that, under specific circumstances, credit contraction during financial crises is more to be ascribed to the reduction of credit demand from household and enterprises, rather than to a voluntary reduction of credit from banks. © 2012 The Clute Institute...|$|R
