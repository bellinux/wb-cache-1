6000|$|They started {{next morning}} cheerfully enough, and {{for three hours}} or more paddled easily up the glassy and windless reaches, between two green flower-bespangled walls of forest, gay with innumerable birds and insects; while down from the {{branches}} which overhung the stream long trailers hung to the water's edge, and seemed admiring in the clear mirror the images of their own gorgeous flowers. River, trees, flowers, birds, insects,--it was all a fairy-land: {{but it was a}} colossal one; and yet the voyagers took little note of it. It was now to them an everyday occurrence, to see trees full two hundred feet high one mass of yellow or purple blossom to the highest twigs, and every branch and stem one hanging garden of crimson and orange orchids or vanillas. Common to them were all the fantastic and enormous shapes with which Nature bedecks her robes beneath the fierce suns and fattening rains of the tropic forest. Common were forms and colors of bird, and fish, and butterfly, more strange and bright than ever opium-eater dreamed. The long processions of monkeys, who kept pace with them along the tree-tops, and proclaimed their wonder in every imaginable whistle, and grunt, and howl, had ceased to move their laughter, as much as the roar of the jaguar and the rustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear; and when a brilliant green and rose-colored fish, flat-bodied like a bream, flab-finned like a salmon, and saw-toothed like a shark, leapt <b>clean</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> of the canoe to escape the rush of the huge alligator (whose loathsome snout, ere he could stop, actually rattled against the canoe within a foot of Jack Brimblecombe's hand), Jack, instead of turning pale, as he had done at the sharks upon a certain memorable occasion, coolly picked up the fish, and said, [...] "He's four pound weight! If you can catch 'pirai' for us like that, old fellow, just keep in our wake, and we'll give you the cleanings for wages." ...|$|E

Ere long the fish were <b>cleaned,</b> packed, put <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the steamer and off to market.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of the cabin atmosphere aboard spacecraft is critical not only to its habitability but also to its function. Ideally, air quality can be maintained by striking a proper balance between the generation and removal of contaminants. Both very dynamic processes, the balance between generation and removal {{can be difficult to}} maintain and control because the state of the cabin atmosphere is in constant evolution responding to different perturbations. Typically, maintaining a <b>clean</b> cabin environment <b>on</b> <b>board</b> crewed spacecraft and space habitats is the central function of the environmental control and life support (ECLS) system. While active air quality control equipment is deployed <b>on</b> <b>board</b> every vehicle to remove carbon dioxide, water vapor, and trace chemical components from the cabin atmosphere, perturbations associated with logistics, vehicle construction and maintenance, and ECLS system configuration influence the resulting cabin atmospheric quality. The air-quality data obtained from the International Space Station (ISS) and NASA-Mir programs provides a wealth of information regarding the {{maintenance of}} the cabin atmosphere aboard long-lived space habitats. A comparison of the composition of the trace chemical contaminant load is presented. Correlations between ground-based and in-flight operations that influence cabin atmospheric quality are identified and discussed, and observations on cabin atmospheric quality during the NASA-Mir expeditions and the International Space Station are explored...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} where bill of lading {{can be used as}} carrier's receipt for goods. The first is <b>on</b> <b>board</b> bill of lading, also known as clean bill of lading. Clean bill of lading is used when there is no {{discrepancy}} between description filled by shipper and the actual goods shipped <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> <b>Clean</b> bill of lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the carrier's ship according to the prima facie evidence. If the carrier finds out that the bill of lading is different from goods <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> one can provide contradictory evidence <b>on</b> <b>clean</b> bill of lading. It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier, but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party, it cannot be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy. The second is claused bill of lading. Claused bill of lading is used when there is some discrepancy between description in the bill of lading and the actual goods. For claused bill of lading, one can mark only when the goods are loaded.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that {{different}} financial environments would affect the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the various functions provided by bankers on board: monitoring, expertise and (or) certification. During the two years of research period, we plan to analyze empirically the relationships between bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s debt ratio and loan terms in order to clarify the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for global banks. First, since the firm』s debt ratio is an endogenous variable and would interact with bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> we will employ the simultaneous regression models to estimate the relations between the debt ratio and bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In addition, the estimation will be further divided into some regressions with different dependent variables, including the lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> non-lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> insurance companies <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> investment banks <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> other investors <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> to detail and compare their relations with the firm』s debt ratio. Finally, we also expect to explore the effects of the tenure of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s financial distress on the role of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> For the first year, the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s borrowing terms will be analyzed, and we plan to investigate how bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> influence the firm』s debt ratio in the second year of this research project. 許多研究指出不同的金融環境會影響銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的角色，本文將嘗試探討在全球國家中，銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種功能：監督、專業評估與（或）認證。在本計畫的兩年時間，我們預計實證分析全球的銀行進入企業董監事會與企業的負債比例以及銀行放款契約條件之間的關係，以釐清銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種可能角色。首先，由於銀行在企業董監事會與企業的負債比例為內生變數且彼此會相互影響，故在方法上將使用聯立迴歸模式（simultaneous regression models）同時考慮企業負債與銀行進入董監事會的關係。此外，本文除了考慮銀行進入企業董監事會之虛擬變數外，也將進一步探討董事銀行比例、非董事銀行比例、保險公司與投資銀行比例、其他投資者比例與企業負債比例之關係，以暸解上述董監事會成員之間的關係是否具有替代或互補關係。最後，本文也預計探討銀行進入企業董監事會的持續時間（tenure）及加入企業財務危機對銀行在董監事會所扮演的角色之影響，因為企業財務危機也可能會影響銀行加入企業董監事會的行為。本研究計畫預計在第一年首先進行銀行在企業董監事會與放款契約條件關係之研究，第二年則將進ㄧ步探討銀行在企業董監事會與企業資本結構之關係...|$|R
