5|$|Boletus aereus, {{the dark}} cep or bronze bolete, {{is a highly}} prized and much sought-after edible {{mushroom}} in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is widely <b>consumed</b> <b>in</b> Spain (Basque Country and Navarre), France, Italy, Greece, and generally throughout the Mediterranean. Described as a new species in 1789 by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard, it {{is closely related to}} several other European boletes, including B.reticulatus, B.pinophilus, and the popular B.edulis. Some populations in North Africa have been classified as a separate species, B.mamorensis, although they are phylogenetically very close.|$|E

Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being <b>consumed</b> <b>in</b> eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E

Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were <b>consumed</b> <b>in</b> fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E

Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food <b>consumed</b> <b>in</b> autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley.
