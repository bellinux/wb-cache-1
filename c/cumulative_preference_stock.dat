The ultra vires assets and borrowings were left to the Silloth company to liquidate: the directors responsible for acquiring assets {{not covered by the}} act of incorporation were treated as having personally bought those assets; they were also to assume personal responsibility for half the borrowing in excess of the amount authorised by the act, the other half to be redeemed by the issue of <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> the dividend on which would be paid from the rent of the line.

40|$|Objective To {{develop new}} {{standardized}} eye tracking based measures and metrics for infants’ gaze dynamics in the face-distractor competition paradigm. Method Eye tracking {{data were collected}} from two samples of healthy 7 -month-old (total n = 45), as well as one sample of 5 -month-old infants (n = 22) in a paradigm with a picture of a face or a non-face pattern as a central stimulus, and a geometric shape as a lateral stimulus. The data were analyzed by using conventional measures of infants’ initial disengagement from the central to the lateral stimulus (i. e., saccadic reaction time and probability) and, additionally, novel measures reflecting infants gaze dynamics after the initial disengagement (i. e., cumulative allocation of attention to the central vs. peripheral stimulus). Results The results showed that the initial saccade away from the centrally presented stimulus is followed by a rapid re-engagement of attention with the central stimulus, leading to <b>cumulative</b> <b>preference</b> for the central stimulus over the lateral stimulus over time. This pattern tended to be stronger for salient facial expressions as compared to non-face patterns, was replicable across two independent samples of 7 -month-old infants, and differentiated between 7 and 5 month-old infants.

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{evidence}} of investors' <b>preference</b> for <b>stocks</b> with lottery- type payoffs documented on the U.

Across 14 markets, lottery- type stocks, characterized by high idiosyncratic skewness, high idiosyncratic volatility and low price, underperform and exhibit a "lottery premium". Fur- thermore, <b>preferences</b> for lottery-type <b>stocks</b> can help to explain the puzzling negative relation between past idiosyncratic volatility and returns, which does not persist after controlling for past extreme positive returns. Examining the relation between national revenues from gambling and "lottery premium" I find that countries featuring higher gambling revenues also exhibit a higher "lottery premium". Overall, the results indicate that lottery preferences might impact investment decisions and stock prices.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>stock</b> {{characteristic}} <b>preferences</b> of active Australian equity managers. We examine the following characteristics: stock price variance, momentum, size, transaction costs, earnings yield, analyst coverage {{and the standard}} deviation of analyst forecasts. In aggregate we find that active managers exhibit <b>preferences</b> for <b>stocks</b> exhibiting high price variance, large market capitalisation, low transaction costs, value-oriented stocks, greater levels of analyst coverage, and stocks with less variability in analyst earnings forecasts. The study also recognises the importance of tracking error in portfolio management by examining <b>stock</b> <b>preferences</b> with respect to both small and large stocks. We find evidence of momentum trading in large stocks, and higher volatility and wider analyst coverage amongst small stocks. Active managers are also evaluated {{on the basis of}} size and investment style. Small investment managers exhibit a <b>preference</b> for <b>stocks</b> with higher volatility and analyst coverage (including consensus of forecasts).

Additionally, we assess the relationship between dimensions of personality and individual preferences in predicting expenditure on these categories.

Households with low risk aversion smooth earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most of them (optimally) never invest in equities.

50|$|In 1858 the Brogdens {{approached}} the Furness Railway {{for a further}} loan as traffic on the U&L had not “come up to expectations”. However the FR insisted that they would only offer a loan if the U&L was sold to them so Brogdens declined this offer. In 1859-1860 the line began to pay its way. It was rumoured that the line would be sold to the London and North Western Railway and in 1862 an agreement was made between the shareholders of the U&L and Furness. U&L shareholders received 5% <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> in the Furness Railway {{in return for their}} U&L shares, not a very large return considering that they had risked losing the money altogether. This railway link was critical to the later industrial development of Barrow-in-Furness and its locality and mining interests.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal international {{portfolio choice}} when equity market linkages increase {{during periods of}} distress and investors are averse to disappointing outcomes. I propose a model that captures the joint effect of these two phenomena and show that it leads to a first-order effect on the optimal portfolios. Even during correlated downturns, international diversification is still highly valuable in utility terms. However, including return predictability significantly increases the attractiveness of US stocks and can create substantial home bias in more favorable states of the economy. Furthermore, the model can help rationalize the empirically documented use of “returnchasing” strategies and creates significant intertemporal hedging demands {{even in the absence}} of return predictability. An expected utility model cannot replicate the results merely by increasing curvature because the effective degree of risk aversion is strongly regime dependent.

50|$|The East Somerset Railway was not {{a success}} in {{financial}} terms, {{and after a few}} years the possibility of a sale to the wealthy Great Western Railway was being considered. The East Somerset valued its line at £87,138, but the GWR was unwilling to pay that price for an unsuccessful railway. The GWR was planning to convert the gauge of the former Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth line to standard gauge, and gave notice to the East Somerset in January 1874 that it would do so in May. The ESR directors could hardly have been surprised at this development, but it meant that they too would have to convert the gauge of their line. The cost of that would be £7,390, money that they did not have. The ESR now had no alternative to selling to the GWR, which they did for GWR <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> valued at £67,442.

50|$|For a decade, {{there had}} been talk of the Sirhowy Railway being {{acquired}} {{by one of the}} neighbouring concerns. In November 1873 the Monmouthshire Railway approached the Sirhowy with an offer to buy their concern for £295,000. Negotiations continued in 1874, and then it appeared certain that the Great Western Railway would conclude a deal. The GWR promoted a Parliamentary Bill in the 1875 session for a new line connecting Nine Mile Point and Caerleon, so by-passing Newport, which was heavily congested at the time. In fact it was the LNWR which started working trains over the Sirhowy line from 1 July 1875, and on 21 August 1875 a working agreement was concluded; this was enabled by a general clause on the Sirhowy Company’s Act of 1865. Sirhowy Company debentures to the extent of £56,633 were taken on by the LNWR, and Sirhowy ordinary and <b>preference</b> <b>stock</b> was exchanged for an equivalent amount of LNWR interest bearing stock.

40|$|Market {{frictions}} make markets incomplete. Firms' {{equity securities}} {{can help to}} complete markets by offering investors opportunities to invest in assets that are otherwise unavailable or costly to acquire. However, stocks offer {{a substitute for the}} underlying assets only if the firm maintains exposure to the assets. In incomplete markets, investors should display <b>preferences</b> for <b>stocks</b> with high industry exposure, especially when the costs of direct investment in the industry assets are high. We provide evidence that investors display <b>preferences</b> for <b>stocks</b> with high industry exposure based on a robust positive relation between investor interest (turnover, and the number of institutions and mutual funds) and industry exposure. The association is unrelated to levels of diversification. The attraction to industry exposure is greatest in industries in which returns differ significantly from those of the aggregate market portfolio, where the benefits from investing in industry exposed stocks as substitutes for the underlying assets are the greatest. Preferences for industry exposure are most pronounced for transient investors investing based on public information, and sector funds seeking industry exposure. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} use of earnings, forward-looking {{performance}} measures and stock prices in managerial compensation. When the firm's owner and its manager have identical time <b>preferences,</b> the <b>stock</b> price is not useful for motivating the manager, {{as it is a}} noisy aggregation of a forward-looking measure and future earnings. In contrast, when the owner and the manager have conflicting time <b>preferences,</b> the noisy <b>stock</b> price is useful for contracting. If the manager has no access to banking and cannot trade the firm's shares, the timeliness of the stock price dominates the extra risk imposed by its noise. At the same time, forward-looking performance measures (such as customer satisfaction) can induce a desirable allocation of management effort between the short term and long term more efficiently than the stock price can. Forward-looking performance measures and the stock price are thus not direct substitutes in rewarding farsighted effort. ...|$|R
