40|$|The {{autoimmune}} liver pathology {{in childhood}} {{even if it}} have, less epidemiologic importance if comparate with adulthood disease it represents an interesting chapter of hepatic pathology for the pathogenetic problem and therapeutic options. AIH {{can be defined as}} an inflammatory liver disease characterized histologically by a dense mononuclear cell infiltrate in the portal tract and serologically by the presence of non-organ and liver-specific autoantibodies, high transaminases and increased levels of IgG, {{in the absence of a}} known etiology. It usually responds to immunosuppressive treatment, which should be instituted as soon as diagnosis is made. Three types of autoimmune hepatitis have been proposed based on immunoserological markers: type I ANAor ASMA positive, type II LKM 1 positive, type III SLA/LP (soluble liver antigen / liver-pancreas). Our aim is: morphologic and immunohistichemystry study for caratterizzation of Lymphocytic, often lymphoplasmacytic, infiltrates in the liver; histological difference between viral hepatitis and AIH in childhood. We selected a total of 14 children with evident clinical and/or biochemical evidence of liver disease associated with circulating autoantibodies, with averange age between 3 and 14 years,all was derived from pediadric department of University Federico II of Napoli. Ryspectivelly 10 AIH typeI; and 4 AIH type II (LKM 1). For control we have choosed 10 (of patients in childood age) hcv positinve biopsies, for compare, evaluation, and distiction between lymphocyte appraisal among AIH and chronic hepatitis of known cause.

40|$|Cytotoxic CD 4 Th 1 {{cells are}} {{emerging}} as a therapeutically useful T cell lineage that can effectively target tumors, but until now the pathways that govern their differentiation have been poorly understood. We demonstrate that CD 134 (OX 40) costimulation programs naive self- and virus-reactive CD 4 T cells to undergo in vivo differentiation into cytotoxic Th 1 effectors. CD 137 (4 - 1 BB) costimulation maximized clonal expansion and IL- 2 was necessary for cytotoxic Th 1 differentiation. Importantly, the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) was critical for inducing the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>marker</b> granzyme B. CD 134 plus CD 137 dual costimulation also imprinted a cytotoxic phenotype on bystanding CD 4 T cells. Thus, the present study identifies {{for the first time}} a specific costimulatory pathway and an intracellular mechanism relying on Eomes that induces both antigen-specific and bystander cytotoxic CD 4 Th 1 cells. This mechanism might be therapeutically useful since CD 134 plus CD 137 dual costimulation induced CD 4 T cell-dependent tumoricidal function in a mouse melanoma model. ...|$|E

Its presence in CD 8 + T lymphocytes {{is considered to be}} a marker of cytotoxic activity, although there are few data in this regard. In the present work, we analysed the expression of CD 160 in subpopulations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) -specific CD 8 + T cells. Subpopulations were defined by CD 28 and CD 57 expression and exhibited varying degrees of differentiation and cytotoxic potential, as evaluated by the expression of perforin, interferon (IFN) -γ and interleukin (IL) - 7 Rα/CD 127. We included subjects with different intensities of anti-viral immune response. Results showed that the terminally differentiated CD 28 – CD 57 + subset displaying the highest level of perforin expressed CD 160 at a level similar to that of memory CD 28 + CD 57 –perforin– cells. A comparison of the expression of perforin in CD 160 + cells versus CD 160 – cells showed that expression was significantly higher in the absence of CD 160. Interestingly, the CMV-specific CD 8 + T cell subset from a patient with ongoing CMV reactivation did not begin to express CD 160 until day + 92 of the follow-up period. Taken together, our data show that CD 160 cannot be considered a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>marker</b> in CMV-specific CD 8 + T cells...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Drugs can induce {{different}} immunologic reactions; T-cell mediated responses {{produce the}} most severe reactions. Although in vitro studies show that T cells recognize drugs or their metabolites and induce an effector cytotoxic response, direct in vivo evidence of involvement is lacking. T lymphocytes produce <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> {{that are responsible for}} 2 major pathways to cell death: granule-mediated exocytosis (perforin and granzyme B) and Fas/FasL interaction. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to establish the role of proinflammatory TNF-alpha and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> in subjects with delayed responses to drugs. METHODS: We assessed expression levels by quantitative-competitive PCR of TNF-alpha, perforin, granzyme B, and FasL in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and blister fluid from subjects with delayed reactions to drugs. Samples were obtained within 24 hours of the reaction and 30 days later. Fifteen patients were included and classified according to severity of the reaction, as follows: (A) maculopapular exanthema, (B) desquamative exanthema, (C) Stevens-Johnson syndrome, (D) toxic epidermal necrolysis. RESULTS: At the acute stage, there was a large increase in TNF-alpha (9 -fold), perforin (6 -fold), and GrB (7 -fold) in patients in comparison with control subjects. FasL was expressed in PBMCs only in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. A high association between <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> and disease severity was seen (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: our data show that TNF-alpha, perforin, GrB, and FasL are increased in the early stage of disease, suggesting that a cytotoxic mechanism might be taking part. These findings support the role of T cells in allergic drug reactions and provide further clues pertaining to therapeutic interventions...|$|R
40|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the expression of}} several <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers,</b> killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), CD 94 /CD 159, CD 314 and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), in 22 CD 3 + lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocyte (LDGL) patients we investigated whether granular lymphocytes (GLs) displayed the phenotype of fully differentiated cytotoxic cells. Our results demonstrate that GLs express a pattern consistent with fully differentiated CTLs. KIRs are expressed only in a fraction of patients (7 / 22), as is CD 94 /CD 159 (5 / 22). In conclusion, GLs in CD 3 + LDGL patients typically show the phenotype of fully differentiated CTL, whereas the expression of NK receptors does not represent a common feature of the proliferating clon...|$|R
40|$|To define {{further the}} {{characteristics}} of CD 8 + cells in skin lesions of CD 3 + CD 4 + mycosis fungoides (MF), the authors used single- and double-label immunohistologic techniques and in situ hybridization to detect antigens and transcripts associated with certain types of cytotoxic or suppressor function. The <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> included CD 16, CD 56, CD 57, and an anti-sense probe for human Hanukah factor (HuHf) mRNA. Analysis of 23 cases demonstrated that lesional CD 8 + cells were CD 3 + T cells that generally lacked expression {{of any of the}} <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> studied. Analysis of another 10 cases confirmed the CD 3 + T-cell lineage of lesional CD 8 + cells and demonstrated that these cells also lacked expression of the suppressor-associated marker, CD 11 b. In aggregate, these results indicate that most CD 8 + cells in CD 3 + CD 4 + MF skin lesions are of T-cell rather than NK-cell differentiation. Their overall phenotype suggests that they may be major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted cytotoxic T cells lacking appreciable levels of HuHF serine protease. Because the induction of CD 8 + suppressor T cells is mediated by CD 4 + T cells expressing the CD 45 RA+ RO- phenotype, CD 45 epitope expression was studied in 15 MF cases. The vast majority (13 / 15) contained CD 3 + CD 4 + tumor cells that were CD 45 + RA- RB+ RO+ 2 B 11 +. This phenotype is consistent with memory T cells rather than suppressor-inducer T cells, and correlates with the paucity of phenotypically defined suppressor T cells in CD 3 + CD 4 + MF skin lesions...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} cancer related deaths in the U. S., with African-Americans having higher {{incidence}} and mortality rates than Caucasian-Americans. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes provide protection to patients with colon cancer while patients deficient in these responses have significantly worse prognosis. To determine if differences in cytotoxic immunity might play a role in racial disparities in colorectal cancer 258 microsatellite-stable colon tumors were examined for infiltrating immune biomarkers via immunohistochemistry. Descriptive summary statistics were calculated using two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests, while linear regression models with log-transformed data were used to assess differences in race and Pearson and Spearman correlations were used to correlate different biomarkers. The association between different biomarkers was also assessed using linear regression after adjusting for covariates. No significant differences were observed in CD 8 + (p = 0. 83), CD 57 + (p = 0. 55), and IL- 17 -expressing (p = 0. 63) cell numbers within the tumor samples tested. When infiltration of granzyme B+ cells was analyzed, however, a significant difference was observed, with African Americans having lower infiltration of cells expressing this <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>marker</b> than Caucasians (p< 0. 01). Analysis of infiltrating granzyme B+ cells at the invasive borders of the tumor revealed an even greater difference by race (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Poster session: ImmunologyRecent {{evidence}} shows that polyfunctional CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines simultaneously are the protective immune correlates of different viral infections. Here, we developed a novel 9 -color flow cytometric assay for analysis of virusspecific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses to EBV infection. Overlapping peptide pools of four EBV latent proteins (EBNA 1, EBNA 3 A, EBNA 3 B and LMP 2) and one lytic protein (BZLF 1) were used to stimulate {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) of ten healthy Chinese EBV-seropositive long term carriers. After 6 -hour stimulation by the peptides, PBMCs were stained sequentially by aqua blue dye (for exclusion of dead cells) and antibodies to surface markers (CD 3 -APC-Cy 7, CD 4 -PE-Texas Red and CD 8 -Pacific Blue), <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>marker</b> (CD 107 a-PE-Cy 5) and cytokines (interferon-g [IFN-g]-FITC, interleukin- 2 [IL- 2]-APC, macrophage inhibitory protein 1 -a [MIP 1]-a-PE and tumour necrosis factor-a [TNF-a]-PE-Cy 7), and analyzed by an optimized 9 -colour flow cytometric assay using BDFACS LSR-II. Positive (PBMCs stimulated by Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B), negative (unstimulated and unstained PBMCs) and biological (unstimulated but stained PBMCs) controls were included for each study subject. Polyfunctional CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells (defined as those that secrete three or more cytokines) reactive to EBV latent and lytic peptides could be clearly demonstrated in the long term carriers: CD 4 + T cells secrete three (IFN-g, TNF-a and MIP 1 -a) or all four cytokines whereas CD 8 + T cells secrete three cytokines (IFN-g, TNF-a and MIP 1 -a) and have a cytotoxic function (CD 107 a expression).

40|$|A three-part {{project was}} devised to {{investigate}} the origins of and potential methods {{to reduce the risk}} of occupational exposure to cytotoxic drugs. The first phase involved researching the current decontamination methods applied in UK hospital pharmacies, which manipulate cytotoxic drugs. The second phase evaluated practical decontamination methods, and the third phase investigated one intervention aimed at reducing or preventing contamination occurring in an isolator. A questionnaire was sent out to ASU managers in NHS hospital pharmacies to gain information about the disinfection and decontamination procedures and products used. The practical decontamination methods investigated were mechanical removal and degradation by detergents (pH range from 1. 7 - 13. 2) and cleaning agents, and degradation by vaporised hydrogen peroxide. Analytical methods were developed and validated to recover and quantify the amount of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>marker</b> drug remaining after the decontamination tests carried out in phase two, and to recover and quantify cytotoxic surface contamination from various surfaces in phase three of this work. This composed an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-system e. g. PhaSeal® device for fluid-transfer, in reducing contamination produced from the compounding of cytotoxic drugs in an isolator. The detergents and cleaning agents were effective in removing or reducing cytotoxic surface contamination. Alkaline detergents caused degradation of doxorubicin (maximum 81 % at pH 13. 2 after 1 hour exposure); the other detergents tested did not xi x degrade the cytotoxic drugs investigated. Exposure to vaporised hydrogen peroxide (1. 6 g min- 1 for 2 hours) caused the degradation of cyclophosphamide (98. 9 %), 5 -Fluorouracil (29. 3 %), doxorubicin (71. 0 %) and epirubicin (65. 9 %) when exposed in pharmaceutical diluents. The closed-system (PhaSeal®) device was effective in reducing contamination produced in an isolator from the compounding of cytotoxic drugs. The risk posed by handling and manipulation of cytotoxic drugs and products to the operator and the environment may be reduced, if not eliminated by considering additional approaches to the methods already in place. Firstly, the application of effective decontamination methods; and secondly, by using an effective closed-system, for example the PhaSeal® drug transfer device in a controlled environment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutaneous lymphomas {{expressing a}} {{cytotoxic}} or natural killer (NK) cell phenotype represent {{a group of}} lymphoproliferative disorders {{for which there is}} currently much confusion and little consensus regarding the best nomenclature and classification. METHODS: This study analyzes 48 cases of primary cutaneous lymphoma expressing cytotoxic proteins and/or the NK cell marker, CD 56. These cases were collected for a workshop of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force, to better clarify the clinical, morphologic, and phenotypic features of these uncommon tumors. RESULTS: Several categories with different clinical and pathologic features were delineated: 1) aggressive, CD 8 +, epidermotropic, cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma; 2) mycosis fungoides, cytotoxic immunophenotype variant; 3) subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma; 4) NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type; 5) CD 4 +, NK cell lymphoma; 6) blastoid NK cell lymphoma; (7) intravascular NK-like lymphoma; and 8) cytotoxic, peripheral T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that primary cutaneous cytotoxic/NK cell lymphomas include distinct groups of diseases, clinically, histologically, and biologically.

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Extranodal NK/T-cell {{lymphoma}} nasal type is {{a distinct}} clinicopathologic entity. The most common initial site of presentation is the nasopharyngeal area, but non-nasals sites including the skin and the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. AREAS COVERED: The diagnosis and management of NK/T-cell lymphoma is discussed, based on a literature search on PubMed. NK/T-cell lymphoma are typically positive for CD 3 (cytoplasmic), CD 56, <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> (granzyme B, TIA 1) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Plasma EBV DNA is an accurate surrogate biomarker for lymphoma load. For stage I/II nasal lymphoma, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy yields the best results. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy and sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy give similar response rates and survivals. For stage III/IV nasal lymphoma and non-nasal lymphomas, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Conventional anthracycline-based regimens are ineffective. Recommended chemotherapy protocols {{are based on the}} use of L-asparaginase combined with other effective drugs. Durable remission can be expected in at least 60 % of patients irrespective of stage.

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{cells are}} {{considered}} crucial for antitumor immunity and their induction is {{the aim of}} various immunotherapeutic strategies. High frequencies of tumor-specific CD 8 + T cells alone, however, are no guarantee for long-term tumor control. Here, we analyzed the functionality of tumor-specific CD 8 + T cells in melanoma patients upon dendritic cell vaccination by measuring multiple T cell effector functions considered crucial for anticancer immunity, including the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> (IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL- 2, CCL 4, CD 107 a).

40|$|Nonimmediate {{allergic}} reactions (NIRs) to drugs, {{which are the}} most common reactions induced by specifi c immunologic mechanisms, can be induced by all commercially available drugs. NIRs can appear hours, days, or even weeks after drug intake. They elicit a spectrum of manifestations, mostly affecting the skin, ranging from maculopapular exanthema and urticaria to other less common but more severe entities such as acute generalized exanthematic pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The main pathologic event involved in NIRs is a T-cell effector response and the wide heterogeneity of clinical symptoms may refl ect differences in the underlying immunologic mechanisms. Despite their clinical heterogeneity, NIRs share certain aspects such as the activation of T cells with increased expression of CD 25 and HLA-DR.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{generally}} accepted that emphysematous lungs {{are characterized by}} an increase in the numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and CD 8 + T lymphocytes, the lasts having increased cytotoxic activity. Because systemic inflammation is also a component of emphysema, we hypothesize that peripheral CD 8 + T lymphocytes of emphysematous smokers who show evidence of systemic inflammation will have higher expression of cytotoxic molecules. Methods We assessed parameters of systemic inflammation in normal individuals (smokers or non-smokers) and in emphysematous subjects with an active smoking history by measuring serum interleukine- 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor. Expression of perforin, granzyme B, and FasL protein by CD 8 + T lymphocytes, CD 4 + T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells were assessed by flow cytometry while perforin, granzyme B, and FasL mRNA expression were measured on purified systemic CD 8 + T lymphocytes by real-time PCR. Results Emphysematous smokers had higher levels of serum interleukine- 6 than normal subjects. Even with the presence of systemic inflammation in emphysematous smokers, the percentage of peripheral CD 8 + T lymphocytes, CD 4 + T lymphocytes, and NK cells expressing perforin and granzyme B protein was not different between the three groups.

40|$|Background Bacterial {{respiratory}} tract infections and exacerbations of chronic lung diseases are commonly caused by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Cell-mediated cytotoxicity may be key to controlling infection, but {{the responses of}} NTHi-specific T cell populations are not well understood. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a recently-discovered, innate-like subset of T cells with cytotoxic function, whose role in lung immunity is unclear. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the mechanisms behind conventional T and MAIT cell cytotoxic responses to NTHi. Methods Human ex vivo lung explants were infected with a clinical strain of NTHi. Monocyte-derived macrophages were also infected with NTHi in vitro and co-cultured with autologous T cells. Cytotoxic responses of T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. Results We found significant upregulation of the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers,</b> CD 107 a and granzyme B, in lung CD 4 +, CD 8 + and MAIT cell populations. We show that MAIT cell cytotoxic responses were upregulated by a combination of both time-dependent antigen presentation and through a novel mechanism by which IL- 12 and IL- 7 synergistically control granzyme B through upregulation of the IL- 12 receptor. Conclusions Overall our data provide evidence for a cytotoxic role of MAIT cells in the lung and highlight important differences in the control of adaptive and innate-like T cell responses. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic opportunities to modulate the anti-bacterial response and improve clinical outcome. <br/...|$|R

40|$|During {{the innate}} immune {{response}} against infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells {{are as important}} effector cells as are Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated after antigenic stimulation in the adaptative response. NK cells increase in numbers, after viral infection or vaccination. We investigated the NK cell and CD 8 T lymphocyte status in 55 dengue infected patients. The NK (CD 56 +CD 3 −) and CD 56 + T cell (CD 56 +CD 3 +) rates rise during the acute phase of disease. The majority of NK cells from dengue patients display early markers for activation (CD 69, HLA-DR, and CD 38) and cell adhesion molecules (CD 44, CD 11 a) during the acute phase of disease. The intracellular cytotoxic granule, TIA- 1, is also up-regulated early in NK cells. Most of these markers appear also on CD 8 + T lymphocytes but during the late acute phase.

The hypothesis of leprosy {{was supported by the}} clinical and initial hystopathological findings and the patient was referred to our hospital with suspected Hansen's disease. In the new skin and lymph node biopsies a lymphocyte population was identified whose immunohystochemistry study allowed the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma with expression of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers.</b> The patient was started on chemotherapy with initial remission of the skin lesions but, subsequently, progression of systemic disease.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{harbours}} {{different types}} of DNA alterations, including microsatellite instability (MSI). Cancers {{with high levels of}} MSI (MSI-H) are considered to have a good prognosis, probably related to lymphocyte infiltration within tumours. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterise the intratumoural expression of markers associated with the antitumour immune response in mismatch repair (MMR) -proficient (MSS) colon cancers. METHODS: Ninety human colon cancers (T) and autologous normal colon mucosa (NT) were quantified for the expression of 15 markers of the immune response with quantitiative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). mRNA expression levels were correlated with MMR status. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using both interleukin 17 (IL 17) and CD 3 antibodies. RESULTS: Expression of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> (FasL, granzyme B and perforin), inflammatory cytokines (IL 1 beta, IL 6, IL 8, IL 17 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)) and a marker of regulatory T cells (forkhead box P 3 (Foxp 3)) was significantly higher in tumours than in autologous normal tissues. Adjusting for MMR status, higher tumoural expression of both granzyme B and perforin was associated with the MSI-H phenotype, and the perforin T/NT ratio was higher in MSI-H tissues than in MSS tissues. Higher tumoural expression of Foxp 3, IL 17, IL 1 beta, IL 6 and TGFbeta was associated with the MSS phenotype, and the IL 17 T/NT ratio was higher in MSS tissues than in MSI-H tissues as assessed by both qRT-PCR and IHC. CONCLUSIONS: Immune gene expression profiling in CRC displayed different patterns according to MMR status. Higher Foxp 3, IL 6, TGFbeta and IL 17 expression is a particular determinant in MMR-proficient CRC. These may be potential biomarkers for a new prognostic "test set" in sporadic CRCs...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) is {{the second}} {{worldwide}} {{leading cause of death}} from an infectious disease after HIV infection. Protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains poorly understood and the role of Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cells is controversial. We performed comprehensive functional and phenotypic characterizations of Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cell responses in 273 subjects with either latent Mtb infection (LTBI) or active TB disease (TB) to assess their profile and relevance in TB. Materials and methods: Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we assessed Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cell functional (production of IFNgamma, IL- 2 and TNF-alpha; proliferation capacity and cytotoxicity) and phenotypic (T-cell differentiation and exhaustion) profiles in cells isolated from peripheral blood and correlated these profiles with distinct clinical presentations. Results: Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cells were detected in most TB patients and few LTBI subjects (65 % and 15 %, respectively; P < 0. 00001) and were of similar magnitude with a comparable cytokines profile (IFNg+TNFa+IL 2 -) in both groups. Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cells were mostly TEMRA (CD 45 RA+ CCR 7 -) co-expressing 2 B 4 and CD 160 in LTBI subjects and mostly TEM (CD 45 RA-CCR 7 -) lacking PD- 1 / CD 160 / 2 B 4 in TB patients. Furthermore, Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cells mostly expressed very little perforin and granulysin but contained granzymes A and B or lacked all these <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> in TB and LTBI subjects, respectively. However, in vitro expanded Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cells acquired perforin, granulysin and granzymes. Finally, Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cell responses were more robust and prone to proliferate in patients with extrapulmonary compared to pulmonary TB. Conclusions: The clinical status and TB presentation are associated to specific profiles of Mtb-specific CD 8 T-cell responses, thus indicating distinct dynamics between the mycobacteria, the CD 8 T-cell response and the clinical outcome. Our data shed light on the controversial reached by studies performed in human and animal models, thus advancing the current knowledge on the complex dynamic of TB immunity...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemokine}} RANTES is secreted rapidly after {{activation of}} human CD 8 + T cells, with a cycloheximide-resistant burst {{during the first}} hour. This pattern was observed in purified memory and effector phenotype CD 8 + cells from blood {{as well as in}} blasts. In contrast, secretion of other chemokines and interferon-γ by these cells was sensitive to cycloheximide and detectable only after a lag. Immunofluorescence microscopy of CD 8 + memory and effector cells and blasts showed RANTES present in intracellular vesicles that do not significantly colocalize with <b>cytotoxic</b> granule <b>markers</b> or other markers of defined cytoplasmic compartments. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that RANTES is stored in small vesicles distinct from the lysosomal secretory granules. RANTES+ vesicles polarize rapidly in response to TcR engagement and are more rapidly depleted from the cytoplasm. These results show that CD 8 + T cells have two distinct TcR-regulated secretory compartments characterized by different mobilization kinetics, effector molecules, and biological function...|$|R

We performed a longitudinal study on viral loads and T cell functions in six PTLD patients (two boys and four girls) up to 5 years after diagnosis. Median age at diagnosis was 2. 4 years (range: 0. 8 - 5. 2 years). Primary disease was congenital biliary atresia with a median age of transplantation at 0. 6 years (range: 0. 5 - 1. 3 years). Median time from date of transplantation to diagnosis of PTLD was 1. 3 years (range: 0. 3 - 4. 7 years). All patients were seronegative towards EBV prior to transplantation and were maintained {{on a range of}} tacrolimus doses for immunosuppression. Three patients entered continual clinical remission after one course of rituximab while two patients had relapsed disease and one had persistent lymphocytosis requiring additional treatment with second course of rituximab or chemotherapy to enter clinical remission. Plasma EBV loads were determined by qPCR. Despite entering clinical remission, persistently elevated plasma loads were found in 4 of 6 patients indicating suboptimal long-term viral control. Two patients were selected for longitudinal profiling of EBV latent cycle and lytic cycle antigen-specific polyfunctional T-cell (PFC) responses from 1 - 4 years after PTLD diagnosis. Upon stimulation by overlapping peptides of EBNA 1, EBNA 3 a/ 3 b/ 3 c and BZLF 1, the production of three cytokines (IFN-, TNF-, IL- 2) and expression of two <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> (perforin, CD 107 a) were examined. Although CD 4 + and CD 8 + PFC responses could be detected at 3 years after diagnosis, the PFCs were predominantly perforinnegative and the proportion of PFCs with three-five functions was low ranging from 0 - 3 percent of total antigen-responsive T-cells. Long-term viral control is suboptimal concurrent with slow development of EBV-specific PFC responses signifying the continual risk of re-emergence of PTLD in this cohort of young PTLD patients...|$|R
40|$|T {{regulatory}} cells (Tregs) {{have been}} extensively studied {{in patients with}} cancer or autoimmunity. These cells hamper the immune system’s ability to clear tumor cells in cancer patients. In autoimmune diseases, on the other hand, they {{are not able to}} restrain autoreactive immune responses. If we manage to understand Tregs and their role in health and diseases {{we may be able to}} develop better immunomodulatory therapies. Early studies demonstrated that tolerance was maintained by a subset of CD 25 + T-cells. CD 25 was the earliest marker for Tregs and is still often used to define these cells. Several Treg-associated markers have been suggested throughout the years. However, these markers can be upregulated by activated T-cells as well. The most specific marker for Tregs is currently the transcription factor forkhead box P 3 (FoxP 3). In this thesis, we investigated the presence of CD 25 - Tregs in patients with B-cell malignancies and in patients with autoimmunity. These cells were identified in both patient groups. Further, patients with B-cell malignancies often have high levels of soluble CD 25 (sCD 25) in the periphery. In our patient cohorts, the level of peripheral Tregs correlated with the level of sCD 25 in patients with lymphoma. Tregs were shown to release sCD 25 in vitro and sCD 25 had a suppressive effect on T-cell proliferation. These data show that Tregs may release CD 25 to hamper T-cell proliferation and that this may be an immune escape mechanism in cancer patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that an increased infiltration of FoxP 3 + cells into lymphoma-affected lymph nodes is associated with a better patient outcome. This is in contrast to studies from non-hematological cancers where an increased presence of Tregs is associated with a poor prognosis. Since previous studies have shown that Tregs are able to kill B-cells, we wanted to investigate if Tregs are cytotoxic in patients with B-cell tumors. In the subsequent studies, Tregs from patients with B-cell lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were phenotyped to investigate the presence of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>markers</b> on these cells. FoxP 3 -expressing T-cells from both patients with CLL and B-cell lymphoma displayed signs of cytotoxicity by upregulation of FasL and the degranulation marker CD 107 a. Tregs from CLL patients could further kill their autologous B-cells in in vitro cultures. Taken together the studies in this thesis have demonstrated two possible new functions of Tregs in patients with B-cell malignancies and the presence of CD 25 - Tregs in both cancer and autoimmunity...|$|R
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTLs) {{that cause}} {{type 1 diabetes}} are activated in draining lymph nodes and become concentrated as fully active CTLs in inflamed pancreatic islets. It is unclear whether CTL function is driven by signals received in the lymph node or also in the inflamed tissue. We studied whether the development of cytotoxicity requires further activation in islets. Autoreactive CTLs found in the islets of diabetes-prone NOD mice had acquired much higher expression of the <b>cytotoxic</b> effector <b>markers</b> granzyme B, interferon γ, and CD 107 a than had those in the pancreatic lymph node (PLN). Increased expression seemed to result from stimulation in the islet itself. T cells held up from migrating from the PLN by administration of the sphingosine- 1 -phosphate agonist FTY 720 did not increase expression of cytotoxic molecules in the PLN. Stimulation did not require antigen presentation or cytokine secretion by the target β cells {{because it was not}} affected by the absence of class I major histocompatibility complex expression or by the overexpression of suppressor of cytokine signaling- 1. Activation of CD 40 -expressing cells stimulated increased CTL function and β-cell destruction, suggesting that signals derived from CD 40 -expressing cells promote the acquisition of cytotoxicity in the islet environment. These data provide in vivo evidence that stimulation of cytotoxic effector molecule expression occurs in inflamed islets and is independent of β cells...|$|R
40|$|Induction of an antigenically {{broad and}} {{vigorous}} primary T-cell immune response by myeloid dendritic cells (DC) {{in blood and}} tissues could be important for an effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Here we show that a primary CD 8 + T-cell response can be induced by HIV- 1 peptide-loaded DC derived from blood monocytes of HIV- 1 -negative adults and neonates (moDC) and by Langerhans cells (LC) and interstitial, dermal-intestinal DC (idDC) derived from CD 34 + stem cells of neonatal cord blood. Optimal priming of single-cell gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production by CD 8 + T cells required CD 4 + T cells and was broadly directed to multiple regions of Gag, Env, and Nef that corresponded to known and predicted major histocompatibility complex class I epitopes. Polyfunctional CD 8 + T-cell responses, defined as single-cell production {{of more than one}} cytokine (IFN-γ, interleukin 2, or tumor necrosis factor alpha), chemokine (macrophage inhibitory factor 1 β), or <b>cytotoxic</b> degranulation <b>marker</b> CD 107 a, were primed by moDC, LC, and idDC to HIV- 1 Gag and reverse transcriptase epitopes, as well as to Epstein-Barr virus and influenza A virus epitopes. Thus, three major types of blood and tissue myeloid DC targeted by HIV- 1, i. e., moDC, LC, and idDC, can prime multispecific, polyfunctional CD 8 + T-cell responses to HIV- 1 and other viral antigens...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{infected}} with Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness and {{a contributor to}} nagana in cattle, rapidly lose the capacity to mount VSG-specific antibody responses, and die with uncontrolled parasitemia. We have shown (Bockstal et al., 2011, PLOS Pathogens) {{that the loss of}} humoral immune competence in the infected mice results from depletion of developing and mature splenic B cells. We now report that T. brucei-induced splenic B cell depletion is dependent upon the presence of the pore forming molecule perforin which is present in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer T cells and natural killer cells, occurs in the absence of T cells (and natural killer T cells), i. e., in T cell receptor (αβγδ) -/- mice, but does not occur in intact mice that are depleted of natural killer (NK) cells by treatment with monoclonal antibody specific for the NK 1. 1 differentiation antigen. In the intact mice, B cells are deleted after remission of the first T. brucei parasitemic wave. At this time natural killer cells are expressing the <b>cytotoxic</b> granule <b>marker</b> CD 107 a, indicating that they have degranulated, executing their effector function. Moreover, in vitro assays show that B cells from T. brucei infected mice are killed by natural killer cells from uninfected C 57 BL/ 6 mice but not efficiently killed by CD 107 a positive natural killer cells isolated from infected mice, which may be functionally exhausted...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Immunization {{of healthy}} volunteers by bites from Plasmodium falciparum-infected {{mosquitoes}} during chloroquine chemoprophylaxis (hereafter, chemoprophylaxis and sporozoites [CPS] immunization) induces sterile protection against malaria. CPS-induced protection is mediated by immunity against pre-erythrocytic stages, presumably {{at least partially}} by cytotoxic cellular responses. We therefore aimed to investigate the association of CPS-induced <b>cytotoxic</b> T-cell <b>markers</b> with protection. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, we performed dose titration of CPS immunization followed by homologous challenge infection in 29 subjects. Immune responses were assessed by in vitro restimulation of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Dose-dependent complete protection was obtained in 4 of 5 volunteers after immunization with bites from 45 P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, in 8 of 9 volunteers with bites from 30, and in 5 of 10 volunteers with bites from 15 (odds ratio [OR], 5. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 5 - 17). Completely protected subjects had significantly higher proportions of CD 4 T cells expressing the degranulation marker CD 107 a (OR, 8. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 123; P =. 011) and CD 8 cells producing granzyme B (OR, 11; 95 % CI, 1. 9 - 212; P =. 004) after P. falciparum restimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These data underline the efficiency of CPS immunization to induce sterile protection and support a possible role for cytotoxic CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell responses in pre-erythrocytic immunity.

40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 8 (HHV- 8) is the etiological {{agent of}} Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. It is postulated that CD 8 + T cell responses {{play an important}} role in controlling HHV- 8 infection and preventing development of disease. In this study, we investigated monofunctional and polyfunctional CD 8 + T cell responses to HHV- 8 lytic proteins gB (glycoprotein B) and K 8. 1 and latency proteins LANA- 1 (latency-associated nuclear antigen- 1) and K 12. On the basis of our previous findings that dendritic cells (DC) reveal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I epitopes in gB, we used a DC-based system to identify 2 novel epitopes in gB, 2 in K 8. 1, 5 in LANA- 1, and 1 in K 12. These new HHV- 8 epitopes activated monofunctional and polyfunctional CD 8 + T cells that produced various combinations of gamma interferon, interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inhibitory protein 1 β, and <b>cytotoxic</b> degranulation <b>marker</b> CD 107 a in healthy HHV- 8 -seropositive individuals. We were also able to detect HHV- 8 -specific CD 8 + T cells in peripheral blood samples using HLA A* 0201 pentamer complexes for one gB epitope, one K 8. 1 epitope, two LANA- 1 epitopes, and one K 12 epitope. These immunogenic regions of viral lytic and latency proteins could be important in T cell control of HHV- 8 infection...|$|R
40|$|The porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) {{is the cause}} {{of one of the most}} economically important diseases affecting swine worldwide. Efforts to develop a next-generation vaccine have largely focused on envelope glycoproteins to target virus-neutralizing antibody responses. However, these approaches have failed to demonstrate the necessary efficacy to progress toward market. T cells are crucial to the control of many viruses through cytolysis and cytokine secretion. Since control of PRRSV infection is not dependent on the development of neutralizing antibodies, it has been proposed that T cell-mediated immunity plays a key role. Therefore, we hypothesized that conserved T cell antigens represent prime candidates for the development a novel PRRS vaccine. Antigens were identified by screening a proteome-wide synthetic peptide library with T cells from cohorts of pigs rendered immune by experimental infections with a closely related (subtype 1) or divergent (subtype 3) PRRSV- 1 strain. Dominant T cell IFN-γ responses were directed against the non-structural protein 5 (NSP 5), and to a lesser extent, the matrix (M) protein. The majority of NSP 5 -specific CD 8 T cells and M-specific CD 4 T cells expressed a putative effector memory phenotype and were polyfunctional as assessed by coexpression of TNF-α and mobilization of the <b>cytotoxic</b> degranulation <b>marker</b> CD 107 a. Both antigens were generally well conserved among strains of both PRRSV genotypes. Thus, M and NSP 5 represent attractive vaccine candidate T cell antigens, which should be evaluated further in the context of PRRSV vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|One of us (F. R.) {{recently}} reported a method {{allowing for the}} long-term culture of normal human T lymphocytes from peripheral blood or bone marrow (1). Exponential proliferative growth was dependent upon {{the addition of a}} T-cell growth factor (TCGF) produced by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes (1, 2). We have used similar methodology and have reported the long-term culture of murine tumor-antigen specific cytotoxie T-cell lines (CTLL) (3). Murine CTLL have remained in culture for over 20 mo during which time they have continued to mediate syngeneic tumor-specific cytotoxic reactivity. Both of the above mentioned observations involving the continuous culture of normal human and differentiated murine CTLL have been confirmed (4, 5). We now report the ability to culture large numbers of human antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in a TCGF-dependent state of sustained exponential proliferation.
