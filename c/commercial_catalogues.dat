30|$|The gall {{extracts}} chromatographic profiles {{are very}} interesting, where HPLC–ESI–MS clearly shows {{the presence of}} a dominant fraction of polygalloyl esters of glucose, Fig.  7. The results obtained from the aqueous solution of commercial tannic acid surprised us, and for that reason, the chromatogram obtained is presented in Fig.  7. We were expecting a maximum of two peaks, corresponding to some fraction of gallic acid and a broad band for the isomers of decagalloylglucoses [39]. Instead, the chromatographic profile is much more complex than the gall extracts obtained following fifteenth to seventeenth centuries recipes. Definitively, commercial tannic acid cannot be described, as depicted in the <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues,</b> as penta-m-digalloyl-glucose (meta-depsidic 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 pentakis-O-digalloyl-β-d-glucopyranose), Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, and it is not suitable for preparing a reference medieval iron-gall ink. As described by Quideau et al. [39], commercial tannic acid is in fact “a complex and varying mixture of different gallotannins and simpler galloylglucoses”. This could have been anticipated as tannic acid is described in literature as being extracted from gall-nuts “by boiling ground-up nuts in acidic aqueous solution” [40]. In the future, we plan to study “true” iron-decagalloylglucoses complexes, but we anticipate it will not be an easy task since these molecular structures equilibrate into meta/para-depsidic isomeric mixtures in solution [39].|$|E

40|$|With {{this review}} article, {{we intend to}} {{demonstrate}} the importance of Computerized Tomography (CT) in healthcare quality and safety. The concept of safety in CT is wider than for general healthcare. Safe healthcare provided using CT must include diagnostic image quality and reliability, as {{this is the only}} way to ensure diagnostic accuracy. The images must be acquired with the most adequate protocols available and with the lowest achievable radiation dose. In this article we will focus primarily on the concepts of dose, since this variable strongly affects the image quality and the consequent diagnostic accuracy. In methodological terms, 73 papers and 6 catalogues issued by the manufacturers of CT equipment, that included the keywords low dose, ultra-low dose and dose reduction were analysed. After review of these articles we found that about 82 % are chest exams, namely the lungs. The remaining were subdivided mainly by studies of the sinuses, heart and bone segments. After this review we selected the only 10 articles that present the keywords and simultaneously quantify the dose reduction. Given the lack of precision associated with these terms, introduced mainly by <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues</b> of different equipment brands, we intend to demonstrate that the concepts low dose and ultra-low dose are wrapped in unclear marketing strategies, without a strict and unambiguous definition of what is the effective dose. We propose that these concepts should be clearly defined and a precise indication of the effective dose reduction value should be compared to the default value (standard diagnostic dose) by exam region. Therefore, it is demonstrated that there is no concrete definition of what low dose or ultra-low dose are. These slogans cannot be used until they are not holistically defined, as well as the correspondent dose reduction value...|$|E

Furthermore, the exponential development that the “WWW” is having, produces a great documentary boom and, at the same time, a better accessibility to the information in every field of the knoledgement. The documentalist, acting as an information manager knows, or should know, the presence of many electronic resources on the web, which will help him in a very quick an efficient way to perform his job, satisfying all the users or clients needs, who might be overwhelmed with such amount of information. Nevetheless, all this boom is affecting all professionals acting in the field of Librarianship and Documentation, where more and more websites to perform this profession can be found. Websites, which most of the times are even unknown by the documentalist, leaving the guides obsolete and insufficient, besides that, they have beeen published by people non related to the Documentary world. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show and to propose a classification, which, based on our own experience, would allow the documentalist, librarian or knowledge manager, to classify the main resources on the web. At the same time, we pretend to show, from our point of view, all the resources, either talking about selection and acquisition of bibliographic materials, as library catalogues, <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues,</b> or data bases, in the “Technique Process” field, as a help on retrieving and diffusion of information, for example the main thesaurus, classifications or indexing tools that are avalaible in the web, as well as the related software, or just the Consortiums and more popular Bibliographic networks, that several organisms and companies provide to their clients or users for the cooperation in every field. 	At last, about the “Document Access”, our aim is to select all the resources or projects available on the “WWW”, like Virtual Libraries, that ease not only the references, but also the own access to the document, as it is the “Gutenberg Project” or the “Cervantes Virtual” project, here in Spain...|$|E
40|$|Accessing 3 D {{geospatial}} models, eventually at no {{cost and}} for unrestricted use, is certainly an important issue as they become popular among participatory communities, consultants, and officials. Various geo-portals, mainly established for 2 D resources, have tried {{to provide access to}} existing 3 D resources such as digital elevation model, LIDAR or classic topographic data. Describing the content of data, metadata is a key component of data discovery in geo-portals. An inventory of seven online geo-portals and <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues</b> shows that the metadata referring to 3 D information is very different from one geo-portal to another as well as for similar 3 D resources in the same geo-portal. The inventory considered 971 data resources affiliated with elevation. 51 % of them were from three geo-portals running at Canadian federal and municipal levels whose metadata resources did not consider 3 D model by any definition. Regarding the remaining 49 % which refer to 3 D models, different definition of terms and metadata were found, resulting in confusion and misinterpretation. The overall assessment of these geo-portals clearly shows that the provided metadata do not integrate specific and common information about 3 D geospatial models. Accordingly, the main objective of this research is to improve 3 D geospatial model discovery in geo-portals by adding a specific metadata-set. Based on the knowledge and current practices on 3 D modeling, and 3 D data acquisition and management, a set of metadata is proposed to increase its suitability for 3 D geospatial models. This metadata-set enables the definition of genuine classes, fields, and code-lists for a 3 D metadata profile. The main structure of the proposal contains 21 metadata classes. These classes are classified in three packages as General and Complementary on contextual and structural information, and Availability on the transition from storage to delivery format. The proposed metadata set is compared with Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) metadata which is an implementation of North American Profile of ISO- 19115. The comparison analyzes the two metadata against three simulated scenarios about discovering needed 3 D geo-spatial datasets. Considering specific metadata about 3 D geospatial models, the proposed metadata-set has six additional classes on geometric dimension, level of detail, geometric modeling, topology, and appearance information. In addition classes on data acquisition, preparation, and modeling, and physical availability have been specialized for 3 D geospatial models...|$|E

40|$|This talk {{concerns}} {{the conception of}} an OAI 1 compliant service that can manage three different digital historical archives maintained by the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. This situation requires careful consideration of interoperability issues related to uniform naming, metadata formats, document models and access protocols for the different data sources. In this talk we will present the design approach for the digital archives federation services to be developed in the Porta Europa Portal (PEP) Pilot Project. The PEP pilot project specialised portal should provide high quality information, selected according to the criteria of originality, accuracy, credibility together with the cultural and political pluralism derived from the EUI's profile. The information in Porta Europa will be: relevant, reliable, searchable and retrievable. To test the feasibility {{and the impact of}} the PEP project the EUI committed itself {{to the development of a}} PEP prototype 2 concerning historic topics. To this extent, among the various available digital historical archives three of them were chosen for the implementation of the pilot. Our approach in solving problems of standardization and interoperability in the PEP pilot project is based on two main issues: Metadata standard (Dublin Core 3) Protocols (OAI-PMH) The PEP (Porta Europa Portal) project refers to the integration of three digital libraries related to European history topics: Voices on Europe, Virtual Library and Biblio library catalogue. Each of these data source is characterized by: a collection of data objects (books, journals, documents, multimedia objects etc.) available locally or through the network a collection of metadata structures a collection of services (access methods, management functions, logging/statistics, etc.) a domain focus (topic) a community of users Of course the need of integrating the three data sources comes from the topic (European history) and users community which are common to all three archives. Voices on Europe; ([URL] Voices on Europe is an archive containing the electronic audio version and electronic transcriptions about a hundred of interviews given by outstanding politician and historians. WWW-VL (Virtual Library) on European History Integration; ([URL] The Virtual Library (VL) is the Web oldest catalogue, conceived by Tim Berners-Lee. Unlike <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues,</b> it is run by a loose confederation of volunteers, who compile pages of relevant links for specific areas in which they are expert. The EUI Library Web site contains the complete list of VLs belonging to the WWW VL History Project in the University of Lawrence/Kansas (USA) and mirrored at the European University Institute's Library. Biblio (the EUI historical archives); ([URL] This is the library catalogue containing more than 250. 000 bibliographic records. Access to resources is supported by INNOPAC, well known Library Automation System. The PEP Pilot Project is being developed according to the following steps: Analysis of the three data resources; in this part we first understand the current situation of the resources and we identify the main issues involved in each case. Each resource is characterised by different issues which are elicited and therefore faced. This phase end with a detailed description of the metadata formats, document models and access protocols for each of the data sources. The analysis revealed the strong points and the weakness of each digital library setting the basis for the definition of a common document description model. Definition of the federation architecture (figure 1); the architecture of our federation service 4 is structured in three layers: the data source layer where all information is stored with autonomy of representation and access interfaces, the adapter layer were special adapters have to be implemented to provide uniform access and transform the data source specific model into the global model of the federated system, and the federation layer which is responsible for global data integration using an on purpose database and is the OAI data provider and the User interface that will be the OAI service provider. Data Source Layer: these are the archives (digital libraries) whose integration we deal with: Voices on Europe, Virtual Library and Biblio library catalogue. Adapter Layer: this layer provides uniform access to the information, hiding the differences in the data models and query interfaces. Here the metadata are translated from the source specific model into the global model of the federated system. The development of this work is the adoption of the Web services technical framework where a standardized mechanism would be used to describe, locate and communicate with each digital library. The main operation of this layer is the "extraction of data". This operation has to be automatic so that each interface has to be implemented specifically for the resource. As instance SQL queries could be used to extract data from some Data sources (Voices on Europe, Virtual Library) and some external tools such as Innopac tools could be used for the catalogue. Federation Layer and User Interface: in this two layers is implemented the OAI-PMH, in details: Data Provider (The Federation layer) Service Provider (The User Interface) Moreover the Federation layer has to describe Metadata of the three different resources in a common standard to allow in a second step to store them in a unique database. To this extent a common metadata format (Meta Resource Card - MRC) must be devised for the three resources. To effectively address the interoperability issue, the Meta Resource Card should follow the unqualified Dublin Core Standard to define the common fields. In the Federation Layer are implemented interoperability functions, the OAI compliant Data Provider, that is the core of pilot project. The User Interface will be OAI compliant Service Provider and it will use OAI harvesting to extract data. In a first period externally implemented interfaces such as Arc 5 could be used as the Service Provider...|$|E

The purpose of the paper is to highlight the multilayered processinvolved in conveying meaning to the “parent-child cluster” consumer through press and onlineadvertisements designed by children’s furniture manufacturers. A corpus of 200 press advertisements and catalogues produced bychildren's furniture manufacturers (particularly IKEA and Gautier) was analysed using a combination ofBarthes’ (1964) visual analysis and Greimas’ (1987) narrative approach to visual discourses. The scenes portrayed to shape the message addressed to the “parent-child cluster“ consumer,suggest that, in addition to fostering positive values such as self-fulfilment and stimulating backgroundfor an active child, they also promote discourses about contemporary childhood and parenthood.

40|$|The {{teaching}} of illustration {{has been an}} important element in the curriculum at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. The Central Saint Martin’s Museum Collection initiated this project, supported by AHRC grants, to present the historical development of illustration and its teaching. Examples from the Museum collection were used to illustrate this project and presented at an exhibition in 2005. The exhibition catalogue, published by The Herbert Press, offered an opportunity to examine this material in detail. My own contribution was to look at the relationship between illustration, publicity and advertising throughout the 20 th century and especially with regard to the transformation of commercial art. The historical development of these relations revealed the significance of lithography as the dominant technology of the commercial print environment during the 20 th century. The special skills of lithographic drawing were shown to be a specialised interaction of drawing skill and technology.
