5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of the Gilded Age New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to Henry's {{religious}} policies {{was quickly}} suppressed in England. A number of dissenting monks, {{including the first}} Carthusian Martyrs, were executed and many more pilloried. The most prominent resisters included John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, both of whom refused to take the oath to the King. Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought to have the men executed; rather, they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as supreme head of the Church, but More was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> openly breaking the Treason Act, which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however – More on the evidence of a single conversation with Richard Rich, the Solicitor General. Both were duly executed {{in the summer of}} 1535.|$|E

Balthier received many privileges as Cid's son, including being made an Imperial Judge, but eventually cut ties with his father when Cid became consumed by his experimentation with nethicite. He left {{the service of the}} empire, stole an Archadian airship, and took a new name. Balthier is now a renowned career criminal with a sizable bounty on his head, and must be <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the attention of both the law and the bounty hunters seeking the reward for his capture. He originally joins the resistance in the hope of reacquiring the Dusk Shard, but when he learns it is actually a piece of nethicite, he sees too much of his father's obsession in his own quest and decides to abandon the search. After the party defeats Dr. Cid at the Pharos, Balthier makes peace with his father and helps the group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for Cid's deeds.|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put things back in their proper place, or Am <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E

25|$|While the Samogitians were plundering Courland, {{the knights}} from Kuldīga {{requested}} reinforcements from Klaipėda. The Knights pursued retreating Samogitians, who carried their loot {{back home and}} the decisive battle took place near Skuodas. The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle blamed the defeat on the cowardly Curonians, who did not withstand the Samogitian pressure and retreated from the battlefield leaving the knights exposed. Inspired by the success, the Samogitians almost immediately organized another raid into Courland. This time Livonian Grand Master Burchard von Hornhausen commanded the Knights.

25|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, Gagliano and Lucchese led {{their family}} into {{profitable}} {{areas of the}} trucking and clothing industries. When Luciano was {{sent to prison for}} pandering in 1936, a rival alliance took control of the Commission. The alliance of Mangano, Bonanno, Buffalo crime family boss Stefano Magaddino, and Profaci used their power to control organized crime in America. Understanding his vulnerability, Gagliano was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> opposing this new alliance. Gagliano was a quiet man who avoided the media and stayed off the streets. He preferred to pass his orders to the family though Lucchese and a few other close allies. In contrast, Lucchese was the public face of the family who carried out Gagliano's orders. In 1946, Lucchese attended the Cosa Nostra Havana Conference in Cuba on behalf of Gagliano. Gagliano kept such a low profile that virtually nothing is known about his activities from 1932 until he retired or died between 1951 and 1953.|$|E

After Diefenbaker was returned with a minority, Washington continued to press for acceptance of nuclear arms, but Diefenbaker, faced with a split between Defence Minister Douglas Harkness and External Affairs Minister Howard Green on the question, continued to stall, hoping that time and events would invite consensus.|$|E

500|$|Following {{months of}} {{abortive}} Anglo-Rhodesian talks and unsuccessful attempts by Britain to deter Portugal diplomatically, Reedman travelled to Lisbon in September 1965 {{to take up}} his post {{at the head of}} an independent Rhodesian mission. The Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which insisted it was neutral regarding Rhodesia, outraged Whitehall by accepting Reedman's letter of accreditation—though Lisbon was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> provoking Britain, omitting the word [...] "diplomatic" [...] from the titles given to both Reedman and his mission. The Rhodesians still regarded themselves as victorious, saying they had set out to gain an independent diplomatic representative in Lisbon, and now had one. The historian JRT Wood later called this [...] "Rhodesia's first independent and indeed unilateral act—the veritable straw in the wind." [...] On 11 November 1965, less than two months after Reedman's investiture, Rhodesia went one further and unilaterally declared its independence from Britain. The mission in Lisbon operated until 1975, when it was closed following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal the previous year.|$|E

500|$|Diefenbaker won Prince Albert in 1953, {{even as the}} Tories {{suffered}} a second consecutive disastrous defeat under Drew. Speculation arose in the press that the leader might be pressured to step aside.

However, Diefenbaker was never a member of the [...] "Five O'clock Club" [...] of Drew intimates who met the leader in his office for a drink and gossip each day. By 1955, there was a widespread feeling among Tories that Drew was not capable of leading the party to a victory. At the same time, the Liberals were in flux as the aging St. Laurent tired of politics. Drew was able to damage the government in a weeks-long battle over the TransCanada pipeline in 1956—the so-called Pipeline Debate—in which the government, in a hurry to obtain financing for the pipeline, imposed closure before the debate even began. The Tories and the CCF combined to obstruct business in the House for weeks before the Liberals were finally able to pass the measure. Diefenbaker played a relatively minor role in the Pipeline Debate, speaking only once.|$|E
500|$|Christine Love {{describes}} herself as [...] "a writer first, and a game designer second", as writing was her initial goal. She originally pictured her future {{as that of a}} novelist, with a day job as a programmer to support herself. Love describes her games as being about [...] "our relationship with technology, about human relationships in general, and about seeing things from different perspectives," [...] as well as having [...] "a ton of words". She strives for her stories to be true and sincere, but not necessarily realistic. Love is also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in video games; in Digital and Analogue, she was <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or the character they control, though the love interests in the games are female. Privately, however, she thinks of them as female, as her intention was to create games that could be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself, without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did not match up to their perceptions. Love believes that indie games have [...] "more meaningful depictions of queer experiences" [...] than those from larger studios.|$|E
