5|$|Asteroids is an arcade space shooter {{released}} in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The {{object of the}} game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.|$|E
5|$|El Sol {{returned}} to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until March 1927, when she sank in New York Harbor after <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> Sac City of the American Diamond Line. A portion of the ship's cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year.|$|E

5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In coastal regions, {{dolphins}} run {{the risk}} of <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> boats. Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.|$|E

5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{unmanned}} resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to {{the station}} on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic docking system failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system. Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 {{which resulted in the}} spacecraft <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> Mir, causing significant damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{took place at}} the bridge over the years, with vessels <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> the piers due to the hazardous nature of the waterway. In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.|$|E
50|$|On 17 August 2010, {{several people}} were injured, four seriously, when a train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> a sewage {{truck in the}} village. The two-carriage {{passenger}} train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the truck at around 17:35 BST.|$|R
50|$|An express {{passenger}} train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> a light engine at , Yorkshire on 22 October 1903 {{due to a}} signalman's error. A third train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the wreckage at low speed. One person was killed.|$|R

5|$|After her {{overhaul}} {{was completed}} in June 1944, the ship resumed her former duties in the Skagerrak, although the repairs required after another boiler room fire in August necessitated lengthy repairs in Oslo. She was damaged after <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> the mole in Frederikshavn, Denmark, on 18 November and became operational again on 7 January 1945. Theodor Riedel remained in Southern Norway and Denmark until the ships there were ordered into the Baltic {{to assist with the}} evacuation of the Hel Peninsula on 5 May. After unloading the refugees in Copenhagen, she made another voyage to Hela and returned to Copenhagen on 7 May. The crew surrendered in Kiel three days later.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume the {{following}} season, Salo signed another two-year contract with the Canucks at $1.5 million per season. He was limited to 59 games in the subsequent 2005–06 season, suffering a shoulder injury with the Finnish national team during the 2006 Winter Olympics, <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> a teammate during a line change. He recorded 10 goals and 33 points with the Canucks, second among team defencemen in scoring. His 23 assists were also a career-high.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg {{entered the}} round as the {{defending}} race winner and championship leader, with a twenty-four-point advantage over teammate Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton started the race from pole {{and went on}} to win the race after <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> Rosberg on the final lap; as a result, Rosberg finished fourth behind Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen, and saw his championship lead cut to eleven points. Mercedes led rivals Ferrari by eighty-one points in the Constructors' standings at the start of the round, extending their lead to one hundred and three after Sebastian Vettel retired.|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{the winds}} would summon their {{forces on the}} Baltic Sea and rush into the hinterland, they would first rush {{unimpeded}} across the hills of Södermanland into Närke. At Närke they would then <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the ridge of Kilsbergen, which would turn the winds southwards, where they would then <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Tiveden, which would direct them eastwards to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Tylöskog. They would then rush northwards to <b>collide</b> <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> Käglan, turning the winds westwards again towards Kilsbergen, and so on. The winds would be circulate in this manner in smaller and smaller circles until {{there was nothing left}} but a whirlwind on the plain.|$|R
50|$|On 23 January 1998 the Stena Jutlandica <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the Chemical tanker Brevik near Gothenburg.In {{the early}} morning of 19 July 2015 the Stena Jutlandica <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the tanker Ternvind near Gothenburg, leaving {{a hole in the}} hull.|$|R
50|$|A {{passenger}} train being {{operated by a}} diesel multiple unit overran signals and <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> another diesel multiple unit at Luton South Signal Box. An express {{passenger train}} then <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the wreckage, striking it with a glancing blow.|$|R
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2003–04 season, Jovanovski {{suffered}} a third-degree shoulder separation {{during a game}} against the Nashville Predators on January 25, 2004. <b>Colliding</b> <b>with</b> opposing forward Martin Erat, he fell to ice and slid into the rink boards. He returned late in the season to help the Canucks secure the Northwest Division title. In 56 games, he scored seven goals and 23 points. Adding four assists in seven 2004 playoff games, the Canucks were defeated in the first round by the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage {{over the rest of}} the group. He used the whole width of the road and coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto {{the wrong side of the}} road before <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> a Renault Scénic. A {{passenger}} in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured. Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.|$|E
50|$|The Icelandic {{lighthouse}} tender V/s Árvakur <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> four British vessels on 1 June, and {{six days}} later ICGV Ægir <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> HMS Scylla when it was reconnoitering for icebergs off the Westfjords, even though no trawlers were present.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1943, Leamington <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the American {{minesweeper}} [...] and {{was under}} repair at Halifax until 3 June. Later that month, she <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the merchant ship Mortimer and was repaired at Norfolk, Virginia with work continuing until October 1943.|$|R
30|$|In a {{conventional}} DCF, acknowledge (ACK) frames never <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> other frames because the ACK frames are transmitted after the short interframe space (SIFS) period. However, the ACK frames may <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> other frames in the RoF-based WLAN {{owing to the}} long propagation delays.|$|R
5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|The USAF {{eventually}} gave up {{fighting for}} its {{production and the}} B-70 program was canceled in 1961. Development was then turned over to a research program to {{study the effects of}} long-duration high-speed flight. As such, two prototype aircraft, designated XB-70A, were built; these aircraft were used for supersonic test-flights during 1964–69. In 1966, one prototype crashed after <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> a smaller aircraft while flying in close formation; the remaining Valkyrie bomber is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Samuelsson {{suffered a}} mild concussion after <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> St. Louis Blues forward Vladimír Sobotka on December 5, 2010, {{causing him to}} miss one game. Two months later, he was named the NHL's Second Star for the week ending February 6, 2011. He scored two goals and six points in three Canucks victories to earn the distinction. While his goals total decreased to 18 in 2010–11, Samuelsson recorded his second consecutive 50-point campaign with a career-high 32 assists. Ranking fourth in team point-scoring behind the Sedins and Kesler, he helped the Canucks to the franchise's first Presidents' Trophy as {{the team with the}} NHL's best regular season record.|$|E
50|$|Precursor mechanism. One {{of the two}} molecules, A, is adsorbed on the surface. The second molecule, B, <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> the surface, {{forming a}} mobile {{precursor}} state. The molecule B then <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> A on the surface, they react, bind and the new molecule desorbs.|$|R
50|$|The {{second step}} in the {{formation}} of Pangaea was the collision of Gondwana with Euramerica. By Silurian time, 440 Ma, Baltica had already <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> Laurentia, forming Euramerica. Avalonia had not yet <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> Laurentia, but as Avalonia inched towards Laurentia, the seaway between them, a remnant of the Iapetus Ocean, was slowly shrinking. Meanwhile, southern Europe broke off from Gondwana and began to move towards Euramerica across the newly formed Rheic Ocean. It <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> southern Baltica in the Devonian, though this microcontinent was an underwater plate. The Iapetus Ocean's sister ocean, the Khanty Ocean, shrank as an island arc from Siberia <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> eastern Baltica (now part of Euramerica). Behind this island arc was a new ocean, the Ural Ocean.|$|R
5|$|On 9 August 1920, a {{passenger}} train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> the buffers. Two people were injured. The following year, {{a passenger}} train was being shunted into a platform and <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> three luggage vans already occupying the line. A carriage was derailed and a luggage van was wrecked.|$|R
