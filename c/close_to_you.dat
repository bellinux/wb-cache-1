500|$|After {{they began}} working on the song, Carey began to {{incorporate}} other lyrics into the chorus, {{trying to make the}} song relatable to the AIDS epidemic that was in full force in the mid-1990s. Additionally, Mariah's sister Alison Carey had been diagnosed with HIV in 1988 when she was 27, an event that ruined their relationship and tore them apart. Carey has stated that she wrote the song hoping that all her fans that have lost someone could relate to [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] and maybe help ease the pain of the loss. Carey described the song as [...] " [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> it changes your life and changes our perspective." ...|$|E

[...] whole idea of when you lose people that are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away.

500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Sinatra {{released}} <b>Close</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> A Swingin' Affair! and Where Are You?—his {{first album}} in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins. Granata considers [...] "Close to You" [...] {{to have been}} thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the [...] "golden" [...] era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was [...] "extremely progressive" [...] by the stands of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs [...] "With Every Breath I Take", [...] "Blame It On My Youth" [...] and [...] "It Could Happen to You". For Granata, Sinatra's A Swingin' Affair! and swing music predecessor Songs for Swingin' Lovers! solidified [...] "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis, Jr., and noted that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s. On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium, his first appearance in Seattle since 1945. The recording was first released as a bootleg, but in 1999 Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as the Sinatra '57 in Concert live album, after Sinatra's death. In 1958 Sinatra released the album Come Fly with Me with Billy May. It reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards. The title song, [...] "Come Fly With Me", written especially for him, {{would become one of}} his best known standards. On May 29 he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth was planned, [...] "Lush Life", but Sinatra found it too technically demanding. In September, Sinatra released Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards album chart and peaking at No.1. Cuts from this LP, such as [...] "Angel Eyes" [...] and [...] "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of the [...] "saloon song" [...] segments of Sinatra's concerts.|$|E

2500|$|... "Red Dress" [...] {{serves as}} the fifth track on the album; it is an uptempo pop song that {{features}} two choruses. Its instrumentation is composed of keyboards, bass and guitars, while the main riff samples the Northern soul song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Tony Clarke. [...] "Red Dress" [...] features a theme of girl power, and is lyrically {{about a woman who}} uses her sexuality to gain power over men. The sixth track of Taller in More Ways is the midtempo pop ballad [...] "Ugly", consisting of acoustic guitars [...] "buoyed by peripheral detail". Its lyrical content is related to self-esteem and body-image concerns; the song received comparisons to [...] "Beautiful" [...] by American recording artist Christina Aguilera and [...] "Unpretty" [...] by American girl group TLC. [...] "It Ain't Easy", the album's seventh track, is an electro and R song backed by a guitar riff, drums and keys. It is reminiscent of that heard on [...] "Personal Jesus" [...] by Depeche Mode. Lyrically, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is about the Sugababes as people and balancing their lives with their careers. The album's eighth track, [...] "Bruised", contains a repetitive [...] "da-na-na" [...] backing vocal and is lyrically about a tempestuous relationship. Buchanan revealed that the song is about being in an unhealthy relationship, saying: [...] "Every time they come <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> you get bruised".|$|E
