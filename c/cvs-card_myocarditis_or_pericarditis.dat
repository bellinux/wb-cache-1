METHODS: We collected 53 endomyocardial biopsies and two autopsy specimens from 41 patients affected by <b>myocarditis</b> <b>or</b> dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients were diagnosed clinically, hemodynamically, virologically and histologically (Dallas classification). We tested for the presence of enteroviral sequences by PCR, using 5 prime prime or minute non-coding (coxsackievirus B 3, CB 3, map position 450 [...] 474, 584 [...] 603) derived primers.

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} was {{to find out whether}} immunhistochemical {{investigations}} of endomyocardial biopsies is essential in the identification of inflammmatory heart muscle diseases. Therefore clinical data of patients either with a bioptical verified <b>myocarditis</b> <b>or</b> an inflammmatory cardiomyopathy were compared with those of patients without inflammation in the myocardium. The data of investigation were collected from patients, who were medicated in the period from February 1991 to October 1994 in the clinic of cardiology, pneumology and angiology in the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf. Fever or a common cold {{at the beginning of the}} anamnesis, which points typically to myocarditis, proved as uncertain criteria. Among patients with the suspicion diagnosis myocarditis atypical chest pain was the only symptom that significantly differed from patients without myocardial inflammation. The more likely causes may be vasospasms or the development of vasculitis. Other symptoms such as vertigo, tachycardia, irregular heart beat, dyspnoea and exhaustion were uncharacteristic for the diagnosis of <b>myocarditis</b> <b>or</b> inflammatory cardiomyopathy. To diagnose a myocardial inflammation the laboratory evidence of inflammation and CK-rise were without substantial meaning, because these parameters are mostly arised at the beginning of myocardial inflammation, but most of the patients were in a chronical stadium. Inflammation in the myocardium was frequently associated with sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, whereby a significant difference was noticed between patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis, in contrast to non inflammation heart disease, was significantly associated with ST-rise. Left ventricular enddiastolic pressure was the only hemodynamic parameter, wich was significantly higher by patients with inflammatory than with dilated cardiomyopathy. Perhaps there are autoimmunological mechanisms, that influence additionally myocyte apoptosis and myocardial remodeling. The other parameters, which were raised by cardiac catheterization, as well as x-ray, showed however likewise tendentious impaired cardiac function and/or heart enlargement of patients with inflammatory than with dilated cardiomyopathy. The results of this essay show that there are a few clinical findings, which point on a <b>myocarditis</b> <b>or</b> an inflammatory cardiomyopathy however without to prove it, so that also in the future an immunhistochemical evaluation of endomyocardial biopsies is still substantial...|$|R

40|$|Background Acute {{pericarditis}} is common, yet uncertainty persists on its treatment. We thus {{aimed to}} conduct a comprehensive systematic review on pharmacologic treatments for acute <b>or</b> recurrent <b>pericarditis.</b> Methods Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included provided they focused on pharmacologic agents for acute <b>pericarditis</b> <b>or</b> its recurrences. Random-effect odds ratios (ORs) were computed for long-term treatment failure, pericarditis recurrence, rehospitalization, and adverse drug effects. Results From 2, 078 citations, 7 studies were finally included (451 patients); but only 3 were randomized trials. Treatment comparisons were as follows: colchicine versus standard therapy (3 studies, 265 patients), steroids versus standard therapy (2 studies, 31 patients), low-dose versus high-dose steroids (1 study, 100 patients), and statins versus standard therapy (1 study, 55 patients). Colchicine {{was associated with a}} reduced risk of treatment failure (OR = 0. 23 [0. 11 - 0. 49]) and recurrent <b>pericarditis</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 39 [0. 20 - 0. 77]), but with a trend toward more adverse effects (OR = 5. 27 [0. 86 - 32. 16]). Overall, steroids were associated with a trend toward increased risk of recurrent <b>pericarditis</b> (<b>OR</b> = 7. 50 [0. 62 - 90. 65]). Conversely, low-dose steroids proved superior to high-dose steroids for treatment failure <b>or</b> recurrent <b>pericarditis</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 29 [0. 13 - 0. 66]), rehospitalizations (OR = 0. 19 [0. 06 - 0. 63]), and adverse effects (OR = 0. 07 [0. 01 - 0. 54]). Data on statins were inconclusive. Conclusions Clinical evidence informing decision-making for the management of acute pericarditis and its recurrences is still limited to few, small, and/or low-quality clinical studies. Notwithstanding such major caveats, available studies routinely using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in both experimental and control groups suggest a beneficial risk-benefit profile for colchicine and a detrimental one for steroids, especially when used at high dosages.

40|$|Heart-reactive {{antibodies}} {{are commonly}} observed {{in patients with}} <b>myocarditis</b> <b>or</b> cardiomyopathy. Such antibodies may be important in the pathogenesis of these disorders, yet the specific antigens recognized have not been studied systematically. This report characterizes circulating heart autoantibodies from patients with myocarditis (n = 17) or idiopathic cardiomyopathy (n = 71) and from healthy volunteers (n = 15). Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that high titer (≥ 1 : 20) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody activity occurred in 59 % of the myocarditis samples, 20 % of the cardiomyopathy samples {{and none of the}} normal samples. All samples were tested by Western immunoblotting for IgG activity against a normal human heart extract. The number of antigens recognized by each sample was enumerated and the molecular weight of each antigen estimated; the prevalence of reactivity against antigens in selected molecular weight classes was determined. There was no difference in the mean number of heart antigens recognized by serum from each group. For most weight classes, prevalence either did not differ significantly among the various groups or subgroups or was greatest among samples from healthy volunteers. Prevalence of reactivity with 190 to 199 kilodalton (kd) antigens was greatest (p < 0. 05) among low titer serum samples from patients with myocarditis. High titer cardiomyopathy serum differed from normal serum by an increased (p < 0. 05) prevalence of antibodies to 40 to 49 and 100 to 109 kd antigens.

Deaths caused by infectious diseases were grouped by site of infection and analyzed using SPSS 17. 0 software. RESULTS: 45, 451 deaths due to infections were recorded in Greece during the 8 -year period of time, among which 12. 2 % were due to septicemia, 69. 7 % pneumonia, 1. 5 % pulmonary tuberculosis, 0. 2 % influenza, 0. 5 % other infections of the respiratory tract, 7. 9 % intra-abdominal infections (IAIs), 2. 5 % urinary tract infections (UTIs), 2. 2 % endocarditis <b>or</b> <b>pericarditis</b> <b>or</b> <b>myocarditis,</b> 1. 6 % hepatitis, 1 % infections of the central nervous system, and 0. 7 % other infections. A percentage of 99. 4 % of deaths due to septicemia were caused by bacteria that were not reported on the death certificate (noted as indeterminate septicemia). More deaths due to indeterminate septicemia were observed during 2007 - 2010 compared to 2003 - 2006 (3, 558 versus 1, 966; p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations related to the quality of death certificates, this study shows that the mortality rate due to septicemia has almost doubled after 2007 in Greece. Proportionally, septicemia accounted for a greater increase in the mortality rate within the infectious causes of death for the same period of time. The emergence of resistance could partially explain this alarming phenomenon. Therefore, stricter infection control measures should be urgently applied in all Greek healthcare facilities...|$|R
