25|$|The first {{overseas}} deployment {{took place}} in the Balkans, from July to November 1995, under the name Nomad Vigil. Operations were based in Gjader, Albania. Four disassembled Predators were flown into Gjadër airbase in a C-130 Hercules. The UAVs were assembled and flown first by civilian <b>contract</b> <b>personnel.</b> More than 70 U.S. military personnel of the military intelligence were deployed. Intelligence collection missions began in July 1995. One of the Predators was lost over Bosnia on 11 August 1995; a second was deliberately destroyed on 14 August after suffering an engine failure over Bosnia, which may have been caused by hostile ground fire. Its original 60-day stay was extended to 120 days. The following spring, in March 1996, the system was redeployed to the Balkan area and operated out of Taszar, Hungary.|$|E

25|$|Houston {{is home to}} the Johnson Space Center, NASA's largest {{research}} and development facility, employing nearly 3,000 federal civil service workers and more than 14,000 <b>contract</b> <b>personnel.</b> Program offices for Project Constellation, Orion, and other new space vehicle projects will create new jobs at the center. The city's burgeoning aerospace industry heralded its second growth spurt, which solidified with the 1973 oil crisis. The majority of the contractor work force related to the projects will also be located at the center. Texas Governor Rick Perry recently announced a $7.5 million Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant to Lockheed Martin, which will bring about 1,000 jobs to the Houston area. The grant ensures that Lockheed Martin will create these jobs in the Houston area after they earned a multibillion-dollar contract from NASA to build the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. Houston is also home to the United Space Alliance, which employs well over 10,000 people.|$|E

40|$|The fear of {{receiving}} a bid protest {{is said to}} affect acquisition strategies, yet {{it has not been}} empirically explored. Based on the Public Value Framework and interviews with <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel,</b> this research tests a model of antecedents to and consequences of the fear of a protest. Survey data was obtained from a sample of 350 <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel.</b> The fear of protest is mitigated by having sufficient procurement lead time and by source selection experience, and increased by protest risk. Fear of protest increases compromised technical evaluations, added procurement lead time, and transaction costs, while it decreases contracting officer authority and is associated with source selection method inappropriateness. Compromised technical evaluations, in turn, decrease contractor performance while contracting officer authority increases contractor performance. Thus, findings suggest that, indeed, the tail is wagging the dog. The research concludes with several managerial implications, study limitations and future research directions...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis investigates the current use of, {{and the potential}} for improving, market research within the Marine Corps field contracting community. It explores the nature of the procurements typically conducted, and the information needs of <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel.</b> It examines the participation by customers in market research efforts, and advance procurement planning. It also analyzes the barriers to effective market research, or improvements to the current system. Knowledge and understanding of pertinent markets is essential for optimum procurement decisions. Market research is a vital element of effective procurement. Effective market research can increase competition in contracting, and provide valuable market information which can then be used to make better procurement decisions. This thesis will identify the shortcomings in the use of market research by the Marine Corps field <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel.</b> It will also provide recommendations on how the Marine Corps might best improve market research at the field activities.

40|$|Joint Applied ProjectThe Defense (DoD) is realizing {{a current}} and {{expected}} future shortage in experienced acquisition and <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> due, in part, to a hiring freeze {{in the middle}} 1990 s {{and the number of}} personnel that are eligible to retire in the next five years. This Joint Applied Project (JAP) will focus on the Army's current acquisition and <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> recruitment programs, personnel development programs and personnel retention programs within the Army Contracting Command (ACC), its major Centers and two subordinate commands, the Expeditionary Contracting Command (ECC) and the Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC). The JAP provides historical background plus information regarding current acquisition and <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> recruitment programs, personnel development programs and personnel retention programs. To understand the current recruitment programs, personnel development programs and personnel retention programs considered by ACC, the following research questions are addressed: What are the recruitment program implementation differences among the organizations within ACC? What are the major differences in training programs among the organizations within ACC? What major retention programs are utilized among the organizations within ACC? What key acquisition personnel shortages exist within ACC? Information was gathered through the review of various sources including Government laws, National Defense Authorization Bills, Government policy letters and reports. In addition, data was collected through a survey questionnaire to ACC' major Centers and two subordinate commands (MICC and ECC). The JAP provides an additional reference tool for ACC when addressing recruitment, development and retention strategies in updating and expanding the Human Capital Strategic Plan (HCSP) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{reviews the}} {{intellectual property rights}} in software acquired by the Department of Defense (DoD). The intent {{of the study is}} to analyze the effectiveness of the DoD's policy concerning noncommercial software intellectual property rights. Surveys were developed to assess the current policy. Contracting officials in the military and commercial sector were the respondents to the interviews. The conclusions based on this research are that contracting officers do not fully understand the myriad of intellectual property rights management tools at their disposal. The research also uncovered the perception that DoD's overall policy in this area is fragmented and confusing. Recommendations include: (1) acquisition and contracting students of Federal acquisition programs should receive instruction in ADP or FIP (Federal Information Processing) acquisition, (2) acquisition and contracting students of Federal acquisition programs should receive increased class sessions on intellectual property rights, (3) DoD <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> should increase usage of 'specifically negotiated license rights' in software contracts, and (4) DoD <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> should strengthen software contract solicitations.

40|$|Sponsored Report (for Acquisition Research Program) This study {{focuses on}} the {{demographics}} of <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> in the Army Contracting Command (ACC). Numerous acquisition studies and commissions have cited personnel management {{as one of the}} most critical factors contributing to the success or failure of buying organizations. Further, strategic human capital management and DOD Contract Management have been on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) High-Risk List for the last several years. Actions to understand the nature and dynamics of the acquisition workforce are important in the development and execution of an integrated, strategic, human capital management plan. This research focused primarily on identifying basic demographics for <b>contracting</b> <b>personnel</b> in the 1102 occupational series in ACC. The research consisted of two principal aspects. First, what is the baseline status of critical demographic factors of the ACC contracting workforce? Second, how does the ACC workforce compare with other similar contracting populations''such as other Services and DOD agencies, other Federal Government agencies, and even in the commercial or private sector? The key demographics upon which this study focused included: (1) education level; (2) contracting certification level; (3) gender; (4) age; (5) retirement eligibility; (6) rank (military) and grade level (civilians); (7) pay plan (civilians); (8) experience; (9) supervisory vs. non-supervisory personnel; and (10) contractor personnel. These demographics were examined at two different points in time in order to perform trend analysis. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R
