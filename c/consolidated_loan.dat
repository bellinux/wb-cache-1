40|$|The Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs (DCA) Examination Manual (manual) is {{designed}} as a job performance aid for field examiners conducting Compliance and CRA examinations, and for Regional Office and Washington Office employees processing examination reports and related documents. The information contained in the manual is presented by task. This format comprehensively displays information to assist examiners in performing examinations. In the task-oriented format, information is grouped by process, which has been shown through practice to be the format in which individuals best assimilate and comprehend information. In addition, the manual pages are divided into two columns to enhance locating particular topics and reading ease. The left-hand column contains headers and icons for assistance in locating detailed information contained in the right-hand column. Also, the manual is presented in a loose-leaf binder format to facilitate periodic updates and to allow users to insert other references. Structuring the manual around the examination process, from pre-examination planning to report preparation, reflects the logical flow of the examination process and the actual procedures performed by DCA field examiners. This format, of grouping by examination process and area of review, allows for the assimilation and integration of different regulatory requirements as they apply to {{a specific type of}} transaction. For example, the section for primary residence loan review combines Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act requirements into one <b>consolidated</b> <b>loan</b> file review. The manual outlines detailed procedures to be performed during each examination. In addition to examination procedures, each section includes, where applicable...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report focuses on the default rate for student loans. Two major federal student loan programs, the Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP) and the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), together provided student borrowers with about 9 million loans totaling about $ 42. 9 billion in fiscal year 1999. The most recent student loan default rate statistics for schools showed that, overall, the direct and guaranteed student loan programs had similar default rates: at 6. 6 percent for FDLP and 6. 7 percent for FFELP. The two programs had similar default rates when the comparisons focused {{on the type of}} school. FDLP has two types of <b>loans,</b> <b>consolidated</b> and nonconsolidated. Generally, borrowers with <b>consolidated</b> <b>loans</b> who used the standard payment plan had a lower default rate than did borrowers with nonconsolidated loans. However, when income contingent repayment plans were used, borrowers with <b>consolidated</b> <b>loans</b> had a higher default rate than did those with nonconsolidated loans.

The Banking Act of 1936 established a clear separation between short term and medium-to-long term financing and the major banks had opted for specializing in short-term loans and there was the institution that would deal with financing for the flotation of companies that wished to obtain a stock market listing. In addition to granting <b>consolidated</b> <b>loans</b> against certificates of deposit and savings books, Mediobanca developed its activity of placement of bonds and shares issued by Italian companies. The professionalism developed by the bank under the, some would say brilliant, guidance of Enrico Cuccia enabled it to quickly acquire a position of leadership in the field of investment banking in Italy. In the mid-1950s, Mediobanca entered into agreements with important foreign partners (Lazard Group, Berliner Händel-Gesellschaft, Lehman Brothers, Sofina) that enabled the bank to play a role on the international market and obtained a Stock Exchange listing in 1956.|$|R

50|$|An initial treaty {{for this}} purpose was signed on 30 October 1882 by Muhammad Bey's {{successor}} Ali III ibn al-Husayn and the French Resident General Paul Cambon. This text stipulated that the French government was authorised to exercise those administrative and judicial powers it considered appropriate in the country. The debt question was resolved by France issuing a new <b>consolidating</b> <b>loan</b> to the Regency, guaranteed by the Bank of France, which paid off the existing creditors and therefore made the International Debt Commission redundant. However, the French National Assembly refused to ratify this text {{in the light of}} the potential costs and risks of direct colonial control, not least since it had never even authorised the military occupation of the country. An agreement providing, at least formally, for indirect rule was therefore required. A modified text was drawn up, stating that the Bey of Tunis undertook to introduce such administrative, judicial and financial reforms as the French government judged appropriate. This form of words allowed the fiction to be preserved that the ultimate decisions were to be taken by the Bey. To ensure that the Bey signed the conventions, the treaty provided that the Bey would receive a pension of two million Tunisian rials. The amended conventions were signed by Ali Bey and Cambon on 8 June 1883.|$|R

40|$|Loan {{securitization}} {{has become}} a widely used method for <b>consolidating</b> collections of <b>loans</b> into financial instruments with sufficiently stable statistical properties {{that they can be}} freely traded. In recent years the concept has been generally extended, creating a class of asset backed securities, financial instruments which are created {{from a wide variety of}} loan sources, including credit card, commercial real estate and even financial investment (hedge fund) lending. In this paper the money and loan supply implications of these instruments within a fractional reserve banking system are examined. It appears that the interaction of these instruments create an infinite loop within the monetary system, which removes the limit on loan creation that should be imposed by the bank’s reserve requirement. This has effectively disabled the ability of the central bank’s reserve requirements to limit the expansion of credit by commercial banks, leading directly to the current credit crisis. The evidence suggests that loan securitization and the sale of commercial bank loans outside the regulated banking industry are incompatible with the stable operation of a fractional reserve banking system. 1 Prologue...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on mortgage funding and risk management. The U. S mortgage market is very concentrated. In 2006, the top 40 lenders were responsiblefor the origination of 96 percent of all mortgages (Stanton et al. (2014)). These large lendersoriginated about 60 percent of the mortgages through the wholesale channel, delegating partsof the origination process to third party agents such as mortgage brokers and correspondentlenders. I show {{that the type of}} agent selected by the wholesale lender could crowd outlocal banks, who often act as correspondents and rely on these wholesale lenders for funding. I also show that this crowding out has spillover eects. As local banks decreased theirpresence in the county, they have also reduced other types of lending. As a result, their localcommunities showed less growth in small businesses. The second chapter discusses the perils of warehouse lending. Warehouse lending is animportant part of the U. S. mortgage market because a large fraction of mortgage origination,both pre-crisis and currently, is carried out by non-depositories who are reliant on warehousefacilities to fund their mortgage origination activity. After the passage of The BankruptcyAbuse Prevention Act (BAPCPA), in April 2005, most warehouse facilities were structuredas Master Repurchase Agreements (MRAs). BAPCPA re-dened the mortgage loans heldas collateral on the warehouse lines (the newly originated mortgages) as repo thus exemptingthem from automatic stay upon the bankruptcy of the mortgage originator (the reposeller). We consider the eect of the growth of MRAs for funding mortgage originations onthe performance of the mortgage originators (repo sellers) and warehouse lenders (repo buyers). We nd that mortgage originators (repo sellers), that used MRAs to fund their loans,originated mortgages of lower quality and that these originators were more likely to declarebankruptcy. Symmetrically, we nd that the warehouse lenders (repo buyers) experienced asharper increase in mortgage charge-os and non-performing mortgages than non-warehouselenders, even though the quality of the retail and wholesale mortgages that they originatedwere comparable to the quality of mortgages originated by non warehouse lenders. Thisnegative outcome for warehouse lenders arose from the exemption of the mortgage repocollateral from automatic stay, since under BAPCPA the poor quality assets of bankrupt counter parties, the mortgage originators, became consolidated on the warehouse lender balancesheets. Thus, the <b>consolidated</b> <b>loans</b> from the bankrupt counter parties generated animportant component of the deterioration in the warehouse lenders' mortgageIn the third chapter, we propose an empirical duration measure for the stock of U. S. Agency MBS that appears to be less prone to model risk than measures such as the BarclaysEective Duration measure. We nd that this measure {{does not appear to have}} a strongeect on the 12 -month excess returns of ten-year Treasuries as would be expected if shocksto MBS duration lead to commensurate shocks to the quantity of interest rate risk borneby professional bond investors (see, Hanson, 2014; Malkhozov et al., 2016). Given thisnegative reduced form result, we then explore the mortgage and treasury hedging activitiesof the primary MBS investors such as commercial banks, insurance companies, the agencies,the Federal Reserve Bank, Mutual Funds, and foreign investors. We nd that the onlyinvestors that may follow the models of Hanson (2014) and Malkhozov et al. (2016) areforeign investors in Switzerland and the United Kingdom and life insurance rms. Lifeinsurance rm market share has declined over the period, dropping below 10 % since 1996 and reaching 4 % in 2016. Furthermore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are not majorparticipants in the US Treasury market. Of the investors we are not able to study, hedgefunds and pensions/retirement funds are the two investor groups that may trade along theHanson (2014) and Malkhozov et al. (2016) models. However, although these two investorgroups held almost 25 % of the Agency MBS market (including households and non protorganizations) in the late 1990 s, post crisis their share has fallen below 10...|$|R
40|$|Financial theory {{offers several}} {{rationales}} for financial risk management. Hedging enables firms {{to maintain their}} access to internal funds as well as reduces the costs of financial distress. The theoretical framework offers, however, few tools for currency risk identification and for choosing a proper hedging instrument. This Thesis seeks to help firms manage risks better by defining the currency risk exposures of a multinational corporation, by describing their effects on the cash flows, profit and loss and balance sheet of the corporation {{as well as by}} comparing the applicability of currency forwards and currency options in hedging these exposures. The exposure framework is constructed based on an extensive literature review of financial risk management articles. The effects of currency exposures on cash flows, profit and loss and balance sheet are modeled. The model further takes into account current accounting standards regarding derivatives. The model is applied on a stock-listed corporation by conducting a historical simulation of its EURUSD currency risk. The simulation makes it possible to study the effects of currency rate movements and the differences between hedging strategies.
