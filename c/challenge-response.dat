25|$|A second {{method of}} {{prevention}} is by using cryptography. Rolling codes and <b>challenge-response</b> authentication (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded {{would prove to be}} unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag's id being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a cryptographically coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be symmetric, or may use public key cryptography.|$|E

50|$|Rather than embodying {{a single}} {{cryptographic}} key, PUFs implement <b>challenge-response</b> authentication to evaluate this microstructure. When a physical stimulus {{is applied to}} the structure, it reacts in an unpredictable (but repeatable) way due to the complex interaction of the stimulus with the physical microstructure of the device. This exact microstructure depends on physical factors introduced during manufacture which are unpredictable (like a fair coin). The applied stimulus is called the challenge, and the reaction of the PUF is called the response. A specific challenge and its corresponding response together form a <b>challenge-response</b> pair or CRP. The device's identity is established by the properties of the microstructure itself. As this structure is not directly revealed by the <b>challenge-response</b> mechanism, such a device is resistant to spoofing attacks.|$|E

50|$|To avoid {{storage of}} passwords, some {{operating}} systems (e.g. Unix-type) store a hash of the password rather than storing the password itself. During authentication, the system need only {{verify that the}} hash of the password entered matches the hash stored in the password database. This {{makes it more difficult}} for an intruder to get the passwords, since the password itself is not stored, and {{it is very difficult to}} determine a password that matches a given hash. However, this presents a problem for many (but not all) <b>challenge-response</b> algorithms, which require both the client and the server to have a shared secret. Since the password itself is not stored, a <b>challenge-response</b> algorithm will usually have to use the hash of the password as the secret instead of the password itself. In this case, an intruder can use the actual hash, rather than the password, which makes the stored hashes just as sensitive as the actual passwords. SCRAM is a <b>challenge-response</b> algorithm that avoids this problem.|$|E
