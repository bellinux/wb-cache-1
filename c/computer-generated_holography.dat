40|$|Holography, {{a revolutionary}} 3 D imaging technique, has been {{developed}} for storing and recovering the amplitude and phase of light scattered by objects. Later, single-beam <b>computer-generated</b> phase <b>holography</b> was proposed for restoring the wavefront from a given incidence. However, because the phase modulation depends on the light propagation inside the material, the thickness of phase holograms usually remains comparable to the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate ultra-thin metasurface holograms that operate in the visible range whose thickness is only 30 nm (approximately 1 / 23 of the operational wavelength). To our knowledge, this is the thinnest hologram that can provide both amplitude and phase modulation in the visible wavelength range, which generates high-resolution low-noise images. Using this technique, not only the phase, but potentially the amplitude of the incident wave can be efficiently controlled, expanding the route to new applications of ultra-thin and surface-confined photonic devices...|$|R

40|$|Standard multiple-beam {{holography}} {{has been}} largely used to produce gratings in polymer-liquid crystal composites, like POLICRYPS, H-PDLC gratings and POLIPHEM [1]. In this work we present {{a different approach to}} liquid crystalpolymeric grating production, based on the <b>Computer-Generated</b> <b>Holography</b> (CGH). The great advantage of using CGH is that interferometer-based schemes are no longer necessary, avoiding problems related to long term stability of the interference pattern and multi-beam complex optical setup. Moreover, the CGH technique allows a wider choice of pattern designs. In this preliminary work, we obtained promising results, as for instance the patterning of a square-wave refractive index modulation of a LCpolymeric composite, a pattern which is not achievable with standard two-beam holography.

Here we demonstrate an all-optical method for precise spatial control and recording of neuronal activity in anesthetized and awake freely behaving mice. Photoactivation patterns targeted to multiple neuronal somata, produced with <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography,</b> were transmitted to the mouse brain using a micro-objective-coupled fiber bundle. Fluorescence imaging through the same device, via epifluorescence, structured illumination, or scanless multipoint confocal microscopy, allowed imaging of neurons and recording of neuronal activity.

According {{to the principles of}} paraboloid of revolution in 3 D Fourier space, spectra information of 3 D objects is gathered from projection images. We record a series of real projection images of 3 D objects under incoherent white-light illumination by circular scanning method, and synthesize interpolated projection images by motion estimation and compensation between adjacent real projection images, then extract the spectra information of the 3 D objects from all projection images in circle form. Because of quantization error, information extraction in two circles form is better than in single circle. Finally hologram is encoded based on <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography</b> using a conjugate-symmetric extension.

Photostimulation of single cells using two-photon <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography</b> evokes calcium responses in downstream neurons. Morphological reconstruction of neurite arbors, response latencies and localization of presynaptic markers suggest that some neuron pairs recorded here are directly connected, while others are two or more synapses apart from each other.

Optobow should be useful for identification and manipulation of networks of interconnected neurons, even in dense neural tissues...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the fabrication of two-dimensional diffraction gratings in diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films, with applications in <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography</b> and micro optics. In {{order to achieve}} high diffraction efficiency {{and to have a}} very simple manufacturing process, the device is designed to modulate only the phase of an incoming coherent monochromatic laser beam (632. 8 nm, HeNe laser). This modulation is obtained by implementing a binary microrelief in the DLC film, responsible for generating a localized optical path difference of half a wavelength. This microrelief is obtained by anisotropic reactive ion etching of the DLC surface in an oxygen based plasma. The DLC layer was grown by reactive magnetron sputtering, using a methane-based plasma chemistry. AFM measurements show a low-level surface roughness of less than 1 % of the operation wavelength, and optical characterization shows a good quality of the reconstructed diffraction patterns.

Using <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography,</b> we experimentally implement a Y-junction suitable for atom trapping, with controllable and independent parameters. The junction and the transverse size of the atom waveguides are of the order of 5 micrometers, leading to favorable estimates for the Kondo temperature and for the coupling across the junction. Since our results show that all the required theoretical and experimental ingredients are available, this provides the demonstration of an ultracold atom device that may in principle exhibit the topological Kondo effect.

40|$|International audienceElectrical {{properties}} of neuronal processes are extraordinarily complex, dynamic, and, {{in the general}} case, impossible to predict {{in the absence of}} detailed measurements. To obtain such a measurement one would, ideally, {{like to be able to}} monitor electrical subthreshold events as they travel from synapses on distal dendrites and summate at particular locations to initiate action potentials. It is now possible to carry out these measurements at the scale of individual dendritic spines using voltage imaging. In these measurements, the voltage-sensitive probes can be thought of as transmembrane voltmeters with a linear scale, which directly monitor electrical signals. Amiram Grinvald and his colleagues were important early contributors to the methodology of voltage imaging, and they pioneered some of its significant results. In this study, we combined voltage imaging and glutamate uncaging using <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography</b> (CGH). The results demonstrated that patterned illumination, by reducing the surface area of illuminated membrane, reduces photodynamic damage.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest {{recently in the}} generation of azimuthal phase functions associated with photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) for high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The generation of secure quantum keys requires not only this pure phase basis, but also additional bases comprised of orthonormal superposition states formed from the pure states. These bases are also known as mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and include quantum states whose wave functions are modulated in both phase and amplitude. While modulo 2 π optical path control with high-resolution spatial light modulators (SLMs) is well suited to creating the azimuthal phases associated with the pure states, it does not introduce the amplitude modulation associated with the MUB superposition states. Using <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography</b> (CGH) with the Leith-Upatnieks approach to hologram recording however, both phase and amplitude modulation can be achieved. This paper presents {{a description of the}} OAM states of a 3 -dimensional MUB system and analyzes the construction of these states via CGH with a phase modulating SLM. The effects of phase holography artifacts on quantum-state generation are quantified and a prescription for avoiding these artifacts by preconditioning the hologram function is presented.

40|$|The {{technique}} of Spatial Light Modulation based on <b>Computer-generated</b> <b>Holography</b> {{has been successfully}} exploited to realize patterned samples made by a mixture of liquid crystal and polymeric composites. We believe that the realized structures and, mainly, the employed technique can promote important interests {{in the development of}} soft matter photonic devices due to the extreme flexibility and ease of production of our technique, the all joined with the known tuning features of the LC component. Our single-beam technique was developed with three different approaches (Fourier optics-based, direct imaging and interference-based) and allowed the realization of complex structures with micrometric resolution and with accurate control of the writing intensity distribution in the visible range. The irradiance pattern can be, in fact, modified in real time by in-video addressing of the computer-generated holograms (CGHs), without the need for sophisticated mechanical control of the optical table and realignment of the optical elements. Regular patterned samples with good optical contrast were obtained, leading to Photonic Crystals (PhCs) structures with 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D geometries. Regular but not periodic two-dimensional structures were also obtained, leading to Photonic Quasicrystals (PhQCs) of the Penrose, Octagonal, Dodecagonal type and other 2 D structures with rotational symmetry up to 23 -fold, together with aperiodic structures too like the 2 D Thue-Morse pattern. Moreover, samples with structures of defects were also produced with a single-step process. Results of optical and electro-optical characterization of realized samples are presented. Theoretical FDTD studies of the transmission spectra and photonic properties of the structures produced are also shown. The FDTD simulations demonstrate the importance of the choice of the geometric tiling in the building process of the PhQCs, influencing the characteristics of the photonic band-gap of the structures.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 122 - 130. A three-dimensional {{scene or}} object can be optically replicated via the threedimensional imaging and display method holography. In <b>computer-generated</b> <b>holography,</b> the scalar diffraction field {{due to a}} field given on an object (curved surface) is calculated numerically. The source model approaches treat the building elements of the object (such as points or planar polygons) independently to simplify the calculation of diffraction field. However, as a tradeoff, the accuracies of fields calculated by such methods are degraded. On the other hand, field models provide exact field solutions but their computational complexities make their application impractical for meaningful sizes of surfaces. By using the practical setup of the integral imaging, we establish a space-frequency signal decomposition based relation between the ray optics (more specifically the light field representation) and the scalar wave optics. Then, by employing the uncertainty principle inherent to this space-frequency decomposition, we derive an upper bound for the joint spatial and angular (spectral) resolution of a physically realizable light field representation. We mainly propose two methods for the problem of three-dimensional diffraction field calculation from fields given on curved surfaces. In the first approach, we apply linear space-frequency signal decomposition methods to the two-dimensional field given on the curved surface and decompose it into a sum of local elementary functions. Then, we write the diffraction field as a sum of local beams each of which corresponds to such an elementary function on the curved surface. By this way, we increase the accuracy provided by the source models while keeping the computational complexity at comparable levels. In the second approach, we firstly decompose the three-dimensional field into a sum of local beams, and then, we construct a linear system of equations where we form the system matrix by calculating the field patterns that the three-dimensional beams produce on the curved surface. We find the coefficients of the beams by solving the linear system of equations and thus specify the three-dimensional field. Since we use local beams in threedimensional field decomposition, {{we end up with}} sparse system matrices. Hence, by taking advantage of this sparsity, we achieve considerable reduction in computational complexity and memory requirement compared to other field model approaches that use global signal decompositions. The local Gaussian beams used in both approaches actually correspond to physically realizable light rays. Indeed, the upper joint resolution bound that we derive is obtained by such Gaussian beams.
