5000|$|MV1 Midnight on Dagger Alley was {{published}} in 1984, and was written by Merle M. Rasmussen. The module features art by Jeff Easley. The module comes in a cardboard folder, with two double-sided maps, a tear-off <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet</b> with character stats {{on one side and}} charts on the other and an eight-page booklet for the adventure. The adventure is intended for one player, with a playing time of one to three hours. The module also comes with a [...] "magic viewer", a framed piece of red cellophane that is used to view areas of the map or read areas of text which are camouflaged by red mottling.|$|E
5000|$|Passe-partout (or passepartout) is the French {{term for}} a mat, a paper or, more usually, <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet</b> with a cutout, which is placed under the glass in a picture frame. A picture (a photo or print, drawing, etc.) is placed beneath it, with the cutout framing it. The {{passe-partout}} serves two purposes: first, to prevent the image from touching the glass, and second, to frame the image and enhance its visual appeal. The cutout in the passe-partout is usually beveled to avoid casting shadows on the picture. The word may {{also be used for}} the tape used to stick the back of the picture to its frame. The term [...] "mount" [...] is used in British English.|$|E
50|$|Braille (a {{writing system}} for the blind) uses either 6 or 8 tactile 'points' from which all letters and numbers are formed. When Louis Braille invented it, it was {{produced}} with a needle holing successively all needed points in a <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet.</b> In 1892, Frank Haven Hall, superintendent of the Illinois Institute for the Education of the Blind, created the Hall Braille Writer, which was like a typewriter with 6 keys, one for each dot in a braille cell. The Perkins Brailler, first manufactured in 1951, uses a 6-key chord keyboard (plus a spacebar) to produce braille output, and has been very successful as a mass market affordable product. Braille, like Baudot, uses a number symbol and a shift symbol, which may be repeated for shift lock, to fit numbers and upper case into the 63 codes that 6 bits offer.|$|E
5000|$|The product {{comes with}} 10 <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> on which {{completed}} puzzles are stored. The puzzles {{along with their}} <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> are stacked {{on top of each}} other in the manner of a multi-tiered sandwich. Ultimately the entire sandwich is held together with straps that are provided and then the whole is stored in an outer cardboard case.|$|R
25|$|For sale to {{individuals}} or restaurants the wine is filtered if necessary, then conditioned. The filtration consists of passing the wine through a filter element for retaining fine particles suspended in the wine. It may be fine earth (Kieselguhr), <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets,</b> membranes, or Cross-flow filtration.|$|R
50|$|It also {{features}} Lisa Jen from the Welsh language band 9Bach on backing vocals and xylophone. On its release, record stores stocking the album were supplied with 96 inch <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> with patterns {{for making the}} cardboard candylion seen on the album cover, to hand out to purchasers.|$|R
5000|$|It {{employs the}} {{principle}} of feedback [...]. the incoming water pushes the buoy upwards , outgoing water lowers it, adjusting [...] "conic needle" [...] to let pass {{the same amount of}} water that enters into the container, this way.. [...] "inked needle" [...] records, on the drum's sheet, the amount of water flowing through the [...] "conic hole" [...] at every moment -in mm of rainfall per square-meter [...] Jardi's pluviometer consists of a drum that rotates at constant speed. The drum moves a graduated sheet of cardboard (the <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet</b> is usually for one day) that records the time at the abscissa while the y axis indicates the height of rainfall in mm. A pen moves vertically as the cardboard moves below it. The pen is driven by a buoy, marking the paper with the instantaneous rainfall rate over a period of time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pluviometer}} of intensities (or Jardi's pluviometer) is a {{tool that}} measures the average intensity of rainfall in a certain interval of time. It was initially designed to record the rainfall regime in Catalonia but eventually spread globally throughout the world. [...] It employs the principle of feedback [...]. the incoming water pushes the buoy upwards, making the lower [...] "adjusting conic needle" [...] to let pass {{the same amount of}} water that enters into the container, this way.. the needle records on the drum the amount of water flowing through it at every moment -in mm of rainfall per square-meter [...] It consists of a rotating drum that rotates at constant speed, this drum drags a graduate sheet of cardboard, which has the time at the abscissa while the y axis indicates the height of rainfall in mm of rain.

50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} album covers {{has been the}} subject of creative innovation. Ogden's Nut Gone Flake by the Small Faces was originally in a circular metal tin, and Happy to Meet - Sorry to Part by Horslips was in an octagonal package. Anyway by Family was originally issued in an opaque plastic package through which a design (a Leonardo sketch) could be seen. Magical Mystery Tour by the Beatles was first released as a double EP with a booklet between the records. Sgt. Pepper contained a <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet</b> of images, and The Beatles (often referred to as the White Album) contained four large glossy photos of the individual Beatles along with a poster-sized collage. Live at Leeds by The Who also contained a generous supply of posters and printed material. Led Zeppelin III had a front cover that contained a revolving disc which brought different images into view through small cut-outs in the outer sleeve. A similar effect was used for the band's later album Physical Graffiti with cut-outs of the windows of a brownstone building. The original issue of Sticky Fingers by the Rolling Stones had an actual zipper incorporated into the picture of the crotch area of a pair of jeans. The Velvet Underground and Nico album had a Warhol-designed cardboard banana on the cover that could be peeled back. The record company Vertigo had a black-and-white design on the centre label that produced a hypnotic optical effect when the disc revolved on the turntable.|$|E
5000|$|The company's primary {{products}} include the Pantone Guides, which {{consist of a}} large number of small (approximately 6×2 inches or 15×5 cm) thin <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets,</b> printed on one side with a series of related color swatches and then bound into a small [...] "fan deck". For instance, a particular [...] "page" [...] might contain a number of yellows of varying tints.|$|R

500|$|There {{was also}} {{significant}} flooding in Michoacán, where up to [...] of precipitation {{fell in the}} city of Zamora. City officials reported that 10neighborhoods were flooded. In rural areas of Michoacán, a combination of heavy rains and hail destroyed about 40homes. Offshore the city of Acapulco in Guerrero, several waterspouts were spawned. As the storm weakened, it produced rough seas and heavy rains over parts of Baja California Sur. Although Dalila passed over Socorro Island with winds of 60mph (95km/h), there were no reports of any deaths or damage.

40|$|In {{traditional}} media, such as {{photography and}} painting, a <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet</b> with a cutout (called) is frequently placed {{on top of}} an image. One of its functions is to increase the depth impression via the "looking-through-a-window" metaphor. This paper shows how an improved 3 D effect can be achieved by using a virtual passepartout: a 2 D framing that selectively masks the 3 D shape and leads to additional occlusion events between the virtual world and the frame. We introduce a pipeline to design virtual passepartouts interactively as a simple post-process on RGB images augmented with depth information. Additionally, an automated approach finds the optimal virtual passepartout for a given scene. Virtual passepartouts can be used to enhance depth depiction in images and videos with depth information, renderings, stereo images and the fabrication of physical passepartouts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} predict the through-thickness moisture content distribution and associated induced deformations of paper and cardboard sheets as they are subjected to relative humidity changes. The transient moisture diffusion problem is solved using a “natural” analytic approach that has previously been applied for solving transient heat conduction in multi-layer solids. The deformation behaviour of the sheet during the moisture diffusion process is predicted using a semi-analytical approach based on a Rayleigh–Ritz minimization of the total potential energy. Geometrically nonlinear effects are taken into account. Curvatures of the originally flat sheet are predicted {{as a function of}} time, as are the shapes of the sheet for steady-state condition. As multiple solutions exist, stability is studied. The developed model was used to study the deformation behaviour of one paper and two cardboard sheets. Comparisons with finite-element results demonstrate that the developed model provides accurate results. The displacements obtained for steady-state conditions are within + 6 %. Comparisons with previous steady-state analyses reveal important differences in the shape of one <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet.</b> This suggests that the moisture diffusion process may influence the configuration assumed by the sheet at steady-state equilibrium. Hence, {{it may be necessary to}} take the moisture diffusion into account in the analysis to accurately predict the hygro-mechanical behaviour of paper or cardboard sheets...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the end of}} 1797 Paul {{commissioned}} Lvov {{to design}} and build the Priory Palace in Gatchina Park - the largest rammed earth project ever built in Russia. It also used another of Lvov's inventions, a composite roofing material made by impregnating <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> with coal tar and mineral powders. Paul's manager count Prozorovsky forced Lvov to build the palace literally in a swamp, and the Priory, built literally of dirt and dust, was rated to stand for 25 years only. Contrary to expectations [...] it survived over two hundred years, the neglect of Soviet period and the German attempts to destroy it in World War II.|$|R
5000|$|In microgames, {{counters}} {{were printed}} {{on one or}} more sheets of thick paper which the player had to cut for themselves rather than the die-cut <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> included with most board wargames. Dragon Magazine used to include counters printed on a cardstock centerfold for monthly games (especially by Tom Wham).In block wargames, wooden blocks are used instead of cardboard as the counters to represent pieces, in order to emulate the fog of war (by placing the blocks upright to make the information visible to {{only one of the}} players). Often, when units take damage, the counter is rotated to signify the units new attack strength.|$|R
5000|$|Microgames enjoyed {{popularity}} {{during the}} 1980s. The term generally refers to board games or wargames which were packaged and sold with instructions and maps or playing surfaces printed in a booklet format, or as one large sheet folded {{until it became}} [...] "pocket sized" [...] (approximately 4×7 inches). Game pieces (also known as chits or counters) were printed on one or more sheets of thick paper which the player sometimes had to cut for themselves. Other microgames had fully die-cut <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> like those included with most board wargames. [...] Steve Jackson Games used the Pocket Box to package many of their games in this format.|$|R
40|$|The {{terahertz}} {{region of}} the electromagnetic spectrum (300 GHz- 3 THz) has seen {{a lot of interest in}} recent years [1]. In particular the possibilities of imaging concealed threats of a chemical, biological and explosive nature has been proposed [2]. The Wireless Technologies Laboratory at the CSIRO ICT Centre has built a Terahertz imaging demonstrator [3] and a range of research activities is occurring around this demonstrator [4, 5, 6]. Most importantly the demonstrator will allow the performance of our own detector technologies to be evaluated [7] which has been developed using techniques in computational electromagnetics [8, 9, 10] and distributed computing [11, 12]. The demonstrator comprised of a Backward Wave Oscillator source (10 mW, 500 - 700 GHz) [13] a Schottky diode detector [14], and a quasi-optical system which was designed to focus the THz beam onto a 0. 8 mm diameter spot on a sample. Images thus far have been taken in transmission through samples; however, the system can be reconfigured into a reflection mode operation. Figure 1 shows an image of a leaf taken by the system. The image was taken through a <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheet</b> and cloth mesh to demonstrate the ability to distinguish features through concealing media. Figure 1) Left: The THz imaging demonstrator.

40|$|Bumpers play an {{important}} role in preventing the impact energy from being transferred to the automobile and passengers. Saving the impact energy in the bumper to be released in the environment reduces the damages of the automobile and passengers. Therefore researchers have sought to make bumpers lighter without sacrificing strength, ability to absorb impact, or passenger safety. This study investigates the possibility of adding filling material between the bumper and front car body. The experimental tests were conducted and applied on front bumper of Fiat- Sahin vehicle. The results showed the improvement in bumper impact resistance about 260 % when using one layer of honey comb cardboard cell and <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets</b> as filling materials...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with German Shepherd dogs {{in order to establish}} the role of floor type in kennels in the aetiology of canine respiratory diseases catarrhal rhinitis and laryngitis. The tests were performed in 20 boxes with various types of floor bedding: straw, heat-insulating <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets,</b> wood shavings, wooden slats. Catarrhal rhinitis and laryngitis were manifested only in animals reared on concrete floors without beddings. The experiment showed that materials with a low thermal conductivity coefficients should be used for floors in kennel boxes. The all year-round use of suitable bedding materials in the rearing of dogs from all ages is important in the prophylaxis of respiratory infections such as catarrhal rhinitis and laryngitis. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{presumption}} that carnivorous dinosaurs, like Megalosaurus, were quadrupeds was first {{challenged by the}} find of Compsognathus in 1859. That, however, was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known Megalosaurus bones, held by recesses in <b>cardboard</b> <b>sheets,</b> in {{a more or less}} natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like Allosaurus, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.|$|R
