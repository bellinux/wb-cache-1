5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the <b>Community</b> <b>budget</b> over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E

It is the only institution {{not mentioned in the}} original treaties, having been set up in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Delors entered {{office when}} eurosclerosis {{was at its}} height. The slow pace of enlargement, lack of {{democracy}} and economic problems caused that negative and apathetic attitudes to the Community were high. The preceding Thorn Commission was unable to exercise its authority to any meaningful extent {{in the face of}} the British vetoes on EU projects to force a more favourable agreement for it on the <b>Community</b> <b>budget.</b> Delors had previously been one of the architects of the agreement at Fontainebleau, which secured the UK rebate, and Delors intended that the settling of the budget issue should herald a new era of European integration.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 and 1975, the Budgetary {{treaties}} gave Parliament {{power over}} the <b>Community</b> <b>budget.</b> The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the Council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see European Parliament election, 1979). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the Commission as a whole, {{and the right to}} approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.|$|E
500|$|When {{the initial}} {{allegations}} against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the <b>Community</b> <b>budget,</b> President Jacques Santer stated that a no vote would be {{tantamount to a}} vote of no confidence. The Socialist group supported the Commission and saw the issue as {{an attempt by the}} EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, Pauline Green MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-opposition dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down. Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noted that: ...|$|E

Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the <b>community's</b> <b>budget</b> for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: [...] "I found strong indications that [...] [...] [...] auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations [...] [...] [...] The commission is a closed culture {{and they want to}} keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."
