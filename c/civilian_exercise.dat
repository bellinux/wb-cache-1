40|$|SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM: The {{numerous}} {{health benefits}} of physical activity have been well documented, resulting in public health support of regular physical activity and exercise. Although beneficial, exercise also has corresponding risks, including musculoskeletal injuries. The incidence and risk factors for exercise-related injury have been poorly assessed in women. Many <b>civilian</b> <b>exercise</b> activities (e. g., jogging, walking, and erobics) have corollaries in military physical training; injury incidence and risk factors associated with military physical training have been more thoroughly studied. ETIOLOGIC FACTORS: Injury risks increase {{as the amount of}} training increases (increased exposure). The same exercise parameters that can be modified to enhance physical fitness (i. e., frequency, duration, and intensity) also influence the risk for injury in a dose-response manner. Higher levels of current physical fitness (aerobic fitness) protect the participant against future injury. A history of previous injury is a risk factor for future injury. Smoking cigarettes has been associated with increased risk for exercise-related injury. Studies conducted in military populations suggest that the most important risk factor for injuries among persons engaged in vigorous weight-bearing aerobic physical activity might be low aerobic fitness rather than female sex. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION: Because of the limited scientific research regarding women engaging in exercise, general recommendations are provided. Women starting exercise programs should be realistic about their goals and start slowly at frequency, duration, and intensity levels commensurate with their current physical fitness condition. Women should be informed about the early indicators of potential injury. Women who have sustained an injury should take precautions to prevent reinjury (e. g., ensuring appropriate recovery and rehabilitation). RESEARCH AGENDA: In general, a combination of factors affects the risk for exercise-related injury in women. How these factors act singly and in combination to influence injury risk is not well understood. Additional research regarding exercise-related injury in women is needed to answer many of the remaining epidemiologic questions and to help develop exercise programs that improve health while reducing the risk for injury. CONCLUSION: Exercise is an important component in improving and maintaining health; however, injury is also an accompanying risk. A review of key military and civilian research studies regarding exercise-related injuries provides some clues to reducing these injuries in women. Greater adherence to exercise guidelines can help decrease these risks. Injury Prevention and ControlPrevention and ControlCurrent 1558073...|$|E

This thesis explores the concept of autonomy {{with respect to the}} European Union's civil-military operations policy under ESDP, by considering intra-organizational relations (autonomy within organizations) and interorganizational relations (autonomy among organizations) employing Principal-Agent and Resource Dependency theory. A dialectic concept of autonomy is then applied to ESDP and examined through a case study of ESDP civilian and military operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the EU's <b>civilian</b> operations <b>exercise</b> a fairly high amount of autonomy, its military operations are considerably constrained due to member-state prerogatives, a capabilities gap, a subjectivity to United Nations Security Council approval and resource dependence on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} the most important factors necessary for democratic transition in Haiti, and to assess the U. S. role in promoting democracy. This thesis provides an in-depth review of theoretical literature on democratization. The thesis then reviews Haitian history, with a focus on the legacies that have significant implications for the democratization of Haiti. This thesis concludes that the United States' support of democracy in Haiti is a necessary but insufficient condition for establishing democracy in that country. The United States cannot compensate for Haiti's internal shortcomings, but it can seek to affect the two most important internal factors for Haiti's democratization: civil-military relations and political institutions. U. S. support for democracy in Haiti will only succeed if the Haitian <b>civilian</b> government <b>exercises</b> control over the military, and if Haiti's political institutions are efficient and functioning properly.

This review presents a brief examination of civilmilitary relations in Croatia – including past and present factors affecting its development.

The new structures, although tailored for Croatia 2 ̆ 7 s needs, are also very similar to those of Western defense institutions.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the development of an instrument to measure team situation awareness (TSA). Individual team member SA may or may not be shared through communication processes with other team members. Most existing instruments do not measure these processes but measure TSA as a product. Because team members have access to the quality of their communication processes, we developed a self-rating instrument. Advantages, compared to existing TSA instruments, are that it is non-obtrusive with the task and easy to use. Based on a literature review, we selected conditions, processes and outcomes that had to meet three criteria. They had to be relevant for achieving and maintaining TSA, easy to measure, and offer opportunities for team leaders to improve TSA. We administered the instrument in two military and one <b>civilian</b> crisis management <b>exercise.</b> On the basis of these results, we determined psychometric properties such as validity and reliability of the items constituting the instrument. The results of these case studies show that the instrument provides valuable insight to the team leader.
