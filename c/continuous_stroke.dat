In this study, we examined {{their effects on}} the critical swimming velocities (Ucrit), swimming gait patterns, and oral grasping behavior of five California estuarine fishes. All species (4 - 5 cm SL) swam similarly (mean Ucrit range: 30 - 36 cm/s) under day/light conditions. However, both nighttime photophase and darkness decreased Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) swimming velocities. Congeneric Wakasagi (H. nipponensis) swimming performance also decreased at night/dark conditions. Regardless of photophase and illumination, Delta Smelt, Wakasagi, and Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) exhibited three swimming gaits: intermittent stroke-and-glide at low velocities, <b>continuous</b> <b>stroking</b> at moderate velocities, and intermittent burst-and-glide at high velocities near Ucrit. In contrast, Chinook Salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha) used only two swimming gaits: <b>continuous</b> <b>stroking</b> and burst-and-glide under all conditions. Inland Silversides (Menidia beryllina) used these two gaits under light conditions and all three gaits under dark conditions. Some Wakasagi, Splittail, and Chinook Salmon orally grasped the upstream screen in the flume at moderate to high water velocities. Oral grasping does not require jaw teeth and may represent adaptive behavior in natural habitats.

Our focal rings provide an opportunity to assign independent effects to the two dimensions of a display surface, creating implicit gestural modes (e. g. navigation versus scaling) that can be dynamically switched between in the context of a single <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke.</b> A focal ring can define the origin of a Polar or Cartesian frame of reference, interpreting touch gestures directed either through and around, or horizontal and vertical to itself.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of semi-active (SA) structural control systems based on magnetorheological (MR) dampers in earthquake engineering {{is at the}} moment highly questionable {{due to lack of}} experimental information about the long term behavior of MR fluids and MR dampers. As a matter of a fact, MR fluids adopted in smart dampers are essentially made up of magnetizable particles suspended in a fluid carrier. The MR effect is then associated to the uniform distribution of such particles in the fluid. Due to gravity, magnetizable particles tend to settle down in time, making the damper not able to perform as expected. This phenomenon has little or no importance in applications where SA MR dampers are continuously excited. For instance, in smart car dampers, the almost <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> activity shakes the fluid and counteract the settling effect. In earthquake applications, SA MR dampers could stay still for decades before starting to work and, therefore, particles settling could make the dampers useless at the very moment they are needed. In the present paper an experimental activity on SA MR dampers is presented. On a purposefully made testing apparatus, the SA MR dampers have been tested and fully characterized. The devices have been then stored on a shelf of the laboratory for about 5 years, after that one of the original test (harmonic cycles at imposed frequency and displacement amplitude) has been repeated. The comparison of the results may give an interesting insight on the long term behavior of SA MR dampers...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—Anticoagulation is {{a highly}} {{effective}} secondary prevention in patients with cardioembolic stroke and atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF). However, the condition remains underdiagnosed, because paroxysmal AF may be missed by diagnostic tests in the acute phase. In this study, the sensitivity of AF detection was assessed for serial electrocardiographic recordings and <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> unit telemetric monitoring {{with or without a}} structured algorithm to analyze telemetric data (SEA-AF). Methods—Three hundred forty-six consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke were prospectively included and subjected to standard telemetric monitoring. In addition, telemetric data were separately analyzed following SEA-AF, consisting of a structured evaluation of episodes with high risk for AF and a chronological beat-to-beat screening of the full registration. Serial electrocardiograms were conducted in 24 -hour intervals. Results—Median effective telemetry monitoring time was 75. 5 hours (interquartile range 64 – 86 hours). Overall, AF was diagnosed in 119 of 346 patients (34. 4 %). The structured reading algorithm was the most sensitive method to detected AF. Conventional telemetry and serial electrocardiographic assessments were less effective. However, only 35 % of patients with previously documented paroxysmal AF and negative baseline electrocardiogram demonstrated AF episodes during monitoring. Conclusions—Continuous stroke unit telemetry using SEA-AF shows a significantly higher detection rate for AF compared with daily electrocardiographic assessments and standard telemetry without structured reading. The low overall probability to detect paroxysmal AF with either method during the first days after stroke demonstrates the urgent need for complementary diagnostic strategies such as long-term monitoring and frequent follow-up assessments...|$|E

Sensitive detection of pxAF after stroke is crucial for adequate secondary stroke prevention; the optimal diagnostic modality to detect pxAF on stroke units is unknown. We compared 24 -hour Holter electrocardiography (ECG) with <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> unit ECG monitoring (CEM) for pxAF detection. Methods—Patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were prospectively enrolled. After a 12 -channel ECG on admission, all patients received 24 -hour Holter ECG and CEM. Additionally, ECG monitoring data underwent automated analysis using dedicated software to identify pxAF. Patients {{with a history of}} atrial fibrillation or with atrial fibrillation on the admission ECG were excluded. Results—Four hundred ninety-six patients (median age, 69 years; 61. 5 % male) fulfilled all inclusion criteria (ischemic stroke: 80. 4 %; transient ischemic attack: 19. 6 %). Median stroke unit stay lasted 88. 8 hours (interquartile range, 65. 0 – 122. 0). ECG data for automated CEM analysis were available for a median time of 64. 0 hours (43. 0 – 89. 8). Paroxysmal AF was documented in 41 of 496 patients (8. 3 %). Of these, Holter detected pxAF in 34. 1 %; CEM in 65. 9 %; and automated CEM in 92. 7 %.

In GDT, SVV and SV were continuously monitored (FloTrac/Vigileo) and patients were brought to and maintained on the plateau of the Frank-Starling curve (SVV < 10 % and SV increase < 10 % in response to fluid loading). Organ dysfunction was assessed using the SOFA score and resource utilization using the TISS score. Patients were followed up to 28 days for postoperative complications. Main outcome measures were the number of complications (infectious, cardiac, respiratory, renal, hematologic and abdominal post-operative complications), maximum SOFA score and cumulative TISS score during ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and time until fit for discharge. 12 patients had to be excluded from final analysis (6 in each group). During surgery, GDT received more colloids than CON (1, 589 vs. 927 ml, P < 0. 05) and SVV decreased in GDT (from 9. 0 to 8. 0 %, P < 0. 05) but not in CON.

30|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{and postoperative}} management followed institutional standards. During the postoperative period, all patients were {{admitted to the}} ICU and extubated {{after the completion of}} the institutional weaning protocol. At the time of the study, they were intubated, ventilated (volume-controlled regimen), and sedated with propofol and remifentanil to maintain a Ramsay score > 5. For each patient, a radial artery catheter (Leadercath 20 G, Vygon, Ecouen, France), a jugular central venous catheter, and a femoral 5 -F thermistor-tipped arterial catheter (Pulsiocath™ thermodilution catheter PV 2015 L 20 N [Pulsion France sarl, La Montagne, France]) were inserted in the operating room after induction of general anesthesia [14]. The Pulsiocath thermodilution catheter was connected to the stand-alone PiCCO 2 computer PC 8500 version 2.0 (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). Continuous pulse contour cardiac index measurement was initiated after the initial calibration of the system by a triplicate 15 -mL ice-cold normal saline injection through the central venous catheter (transpulmonary thermodilution) [16]. The calibration process was then repeated at the arrival in the ICU and before and after fluid challenge in the ICU. All patients were intubated with a 7.5 -mm ECOM endotracheal tube (ECOM-ETT 7.5 G, ConMed, Utica, NY) after the induction of general anesthesia. This endotracheal tube is specially designed and contains seven silver electrodes on the cuff and tube that continuously measure the bioimpedance signal from the ascending aorta, in close proximity to the trachea [11]. After processing, it provides real-time <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> volume and cardiac index values. At the arrival in ICU, the ECOM pressure monitor was connected to the radial arterial line and then to the ECOM endotracheal tube impedance wires. All pressure monitors were zeroed at the midaxillary line. Intra- and postoperative hemodynamic management were left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, who was not involved in the study protocol and was unaware of the hemodynamic data given by the ECOM system. Hemodynamic therapy in the ICU was guided by usual clinical parameters and values obtained from continuous mean arterial pressure and calibrated pulse contour monitoring. Intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs were used as appropriate. During the brief observation period, ventilator settings, sedation, and vasoactive drugs were continued unchanged.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Patients with stroke {{should have}} access to a {{continuum}} of care from organized stroke units in the acute phase, to appropriate rehabilitation and secondary prevention measures. Moreover to improve the outcomes for acute stroke patients from an organizational perspective, the use of multidisciplinary teams and the delivery of <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> education both to the professionals and to the public, and the implementation of evidence-based stroke care are recommended. Clinical pathways are complex interventions {{that can be used for}} this purpose. However in stroke care the use of clinical pathways remains questionable because little prospective controlled data has demonstrated their effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to determine whether clinical pathways could improve the quality of the care provided to the patients affected by stroke in hospital and through the continuum of the care. Methods Two-arm, cluster-randomized trial with hospitals and rehabilitation long-term care facilities as randomization units. 14 units will be randomized either to arm 1 (clinical pathway) or to arm 2 (no intervention, usual care). The sample will include 238 in each group, this gives a power of 80 %, at 5 % significance level. The primary outcome measure is 30 -days mortality. The impact of the clinical pathways along the continuum of care will also be analyzed by comparing the length of hospital stay, the hospital re-admissions rates, the institutionalization rates after hospital discharge, the patients' dependency levels, and complication rates. The quality of the care provided to the patients will be assessed by monitoring the use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during hospital stay and rehabilitation, and by the use of key quality indicators at discharge. The implementation of organized care will be also evaluated. Conclusion The management of patients affected by stroke involves the expertise of several professionals, which can result in poor coordination or inefficiencies in patient treatment, and clinical pathways can significantly improve the outcomes of these patients. It is proposed that this study will test a new hypothesis and provide evidence of how clinical pathways can work. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov ID [NCT 00673491]</p...|$|E
40|$|Passive leg raising (PLR) is {{a simple}} {{reversible}} maneuver that mimics rapid fluid loading and increases cardiac preload. The effects of this endogenous volume expansion on stroke volume enable the testing of fluid responsiveness with accuracy in spontaneously breathing patients. However, this maneuver requires the determination of stroke volume with a fast-response device, because the hemodynamic changes may be transient. The Vigileo monitor (Vigileo; Flotrac; Edwards Lifesciences; Irvine, CA, USA) analyzes systemic arterial pressure wave and allows <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> volume monitoring. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare changes in stroke volume induced by passive leg raising measured with the Vigileo device and with transthoracic echocardiography and to compare their ability to predict fluid responsiveness. Thirty-four patients with sontaneous breathing activity and considered for volume expansion were included. Measurements of stroke volume were obtained with transthoracic echocardiography (SV-TTE) and with the Vigileo (SV-Flotrac) in a semi-recumbent position, during PLR and after volume expansion (500 ml saline). Patients were responders to volume expansion if SV-TTE increased >= 15 %. Four patients were excluded. No patients received vasoactive drugs. Seven patients presented septic hypovolemia. PLR-induced changes in SV-TTE and in SV-Flotrac were correlated (r 2 = 0, 56, P = 13 % duringPLR was predictive of response to volume expansion with a sensitivity of 100 %. An increase in SV-Flotrac >= 16 % during PLR was predictive of response to volume expansion with a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 90 %. There was no difference between the area under the ROC curve for PLR-induced changes in SV-TTE (AUC = 0. 96 +- 0. 03) or SV-Flotrac (AUC = 0. 92 +- 0. 05). Volume expansion-induced changes in SV-TTE correlated with volume expansion-induced changes in SV-Flotrac (r 2 = 0. 77, P < 0. 0001). In all patients, the highest plateau value of SV-TTE recorded during PLR was obtained within the first 90 s following leg elevation, whereas it was 120 s for SV-Flotrac. PLR-induced changes in SV-Flotrac are able to predict the response to volume expansion in spontaneously breathing patients without vasoactive support.

For this purpose, an image quality simulation and an in vitro study was carried out.

We varied X-ray imaging parameters in a commercially interventional X-ray system to set 3 D image {{quality in the}} contrast–noise–sharpness space. Beam quality was varied to evaluate contrast of the stents while keeping absorbed dose below recommended values. Two detector formats were used, paired with an appropriate pixel size and X-ray focus size. Zoomed reconstructions were carried out and snapshot images acquired. High contrast spatial resolution was assessed with a CT phantom. Results We found an optimal protocol for imaging intracranial nitinol stents. Contrast resolution was optimized for nickel–titanium-containing stents. A high spatial resolution larger than 2. 1 lp/mm allows struts to be visualized.

We designed a pilot study in patients undergoing major abdominal, urologic or vascular surgery to investigate the effects of a goal-directed (GD) fluid management based on <b>continuous</b> <b>stroke</b> volume variation (SVV) and stroke volume (SV) monitoring on postoperative outcomes. Methods: Fifty-two high-risk-surgical patients (ASA 3 or 4, arterial and central venous catheter in place, postoperative admission in ICU) were randomized either to a control group (Group C, n = 26) or to a goal-directed group (Group G, n = 26). Patients with cardiac arrhythmia or ventilated with a tidal volume < 7 ml/kg were excluded. In Group G, SVV and SV were continuously monitored with the FloTrac™/Vigileo™ system (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) and patients were brought to and maintained on the plateau of the Frank-Starling curve (SVV < 10 % and SV increase < 10 % in response to fluid loading). During the ICU stay, organ dysfunction was assessed using the SOFA score and resource utilization using the TISS score. Patients were followed up to 28 days after surgery for infectious, cardiac, respiratory, renal, hematologic and abdominal complications. Results: Group G and Group C were comparable for ASA score, comorbidities, type and duration of surgery (275 vs. 280 minutes), heart rate, MAP and CVP at the start of surgery. However, Group G was younger than Group C (68 vs. 73 years, P < 0. 05). During surgery, Group G received more colloids than Group C (1, 589 vs. 927 ml, P < 0. 05) and SVV decreased in Group G (from 9. 0 to 8. 0 %, P < 0. 05) but not in Group C. The number of postoperative wound infections was lower in Group G (0 vs. 7, P < 0. 01). Although not statistically significant, the proportion of patients with at least one complication (46 vs. 62 %), the number of postoperative complications per patient (0. 65 vs. 1. 40), the maximum ICU SOFA score (5. 9 vs. 7. 2), and the cumulative ICU TISS score (69 vs. 83) were also lower in Group G. ICU and hospital length of stay were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Although the two groups were not perfectly matched, this pilot shows that fluid management based on SVV and SV optimization decreases wound infections.

Diving animals modulate their swimming gaits to promote locomotor efficiency and so enable longer, more productive dives. Beaked whales perform extremely long and deep foraging dives that probably exceed aerobic capacities for some species. Here, we use biomechanical data from suction-cup tags attached to three species of beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris, N = 10; Ziphius cavirostris, N = 9; and Hyperoodon ampullatus, N = 2) to characterize their swimming gaits. In addition to <b>continuous</b> <b>stroking</b> and stroke and-glide gaits described for other diving mammals, all whales produced occasional fluke-strokes with distinctly larger dorsoventral acceleration, which we termed 'type-B' strokes. These high-power strokes occurred almost exclusively during deep dive ascents as part of a novel mixed gait. To quantify body rotations and specific acceleration generated during strokes we adapted a kinematic method combining data from two sensors in the tag. Body rotations estimated with high-rate magnetometer data were subtracted from accelerometer data to estimate the resulting surge and heave accelerations. Using this method, we show that stroke duration, rotation angle and acceleration were bi-modal for these species, with B-strokes having 76 % of the duration, 52 % larger body rotation and four times more surge than normal strokes. The additional acceleration of B-strokes did not lead to faster ascents, but rather enabled brief glides, which may improve the overall efficiency of this gait. Their occurrence towards the end of long dives leads us to propose that B-strokes may recruit fast-twitch fibres that comprise similar to 80 % of swimming muscles in Blainville's beaked whales, thus prolonging foraging time at depth.

40|$|Our testing {{protocol}} was similar though not {{identical to the}} protocol developed by Crawford et al. (3) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1989. Dr. Crawford compressed his experimental limbs 7. 65 cm {{at a rate of}} 3. 85 cm/s, which approached the maximum reliable <b>continuous</b> cycling <b>stroke</b> rate available on his equipment. Our maximum continuous cycling rate was 2. 1 cm/s with a deflection of 6. 75 cm, which was the limit of our equipment. Our primary objectives were to measure and compare energy absorbed by limbs when different versions of commercial equine sports medicine boots were applied and relate that absorption to previously gathered data on the prototype of the commercial product. Admittedly, our current maximum loading rate, 2. 1 cm/s, as well as the original experimental loading rate, 3. 8 cm/s, was lower than that expected with physiological loading with normal equine locomotion. The previous and current experimental protocol used quasi-static testing that is characterized by low loading rates that are useful for a first approximation. The current data, and that previously obtained at University of Wisconsin-Madison, have inherit limitations of in vitro data, and their extrapolation to in vivo conditions must be approached with caution. Measuring the effects of commercial equine sports boots on the kinematics and kinetics of the distal limbs and fetlocks in live horses working at speed are necessary to validate th...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditionally, {{blood transfusions}} in the {{perioperative}} setting {{are used to}} maintain adequate delivery of nutrients and oxygen to organs. However, the effect of blood administration on tissue oxygenation in the perioperative setting remains poorly understood. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine changes in muscle tissue oxygenation saturation (SmO 2) in response to perioperative blood transfusions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were enrolled. SmO 2, <b>continuous</b> hemoglobin (SpHb), <b>stroke</b> volume (SV), cardiac index, and standard hemodynamic parameters including heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and arterial oxygen saturation (SO 2) were recorded. To assess fluid responsiveness, a passive leg raise (PLR) test was performed before the transfusions were started. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in the analysis.

40|$|L-glutamate plays a {{vital role}} in central nervous system. It is a {{neurotransmitter}} associated with several neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and <b>stroke.</b> <b>Continuous</b> and fast monitoring of this neurotransmitter has become a major concern for neuroscientists throughout the world. A simple, sensitive, and reliable L-glutamate microsensor with short response time has been developed using ceramic-based microelectrode arrays with platinum recording sites. The electrodes were modified by electrodeposition of Platinum black (Pt-black) to detect hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) which was produced by enzymatic reactions of glutamate oxidase immobilized on the electrode surface. Modification of Pt electrodes with Pt-black has been adopted because the microscale roughness of Pt-black increases the effective surface area of the electrode and promotes efficiency of H 2 O 2 electro-oxidation. The modified Pt recording sites were coated with m-phenylenediamine (mPD) and L-glutamate oxidase (L-GluOx). mPD acts as an barrier for extracellular interferents such as ascorbic acid and dopamine, thus increasing the selectivity of electrode fo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{impedance}} or admittance cardiography is {{a simple}} method for non-invasive, <b>continuous</b> measurement the <b>stroke</b> volume and cardiac output. For the Electrical impedance cardiography, the band-electrodes array proposed by Kubicek et al has been widely used, and various spot-electrodes array have been experimented {{in search of a}} less uncomfortable and equally reliable electrodes array that is easier to attach. From the uniformity of current distribution on the thorax, we have reinvestigated focusing on the measurement of contour maps of static and pulsatile components of a regional area along the medial line on the frontal part of the thorax. Consequently, the appropriate electrodes locations for current injection were determined as the back of an ear and on the lower abdomen, while those for voltage pick-up was on the medial portion at the level of clavicle and on the portion above the xiphisternum. Preliminary comparison experiments between the cardiac output values obtained by the electrical impedance cardiography and by a pulse dye-densitometry showed a fairy good agreement. I...|$|R

Finally, we comment on possible study design characteristics that might make future trials more successful. CPAP Treatment in Stroke Survivor...|$|R
