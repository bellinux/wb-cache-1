40|$|Primary cooling &ndash; {{inside the}} tundish &ndash; {{has a great}} impact over the {{thickness}} of the solidified steel crust. If on exiting the tundish the crust is too thin, it can punch and break, {{as a result of the}} ferrostatic pressure exerted from the inside by the liquid steel as well as because of the weight of the molten steel. The parameters that influence the amount of dissipated heat depend on the cooling water flow of the tundish, on the pressure and temperature of the cooling water but also on the overheating of the continuously cast steel. The secondary cooling takes place at the exit of the semi-finished product from the tundish, when the solidification is supposed to take place all along the cross section of the strand. In order to achieve it, in addition to a correctly managed primary cooling, it is necessary to obtain the proper correlation of the factors that influence the secondary cooling as well: the water flow rate long the three zones of the installation and its pressure in the secondary circuit. All these have in view a proper solidification length; an intense cooling can generate cracks due to the thermal stress, while a too slow cooling can generate a partial solidification of the strand up to the <b>cropping</b> <b>machine</b> area. The paper presents a mathematical simulation of the continuously cast steel solidification.

The evolution of mechanical threshers to secure the ever growing consumption of cereal has been hindered by several factors which have lead to low performance of several developed threshers. It has been discovered and observed by various researchers that performance of cereal threshers is highly dependent on the value of its working parameters. This work gives an insight into influence of <b>crop,</b> <b>machine</b> and operating parameters on performance of cereal threshers using a computer aided software for simulation of these parameter values. The parameters were varied at six levels and the simulations were performed by varying each parameter while the rest parameters were kept constant. It was observed that threshing efficiency increased for all increasing values of cylinder speed and bulk density, decreased for all increasing values of feed rate and concave clearance, and increased for increasing values of moisture content up to 17 % and decreased after wards. Also threshing loss was found to increase for all increasing values of feed rate and concave clearance, decreased for all increasing values of cylinder speed and bulk density, and decreased for all increasing values of moisture content up to 17 % and then increased after wards, similar effects on the efficiency and losses was observed in the capacity and unthreshed grain cases respectively.

The objective of this project is design and construction of a row <b>crop</b> thinning <b>machine.</b> Four main system units are plant sensors, ground sensors, control and thinning platforms. In this machine the unwanted plants on the rows are randomly removed by employing a pneumatically system. A blade on a vertical arm with pendulum motion removes the plant from the rows. The machine control system consists of an arm and a blade which is activated by a double acting cylinder and equipped with a relay and a timer. The pneumatic cylinder is controlled via a solenoid valve. Laboratory tests were conducted to validate the machine performance. Some other preliminary tests also were performed for optimization of parameters such as cinematic index and cutting length of blades. The laboratory tests (totally 9 tests) were performed with a constant forward speed and three levels of plant density, using artificial plants. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results show that satisfactory performance of the machine is achieved when the plant density is moderate i. e. the thinning performance reduces with higher plant distance in the row. The other effective variable on machine performance is the adjustment of sensor sensitivity, which is used to distinguish between week and strong plants.

40|$|Combine {{harvesters}} play a {{key role}} in agriculture as threshable crops take up about two thirds of the worldwide arable land. From an economic perspective there is a continuous demand for increased productivity of these machines, but the limits for the outside dimensions have been reached and the increased processing efficiency should not compromise the quality of the end product. The reduction of the straw length in the threshing section of a combine harvester is considered to be an important indicator for the crop processing quality. An aggressive threshing action or discontinuous flow of the crop material invokes high impact and friction forces on the crop. This breaks up the straw, resulting in a swath of low volume which complicates the subsequent baling process. Therefore, the impact of the settings of the threshing process on the straw quality, expressed in terms of the swath volume has been assessed in this study. An experimental design involving different combinations of machine settings has been applied and for each of these setting combinations the resulting swaths have been scanned with a LiDaR (Light Detection and Ranging) -sensor. By a backward stepwise regression a quadratic relation between the concave clearance and rotor speed setting and the swath height was found (R²= 0. 79). All terms in the model were significant (p value of F-statistic < 0. 05). The observed relation between machine parameters and straw quality is interpreted as a combination of forces on the crop and residence time of the crop in the threshing and separation section.

The political economic arrangement of the Green Revolution, alongside a post-war focus on economies of scale and export-oriented growth, replace high-yield single varieties of crops for a diverse array of varieties that may not have the same yield, but may be able to resist pests, disease, and changing climatic conditions. Also, the harvest does not flow in all directions equally: Whereas small holder subsistence farming uses a large variety of crops as a food source and small-scale trade, the industrial economic system requires simplified, machine harvested ship-loads of one variety of maize, for example. Diverse varieties of different <b>crops</b> confound the <b>machines,</b> whereas one variety of wheat can be harvested with one setting on a machine. However, none of this is new. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze how the twin concerns of lost varietals and lost cultures are bound together in the socio-political process of standardization, and to explain some areas of resistance...|$|R

Weed spot spraying has potential to increase sugarcane production whilst reducing chemical usage and environmentally damaging runoff. However, weed spot spraying is traditionally a laborious manual task. This paper {{reports on a}} precision machine vision system that was developed to automatically identify and target the difficult to control weed Panicum spp. (Guinea Grass) in sugarcane <b>crops.</b> The infield <b>machine</b> vision system comprised a camera and artificial illumination to enable day and night trials. Image analysis algorithms were developed to discriminate Guinea Grass and sugarcane based on colour and textural differences between the species. A positive weed identification from the image analysis activated solenoid-controlled spray nozzles. Evaluations of the system in a sugarcane crop established that the image analysis algorithm parameters required frequent recalibration during the day but that the requirement for recalibration was reduced at night with constant artificial illumination. The algorithm was only effective at detecting mature Guinea Grass. The developed technology is considered {{a viable alternative to}} manual spot spraying of mature Guinea Grass in sugarcane at night. A cost benefit analysis of the new weed control system indicated potential grower savings of $ 170 /ha by adopting the technology. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Assessment of {{the total}} costs of {{agricultural}} farm is important to decide for selection of optimum combination of machinery, crops and farming system that can maximize profit. The decision on optimum combination of these factors by customary way is quite difficult due to their natural complexity. A computer system was develop in Excel-Visual basic software for farm management decision making, and to estimate machinery and the whole farm costs and net return from crops grown under different farming systems. The system deals with four crops and three farming systems by using tractor and six machines. The input data includes: <b>crops</b> type, operations, <b>machine</b> and inputs cost. The system was verified, validated, analyzed and its accuracy was approved. The system outputs change with various input parameters like farm size, <b>machines</b> used and <b>crops</b> combination. Application of the system showed that annual working hours, size and age of machines affect the fixed and total operation costs. The least operation cost was obtained by conventional farming system followed by zero tillage and heavy machinery system. Different crops varied in their costs when grown alone or in combinations in different farming systems. The lowest and highest net returns were obtained by growing sorghum alone with heavy machinery farming system and by growing the four crops in Zero-Tillage farming system. The system {{can be used as}} pre-season planning and management decision tool...|$|R
40|$|As {{the working}} width of sowing {{implements}} increases, {{the use of}} conventional mechanical seed drills, with hoppers above all the implement working width, has reachedits limits. Any further increase of the working width (more than 4 - 6 m) or the coupling of conventional additional apparatus is expensive, complex and time-consuming. Air-seeding appears thus as the best solution to solve this problem. One storage hopper is able to supply the working width of 24 m or more. However, it should be noticed that to ensure uniform <b>crop</b> growing, a <b>machine</b> needs an accurate, technical solution to ensure seeding material to be distributed across the full implement working width. Indeed, low transversal distribution accuracy {{is one of the}} most important shortcomings of modem air-seeders. Even if air-seeding has been used for more than 50 years, few developments have been carried out on divider headers responsible for distribution accuracy. This paper deals with a study on the influence of divider head geometry and functioning conditions on the seed's distribution accuracy. The first part concerns the study of the influence of the air velocity and the material flow rate on the distribution accuracy. A second study deals with the influence of the outlet closing, of different outlet pipes lengths, of distribution head tightness, of the angle position of distribution heads. Finally the influence of the structural elements such as the pipe elbow, the tower configurations, the tower height and the cone shape deflectors' implementation on the divider lid is proposed. Moreover, observation of the seed's behaviour is undertaken using a high-speed camera system. These experimental results allowed for proposals of hypothesis about the parameters influencing the final result. This paper also proposes theoretical and mathematical explanations of the observed effects, necessary for future divider heads design...|$|R
40|$|Indian {{agriculture}} {{relies on}} monsoon rainfall and irrigation from surface and groundwater. The interannual variability of monsoon rainfalls is high, which forces South Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated areas to local water availability. In this study, {{we have developed}} and tested a methodology for monitoring these spatiotemporal variations using Sentinel- 1 and - 2 observations over the Kudaliar catchment, Telangana State (~ 1000 km 2). These free radar and optical data have been acquired since 2015 {{on a weekly basis}} over continental areas, at a high spatial resolution (10 – 20 m) that is well adapted to the small areas of South Indian field <b>crops.</b> A <b>machine</b> learning algorithm, the Random Forest method, was used over three growing seasons (January to March and July to November 2016 and January to March 2017) to classify small patches of inundated rice paddy, maize, and other irrigated crops, as well as surface water stored in the small reservoirs scattered across the landscape. The crop production comprises only irrigated crops (less than 20 % of the areas) during the dry season (Rabi, December to March), to which rain-fed cotton is added to reach 60 % of the areas during the monsoon season (Kharif, June to November). Sentinel- 1 radar backscatter provides useful observations during the cloudy monsoon season. The lowest irrigated area totals were found during Rabi 2016 and Kharif 2016, accounting for 3. 5 and 5 % with moderate classification confusion. This confusion decreases with increasing areas of irrigated crops during Rabi 2017. During this season, 16 % of rice and 6 % of irrigated crops were detected after the exceptional rainfalls observed in September. Surface water in small surface reservoirs reached 3 % of the total area, which corresponds to a high value. The use of both Sentinel datasets improves the method accuracy and strengthens our confidence in the resulting maps. This methodology shows the potential of automatically monitoring, in near real time, the high short term variability of irrigated area totals in South India, as a proxy for estimating irrigated water and groundwater needs. These are estimated over the study period to range from 49. 5 ± 0. 78 mm (1. 5 % uncertainty) in Rabi 2016, and 44. 9 ± 2. 9 mm (6. 5 % uncertainty) in the Kharif season, to 226. 2 ± 5. 8 mm (2. 5 % uncertainty) in Rabi 2017. This variation must be related to groundwater recharge estimates that range from 10 mm to 160 mm·yr− 1 in the Hyderabad region. These dynamic agro-hydrological variables estimated from Sentinel remote sensing data are crucial in calibrating runoff, aquifer recharge, water use and evapotranspiration for the spatially distributed agro-hydrological models employed to quantify the impacts of agriculture on water resources...|$|R
