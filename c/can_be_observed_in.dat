5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680.

These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these changes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> {{the addition of the}} portico and porte-cochere. Inside the home, the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E

5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing of this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking {{a portion of the}} East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Result {{from the}} {{expansion}} of the British Empire, British cultural influence <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture.|$|E
5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Much circumstantial {{evidence}} points to the participation of Germanic people from Polish lands in the events {{that took place in}} the first half of the 1st century BC and found their culmination in Gaul in 58 BC, as related in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. At the time of the Suebi tribal confederation led by Ariovistus arrival in Gaul, a rapid decrease of settlement density <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the areas of the upper and middle Oder River basin. In fact the Gubin group of the Jastorf culture disappeared then entirely, which may indicate this group's identity with one of the Suebi tribes. The western regions of the Przeworsk culture were also vacated (Lower Silesia, Lubusz Land and western Greater Poland), which is where the tribes accompanying the Suebi tribes must have come from. Burial sites and artifacts characteristic of the Przeworsk culture have been found in Saxony, Thuringia and Hesse, on the route of the Suebi offensive. The above-mentioned regions of western Poland had not become repopulated and economically developed again until in the 2nd century AD.|$|E

5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{music and}} sound was also {{thoroughly}} post-processed by the project's sound designer, Andrei Toncu, {{to improve the}} quality of the recordings, because the budget did not allow for complex equipment to be used, and for creative interest. The movie's background music has reduced volume, following the emotional evolution of the charactersToncu combining the background music (recorded with, or without intention) and a series of effects characteristic to electronic music and musique concrète. However, a few distinct moments <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the film's music, either composed by Andrei Toncu (Andrei imagining stealing the trolleybus), or already existing recordings, edited so that they would integrate into the movie's atmosphere (Elvis Presley's dedication is dynamically equalized to suggest the shift from one radio to another). Another scene in which multiple layers of sound were used was the radio show heard in Giani's car about the breeding of Memestra brassicae butterflies.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, {{can be seen in}} those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E

5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip.

The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel.
