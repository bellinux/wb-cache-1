5|$|Following their {{tour with}} Elliot Minor, {{the writing process}} for the new album began. Although all the music's writing was {{credited}} to the entire band, vocalist Josh Franceschi and guitarist Max Helyer were usually the biggest <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> among the group, being responsible for the ideas behind the songs. The band's work resulted in the album having a sound that most critics associated with pop punk, though this result was unintended. The album was recorded in two weeks at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire with producers Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|The series, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, currently consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, {{was released in}} 2009. The <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After XIII and Type-0s releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was distanced from the series brand for marketing purposes despite retaining thematic connections.|$|E

50|$|The {{reality is}} that P&D Enterprises, while a real company, is solely devoted to {{providing}} a safe and contented existence for Bradford. For, earlier on, psychological probing has revealed to Project Genesis' staff that the phenomenon that led them to Bradford {{is in fact the}} <b>Creative</b> <b>Force</b> that brought the Universe into being in the first place, and (while not immediately clear to the Project staff) the <b>Creative</b> <b>Force</b> has sought Bradford as a hiding place from a Universe that has become tiresomely overwhelmingly complex and the Destructive <b>Force</b> whom the <b>Creative</b> <b>Force</b> had originally brought into being a self-made opponent to stave off ennui. The <b>Creative</b> <b>Force</b> now seeks shelter amongst its favored beings. Hedgemore did not commit suicide, but willingly abdicated his top position and lives in cloistered seclusion within the P&D buildings, never meeting Bradford.|$|R

25|$|During the series' run, it {{received}} critical acclaim from viewers and critics, holding a substantial 8.8/10 on TV.com, {{and a high}} 7.7/10 from reviews on IMDb. Many praised the show for its appeal to children and adults. According to creator Dan Schneider, Drake & Josh had its highest ratings in its final season, and ended due to a collective decision from the <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> behind the show. To this day, Drake & Josh has widely been considered one of Nickelodeon's best live-action shows, if {{not one of the}} best Nickelodeon shows of all time.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Lee Hayes Jr. (August 20, 1942 – August 10, 2008) was an American singer-songwriter, actor, voice {{actor and}} producer.

25|$|The {{new look}} of Harper's Bazaar {{emphasized}} culture {{for its own}} sake. Taking advantage of Brodovitch's contacts in Europe and his wide knowledge of photography, the magazine introduced the work of many artists and photographers to its American audience. Before starting at Harper's Bazaar, Brodovitch organized a return trip to France, hoping to convince old friends {{to work with him}} at the magazine. Each summer he would return to offer commissions to artists and photographers until 1939 when the start of World War II made it impossible. By continually bringing in <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> from overseas, he kept the magazine permanently fresh and cutting-edge. Among the artists that worked for Bazaar were Jean Cocteau, Raoul Dufy, Leonor Fini, Marc Chagall, Man Ray and A. M. Cassandre, the most eminent poster artist in France at the time, replacing the former cover favorite, Erté.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s the {{atmosphere}} in Urdu literature became very depressing. The progressive movement was almost dead and the modernist movement had started running out of ideas. But this was also the time for an upsurge of new <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> rooted in the new life that was metamorphosing the socio-economic and political climate in the sub-continent. It was under this climate that a new era of fiction started with the publication of Paigham Afaqui's novel Makaan. Afaqui and other writers refused to be identified by any movement and displayed complete independence in using personally developed styles and techniques for writing novels and explored their own philosophy and vision of life. It was a serious departure from the theme of independence which dominated writers like Qurratulain Hyder and Abdullah Hussain and the theme of existentialism which was the benchmark of modernism. Writers like Ghazanfer and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have further widened the horizons of new themes and concerns.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the few}} writer-artists at the time, Steranko {{made use}} of a {{cinematic}} style of storytelling. Strausbaugh credits {{him as one of}} Marvel's strongest <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> during the late 1960s, his art owing a large debt to Salvador Dalí. [...] Steranko started by inking and penciling the details of Kirby's artwork on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. beginning in Strange Tales #151, but by Strange Tales #155 Stan Lee had put him in charge of both writing and drawing Fury's adventures. He exaggerated the James Bond-style spy stories, introducing the vortex beam (which lifts objects), the aphonic bomb (which explodes silently), a miniature electronic absorber (which protected Fury from electricity), and the Q-ray machine (a molecular disintegrator)—all in his first 11-page story.|$|E

500|$|The driving <b>creative</b> <b>forces</b> behind Anglo-American were Ted McCall, {{the writer}} of the Men of the Mounted and Robin Hood strips, and artist Ed Furness.

[...] Anglo-American also {{published}} stories based on imported American scripts bought from Fawcett Publications, with fresh artwork by Canadians to bypass trade restrictions. Captain Marvel and Bulletman were amongst the characters that had Canadian adaptations. [...] Anglo-American published {{a large number of}} titles, including Freelance, Grand Slam, Three Aces, Whiz, Captain Marvel and Atom Smasher, but relied less on serials, and was less patriotically Canadian than its rival publishers. [...] It employed a number of talented artists, but they were kept to a [...] "house style" [...] of drawing, in the vein of Captain Marvel's C.C. Beck.|$|E

500|$|The Byrds' second album, Turn! Turn! Turn!, was {{released}} in December 1965 and while it received a mostly positive reception, critical consensus deemed it to be inferior to the band's debut. [...] Nonetheless, it was a commercial success, peaking at number 17 on the U.S. charts and number 11 in the UK. [...] Author Scott Schinder has noted that, along with Mr. Tambourine Man, the Turn! Turn! Turn! album served to establish the Byrds as one of rock music's most important <b>creative</b> <b>forces,</b> {{on a par with}} the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones. [...] Like their debut, the album comprised a mixture of group originals, folk songs, and Bob Dylan covers, all characterized by the group's clear harmonies and McGuinn's distinctive guitar sound. [...] However, the album featured more of the band's own compositions than its predecessor, with Gene Clark in particular coming to the fore as a songwriter. [...] His songs from this period, including [...] "She Don't Care About Time", [...] "The World Turns All Around Her", and [...] "Set You Free This Time", are widely regarded by critics as among the best of the folk rock genre. [...] The latter song was even chosen for release as a single in January 1966, but its densely worded lyrics, melancholy melody, and ballad-like tempo contributed to it stalling at number 63 on the Billboard chart and failing to reach the UK chart altogether.|$|E
