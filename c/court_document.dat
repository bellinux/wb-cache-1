25|$|What {{is crucial}} in setting the level of {{formality}} in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a <b>court</b> <b>document.</b> And an email message to a friend and client, updating {{the status of a}} legal matter, is appropriately informal.|$|E

[...] As these statements would have been self-incriminating, {{they could not be}} used as evidence under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

2500|$|After telling Atwater {{that she}} would be taken to jail, Turek demanded her driver's license and proof of insurance. When Atwater {{informed}} Turek that her license and insurance card were in her purse that had been stolen a couple of days before, Turek told Atwater that he had [...] "heard that story two-hundred times." [...] Atwater provided her address from her checkbook. Atwater then asked Turek to allow her to take her [...] "frightened, upset, and crying" [...] children to a friend's home just two houses down before taking her to jail, but he refused her request. Turek told her [...] "ou're not going anywhere" [...] and stated that her children could accompany her to the police station. A friend of Atwater's who came to the scene took the children into her care while the officer arrested Atwater. Turek handcuffed Atwater, in front of her two young children, placed her in his squad car, did not fasten her seat belt, and drove her to the police station to be booked. [...] According to the <b>court</b> <b>document,</b> [...] "booking officers had her remove her shoes, jewelry, and eyeglasses, and empty her pockets. Officers took Atwater's 'mug shot' and placed her alone in a jail cell for about one hour." [...] A magistrate released Atwater on $310 bond. She later paid three $50 fines for each violation of Texas's seat belt law (one for her and each of her children). The charges of driving without a license and without proof of insurance were dismissed.|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 Western Conference Finals {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the best series in NBA playoff history, with the last four games coming down to the final seconds. Two games were decided on game winning shots and Game 7 was decided in overtime. However, the series was marred by controversy and allegations of corruption. On June 10, 2008, convicted NBA referee Tim Donaghy's attorney filed a <b>court</b> <b>document</b> alleging that Game 6 was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy [...] "learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series." [...] The Lakers won Game 6 106-102, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter, and went on to win the series, and eventually the NBA championship. The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that in order to increase television ratings and ticket sales, [...] "top executives of the NBA sought to manipulate games using referees". It also said that NBA officials would tell referees to not call technical fouls on certain players, and states that a referee was privately reprimanded by the league for ejecting a star player in the first quarter of a January 2000 game. Stern denied the accusations, calling Donaghy a [...] "singing, cooperating witness".|$|E

2500|$|The charter is {{accepted}} as genuine by some, and as having some basis in fact by others. Ponce {{was very young}} {{at the time of}} his arrival in León is probable in light of the contours of his subsequent career. His first appearance in a <b>court</b> <b>document</b> dates to 9 September 1140, when he witnessed an act of Alfonso VII's as alférez, that is, armiger and standard-bearer of the royal mesnada (military retinue). This office was usually reserved for the scions of noble houses and other young and aspiring aristocrats. At the time of his advent in León in 1127 he would therefore have been placed in an aristocratic household capable of raising him, and the king's sister is known to have raised at least one other young nobleperson in her court: Urraca Rodríguez, daughter of Rodrigo González de Lara, whom she remembered in her (undated) will as [...] "Urraca, daughter of Count Rodrigo, whom I raised". Likewise, the village of Argavallones must have been acquired by Ponce sometime before his marriage, since he gave it to his bride as her arras (bridewealth), along with all his lands at Carrizo, San Pedro del Páramo (modern San Pedro de las Dueñas), and Grulleros (Grulerius). According to a document in the Tumbo Antiguo cartulary of Carrizo, Argavallones was located near Grulleros, just west of Villaverde de Sandoval (Sot noval). It may be supposed that the forged eighteenth-century charter was designed to replace an authentic lost charter. This document aside, the earliest reference to Ponce's marriage to Estefanía is from 13 February 1146, when Alfonso VII rewarded them with a grant of land at Villamoros de Mansilla [...] "for the service to me which you [...] have done and are doing".|$|E
