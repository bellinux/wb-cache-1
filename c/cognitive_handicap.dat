40|$|Purpose: Mesulam's (1986) {{mystery is}} that some {{patients}} with frontal lobe damage may show no cognitive impairment according to traditional office-based assessment procedures, yet nevertheless show marked <b>cognitive</b> <b>handicap</b> in everyday life. Mesulam suggested that "the office setting may introduce sufficient external structure to suppress some of these behavioral tendencies" (p. 322). We ask if it is indeed the office setting that is the problem, {{or whether it is}} that traditional assessments do not measure the full range of cognitive functions supported by prefrontal cortex. Method: Neuropsychological case series study and review. Results: Traditional methods for assessing cognitive deficits following frontal lobe damage typically do not measure the full range of deficits that can occur. In particular, rostral prefrontal cortex supports functions which are not routinely assessed yet are crucial to competent everyday life performance. These include meta-memory functions (e. g. context and source memory), complex behavioural co-ordination (e. g. prospective memory and multitasking), and mentalizing. Conclusions: New clinical assessment procedures are required urgently. These could be based, in principle, both on recent experimental findings from cognitive neuroscience, and observation of behaviour outside office settings. These procedures could then be administered in an office setting...|$|E

Objective: To investigate a possible neuroanatomical substrate based on neuroimaging evaluation in children with DLD. Methods: The authors obtained psychological assessment, language evaluation, neurologic examination, and neuroimaging investigation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: children {{should be at least}} 4 years of age; primary complaint of language delay; normal hearing; IQ > 70; and an informed consent form signed by parents or guardians. Exclusion criteria were severe motor and <b>cognitive</b> <b>handicap.</b> Results: Fifteen children met all inclusion criteria. Ages ranged from 4 to 14 years and 11 were boys. Six patients presented diffuse polymicrogyria (PMG) around the entire extent of the sylvian fissure on MRI, and they had severe clinical manifestation of DLD: they did not speak at all or had mixed phonologic-syntactic deficit syndrome. Six children presented PMG restricted to the posterior aspects of the parietal regions, and they had a milder form of DLD: mainly phonologic programming deficit syndrome. The other three children had different imaging findings. Conclusions: Developmental language disorder can be associated with polymicrogyria and the clinical manifestation varies according to the extension of cortical abnormality. A subtle form of posterior parietal polymicrogyria presenting as developmental language disorder is a mild form of perisylvian syndrome...|$|E

It is suggested that in dealing with depressed LD children their affective state and their personality be taken into account as well as their obvious <b>cognitive</b> <b>handicap.</b> There has been a considerable upsurge of interest in childhood depression over the past decade. The psychoanalytic viewpoint that it cannot exist, owing to the lack of superego development in chil-dren (Rie 1966) no longer seems to hold sway. Similarly, the argument that child-hood depression should not be regarded as a separate syndrome because it is a transitory phenomenon (Lefkowitz & Bur-ton 1978) has been strongly criticized (Costello 1980). There is still some sup-port, however, for the point of view that although childhood depression exists as a clinical entity it manifests itself in a different form from adult depression, e. g., as a conduct disorder, hyperactivity, somatic symptoms, school phobia, learn-ing disability, etc., and dysphoria which is the hallmark of depression in adults may not be conspicuous (Leon, Kendall, & Garber 1980; Morris 1981). At present the most widely held view of childhood depression appears to be that children experience depression in much the same way as adults but that there are neverthe-less some minor differences in its ex-pression since the child is still develop-ing and inhabits a different milieu fro...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} year in the Innovation Engineering Program, at Halmstad University, a degree project was {{performed}} that was carried out during Fall semester in 2006 and Spring semester 2007. The project was performed by two students in corporation with LIC Audio AB, a company in Stockholm. The degree project was meant to result in a communication aid for people with a <b>cognitive</b> <b>handicap.</b> The project focused on people suffering from dementia because of the expressed need within this group. This aid should first and foremost help in a conversation between a person with dementia and another person, like a relative or nursing home staff. The two main problems that occur during a conversation with a person suffering from dementia is that the dementian have a hard time understanding the conversation, because of the disease, and that they, because of their age, have reduced hearing ability and even though they would need a hearing aid, they don’t use it. It was established early on in the project that the aid wasn’t supposed to be handled by the dementian but by the other person in the conversation. Through studies of different focus groups and a close contact with experts in the area, the project group have developed an aid where the basic function is based on improving the communication through pictures and amplified sound. The solution has passed through both functional tests and user tests and has been evaluated by a large network of involved stakeholders, with very positive results.

The need to structure these programs for outpatient and community care with a vision for long-term maintenance has been recognised. In Reunion Island, an area affected by epidemiological and nutritional transition, diabetes affects 18 % {{of the adult population}} over 30 years, with major social disparities, poor glycaemic control and frequent cardiovascular complications. Methods/Design ERMIES is a randomised controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a long-term (2 years) structured group self management educational intervention in improving blood glucose in non-recent, insufficiently controlled diabetes. After an initial structured educational cycle carried out blind for the intervention arm, patients will be randomised in two parallel group arms of 120 subjects: structured on-going group with educational intervention maintained over two years, versus only initial education. Education sessions are organised through a regional diabetes management network, and performed by trained registered nurses at close quarters. The educational approach is theoretically based (socio-constructivism, social contextualisation, empowerment, action planning) and reproducible, thanks to curricula and handouts for educators and learners. The subjects will be recruited from five hospital outpatient settings all over Reunion Island. The main eligibility criteria include: age ≥ 18 years, type 2 diabetes treated for more than one year, HbA 1 c[*]≥[*] 7. 5 % for ≥ 3 months, without any severe evolving complication (ischaemic or proliferative retinopathy, severe renal insufficiency, coronaropathy or evolving foot lesion), and absence of any major physical or <b>cognitive</b> <b>handicap.</b> The primary outcome measure is HbA 1 c evolution between inclusion and 2 years. The secondary outcome measures include anthropometric indicators, blood pressure, lipids, antidiabetic medications, level of physical activity, food ingestion, quality of life, social support, anxiety, depression levels and self-efficacy. An associated nested qualitative study will be conducted with 30 to 40 subjects in order to analyse the learning and adaptation processes during the education cycles, and throughout the study.

40|$|Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia (PCH) is {{group of}} very rare, {{inherited}} progressive neurodegenerative disorders with prenatal onset. Up to now seven different subtypes {{have been reported}} (PCH 1 - 7). The incidence of each subtype is unknown. All subtypes share common characteristics, including hypoplasia/atrophy of cerebellum and pons, progressive microcephaly, and variable cerebral involvement. Patients have severe <b>cognitive</b> and motor <b>handicaps</b> and seizures are often reported. Treatment is only symptomatic and prognosis is poor, as most patients die during infancy or childhood. The genetic basis of different subtypes has been elucidated, which makes prenatal testing possible in families with mutations. Mutations in three tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit genes {{were found to be}} responsible for PCH 2, PCH 4 and PCH 5. Mutations in the nuclear encoded mitochondrial arginyl- tRNA synthetase gene underlie PCH 6. The tRNA splicing endonuclease, the mitochondrial arginyl- tRNA synthetase and the vaccinia related kinase 1 are mutated in the minority of PCH 1 cases. These genes are involved in essential processes in protein synthesis in general and tRNA processing in particular.

40|$|Knowledge about cause, pathogenesis, and {{manifestations of}} {{hereditary}} metabolic diseases puts them {{among the best}} known of all human diseases. On the other hand, outcomes of treatment are cause for uncertainty and concern. In 1985, Hayes et al. analyzed efficacy of treatment up to 1983 in 65 of these diseases selected randomly from the McKusick catalogs. Disease scores were calculated for seven parameters: longevity; reproductive capability; somatic and <b>cognitive</b> development; and <b>handicaps</b> affecting schooling, work, and cosmetic appearance. Scores of the untreated and treated phenotypes were then compared. We have now measured progress over the past decade by calculating scores on the same 65 diseases from data in several hundred new reports published since 1983. All seven parameters in the 1993 survey reflect improved efficacy of treatment in the 10 -year interval. However, the percent of diseases for which all manifestations of the disease were removed by treatment has not changed (12 % in 1983; 12 % in 1993). The group in which manifestations were untouched by treatment has become smaller (48 % in 1983; 31 % in 1993), and the group partially ameliorated by treatment had increased reciprocally (40 % in 1983; 57 % in 1993). Progress in the treatment of hereditary metabolic disease is thus better than it was, but it is still only a partial success. The advances are attributable to greater success with organ and tissue transplantation, better pharmacotherapy, and better support systems. Restoration of normal homeostasis, the key to successful treatment, remains an elusive challenge and is a logical, major focus for research in human genetics...|$|R
40|$|Schizophrenia (szp.) is {{characterized}} by classical symptoms such as mania, hallucinations and depersonalization. Moreover we see <b>cognitive</b> deficits which <b>handicap</b> patients more intensively and often persistently longer than typical clinical pathology. These deficits respond badly to medical treatment. In this work deficits in cognitive functions of schizophrenic patients are evaluated by a computer-supported test battery (Test for attentional performance, TAP) and compared {{to the results of}} healthy controls (hc). A precise registration of attention deficits can support therapy and rehabilitation and furthermore be useful in the identification of a cognitive endophenotype of schizophrenia. We tested three tasks of the test for attentional performance on qualification as cognitive endophenotypes. Abilities in divided attention, alertness and suppression of inadequate reaction were recorded. Significant differences between szp. and hc. in mean reaction time was shown in all tests. Moreover the divided attention task showed further deficits in schizophrenic patients. The tests were repeated after a time span of three months in order to show stability and independence of the disease's clinical status. The results showed no differences in the szp. group while hc. could improve their results. The TAP shows applicability for identification of cognitive deficits which are specific for schizophrenia. These deficits show no aberration over a time span of three months and are not affected by antipsychotic medication. A qualification as a cognitive endophenotype could be described for the mean reaction times in three tasks of the TAP. Further studies may show a correlation to gene polymorphisms which are associated to the disease...|$|R

In this context, the Limousin region which is the oldest region of France and Europe shows to be a privileged ground of experiment. The increase in importance of the problems of the preservation at home opens at now immediate perspectives to technicians capable of proposing and of implementing adapted technical solutions to compensate for the handicaps and delay the loss of autonomy. These technicians arise from new university education diplomas but also integrate local craftsmen with new needs of technical training, in particular in the frame of the law of February 11 th, 2005 for the accessibility and the autonomy of the persons. In this Regional context, the Chamber of Professions and the craft business of Limousin has created the National Centre of Innovation Health Autonomy and Professions, real pole of innovation of the craft sector certified at the national level. The CNISAM accompanies the craft companies in their professional practices and helps them to integrate the sanitary, social and statutory environmental aspects {{connected to the}} installation of equipments for the housing environment. It is a centre of resources for the whole national network of the Professional associations and the Craft sector. The CNISAM, with its partners' network, proposes tools and devices in the domains of the adaptation of the housing environment to the old and disabled persons, the accessibility of the businesses, the conception of adaptable furniture, the application of the healthy and long-lasting materials in the building, the innovation of the services linked to the ageing of the population.

Mapping and Geographic knowledge finds nevertheless many applications in everyday life, especially now, due to the possibility of consulting maps on the world wide web. For this reason planning Earth Sciences-related Cartography activities in a museum context is highly recommended, but it may seem to be a great challenge, especially when these activities are presumed to be accessible also to persons with disabilities. The development of simplified cartographic elaborations and 3 -dimensional models, which can put in evidence the main characteristics of the territory and that can ideally be overlapped to the official cartography, constitutes a useful support in order to guarantee immediate legibility to an average non-expert audience and puts the bases for the realization of accessible tactile maps that can be accessible and understandable to <b>cognitive</b> and visually <b>handicapped</b> persons. By the way, Cartography related to Earth Sciences is about much more than simply deciphering maps: it is also about knowledge and understanding of the relations between environment and man.

It is short-lived impairment of neurological function, the brains ability to process information, which can be resolved in seven to ten days. Not all concussion involves the loss of consciousness, with it occurring in less than 10% of concussions. Second-impact syndrome is when a player has obtained a second concussion when you either return to field the same day, or return to play before a complete recovery from a previous concussion. This is a result from brain swelling, from vascular congestion and increased intracranial pressure, this can be fatal to a player as it is a very difficult medical injury to control. The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which protects it from light trauma. More severe impacts, or the forces associated with rapid acceleration, may not be absorbed by this cushion.
