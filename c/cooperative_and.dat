40|$|Product {{diversification}} and {{its financial}} outcomes {{have been studied}} exhaustively. However, previous literature has focused on corporations, ignoring other important legal organizations or governance structures. In this paper, we study the diversification strategies of <b>cooperatives</b> <b>and</b> compare them with corporations. We develop hypotheses that predict that cooperatives differ from corporations {{with respect to the}} extent, type, and performance of product diversification. Data obtained from a sample of 118 <b>cooperatives</b> <b>and</b> corporations are used to test the hypotheses. We find significant differences between <b>cooperatives</b> <b>and</b> corporations. Therefore, our main conclusion is that governance structure does matter for product diversification and its performance. Other governance structures, besides corporations <b>and</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> <b>and</b> their influence in other areas, besides product diversification, could be promising directions for future research. companies;cooperatives;governance structure;product diversification...|$|R

5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder by a man who gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not <b>cooperative</b> <b>and</b> lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E

However changing circumstances and various economic fluctuations made it necessary to support agricultural sector and the agricultural sales <b>cooperatives</b> <b>and</b> unions were used actively in certain support policies {{because of the fact that}} they were organized among the producers. In time the subsidies in question caused the <b>cooperatives</b> <b>and</b> unions to be perceived as public institutions and governments started to play a more active role on them.
