5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific <b>community</b> <b>does</b> not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E

The free software <b>community</b> <b>does</b> not view the open source community as their target grievance, however. Their target grievance is proprietary software itself.|$|E

25|$|Although the <b>community</b> <b>does</b> {{not face}} any {{official}} or informal restrictions on political participation, Britons of Caribbean origin are under-represented in {{local and national}} politics. However, {{there have been some}} successes with Diane Abbott being the first black person elected to Parliament under the Labour Party and Linda C. Douglas being the first black person {{to be part of the}} Labour Party National Executive Committee representing the later expelled Militant tendency. British African-West Indians have long asserted that they encounter discriminatory barriers to most middle- and higher-status occupations, as well as discrimination in hiring practices at all levels of employment. There is also considerable evidence that African-Caribbean people experience differential treatment at the hands of public officials, the British courts and penal system, and the police. Studies have proposed that the isolation of certain regional urban areas by financial institutions such as insurance brokers disproportionately affects the community to its detriment.|$|E

25|$|The Kunbi Hindre (or Hendre) are {{synonymous with}} the Hindre Patils, {{as far as their}} {{perceived}} distribution in the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra in the districts of Nanded, Parbhani, Yeotmal and Akola is concerned. There are no further subdivisions of the community. The community is said to have migrated from the Sahyadri ranges to the central Vidharbha region. The <b>community</b> <b>does</b> not have an oral tradition concerning the etymology of the word Hindre or the history of their migration, so their own origin is unknown to them. While the Hindre were grouped with the Kunbis of the Khandesh region in early ethnographical studies, the origin of the community is not known. Their population has not been accurately recorded in any official records; since the community is only found in certain rural districts, the Anthropological Survey of India estimates their population to be in thousands or in lakhs. While the traditional occupation of the Hindre Kunbis is agriculture, better educational opportunities and urbanisation have resulted in a disruption of their traditional economy, which has caused many Hindre to pursue diversified occupations.|$|E
25|$|The Leva or Lewa are {{synonymous with}} the Lewa Patil—the suffix Patil is a feudal title. The <b>community</b> <b>does</b> not have an oral history of their origin or migration, but they {{generally}} accept that they migrated from Gujarat to the Vidharba region via Nimar (now part of Madhya Pradesh). The community is associated with two other communities from Gujarat: the Lewa and the Lewa Patidar. The former are a well known community; the latter are {{sometimes referred to as}} their parental group, but the Kunbi Leva Patil of Maharashtra have roots which are long established in the Kunbi community of Maharashtra. The community perceives their distribution to be in 72 villages in the Jalgaon and Buldhana districts. The Lewa Patil are numerically, economically and educationally superior in some of the multi-ethnic villages of the Buldhana and Jalgaon district. Nuclear families are replacing the traditional extended family system due to a changing economy and an increasing number of conflicts over property inheritance. Cremation of the dead is the norm, burial the exception for the very young (up to three to four months old). There is no distinctive attire of the Leva community—they follow local fashion trends. On very rare occasions, older Leva men wear a Gujarati style, boat shaped topi or hat made from black or brown silk. Some of the common Leva surnames are Warade (Deshmukh), Narkhede, Kharche, Supe, Borle, Panchpande and Kolte. Dowry is practiced in the Leva community. The amount is negotiable. The attitude towards formal education is positive though Leva girls drop out of school earlier due to social conditions.|$|E
500|$|Jenny's {{character}} was unpopular with both fans and critics {{throughout the entire}} series because of her frequent narcissistic tendencies, her prima donna ways, her egotistical attitude, irresponsibility, frequent self-pity and selfish persona. She has also been labeled a [...] "love to hate" [...] character. The majority of critics have been intrigued by her [...] "polarising personality" [...] and branded {{it as one of}} the main reasons to watch the series. New York magazine gave a large amount of praise to Jenny and on one occasion stated: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show." [...] Kirshner received critical praise for her portrayal of the character. Kirshner has stated she loved playing Jenny because she felt like a brand new character during each season. She has also stated that it is difficult for people to like the character as she can be [...] "very despicable" [...] and even the LGBT <b>community</b> <b>does</b> not like her because of her [...] "duplicity and confusion".|$|E

2500|$|Biological {{definitions}} of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific <b>community</b> <b>does</b> not universally accept a single definition of race.
