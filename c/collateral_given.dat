This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the procedure of giving bank the guarantee carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia as well as the legal action carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia when the insured violates the guarantee bank agreement. This writing belongs to an empirical law research that is descriptive in nature. The data type employed was primary and secondary data. The secondary data source included primary, secondary and tertiary data. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis, in which the data collected would be then analyzed using 3 (three) stages: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing. Considering the result of research and discussion, it can be concluded that firstly, the Procedure of giving bank guarantee in the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia can be divided into 2 (two) types: bank guarantee giving with full cover collateral and bank guarantee giving with non-full cover collateral. Guarantee bank with full cover collateral means that the collateral {{is in the form of}} account. Meanwhile the guarantee bank with non-full cover guarantee means it is guaranteed with the customer’s account and asset as included in the Guarantee Bank Publication Agreement (PPGB). The guarantee bank publication by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia governed in the Guidelines and Policy of Retail Market Credit has been consistent with the conditions of guarantee bank publication included in the Decree of Indonesian Bank Director Board Number 11 / 110 /Kep. /Dir/UPBB about the <b>Collateral</b> <b>Giving</b> by Bank and <b>Collateral</b> <b>Giving</b> by the Non-Bank financial institution as well as Bank of Indonesia’s Circular Number: SE 11 / 11 concerning the <b>Collateral</b> <b>Giving</b> by Bank and <b>Collateral</b> <b>Giving</b> by Non-Bank Financial Institution.

40|$|Current patent {{valuation}} {{methods have been}} described charitably as “inappropriate,” “crude,” “inherently unreliable,” and a “guesstimate. ” This article provides a more rational and systematic tool than any we have found in the existing literature or relevant case law. We believe our approach to patent valuation will be useful in improving investment decisions, in facilitating licensing negotiations, and in reducing error costs in litigation. An improved valuation metric also promises to make patents easier to take as collateral and {{to reduce the amount}} of “Blue Sky” in mergers and acquisitions involving high tech corporations. To the extent that valuation problems have prevented a more efficient market for patents from emerging, we hope to facilitate the development of such a market. In Part I, we will review the standard approaches to valuing patents. Although the cost, income, and market methods of valuation each lend some insight, none are adequate to encompass the multiple factors that bear on patent value. Not surprisingly, some sophisticated firms have abandoned the traditional approaches and adapted the Black-Scholes equation from its original use in valuing stock options to valuing patents as a kind of option. Although use of Black-Scholes is a critical improvement over previous {{valuation methods}}, its treatment in the patent valuation literature (when covered at all) tends to involve either narrow special cases or grossly oversimplified approaches. In Part II, we show how a similar valuation problem involving stock options was solved using a novel and straightforward approach [...] the Black-Scholes equation [...] that has wide utility for patents and patent licenses. We explain how stock options are like patents and demonstrate how the Black-Scholes equation is applied to price real options. In Part III, we prove that a more comprehensive and advanced form of the Black-Scholes equation can be applied to value patents. First, we explain the major difficulties inherent in applying the standard equation to patents and then proceed to demonstrate how it can be adapted to overcome those problems. In particular, the Denton Variation of Black-Scholes begins with fine distinctions in identifying the basis of value, followed by a systematic analysis of factors, especially market forces, that influence variance and its sources over time. We show that the point-price paradigm relied upon by patent valuations to date has been flawed. Here, we leave the world of contemporary patent valuation behind. We claim that solving a single Black-Scholes equation is grossly inadequate for a risky, long-lived, infrequently traded item such as a patent. For a patent, the present value exists as a distribution curve with variously weighted probabilities, thus the apparent precision in picking a starting value by traditional patent valuation methods is illusory. The Denton Variation eliminates two historic shortcomings of the parent equation by providing a precise way to factor in transactions costs, and by quantifying the impact of the option cost on the profitability of the transaction. Moreover, the expression can accommodate a variety of patent profitability situations. For the purposes of illustration, we run through the equation to value a hypothetical patent. In Part IV we note that insights provided by game theory, in particular the Nobel Prize-winning contributions of Professor John Nash, help justify the choices that underlie the Denton adaptation of the Black-Scholes equation. In the licensing context, considerations of the effect of bargaining position are unavoidable, and we show how our assumptions are consistent with game theoretical paradigms. In Parts V and VI, we explore the implications of our refined approach to patent valuation. The statistically definable imprecision or diffuseness in patent value can be traced to economic inefficiency in the present market for patents. We examine, therefore, how patent valuation problems currently hinder efficient transfer of technology. One telling sign in the current market is the lack of patent arbitrage. Patents, like used cars, can be transferred directly from owner to user. But unlike the market for used cars, no equivalent of the used car lot has emerged in the context of patented technology. Although patents, like cars, are numerous and, in the aggregate, hugely valuable, no significant group of arbitragers currently facilitates a market by buying and reselling them. Potential buyers and sellers of technology, therefore, are left to seek each other out directly, usually with little independent guidance as to the value of what they seek to exchange. Similar information deficits plague internal corporate decisions whether to fund particular research projects and decisions by financial institutions on how to value a patent as <b>collateral.</b> <b>Given</b> the undeniable value of patented technology, the market we describe is surprisingly inefficient. In addition, we argue that patent attorneys are uniquely situated to serve as midwives to a “thick” new technology market. Defining the legal scope of the patent, and therefore its usefulness in excluding competition, is currently the central job of the patent attorney. Attorneys also advise on whether options to a license are infringing or not. We hope to hurry the emergence of a new generation of patent attorneys armed with more sophisticated valuation tools and a better awareness of the scientific and business side of the patent industry. In Part VI, we show how our enhanced version of the new Black-Scholes variant equation fits comfortably into the calculation of the reasonable royalty remedy applicable in cases of patent infringement when the patent owner cannot prove lost profits. This is an area where math-based solutions have long evaded the courts. In the lost profits context, we offer our approach as a means by which courts can recognize a patent owner 2 ̆ 7 s ability to recover direct damages to the market value of its patent, in addition to lost profits suffered during the period of infringement. Development of this remedy, which has an analogy in cases of trademark infringement and in patent cases recognizing “market spoilage,” has been stifled by the absence of a method to measure confidently the diminishment in market value of a patent after the infringement ends. Finally, we note the wide applicability of our approach in the compulsory licensing context...|$|E

40|$|Within a {{framework}} of debt renegotiation and a priori private information, {{what is the role}} of outside and inside collateral? The literature shows that unobservability of the project 2 ̆ 019 s returns implies that the high-risk borrower is more inclined to pledge outside collateral than is the low-risk borrower. However, this finding does not hold when the bank can observe neither the project 2 ̆ 019 s returns nor the borrower 2 ̆ 019 s risk class. We show that in this scenario, low-valued outside collateral enables the low-risk entrepreneur to select himself, but high value outside collateral has no sorting potential at all. We also show that a bank 2 ̆ 019 s incentive to sort borrowers may induce investment to preserve the value of the inside collateral and to build up restructuring know-how.

40|$|GABAergic neurons of the {{globus pallidus}} (GP) play {{critical}} roles in basal ganglia function {{by virtue of}} their widespread axonal projections to all parts of the basal ganglia. They also possess local axon collaterals. In view of the importance of GABAergic inputs in sculpting neuronal activity, we quantitatively characterized the local axon collaterals of individual GP neurons by in vivo recording, juxtacellular labeling, reconstruction, and light and electron microscopic analysis in the rat. All labeled GP neurons had similar firing properties and gave rise to local axon collaterals, the main synaptic targets of which were perikarya and primary dendrites. The neurons could be divided into two populations; neurons located within approximately 100 microm of the striatopallidal border ("outer" neurons), which possess a mean of 264 local axonal boutons, and those located approximately 100 microm or more from the striatopallidal border ("inner" neurons), which possess a mean of 581 local axonal boutons. The local axon <b>collaterals</b> <b>gave</b> rise to arborizations close to, or within, the parent dendritic field and arborizations located caudal, medial, and ventral to the parent neuron. The qualitative and quantitative differences in the connectivity of neurons located in the outer and inner regions of the GP underlie a complex microcircuitry that follows an asymmetric rostral to caudal organization. These data suggest that the GP should no longer be considered as an homogeneous relay nucleus that simply transmits striatal information to the subthalamic nucleus and basal ganglia output nuclei, but rather as a structure that can perform complex computations within its borders...|$|R

Labeled principal cells had cell bodies that usually gave rise {{to one or two}} primary dendrites, which branched profusely {{in the vicinity of the}} cell. At the electron microscopic (EM) level, there was a dense synaptic terminal distribution on the cell body and proximal dendrites. Up to half the measured cell surface could be covered with excitatory terminals, whereas inhibitory terminals consistently covered about one-fifth. The distal dendrites were very sparsely innervated. The thick myelinated axon originated from the cell body and innervated nuclei exclusively in the ipsilateral auditory brain stem. These include the lateral superior olive (LSO), ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, medial superior olive, dorsomedial and ventromedial periolivary nuclei, and the MNTB itself. At the EM level the myelinated <b>collaterals</b> <b>gave</b> rise to terminals that contained nonround vesicles and, in the LSO, were seen terminating on cell bodies and primary dendrites. Responses of MNTB cells were similar to their primary excitatory input, the globular bushy cell (GBC), in a number of ways. The spontaneous spike rate of MNTB cells with low characteristic frequencies (CFs) was low, whereas it tended to be higher for higher CF units. In response to short tones, a low frequency MNTB cell showed enhanced phase-locking abilities, relative to auditory nerve fibers. For cells with CFs > 1 kHz, the short tone response often resembled the primary-like with notch response seen in many globular bushy cells, with a well-timed onset component. Exceptions to and variations of this standard response were also noted. When compared with GBCs with comparable CFs, the latency of the MNTB cell response was delayed slightly, as would be expected given the synapse interposed between the two cell types. Our data thus confirm that, in the cat, the MNTB receives and converts synaptic inputs from globular bushy cells into a reasonably accurate reproduction of the bushy cell spike response. This MNTB cell output then becomes an important inhibitory input to a number of ipsilateral auditory brain stem nuclei. status: publishe...|$|R

On the other hand, factors influencing the recovery rate that were identified in other studies (in particular for retail customers), could be caused by the biased valuation of the collateral. Future studies should, therefore, not consider the value of the <b>collateral</b> as a <b>given.</b> Additionally, the banks should review their current practice of flat haircuts and should instead apply adjustments of the collateral value depending on the associated attributes of the collateral as presented in our study. Moreover, the final model is able to explain a large fraction of the recovery rate’s variance (adjusted R^ 2 equals approximately 70 – 77 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary care {{physicians}} {{often fail to}} diagnose low bone density. This pilot study assessed 2 interventions for their effect on bone mineral density testing. Methods: Five practices in the Iowa Research Network were randomized: 2 to chart reminder alone (CR), 2 to chart reminder plus mailed patient education (CR�PtEd), and one to usual care. A total of 204 women aged 65 years or older were recruited from within these practices. Bayesian hierarchical analyses were used instead of traditional statistical methods {{to take advantage of}} collateral data and to adjust for differences between clinics at baseline. Results: After the intervention, the rates of completed bone mineral density testing were 45. 2 % in the CR�PtEd group, 31. 4 % in the chart remainder only group, and 9. 7 % in the usual care practice. Bayesian analysis adjusted for patient and clinic characteristics, which made use of <b>collateral</b> data, <b>gave</b> an odds ratio of 5. 47 for the effect of CR�PtEd group. The Bayesian P was. 029 and the one-sided 95 % credible interval for the odds ratio was greater than 1. 2. The effect of CR�PtEd was confirmed by sensitivity analyses. Traditional hierarchical analysis adjusted for practice characteristics could not be used to estimate statistical significance because there were not enough clinics to accommodate a model that included all the important covariables...|$|R
