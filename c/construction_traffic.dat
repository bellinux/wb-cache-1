25|$|The Midtown Tunnel Construction {{consists}} of the fabrication and installation of the new, parallel Midtown Tunnel, as well as upgrading & replacing the Brambleton Ave/Hampton Boulevard interchange, which leads directly to the tunnel. Fabrication of the tunnel's 11 concrete elements began in November 2012 in Sparrows Point, Maryland and are towed down the Chesapeake Bay to the Project site in Portsmouth for immersion and placement under the Elizabeth River. As of March 2015, the first six elements are in place and production of the remaining five tunnel elements is in progress. Upon completion of <b>construction,</b> <b>traffic</b> in the existing Midtown Tunnel will be converted to one-way eastbound from Portsmouth to Norfolk and the new 2-lane tunnel will carry westbound traffic from Norfolk to Portsmouth.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, a $1.46 million (about $ in [...] dollars) {{contract}} was granted {{to build the}} [...] portion from near Araby Road east through Fortuna Wash. Two years later, {{it was estimated that}} construction would be complete by 1969, except for the Colorado River bridge. The highway was in progress through the Telegraph Pass east of Yuma, and the portions from Avenue 9-E to 4-E, from there to 4th Street in Yuma, and to the river were estimated to cost $9.69 million (about $ in [...] dollars) in total. Following local complaints, Francis Turner, {{the executive director of the}} federal Bureau of Public Roads, agreed to look at constructing an interchange at Trekell Road in Casa Grande again, after an earlier decline to do so. Work began on the Casa Grande part of the freeway in March 1968, at a cost of $3 million (about $ in [...] dollars). That year, many gas station, motel, and restaurant owners noticed a drop in business, possibly due to concerns regarding <b>construction</b> <b>traffic</b> due to I-8; however, they hoped for increased business following completion of the freeway. The Yuma County Chamber of Commerce made plans to promote tourism in the town following the completion of I-8 by late 1968.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commission}} {{reported that}} the Nelson Section was making substantial losses which would only increase with {{the extension of the}} line, and recommended that services be reduced with closure of the line from Belgrove to Kawatiri if losses continued. [...] The report also listed the section to Inangahua as a line on which works should be [...] "suspended" [...] which was duly carried out in January 1931. [...] Even after the commissions suggestions were enacted, goods traffic continued to decline, decreasing 20% between March 1931 and March 1932, {{due in part to the}} loss of <b>construction</b> <b>traffic.</b> [...] Eventually the measures had some positive effect, reducing the losses on the line from £18,000 to £12,000 for the financial year ended March 1932, saving the line from closure for the foreseeable future.|$|E
40|$|<b>Construction</b> {{simulation}} and <b>traffic</b> simulation are complementary {{to successful}} planning of microtunneling and pipe-jacking operations in urban areas. With increasing concerns on sustainable development, {{it is imperative}} to integrate <b>construction</b> engineering and <b>traffic</b> engineering in simulation modeling in order to plan for efficient site operations while reducing the impact of <b>construction</b> upon <b>traffic.</b> In this research, we demonstrate a “larger system simulation ” approach to effectively plan pipe-jacking operations in urban areas in considerations of (1) truck delivery routes and timing; (2) sizing and location of temporary laydown area on site; (3) traffic lane closure distance; and (4) working hours scheduling, aimed at minimizing the negative impact of <b>construction</b> on <b>traffic.</b> Our research goal is to deliver a temporary traffic arrangement plan along with an efficient site operations plan, thus keeping a balance between <b>construction</b> productivity and <b>traffic</b> mobility. A case study is given based on a pipe-jacking site in the urban area of Hong Kong. ...|$|R

2500|$|On January 23, 2015, after {{less than}} two years of <b>construction,</b> <b>traffic</b> was reintroduced to the 600 block of Main Street, between Tupper and Chippewa Streets, in the Theater District. On December 15, 2015, two weeks behind its {{expected}} due date, traffic was reintroduced to the 500 block of Main Street, between Chippewa and Mohawk Streets, in the Central Business District. From July 11, 2016 to September 4, 2016, the outbound track from Allen/Medical Campus Station to Humboldt-Hospital Station were closed while rehabilitation work was being performed on the outbound track. This prolonged period of single-tracking resulted in 20-minute service intervals throughout the day, effectively halving peak weekday morning and evening commuter capacity. Immediately prior to the commencement of this rehabilitation work, peak weekday morning and evening service was running at 10-minute intervals. It has since resumed full service.|$|E
