2500|$|In 1958 {{a version}} of the {{integrated}} circuit was invented in Dallas by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments; this event punctuated the Dallas area's development as a center for high-technology manufacturing (though the technology Mr. Kilby developed was soon usurped by a <b>competing</b> <b>technology</b> simultaneously developed in the [...] "Silicon Valley" [...] in California by engineers who would go on to form Intel Corporation). During the 1950s and 1960s, Dallas became the nation's third-largest technology center, with the growth of such companies as Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV Corporation) and Texas Instruments. In 1957, developers Trammell Crow and John M. Stemmons opened a Home Furnishings Mart, designed by Donald H. Speck, that grew into the Dallas Market Center, the largest wholesale trade complex in the world. The same year, the Dallas Memorial Auditorium (now the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center) opened near Canton and Akard Streets in what is now the Convention Center District of downtown. On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Elm Street while his motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas. The upper two floors of the building from which Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, the Texas School Book Depository, have been converted into a historical museum covering the former president's life and accomplishments.|$|E

50|$|A seemingly-similar <b>competing</b> <b>technology</b> is RDX Technology. A key distinction, however, is {{that the}} REV drive heads and drive {{controller}} remain inside the drive when the hard-disk platter is removed from it. In RDX Technology, the drive heads are contained within the cartridge along with the platter and are removed along with it.|$|E
50|$|After a {{financial}} disagreement in 1995, Stephens was dismissed from Infoworld and was promptly sued by IDG {{to prevent him}} from continuing to use the Cringely trademark.

50|$|RDX is {{sometimes}} compared with Iomega REV, a formerly <b>competing</b> <b>technology.</b> REV places the read/write {{heads in the}} drive instead of inside the cartridge. It also allows an ordinary user to remove and replace the medium without special training. However, REV uses a removable-disk hard disk drive while RDX uses a fixed hard disk in a modular, replaceable package.|$|E
50|$|A3D uses {{a subset}} of the actual in-game 3D world data to {{accurately}} model the location of both direct (A3Dspace) and reflected (A3Dverb) sound streams (A3D 2.0 can perform up to 60 first-order reflections). EAX 1.0, the <b>competing</b> <b>technology</b> at the time promoted by Creative Labs, simulated the environment with an adjustable reverbâ€”it didn't calculate any actual reflections off the 3D surfaces.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{technologies}} of full body scanner used for body imaging; a <b>competing</b> <b>technology</b> is backscatter X-ray. Millimeter wave scanners themselves come in two varieties: active and passive. Active scanners direct millimeter wave energy at the subject and then interpret the reflected energy. Passive systems create images using only ambient radiation and radiation emitted from the human body or objects.|$|E
40|$|Empirically the {{diffusion}} of <b>competing</b> <b>technologies</b> most often displays either "lock-in" to a quasi-monopoly or apparent turbulence but rarely stable market-sharing. In contrast with widespread views, we show that, first, unbounded increasing returns are neither necessary nor sufficient to lead to technological monopolies. Rather, asymptotic patterns depend on the relative impact of increasing returns {{and the degree of}} adopters heterogeneity. Second, the unlikely empirical occurence of stable market-sharing is slower then to monopoly; thus, in the former case, the enviroment often changes before the market-share trajectory becomes stable. <b>Competing</b> <b>Technologies,</b> Product Selection, Unbounded Returns, Network Externalities, Heterogeneity, Technological Monopolies...|$|R

50|$|Hot Spot has {{two main}} {{advantages}} over its <b>competing</b> <b>technology,</b> the Snickometer, {{which is a}} sound-detection based system. Snickometer often produces inconclusive results indicating contact (potentially any combination of bat, pad and ball) only, whereas the Hot Spot clearly shows exactly what the ball strikes. Precise synchronisation of the Snickometer sound with associated pictures takes time, making it currently not suitable {{for use in the}} umpire decision review system.|$|E

Java Pet Store became the symbol for J2EE's ascendency; Microsoft created a competing [...]NET Pet Shop to showcase its <b>competing</b> <b>technology.</b> Since then, many technologies such as Tapestry, Spring, and others have implemented their own versions of the Pet Store application as a way to demonstrate best practices for their given technology.|$|E
