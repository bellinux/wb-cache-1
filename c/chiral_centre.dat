Castanospermine inhibits all forms of alpha- and beta-D-glucosidases, but alteration to any of the five <b>chiral</b> <b>centres</b> in castanospermine markedly decreases the inhibition. 6 -Epicastanospermine, which is related to D-pyranomannose {{in the same way as}} castanospermine is to D-pyranoglucose, does not inhibit lysosomal (acidic) alpha-mannosidase, but is a good inhibitor of the cytosolic or neutral alpha-mannosidase. Conversely, 1 -deoxy- 6 -epicastanospermine inhibits acidic alpha-mannosidase strongly, but not the neutral alpha-mannosidase. An explanation of this different inhibition based on preferential recognition of different configurations of mannose by the different forms of alpha-mannosidase is postulated. All derivatives of 6 -epicastanospermine also have the minimum structural feature for the inhibition of alpha-L-fucosidase, but those with a beta-anomeric substituent do not inhibit the enzyme, or do so very weakly. 1 -Deoxy- 6, 8 a-diepicastanospermine, which has four <b>chiral</b> <b>centres</b> identical with alpha-L-fucose, is, however, a potent inhibitor of alpha-L-fucosidase (Ki 1. 3 microM) ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{approaches}} {{towards the}} synthesis of an acyclic molecule possessing one <b>chiral</b> <b>centre</b> along with suitable functionality to enable cyclisation to a medium ring were investigated. The intramolecular cyclisation reaction would create a second <b>chiral</b> <b>centre</b> so that two diastereoisomeric products would be possible. Potential cyclisation reactions appeared to include allysilane-aldehyde and allyl tin-aldehyde cyclisations. The first route attempted involved the coupling of an oxygen protected w-hydroxy-aldehyde with 3, 3 -diethoxy- 2 -bromopropene via a Grignard reaction or an alkyl lithium reaction, to generate the first <b>chiral</b> <b>centre.</b> A slight variation was also investigated. In this second case the key reaction to form the first <b>chiral</b> <b>centre</b> was the reaction of an oxygen protected w-hydroxy-a-bromoalkane with 2 -(trimethylsilyl) methyl- 2 -propenal via a Grignard reaction. A third approach to the key reaction to introduce the first <b>chiral</b> <b>centre</b> involved the reaction of 2 -bromo- 3 -(trimethylsilyl) propene with an oxygen protected w-hydroxy-aldehyde via Grignard reaction. The products of this reaction then underwent further reactions to generate acyclic molecules containing both allylsilane and aldehyde functionality mediated intramolecular allylsilane-aldehyde cyclisations were then performed. The reaction {{did not appear to}} be very stereoselective for the simple molecules which were investigated, as in all cases the diastereoisomer ratios were approximately 1 : 1. In an attempt to synthesise heterocyclic medium rings an intramolecular acetal initiated allylsilane cyclisation in the presence of Lewis Acid was investigated. It appeared that with the tetrahydropyranyl ethers which were investigated, deprotection of the alcohol group occurred with loss of Thp in preference to breaking of the alternative C-O bond which would have led to cyclisation and the formation of medium ring ethers...|$|E
30|$|What it is {{important}} considering the radiations is the role they played in the survival of l-enantiomer. It {{is well known that}} radiations can reduce the optical activity promoting radioracemization (Cataldo et al. 2008). The chromatographic analysis (see Additional file 1) allowed us to identify the d-enantiomer formed as a result of radioracemization process during irradiation. It is necessary to pay attention to isoleucine, one on the two proteinogenic amino acid, together with threonine, which has two <b>chiral</b> <b>centre</b> (α and β carbon). Due to the presence of these two <b>chiral</b> <b>centre,</b> isoleucine can exist as four stereoisomers which can be seen as two pairs of enantiomers: l- and d-isoleucine, l- and d-allo-isoleucine. The simultaneous inversion of the two <b>chiral</b> <b>centre</b> is unlikely and consequently the formation of d-Ile (Bada and Schroeder 1972). The most common interconversion is the α epimerization which involves the formation of d-allo-isoleucine. In fact, the α carbon can react easily thanks to electron-withdrawing and resonance stabilization effects. On the contrary the β carbon is protected from the amino and carboxylic groups and the β epimerization is a slow rate process.|$|E
