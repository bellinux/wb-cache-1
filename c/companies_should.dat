During the U.S. automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, he opposed a bailout of the industry in the form of direct government intervention, and argued that a managed bankruptcy of struggling automobile <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> instead be accompanied by federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing from the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they did not intend to cause offence.|$|E

The researcher practically investigates and interviews the input, process and output of the safety and health management of semiconductor industry by using the questionnaires and the interview method which is developed according to the framework of the OHSAS 18001. The result shows that there are six important factors for the safety and health management in Taiwan semiconductor industry. 1. The <b>company</b> <b>should</b> make employee clearly understand the safety and health laws and standards. 2.

25|$|Judging by opinion polls, the Act had {{the support}} of the general public and trade unionists. A MORI poll in November 1981 {{revealed}} that 79% of the public and 77% of trade unionists agreed that regular ballots should be held in existing closed shops; 70% of the public and 61% of trade unionists agreed that a company should be allowed to sue a trade union if it lost money in dispute which was unconnected to the company; and 76% of the public and 70% of trade unionists agreed that <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> be able to sue trade unions which broke agreements.|$|E
25|$|During 1981, TVS's ambitions {{were soon}} {{recognised}} for {{their desire to}} have a greater say in how ITV operated and its dismay on how it was being treated by the Big Five ITV companies, Thames Television, LWT, Central Independent Television, Yorkshire Television and Granada Television. The rationale was that the larger ITV <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> bear more of the production costs as their size enabled them to. This led to criticism in some quarters that the larger of the remaining 'regional' ITV companies, such as TVS, Anglia Television, STV, Tyne Tees Television and HTV, found it difficult to get network access for their major productions, and that they were left with softer non-primetime sectors, such as children's and religious television.|$|E

This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.|$|E
25|$|Coltman {{published}} his {{report on the}} Pemmican War a year later in 1818 entitled “A general statement and report relative to the disturbances in the Indian Territories of British North America.” It consisted of more than 500 pages of witness testimonies and other evidence, as well as Coltman’s conclusions and recommendations which were, simply put, that the HBC was the first aggressor, the Red River District was not suitable for any colony, and therefore Selkirk’s plans {{must have been a}} tactical move against the Nor’Westers, that the NWC exceeded all lawful and reasonable bounds of self-defence, that both <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> compensate the government for any expenses incurred during this ordeal, and that only the most vigorous of the many crimes should actually go to trial.|$|E

In his book, Eric Schmidt argues that successful companies in the technology-driven internet age, should attract smart and creative employees and then create an environment where they can thrive. He argues that the traditional business rules that make a company successful have changed. The book states that <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> maximize freedom and speed, and decision-making should not lie {{in the hands of the}} few.

25|$|Sugar cane {{cultivation}} {{once used}} over 80% of the island's managed water supply. One pound of refined sugar requires one ton {{of water to}} produce. Water for sugar cultivation comes mostly from the streams of East Maui, routed though a network of tunnels and ditches hand dug by Chinese labor in the 19th century. In 2006, the town of Paia successfully petitioned the County against mixing in treated water from wells known to be contaminated with both EDB and DBCP from former pineapple cultivation in the area (Environment Hawaii, 1996). Agricultural companies have been released from all future liability for these chemicals (County of Maui, 1999). In 2009, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and others successfully argued in court that sugar <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> {{reduce the amount of}} water they take from four streams.|$|E
25|$|Cases {{like these}} have created some privacy {{implications}} {{as to whether}} or not <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.|$|E
25|$|Design {{work was}} by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company (LMS). They had no prior {{experience}} {{in the design and}} production of fighting vehicles, and had been invited to participate under a Government policy that British <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> develop necessary skills in expectation of war. The design assumed a welded hull rather than the usual rivetting. The turret was designed by Nuffield, with Henry Meadows designing a new low profile engine for it. On 17 April, before even a single prototype was produced, the first 100 vehicles were ordered from the LMSR. Additional orders soon followed, with English Electric and Leyland Motors joining the production effort, for a final production total of 1,771 Covenanters. Nuffield was also approached, but preferred to design its own offspring of the A13 line, which became the Cruiser Mk.VI Crusader.|$|E

25|$|Following {{their return}} to Australia, the {{regiment}} began reorganising on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. At this time the Australian Army was undergoing a period of restructuring as its strategic focus shifted towards concentrating upon fighting {{the war against the}} Japanese in the Pacific. As a part of this restructuring it was decided that {{there was no need for}} divisional cavalry regiments, however, it was decided that the independent <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> be grouped together under a regimental structure, and in response the divisional cavalry regiments were broken up and their headquarters elements were used to administer the commando squadrons. Three such units were formed at this time, with the 7th Division Cavalry Regiment adopting the title of the 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment in April 1943. The regiment's subordinate squadrons were: the 2/3rd, 2/5th and 2/6th Commando Squadrons, however, in terms of tactics and training the individual squadrons retained their independence.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers {{even more than the}} old plan.

This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city needed that extra money to make up for expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development <b>companies</b> <b>should</b> have to pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a program should instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E
