5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize <b>chromosomes.</b> This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize <b>chromosomes,</b> and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize <b>chromosomes.</b> This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the <b>chromosomes,</b> McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize <b>chromosomes</b> triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear <b>chromosomes</b> in eukaryotes, and {{circular}} <b>chromosomes</b> in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of <b>chromosomes</b> {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear <b>chromosomes</b> in eukaryotes, and {{circular}} <b>chromosomes</b> in prokaryotes. The set of <b>chromosomes</b> {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 <b>chromosomes.</b> The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication.

5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of <b>chromosomes</b> between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 <b>chromosomes,</b> horses have 64 <b>chromosomes,</b> and mules or hinnies have 63 <b>chromosomes.</b> Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E

5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous <b>chromosomes</b> from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of <b>chromosomes,</b> to form polyploids. This allows the <b>chromosomes</b> from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's <b>chromosomes</b> are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled <b>chromosomes</b> will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
