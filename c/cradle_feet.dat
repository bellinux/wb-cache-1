40|$|Reliable unipedal {{balance is}} {{fundamental}} to safe ambulation. Accordingly, older persons with peripheral neuropathy (PN), who {{are at increased risk}} for falls, demonstrate impaired unipedal balance. To explore the relationship between afferent function and unipedal balance, frontal plane proprioceptive thresholds at the ankle were quantified in 22 subjects (72. 5 ± 6. 3 years; 11 with PN and 11 matched controls) while they were standing using a <b>foot</b> <b>cradle</b> system and a staircase series of 100 rotational stimuli. PN subjects, as compared to controls, demonstrated shorter median unipedal balance times (3. 4 ± 2. 7 vs. 14. 3 ± 8. 9 s; P = 0. 0017) and greater (less precise) combined ankle inversion/eversion proprioceptive thresholds (1. 17 ± 0. 36 vs. 0. 65 ± 0. 37 °; P = 0. 0055). Combined ankle inversion/eversion proprioceptive thresholds explained approximately half the variance in unipedal balance time (R 2 = 0. 5138; P = 0. 0004). Given prior work demonstrating a similarly strong relationship between ankle torque generation and unipedal balance, neuropathy-associated impairments in ankle frontal plane afferent and efferent function appear to be equally responsible for the inability of older persons with PN to reliably balance on one foot. They therefore provide distinct targets for intervention. Muscle Nerve 39 : 150 – 157, 200...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{ergometer}} rowing technique {{of a person}} {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI), using functional electric stimulation (FES) of his leg muscles, with that of a well-defined group of able-bodied rowers. DESIGN: Whole-body kinematics and kinetics and electric activity of selected muscles were measured during ergometer rowing. SETTING: A hospital-based motion analysis laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Five male university varsity-level rowers and 1 male rower with SCI. INTERVENTIONS: Eight rowing trials were collected on the university-level rowers, 2 trials each at 20, 24, 28, and 32 strokes/min. The rower with SCI had surface electrodes applied to his medial hamstrings and medial quadriceps muscle bellies. The electrodes were attached to a stimulator that was activated using a button in the ergometer handle. The subject with SCI rowed at a self-selected stroke rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Forces at the ergometer handle and <b>foot</b> <b>cradle,</b> 3 -dimensional whole-body kinematics, net joint moments, and phasic activity of muscles. RESULTS: Motion of the arms, ankles, and knees of the rower with SCI was {{similar to those of the}} university-level rowers; other joint motions and forces applied to the ergometer differed. CONCLUSIONS: FES-assisted rowing in its current implementation cannot reproduce a race-winning rowing stroke. Further development work is required...|$|R
40|$|Rowing ergometers can {{be found}} in most gyms and fitness centers, but many people who use them {{regularly}} have little or no instruction in rowing technique. It is not known whether nonrowers who regularly practice ergometer rowing are at risk of musculoskeletal problems. This study was done to quantify the differences in kinematics, kinetics, and musculoskeletal loading of competitive rowers and nonrowers during ergometer rowing. An experiment was performed to collect kinematic, external force, and EMG data during ergometer rowing by 5 university-level competitive rowers and 5 nonrowers. Kinematic and external force data were input to a 3 -D whole-body musculoskeletal model which was used to calculate net joint forces and moments, muscle forces, and joint contact forces. The results showed that competitive rowers and nonrowers are capable of rowing an ergometer with generally similar patterns of kinematics and kinetics; however, there are some potentially important differences in how they use their legs and trunk. The competitive rowers generated higher model quadriceps (vastus) muscle forces and pushed harder against the <b>foot</b> <b>cradle,</b> extending their knees more and their trunks less than the nonrowers during the drive phase. They also had higher contact forces at the knee and higher peak lumbar and knee flexion moments. The ratio of average peak vastus force to average peak erector spinae force in the experienced rowers was 1. 52, whereas it was only 1. 18 in the nonexperienced rowers...|$|R

Over several decades TRT has transformed and taken on new and unusual concepts, such as TRX (total body resistance exercise). However, very {{little research has}} been completed investigating the effects of the TRX. PURPOSE: Therefore, {{the purpose of the study}} was to determine if muscle electrical activity (EMG) will differ while performing a bodyweight split-squat while using an instability device, the TRX, as compared to performing a bodyweight split-squat in a stable environment, without an external load present. METHODS: Twenty non-athlete (10 male; 10 female) experienced resistance and/or aerobically trained individuals participated in the investigation. The study consisted of three sessions including two variations of bodyweight split-squats and a training session to acclimatize the participants. The TRX split-squat was performed by placing the rear foot within the <b>foot</b> <b>cradle</b> of the TRX strap, while the traditional split-squat required the participant to place their rear foot on a stable bench, both 16 inches in height. Each session was separated by one minute of rest and each split-squat required the participant to perform three correct repetitions. EMG analysis was performed to assess the muscle activity of the gluteus maximus (GMa) and rectus femoris (RF). Paired samples t-tests using IBM SPSS version 23 were performed to compare the EMG data of the GMa and RF of males and females for both the TRX and traditional split-squat. RESULTS: Paired samples t-tests revealed significantly higher EMG activity occurred in the GMa during the TRX split-squat compared to the traditional split-squat. No other significant differences in the muscle activity of the GMa or RF occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The study purpose was to determine if a TRX split-squat would increase muscle activity in the GMa or RF compared to the traditional split-squat because of the higher degree of instability involved. Significant results were found for the EMG of the GMa during the TRX® split-squat. The TRX® trainer has not been incorporated in many studies, thus should be an increased focus in the future...|$|R
40|$|THE EFFECTS OF SUSPENSION TRAINING ON CORE AND QUADRICEPS MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING A PUSH-UP J. May, K. Grenier, M. Hopkins, K. Johnston, K. Lane, C. Lynde, K. Slattengren, R. McCulloch Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA Suspension {{training}} {{has increased in}} popularity and usage despite limited evidence {{of its ability to}} produce instability as a means of providing strength and conditioning benefits. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of suspension training on instability measures and proximal lower limb muscle activation during a push-up activity. We hypothesized that push-ups performed on a suspension trainer would: 1) create more instability in the form of increased movement tracked by a 2 D motion capture system; and 2) that this added instability would increase the amount of muscle activation from the core and proximal lower limb stabilizing muscles during a suspended push-up compared to a raised, standard push-up. METHODS: Eighteen active, college-aged males participated in a randomized and counterbalanced study. The subjects performed five consecutive push-ups in two different stability conditions: 1) feet suspended in the <b>foot</b> <b>cradles</b> of the suspension bands and 2) feet resting on a box adjusted to match the height of their <b>feet</b> in the <b>cradles.</b> Muscle activation was recorded for the following muscles bilaterally: internal oblique’s, erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, biceps femoris, and vastus lateralis. Max voluntary contractions (MVC) were obtained prior to testing for each muscle. Movement was recorded from above the subjects and digitized via markers on the posterior aspect of the shoulders, hips, and ankles. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate significant differences between the experimental and control conditions (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). RESULTS: Significant increases in displacement between conditions were seen for fifty percent of the marker locations (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Evaluation of normalized EMG data showed a significant increase in only the right latissimus dorsi between conditions (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Performing a push-up in the suspension system was successful at creating instability as evident by the moderate, but significant, increases in movement. However, the instability resulted in increased activation for only the right latissimus dorsi. The results suggest that further evaluation of upper body musculature during this instability exercise may be valuable...|$|R
5000|$|There were plans, not {{put into}} practice, {{to use the}} Arado Ar 234 jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by {{launching}} them from a [...] "piggy back" [...] position (in {{the manner of the}} Mistel, but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze's launch <b>cradle</b> some eight <b>feet</b> clear of the 234's upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft's fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a [...] "clean" [...] airflow for the Argus motor's intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a [...] "flying fuel tank" [...] (Deichselschlepp) for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an He 177A Greif bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabilizer {{at the rear of the}} tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid tow-bar with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank's fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight [...] "porpoising" [...] of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the [...] "flying fuel tanks" [...] used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.|$|R
