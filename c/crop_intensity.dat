50|$|In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank {{approved}} Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (BISP) in Kenya. The {{project area}} is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin. It {{lies on the}} west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County. The project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya, the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area, create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange. Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 ½ year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya. Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population, expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985. The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices.Actual construction started in 1978. During implementation the costs exploded from $17,500/= per family to $55,000/=, a new record for the World Bank. The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network (615%). The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha, although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha. In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme. They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha. Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas.Soon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives. Job creation was only 40% of the target, the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits. Even with net farm incomes of about 40% of the appraisal estimates in real terms, annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler. The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems.After cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops. Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme, living on famine relief and odd jobs. In the period 1993-2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project, but all in vain. After 2005, rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009-10 the tenants have been growing crops, although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50% of the projected <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> and the settlers have low incomes, if any. This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop, cotton, is no longer a profitable crop.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} and investments vary by season {{due to the}} different challenges faced, such as drought, salinity, or flooding, and the different requirements such as varietal choice, water source (rainfall or irrigation or a mix of the two), inputs, and crop establishment methods. Both cropping intensity {{and the number of}} crops planted annually in an area {{can be used as a}} measures of food security given that these factors can greatly affect overall gross production for that location. Traditionally, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has routinely been used to investigate <b>crop</b> <b>intensity,</b> since MODIS provides global coverage and sufficient temporal observance. However, current techniques for quantifying cropping intensity may not be accurate in regions of the world like Africa and South Asia, which are dominated by smallholder farms where the size of one field is typically much smaller than a MODIS pixel (250 m). As a result, we investigated the capability of combining Landsat 8 (16 day – 30 m) data with Sentinal- 2 (5 day – 10 to 20 m) to map <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> over very large areas such as Africa and South Asia. We developed the Automated <b>Crop</b> <b>Intensity</b> Algorithm (ACIA) to produce <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> at 30 -m using our Landsat- 8 and Sentinel- 2 combination data through Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. We smoothed the temporal 30 -m NDVI data from our Landsat- 8 and Sentinel- 2 combination to overcome cloud effects. The 30 -m NDVI time-series were then identified into 4 <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> classes with ACIA. The 4 <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> classes were: 1) Single crop, season 1, 2) Single crop season 2, 3) Double crop, and 4) continuous crop. When performing cropping intensity mapping with ACIA, we introduced the global crop seasonality map from SAGE Crop Calendar Dataset (Sacks, 2010) as a reference. The final 30 -m <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> map was evaluated by comparing with: 1) random samples interpreted by validators; 2) MODIS results; and 3) survey-based statistics. Although temporal frequency of our Landsat- 8 and Sentinel- 2 30 -m combination is far less than daily coverage of MODIS data, the results of <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> were comparable between the ACIA algorithm and MODIS r for the study areas (R 2 > 0. 75 and RMSE < 0. 15). Given the scaling ability provided by Google Earth Engine, the ACIA algorithm can also be applied to agricultural croplands anywhere in the world...|$|E

40|$|To {{feed the}} world’s growing population, more food {{needs to be}} produced. In {{addition}} to cropland expansion, which faces a variety of constraints, increasing <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> may provide a promising means of boosting global crop production. Yet information on the size and location of <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps—the difference between the maximum <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> that is theoretically possible and the <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> that is realized today—for current global croplands, and how much additional production can potentially be achieved by closing these gaps, is lacking. To address this issue, this study proposes a spatial approach to exploring <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps around the year 2000. We identify these gaps by estimating the potential multiple cropping systems and actual multiple cropping systems for current global croplands and then calculating the difference. An adapted GAEZ (Global Agro-Ecological Zone) method was used to estimate potential multiple cropping systems {{on the basis of}} meteorological data, while actual multiple cropping systems were derived from satellite-based observations. The results show that global average <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps are 0. 48 taking temperature constraints into account and 0. 17 taking temperature and precipitation constraints into account. The Latin American region has the largest concentration of <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps under both scenarios, followed by Africa and Asia. We also find that most food-insecure countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara, as indicated by higher Global Hunger Index scores, have high or moderate <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps in both scenarios. Reducing the <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps would provide an opportunity to increase food production and help people escape extreme hunger. We estimate that global harvests on current croplands can be expanded by an amount equivalent to another 7. 36 million and 2. 71 million square kilometers (km 2), respectively, under the temperature-limited and the temperature- and precipitation-limited scenarios. Latin America has the largest potential to achieve additional harvest area equivalents (more than 1. 28 million km 2) by closing <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps, followed by Asia (1. 00 million km 2). However, it must also be noted that although increasing <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> can boost annual crop production per unit of cropland, this approach is not necessarily always appropriate, and the trade-offs between reducing <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> gaps and caring for the environment must be considered. Only if <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> can be increased sustainably is this a potential strategy for enabling global food production to meet rising food demands.

40|$|Sustainable {{water use}} in {{agriculture}} faces several challenges due to future climate change, increasing population, and higher living standards. Adapting to possible future changes in climate and sustaining {{the use of}} water {{are some of the}} challenges that face future agricultural water management. In this research, the sustainability of irrigation water use was assessed by performance criteria that consider the effects of climate change and adaption management on irrigation. The model, built using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) system, is calibrated using the stream flow and the requirement of water for irrigation. The model was used to examine two future climate projections (A 2 and B 2), for time periods until 2099, and for four scenarios: (1) an increase in the irrigated area, (2) an increase in <b>crop</b> <b>intensity,</b> (3) a change in the crop pattern, and (4) a combination of increased irrigation area and increased <b>crop</b> <b>intensity.</b> Results show water supply is projected to increase by about 85 and 60 % (relative to the historical period) in A 2 and B 2 climate scenarios, respectively, {{by the end of the}} century. The requirement for irrigation water will decrease in the future, relative to the historical period. The sustainability index will also decrease in the future, relative to the historical period. Relative to the baseline scenario, increasing the irrigated area is more sustainable than increasing the <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> or combining increased <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> with increased area under irrigation. Increasing the irrigated area is more amenable to adaption to possible future climate changes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

The {{objective was to}} determine the influence of the land use systems (a combination of crop-fallow sequences and intercropping types) on soil hydraulic properties obtained by disc permeameter and double-ring infiltration measurements. The experiment was established in 1989 as a split-plot design with four replications. The main plots were natural fallow, planted Pueraria phaseoloides and planted Leucaena leucocephala. The subplots were 1 year of maize/cassava intercrop followed by 3 -year fallow (25 % <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity),</b> or 2 -year fallow (33 % <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity),</b> or 1 -year fallow (50 % <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity),</b> or no fallow period (100 % <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity).</b> Water infiltration rates and sorptivities were measured under saturated and unsaturated flow. Irrespective of land use, infiltration rates at the soil surface (121 - 324 cm h(- 1)) were greater than those measured at 30 cm depth (55 - 144 cm h(- 1)). This indicated that fewer large pores were present below 30 cm depth compared with 0 - 30 cm, depth. Despite some temporal variation, sorptivities with the highest mean value of 93. 5 cm h(- 1 / 2) increased as the <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> decreased, suggesting a more continuous macropore system under less intensive land use systems.

In previous work, geospatial analyses demonstrated that free grazing ducks played {{critical role in the}} epidemiology of the disease in Thailand in the winter 2004 / 2005, both in terms of HPAI emergence and spread. This study explored the geographic association between free grazing duck census counts and current statistics on the spatial distribution of rice crops in Thailand, in particular the crop calendar of rice production. The analysis was carried out using both district level rice statistics and rice distribution data predicted with the aid of remote sensing, using a rice-detection algorithm. The results indicated a strong association between the number of free grazing ducks and the number of months during which second-crop rice harvest takes place, {{as well as with the}} rice <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> as predicted by remote sensing. These results confirmed that free grazing duck husbandry was strongly driven by agricultural land use and rice <b>crop</b> <b>intensity,</b> and that this later variable can be readily predicted using remote sensing. Analysis of rice cropping patterns may provide an indication of the location of populations of free grazing ducks in other countries with similar mixed duck and rice production systems and less detailed duck census data. Apart from free ranging ducks and rice cropping, the role of hydrology and seasonality of wetlands and water bodies in the HPAI risk analysis is also discussed in relation to the presumed dry season aggregation of wild waterfowl and aquatic poultry offering much scope for virus transmission. © 2006 Elsevier B.

MIRCA 2000 was mainly derived from census data and crop calendars from literature. Global cropland extent was 16 million km 2 around the year 2000 of which 4. 4 million km 2 (28 %) was fallow, resulting in an average <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> of 0. 82 for total cropland extent and of 1. 13 when excluding fallow land. The lowest <b>cropping</b> <b>intensities</b> related to total cropland extent were found for Southern Africa (0. 45), Central America (0. 49) and Middle Africa (0. 54), while highest <b>cropping</b> <b>intensities</b> were computed for Eastern Asia (1. 04) and Southern Asia (1. 0). In remote or arid regions where shifting cultivation is practiced, fallow periods last 3 – 10 years or even longer. In contrast, crops are harvested two or more times per year in highly populated, often irrigated tropical or subtropical lowlands where multi-cropping systems are common. This indicates that intensification of agricultural land use is a strategy that {{may be able to}} significantly improve global food security.

Since water is the crucial input for increasing <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> and productivity, the demand for it has been increasing year after year. Among the competing demands for water, irrigation accounts for 75 % of the contemporary world’s total use of water. At present 40 % of all food production comes from 17 % of agricultural land that is irrigated and irrigation water provides employment for about 2. 4 billion people (DFID 1997).

Current techniques for quantifying <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> may not accurately map smallholder farms where the size of one field is typically smaller than the spatial resolution of readily available satellite data. We evaluated four methods that use multi-scalar datasets and are commonly used in the literature to assess <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> of smallholder farms: 1) the Landsat threshold method, which identifies if a Landsat pixel is cropped or uncropped during each growing season, 2) the MODIS peak method, which determines if there is a phenological peak in the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index time series during each growing season, 3) the MODIS temporal mixture analysis, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> using phenological MODIS data, and 4) the MODIS hierarchical training method, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> using hierarchical training techniques. Each method was assessed using four criteria: 1) data availability, 2) accuracy across different spatial scales (at aggregate scales 250 × 250 m, 1 × 1 km, 5 × 5 km, and 10 × 10 km), 3) ease of implementation, and 4) ability to use the method over large spatial and temporal scales. We applied our methods to two regions in India (Gujarat and southeastern Madhya Pradesh) that represented diversity in crop type, soils, climatology, irrigation access, <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity,</b> and field size. We found that the Landsat threshold method is the most accurate (R 2 greater than or equal to 0. 71 and RMSE less than or equal to 0. 14), particularly at smaller scales of analysis. Yet given the limited availability of Landsat data, we find that the MODIS hierarchical training method meets multiple criteria for mapping <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> over large spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, the adjusted R 2 between predicted and validation data generally increased and the RMSE decreased with spatial aggregation greater than or equal to 5 × 5 km (R 2 up to 0. 97 and RMSE as low as 0. 00). Our model accuracy varied based on the region and season of analysis and was lowest during the summer season in Gujarat when there was high sub-pixel heterogeneity due to sparsely cropped agricultural land-cover. While our results specifically apply to our study regions in India, they most likely also apply to smallholder agriculture in other locations across the globe where the same types of satellite data are readily available...|$|R
40|$|Lambunu Irrigation Area is {{administratively}} part of ParigiMoutong Regency, Central Sulawesi Province. This {{irrigation area}} is supplied by Lambunu River through its intake in Lambunu Weir and the irrigation water is supplied gravitationally. In the year 2014, planting pattern {{used in the}} area was paddy-paddy with 3, 825 ha and 3, 645 ha for planting schedule I and II, respectively. Ir- rigation operational pattern in Lambunu varied due to the development in irrigation system, the decrease of function of irrigation structures, the change of cropping pattern, and the fluctuation of irrigation water availability. Today, Lambunu Irrigation Area captures 5, 041 ha of potential areas. Due to the changes in irrigation system and water availability, {{it is necessary to}} do some optimiza- tion in irrigation operational patern in Lambunu in order to find optimum planting area and opti- mum farming production. Of some alternatives irrigation operational patterns, carried out based on grouped and rotation system for paddy-paddy-secondary crops, the most optimum irrigation operational patterns has been found. It is irrigation operational patterns with ungrouped system and three planting schedules as follows: - Paddy I is in December I to March II - Paddy II is in April I to July II - Secondary crops in August I to November II <b>Crop</b> <b>intensity</b> for paddy and secondary crops in the area is 200 % and 23 %- 28 %, respectively.

40|$|Accurate and {{spatially}} explicit {{monitoring of}} gross primary productivity of agricultural ecosystems {{at a large}} scale is of great significance to assessment of crop conditions and agricultural production, and is necessary for understanding the carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere. Identifying <b>crop</b> <b>intensity</b> (including multiple cropping and crop calendar) dynamics and assigning appropriate light use efficiency to C 3 and C 4 crops could substantially improve our ability to model and evaluate the seasonal dynamics of carbon flux in intensified agricultural ecosystems. In this paper, we have analyzed temporal dynamics of vegetation indices and phenological characteristics in the winter-wheat and maize double cropping system using multi-year satellite images from the moderate resolution imaging spectral radiometer (MODIS) and in situ observation of key crop phenological transition dates. The multiple cropping and crop calendar information were incorporated into simulations of the satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). Canopy-level maximum light use efficiency, a key parameter in the satellite-based VPM model, was estimated for both winter wheat (0) and maize (C 4) based on the observed CO(2) flux data from an eddy flux tower site in a winter wheat-maize double cropping agro-ecosystem in the Huang-Huai-Hai plain, China. The seasonal dynamics of GPP predicted by the VPM model agreed well with estimated GPP from eddy flux tower data. These results demonstrate {{the potential of the}} satellite-driven VPM model for scaling-up GPP estimation of intensified agricultural ecosystems, which is relevant to food production and security.

40|$|Abstract A pilot {{cropland}} {{carbon sequestration}} program within north central Montana has allowed farmers to receive carbon credit for management adjustments associated with changing from tillage-based agricultural systems to no-till. Carbon credit {{can also be}} obtained by adopting conservation reserve, where cropland is planted into perennial vegetation. Summer fallowing is also considered within the crediting process as credit is not given in years that a field is left un-vegetated. The carbon sequestration program has been advocated {{as a means to}} mitigate climate change while providing an added source of income for Montana farmers. There is lack of data, however, pertaining to the percentage of lands within this region that have not converted to no-till management, lands under certain crop intensities (e. g. those that are cropped every growing season vs. those that use a fallow-crop-fallow system), or cropland that have converted to perennial vegetation outside of the popular Conservation Reserve Program. Data is also sparse concerning the amount of soil organic carbon that might be sequestered given a conversion to no-till or conservation reserve. This study established regional percentage estimates of cropland under no-till, various degrees of <b>crop</b> <b>intensity,</b> and conservation reserve within north central Montana. Literature-based carbon sequestration estimates were used to generate carbon gain data associated with the conversation to no-till and to conservation reserve. These estimates were then applied to the area-based cropland statistics to estimate potential regional carbon sequestration associated with these management changes...|$|E

Here, we observe spatio-temporal trends in land surface phenology parameters (<b>cropping</b> <b>intensity,</b> length of growing season and productivity) for kharif and rabi cropping seasons from satellite data across the Indo-Gangetic Plains from 1982 to 2006. The productivity of the Indo-Gangetic Plains croplands is of regional importance and is a vital component of Indian national food security efforts. Aside from local and intra-state heterogeneity in observed trends {{there was a clear}} west-to-east gradient in <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity.</b> Key observed trends include increasing <b>cropping</b> <b>intensity</b> in the eastern IGP, increasing number of growing days per year in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and increasing productivity in both cropping seasons across the IGP.
