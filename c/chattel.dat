5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} <b>chattel</b> slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The <b>chattel</b> helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other <b>chattel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most historians thus concur that <b>chattel</b> {{slaves were}} indeed {{used in the}} Greek {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, <b>chattel</b> slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{had many}} degrees of enslavement. There was a {{multitude}} of categories, ranging from free citizen to <b>chattel</b> slave, and including Penestae or helots, disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and metics. The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the doctrine of title by possession and the doctrine of relative title. Many property lawyers believe that these doctrines are elementary, important and interesting. But, while virtually everyone accepts that possession of land or <b>chattels</b> is a source of title and that titles are relative, the doctrines have long been a focus of debate. The nature of possession, the nature of the possessorâs title, and the relationships between possession, relative title and ownership have been particularly contentious. Accordingly, this thesis seeks to provide sound answers to the following questions: (1) what, in this context, is possession? (2) What {{is the nature of the}} title that is acquired by taking possession of land or <b>chattels?</b> (3) Does English law recognise landownership and chattel-ownership?âand, if it does, is a person who acquires, by virtue of his or her possession, a title to land or <b>chattels</b> the (or an) owner of the land or <b>chattels?</b> It is argued in Chapter 2 that, for the purposes of the doctrine of title by possession, the general rule is that a person is in possession of land or <b>chattels</b> if and only if she has: (i) a sufficient degree of exclusive physical control; and (ii) an intention to possess. Chapters 3 â 5 are concerned with the second question. It is argued that, upon obtaining possession, a person acquires, in cases involving land, an estate in fee simple absolute in possession and, in cases involving <b>chattels,</b> a general property interest. Chapter 6 {{is concerned with}} the third question. It is argued that English law does recognise landownership and chattel-ownership; and that a person who acquires a title by obtaining possession of land or <b>chattels</b> owns the land or <b>chattels</b> if her title is supreme but not if it is inferior. </p...|$|R

St. Clare recognizes the evil in <b>chattel</b> slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|In May 1803 a shipload of captive West Africans, upon {{surviving}} the middle passage, were landed by U.S.-paid captors in Savannah by slave ship, to be auctioned off {{at one of}} the local slave markets. The ship's enslaved passengers included a number of Igbo people from what is now Nigeria. The Igbo were known by planters and slavers of the American South for being fiercely independent and resistant to <b>chattel</b> slavery. The group of 75 Igbo slaves were bought by agents of John Couper and Thomas Spalding for forced labor on their plantations in St. Simons Island for $100 each.|$|E
5|$|Spartan {{citizens}} used helots, {{a dependent}} group collectively {{owned by the}} state. It is uncertain whether they had <b>chattel</b> slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.|$|E

5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from <b>chattel</b> slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient <b>chattel</b> of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E

25|$|Trespass and trover {{were both}} actions founded upon possession. For many centuries, they were {{alternative}} remedies for the wrongful taking of, or damage to chattels. There was {{a distinction between}} the actions. In the theory of trespass, the plaintiff remained the owner of the <b>chattel,</b> with the possession or property rights interrupted or interfered with. In this case, the plaintiff must accept the <b>chattel</b> back when it was tendered. Recovery was limited to any damage to the <b>chattel,</b> or from the interruption of property rights.|$|E
