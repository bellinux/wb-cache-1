Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador to NATO, warned that Georgia's NATO membership aspirations would cause Russia to support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian State Duma adopted a resolution on 21 March, in which it <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> President of Russia and the government to consider the recognition.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting began local magistrates <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} authorities to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him, and to disperse the crowd. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman wars instigated great {{demographic}} changes. Croats migrated towards Austria and {{the present-day}} Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers.

Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} cause for {{a confrontation with}} the JNA in Split was a blockade of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian authorities had established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladić, and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuđman <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public to bring the siege to its end.|$|E

5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E

5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were growing and <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists {{had taken over the}} League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{public to}} bring the siege to an end, and the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E
5|$|Endecott's {{responsibility}} was {{to establish}} the colony and to prepare it {{for the arrival of}} additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, and he <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plymouth Colony for medical assistance. His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony's settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which including a May pole and dancing) were anathema to the conservative Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the abandoned site of Morton's colony and had the Maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.|$|E

An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia {{was laid}} down on 1 June 1891, {{launched}} on 29 April 1893, and commissioned into the fleet in November 1894.

The squadron <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> port of Brest, France on the way, and stopped in Portsmouth on the return voyage. In early 1897, the ship joined the massive international fleet that demonstrated off Crete to protest the Greek annexation of the island from the Ottoman Empire. The Austro-Hungarian fleet was the third largest contingent, after the Italians and British. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans were dissatisfied with the compromise worked out, and so withdrew their contingents early, in March 1898.|$|E
