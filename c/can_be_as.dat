5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E

5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> pure as 98%.|$|E

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below.

5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> thick as 11 inches.

It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case}} of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, {{as in the case of}} Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> brief as {{three days to}} as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> thick as 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
