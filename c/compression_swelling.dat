40|$|International audienceOnly few {{data are}} {{available}} concerning {{the effect of the}} four main clay minerals, kaolinite (K), illite (I), montmorillonite (M) and chlorite (C), on the mechanical properties of clayey soils. This paper discusses the effect of different mineral contents on the <b>compression</b> and <b>swelling</b> indexes of clay mixtures in order to provide correlations between the mineralogical content of a clayey soil and its compressive properties. Four pure clay powders were used to prepare 34 clay mixtures (different proportions of K+I, K+I+M, K+I+C). Conventional oedometer tests were conducted on all the prepared samples. Based on the test results, the evolution of the compressive properties with the proportions of pure clays was estimated and relevant correlations are suggested. All the results demonstrate that the <b>compression</b> and <b>swelling</b> indexes are reasonably well correlated to the proportion of clay minerals. The content in montmorillonite influences significantly the compressive properties of clayey soils, and the contents of illite and chlorite are less influential when added to kaolinite based clayey soils. Moreover, 15 samples with different proportions of K+I+M+C were prepared and tested, and the proposed correlations were validated in light of the results obtained on these materials...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the changes of electrical {{resistance of the}} carbon black (CB) and carbon nanotube (CNT) filled epoxy composites upon <b>compression,</b> <b>swelling</b> and temperature variation. For all samples we observe a decrease of electrical resistance under compression, while an increase of electrical resistance is found upon swelling due to water absorption. With the same volumetric change, the CB/epoxy composites have a more pronounced change of electrical resistance than the CNT/epoxy composites. The influence of temperature variations on the overall electrical resistance is somewhat more complex. At low temperatures, electrical resistance clearly decreases with increasing temperature, mainly owing to the thermal fluctuation induced tunneling conduction mechanism. At high temperatures, electrical resistance decreases much slower and may even increase due to a more prominent thermal expansion effect. The thermal expansion of the epoxy matrix leads to a decrease of tunneling conduction. Without {{the contribution of the}} thermal expansion, the sensitivity and linearity of electrical resistance change upon temperature variations is higher. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Vertisols {{are deep}} clayey soils, {{with more than}} 45 % clay, {{dominated}} by clay minerals such as smectites, which expand upon wetting and shrink upon drying. The most important physical characteristics of Vertisols are a low hydraulic conductivity and stickiness when wet and high flow of water through the cracks when dry. They become very hard when dry and {{in all the time}} are difficult to work. During the rainy season, the cracks disappear and the soil becomes sticky and plastic with a very slippery surface which makes Vertisols hardly trafficable when wet. Water movement in soil that change volume with water content is not well understood and the management of swelling soil remains problematic. Swelling or shrinking result in vertical displacement of the wet soil, which involves gravitational work and contributes to an overburden component to the total potential of the soil water. Many swelling soils crack and the network of cracks provides pathways for rapid flow of water, which prejudice application of theory based on Darcian flow. One – dimensional flow of water in a swelling system requires material balance equation for both the aqueous and solid phases.

To examine {{whether there is an}} association between genetic polymorphism in a structural gene, and alterations in the mechanical properties of the intervertebral discs that may predispose to disc degeneration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Genetic studies have demonstrated that a polymorphism (Trp 2 allele) in COL 9 A 2 coding for α 2 chain of collagen IX predisposes the individual to disc degeneration. The mechanism of this predisposition is not known. METHODS. Blood and whole disc samples were retrieved from adolescents and young adults during scoliosis surgery, degenerated discs were retrieved from patients with back pain during anterior spinal fusion. Anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus from a set of the scoliosis discs were used to perform immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the presence of collagen IX in the scoliosis discs. For the remaining samples, DNA was extracted from blood to determine the Trp 2 status by sequencing. Nondegenerated (Trp 2 -), nondegenerated (Trp 2 +), and degenerated (Trp 2 -) nucleus pulposus samples were tested in confined <b>compression.</b> <b>Swelling</b> pressure and compressive modulus were measured and compared between groups. RESULTS. Positive staining of collagen IX was detected in both anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus sections confirming its presence in the scoliosis discs. The mean swelling pressure and compressive modulus values of 6 nondegenerated (Trp 2 +) samples (swelling pressure = 0. 0019 MPa, compressive modulus = 0. 97 MPa) were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than those of the 6 nondegenerated (Trp 2 -) samples (swelling pressure = 0. 015 MPa; compressive modulus = 1. 89 MPa). CONCLUSION. This is the first study to demonstrate an association between the Trp 2 allele and disc mechanics, thus relating genetic variations and debilitating mechanical alterations that may ultimately result in intervertebral disc degeneration. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

To confirm this observation, identification tests were extended to an artificial soil corresponding to a mixture of kaolinite/bentonite with different salinities. The results obtained confirm the significant effect of pore water chemistry. To further clarify this effect, oedometer tests were performed with both site water and deionised water. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>compression</b> index, <b>swelling</b> index, and secondary consolidation coefficient are higher in the case of deionised water, whereas the oedometer modulus, consolidation coefficient and hydraulic conductivity are larger in the case of site water.

The chemical part of swelling is therefore noticeable; it strongly depends on the stress level and it prevails on the mechanical part under very low values of confining stress. Moreover, it is extremely slow. On the basis of such results, {{it is possible to}} interpret the field trend of void ratio against depth from the ground floor.

The results show that volume changes and swelling pressure are strongly influenced by {{the composition of the}} pore liquid {{as well as by the}} composition of the liquid the clay is exposed to. In particular, exposure to distilled water causes larger swelling than exposure to the salt solution. The difference is particularly high at low stress level, in which case physicochemical processes rather than mechanical processes seem to dominate the clay behaviour.

Contamination effect and contamination duration are achieved by storing the clay samples in pressurized tank filled with motor oil under pressure of approximately 65  kPa which is almost equivalent to the overburden pressure that affected the clay at the field. Four parameters are considered to follow the contamination effect; Atterberg limits, unconfined compressive strength, coefficient of permeability, and compressibility characteristics. The experimental study reveals that the unconfined compressive strength is reduced by about 38 % {{as compared to the}} control value (uncontaminated). The reduction remains for 6  months and declines furthermore attaining constant value. The contamination of the clay with motor oil entailed substantial microstructural changes: relatively loose packing of clay particles and their detachment from grain surface.

These limits remain constant for 24  months (experiment duration). The coefficient of permeability is significantly increase and exhibits direct proportion with duration of contamination up to 3  months.

MethodCase reports and series obtained after a thorough MEDLINE search were indexed according to compressed structures. Patient demographics, main findings, method of diagnosis, cyst size, outcomes, and follow-up were recorded for each publication. ResultsSigns and symptoms related to popliteal vein and tibial nerve compression were the most frequent presentation of symptomatic Baker cysts, due to the anatomic vulnerability of these structures within the popliteal fossa and their relative sensitivity to compression. Patients with tibial nerve entrapment demonstrated gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, paresthesias, and pain. Those with popliteal vein <b>compression</b> experienced <b>swelling,</b> pain, and rarely, venous thromboembolism. Isolated arterial compression, presenting with intermittent claudication, is a rare occurrence because it is a relatively stiff-walled vessel, has a higher pressure, and is located deep in the popliteal fossa.

ConclusionsBaker cyst is an important pathology for the differential diagnosis of popliteal neurovascular compression phenomena.

An iterative procedure was used to predict the convective transport of physiologically relevant molecules within the disc. An axisymmetric, poroelastic finite-element structural model of the disc was developed. The diurnal loading was divided into discrete time steps.

Loading was simulated for a complete diurnal cycle, and the relative convective and diffusive transport was compared for solutes with molecular weights ranging from 400 Da to 40 kDa. Consistent with previous studies, fluid flow did not enhance the transport of low-weight solutes. During swelling, interstitial fluid flow increased the unidirectional penetration of large solutes by approximately 100 %. Due to the bi-directional temporal nature of disc loading, however, the net effect of convective transport over a full diurnal cycle was more limited (30 % increase).

The model successfully predicts the water content of the compressed membrane measured through in-situ swelling-compression tests and neutron imaging. The results show that external mechanical loads could reduce the water content and conductivity of the membrane, especially at lower temperatures, higher humidities, and in liquid water. The modeling framework and experimental data provide valuable insight for the swelling and conductivity of constrained and compressed membranes, which are of interest in electrochemical devices such as batteries and fuel cells...|$|R
40|$|Functionally {{gradient}} materials (FGMs) with gradual {{and continuous}} changes of their properties {{in one or}} more dimensions are useful {{in a wide range of}} applications. However, obtaining such materials with accurate control of the gradient, especially when the gradient is nonlinear, is not easy. In this work, frontal polymerization (FP) was exploited to synthesize polymeric FGMs. We demonstrated that the use of ascending FP with continuous feeding of monomers with computer-controlled peristaltic pumps provided an excellent method for the preparation of functionally gradient materials with programmed gradients. To test the effectiveness of the method, copolymers made from triethylene glycol dimethacrylate/hexyl methacrylate with linear and hyperbolic gradient in composition were synthesized. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Shore A hardness measurements, <b>compression</b> tests, and <b>swelling</b> studies were performed along the length of the materials to assess the relationship between the gradients and the material properties. Glass transition temperatures, determined by DSC, showed a linear dependence on the composition and were in agreement with theoretical values. The other properties showed different and specific behaviors as a function of the compositional gradient...|$|R
40|$|To produce Low Molecular Weight Organic Compound (LMWOC), the H 2 O 2 {{solution}} is {{being considered for}} bio-methane production in the Subsurface Cultivation and Gasification (SCG) method. Core samples of about 30 mm in diameter and 60 mm in height were prepared from the lignite blocks collected from stream side in Horonobe, Hokkaido were submerged into 1 % H 2 O 2 solution. The changes in physical and mechanical properties were observed by measuring the size, weight, ultrasonic velocity and uniaxial <b>compression</b> test. The <b>swelling,</b> leaching and breakage processes were in action due to reaction of lignite with the H 2 O 2 solution. The density slightly increased and then decreased, and the ultrasonic velocity decreased with reaction time. The mechanism of the phenomenon was mainly due to change in mineral grains forming LMWOC and of microcracks. Lignite became relatively weaker and less stiff after reaction.
