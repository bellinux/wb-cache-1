2500|$|Two historians flourished during Greece's {{classical}} age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus {{is commonly}} called {{the father of}} history, and his [...] "History" [...] contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His <b>critical</b> <b>use</b> of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians. The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Grigori Perelman sketched a {{proof of}} the geometrization {{conjecture}} by showing that the Ricci flow can indeed be continued past the singularities, and has the behavior described above. [...] The main difficulty in verifying Perelman's {{proof of the}} geometrization conjecture was a <b>critical</b> <b>use</b> of his Theorem 7.4 in the preprint 'Ricci Flow with surgery on three-manifolds'. This theorem was stated by Perelman without proof. [...] There are now several different proofs of Perelman's Theorem 7.4, or variants of it which are sufficient to prove geometrization. [...] There is the paper of Shioya and Yamaguchi that uses Perelman's stability theorem and a fibration theorem for Alexandrov spaces. This method, with full details leading to the proof of geometrization, {{can be found in}} the exposition by Bruce Kleiner and [...] John Lott in 'Notes on Perelman's papers' in the journal Geometry & Topology.|$|E

In the same month Kotzebue returned to Saint Petersburg, bringing bad news of the events that happened more than a year before; the directors received letters from Schäffer himself, the most recent dated April 1818, from Rio de Janeiro. In a memorandum to the Minister of the Interior in 1818, Schäffer stressed the importance of controlling the profitable Hawaiian markets. The Board of Directors was requested its opinion of pursuing such a project, agreeing that Hawaiian supplies would be of <b>critical</b> <b>use</b> to settlements in Russian America, Okhotsk and on the Kamchatka Peninsula. As before, the RAC refused to act on the proposal until authorized by the Imperial government.

2500|$|At Montreal, the {{participants}} agreed to freeze production of CFCs at 1986 levels {{and to reduce}} production by 50 percent by 1999. After a series of scientific expeditions to the Antarctic produced convincing evidence that the ozone hole was indeed caused by chlorine and bromine from manmade organohalogens, the Montreal Protocol was strengthened at a 1990 meeting in London. The participants agreed to phase out CFCs and halons entirely (aside from a very small amount marked for certain [...] "essential" [...] uses, such as asthma inhalers) by 2000 in non-Article 5 countries and by 2010 in Article 5 (less developed) signatories. At a 1992 meeting in Copenhagen, the phase-out date was moved up to 1996. At the same meeting, methyl bromide (MeBr), a fumigant used primarily in agricultural production, {{was added to the}} list of controlled substances. For all substances controlled under the protocol, phaseout schedules were delayed for less developed ('Article 5(1)') countries, and phaseout in these countries was supported by transfers of expertise, technology, and money from non-Article 5(1) Parties to the Protocol. Additionally, exemptions from the agreed schedules could be applied for under the Essential Use Exemption (EUE) process for substances other than methyl bromide and under the <b>Critical</b> <b>Use</b> Exemption (CUE) process for methyl bromide.|$|E

We {{describe}} longitudinal patterns of <b>critical</b> care <b>use</b> among a nationally representative cohort of elderly patients monitored from the onset of common serious illnesses. A retrospec-tive population-based cohort study of elderly patients in fee-for-service Medicare is used, with 1, 108, 060 Medicare beneficiaries at least 68 {{years of age and}} newly diagnosed with serious illnesses: 1 of 9 malignancies, stroke, congestive heart failure, hip fracture, or myocardial infarction. Medicare inpatient hospital claims from diagnosis until death (65. 1 %) or fixed-right censoring (more than 4 years) were reviewed. Distinct hospitalizations involving <b>critical</b> care <b>use</b> (intensive care unit or critical care unit) were counted and associated reimbursements were assessed; repeated use was defined as five or more such hospitalizations. Of the cohort, 54. 9 % <b>used</b> <b>critical</b> care at some time after diagnosis. Older patients were much less likely to ever <b>use</b> <b>critical</b> care (odds ratio, 0. 31; comparing patients more than 90 years old with those 68 – 70 years old), even after adjustment.

We conclude that <b>critical</b> care <b>use</b> is common in serious chronic illness and is not associated solely with preterminal hospitalizations.
