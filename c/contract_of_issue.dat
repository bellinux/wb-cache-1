40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{issues related to}} the {{legitimation}} of a condominium to claim damages under a warranty for defects in the common property, arising from individual <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> sale. The main issue discussed is who has the right to claim damages: the individual owners of flats, seeking their rights as arising from general provisions, or the housing community (the condominium as such), {{on the basis of its}} rights arising from a joint management of common property. In other words, whether the condominium may claim damages despite the fact that those claims arise from individual <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> sale. This <b>issue</b> is new in Polish literature, and similar problems are treated and solved differently in different legal systems, especially in the German and Swiss systems. Each of those solutions has certain advantages and disadvantages because the individual’s and group’s interests are always difficult to match and solve. However, the analysis of Polish regulations suggests that the Swiss solution, preferring the individual’s interest, should be adopted. In that solution, legitimation to claim damages under a warranty goes only the individual purchasers, or owners of flats. The housing community (condominium) would be authorised to claim damages only if such claims have been acquired by it by way of a transfer of such rights...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to survey the {{emerging}} legal issues associated with two developments: (1) the trend toward use <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> production for grain and (2) the connection between this development and the protection of intellectual property rights for seeds and plants. The article begins by reviewing the forces contributing to the increased use <b>of</b> production <b>contracts</b> and the reasons companies involved in grain processing and marketing are attracted to using contracts. It then considers the effect entering a production contract may have on the decisionmaking ability of farmers and the potential economic impacts <b>of</b> <b>contracting.</b> This discussion identifies a list of basic rules for farmers to consider when evaluating contracting opportunities. The next section of the article is a more detailed discussion <b>of</b> selected legal <b>issues</b> which may be associated with use <b>of</b> grain production <b>contracts.</b> A variety <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> are discussed, including the nature of the relationship, the forms of pricing terms used, and questions about the timing of payment. This discussion is followed by an inventory of the different clauses typically found in production contracts, illustrated with provisions from contracts currently being used in the Midwest. The article then presents a preliminary analysis <b>of</b> selected <b>issues</b> identified by reviewing contract provisions, including several Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) contract questions commonly considered by courts. The section includes a discussion of the potential to use state legislation to regulate contracting practices. Finally, a comprehensive discussion <b>of</b> the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property protections applicable to the production of grains is presented. The discussion focuses on the impact such protections have on the ability of farmers to save their own crops as seed to plant or sell to other farmers. The article concludes by discussing how the increased use <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> for the production of grain crops has the potential to create a range of important legal and policy issues which may need to be addressed both at the level of individual producers and from the viewpoint of society as a whole...|$|R

40|$|I]f the assured is not {{entitled}} to retain an excess against the insurer, and the insurer … is not entitle to receive the excess from the assured, {{what happens to the}} excess?” This question, posed by Lord Justice Megaw in L. Lucas Ltd. v. Export Credits Guarantee Department, is bred by the juxtaposition of two subrogation rules. The right to subrogation, being in nature like restitution, entitles the holder of the right only to reimbursement and, under a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> insurance, “the assured … shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified. ” The confusion that distribution of windfall profits in subrogation has brought to American and English courts derives from both the difficulty of the question and its rarity. Because insurance agreements are <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> indemnity, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> which party is entitled to any possible excess once both the insurer and the insured have been indemnified has seldom been litigated. This comment will evaluate a subrogee’s right to recover more than it paid to the subrogor. The purpose of subrogation and insurance will be outlined, focusing on those few recent cases in England and the United States dealing with the profit-in-subrogation issue. Next, this Comment will examine the circumstances under which a windfall might accrue to the insurer and the possible justifications and consequences of such a windfall award. A flexible approach for courts confronted with allocating a windfall in an equitable subrogation suit will then be proposed. Finally the implications of choosing a flexible approach to windfalls in subrogation will be contrasted with the view that the windfall be awarded strictly to either the insured or the insurer...|$|R
