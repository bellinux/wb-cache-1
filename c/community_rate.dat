25|$|Robert M. Ball, {{a former}} {{commissioner}} of Social Security under President Kennedy in 1961 (and later under Johnson, and Nixon) defined the {{major obstacle to}} financing health insurance for the elderly: {{the high cost of}} care for the aged combined with the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance {{in the same way as}} cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment. In the early 1960s relatively few of the elderly had health insurance, and what they had was usually inadequate. Insurers such as Blue Cross, which had originally applied the principle of community rating, faced competition from other commercial insurers that did not <b>community</b> <b>rate,</b> and so were forced to raise their rates for the elderly.|$|E

Methods and Results: Three sequential batch reactors (SBR) were inoculated with sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, fed with ammonium- enriched tap water and operated in parallel for 134 days. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) demonstrated co-evolvement of the AOB communities over time. During start-up, temporary decreases in nitrification were noticed, and the AOB <b>community</b> <b>rate</b> of change values (Delta(t(week))) were medium to high (12 - 22 %). During the adjacent period of complete nitrification, low AOB community dynamics were observed (Delta(t) (week) < 5 %). Further pragmatic processing of the DGGE profiles revealed a high range-weighted richness and a medium functional organization of the AOB communities. Conclusions: After a start-up period, high functional stability and low dynamics of the AOB communities were observed. Deterministic rather than stochastic driving forces led to AOB community co-evolvement in the replicate SBR.

40|$|Despite {{universal}} access entitlements {{to the public}} healthcare system in Ireland, over half the population is covered by voluntary private health insurance. The market operates {{on the basis of}} <b>community</b> <b>rating,</b> open enrolment and lifetime cover. A set of minimum benefits also exists, and two risk equalisation schemes have been put in place but neither was implemented. These schemes have proved highly controversial. To date, the debate has primarily consisted of qualitative arguments. This study adds a quantitative element by analysing a number of pertinent issues. A model of a <b>community</b> <b>rated</b> insurance market is developed, which shows that <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> can only be maintained in a competitive market if all insurers in the market have the same risk profile as the market overall. This has relevance to the Irish market {{in the aftermath of a}} Supreme Court decision to set aside risk equalisation. Two reasons why insurers’ risk profiles might differ are adverse selection and risk selection. Evidence is found of the existence of both forms of selection in the Irish market. A move from single <b>rate</b> <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> to lifetime <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> in Australia had significant consequences for take-up rates and the age profile of the insured population. A similar move has been proposed in Ireland. It is found that, although this might improve the stability of <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> in the short term, it would not negate the need for risk equalisation. If <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> were to collapse then risk rating might result. A comparison of the Irish, Australian and UK health insurance markets suggests that <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> encourages higher take-up among older consumers than risk rating.

Parasites were still present on day 6 or 7 in 4. 7 % (11 / 234) of episodes treated with quinine. The overall 28 day parasite reappearance rate following quinine was 28. 7 % (60 / 209) for primary treatments and 44 % (11 / 25) for re-treatments. Quinine treatment resulted in a high rate of gametocyte carriage: person-gametocyte-weeks = 42. 5 (95 % CI 27. 8 - 62. 1) per 1000 woman-weeks. For P. vivax, the reappearance rate for all episodes by day 28 was 4. 5 % (5 / 111). Significantly more women complained of tinnitus following quinine treatment compared to on admission: 64. 5 % (78 / 121) vs 31. 6 % (59 / 187), P < 0. 001.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the rates of residential relocations over the course of 10. 5 years and evaluate differences in these relocation rates according to gender and decedent status. Design: Prospective, longitudinal study with monthly telephone follow-up for up to 126 months. Setting: Greater New Haven, CT. Participants: There were 754 participants, aged 70 years or older, who were initially community-living and nondisabled in their basic activities of daily living. Measurements: Residential location was assessed during monthly interviews and included community, assisted living facility, and nursing home. A residential relocation was defined as a change of residential location for at least 1 week and included relocations within (eg, community-community) or between (community-assisted living) locations. We calculated the rates of relocations per 1000 patient-months and evaluated differences by gender and decedent status. Results: Sixty-six percent of participants had at least one residential relocation (range 0 - 12). Women had lower rates of relocations from nursing home to <b>community</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio [RR] 0. 59, P =. 02); otherwise, there were no gender differences. Decedents had higher rates of relocation from community to assisted living (RR 1. 71, P =. 002), from community to nursing home (RR 3. 64, P <. 001), between assisted living facilities (RR 3. 65, P <. 001), and from assisted living to nursing home (RR 2. 5, P <. 001).

We investigated the association between heat and daily number of emergency department visits at the University Hospital of Verona during the warm seasons 2011 - 2012 and we assessed the magnitude of the impact in terms of attributable events, focusing on the role of age and triage codification. We used a Poisson model to analyse the association between daily number of visits and daily mean apparent temperature, accounting for air pollution level and seasonality. The analyses were stratified by age group and were performed both on the total number of emergency department visits and on the subsample of high-priority visits. Impact estimates were obtained only for this subsample, using a Monte Carlo approach to account for sampling variability. Number of attributable events and attributable <b>community</b> <b>rate</b> were calculated. We found a positive and immediate association between event occurrence and mean apparent temperatures exceeding a threshold located around 28 - 29 °C. The estimated percent change in the total number of visits per 1 °C increase of exposure above the threshold was equal to 3. 75 (90 % CI: 3. 01; 4. 49). Focusing only on high-priority visits, the estimated percent change was larger and the greatest effect was among children. We estimated that apparent temperatures above the threshold were responsible for 1177 high-priority visits during the study period. Due to the record high temperatures observed in 2012 in Italy and in Europe, the impact in 2012 was much larger than in 2011, and consisted in 34 high-priority visits every 10000 children, 30 every 10000 people aged 15 - 64, and 38 every 10000 people aged 65 and over.

To assess the temporal trend in varicella vaccine administration before 18 and 24 months of age in a community cohort of children prior to, during and after the recent varicella vaccine shortage. And to compare the temporal trends in varicella vaccinations to trends of an older, more widely accepted vaccine, the MMR. Methods Community population-based birth cohorts were identified who were eligible for the varicella vaccination before, during and after the 2001 to 2002 varicella vaccine shortage. Only children (84 % of all) who remained in the community through their second birthday were included. For each child in the cohort, the medical records and immunization registry records from both medical facilities in the county were reviewed to identify the dates and sites for all varicella immunizations given. In addition to varicella immunizations, the dates of all MMR vaccinations were recorded. Additional data abstracted included the child's birth date, gender and dates of any recognized cases of chickenpox up through age 24 months. Results Of the 2, 512 children in the birth cohorts, 50. 8 % were boys. In the three cohorts combined, 81. 1 % of the boys and 79. 3 % of the girls (p = 0. 30) received the varicella vaccine by age 24 months. The pre-shortage <b>community</b> <b>rate</b> of varicella immunization was 79. 7 % by 24 months of age. During the varicella vaccine shortage, the rate of varicella immunization by 24 months fell to 77. 2 %. Only 6 additional children received a "catch-up" immunization by 36 months of age. In the post shortage period the community 24 -month immunization rate rebounded to a level higher than the pre-shortage rate 84. 0 %. During the almost three years of observation, the MMR immunization rate by age 24 months was constant (87 %). Conclusion The varicella shortage was associated with an immediate drop in the 24 -month varicella immunizations rate but rebounded quickly to above pre-shortage rates. In this community the only long term impact of the varicella vaccine shortage may be on the small number of children who still had not received catch-up varicella immunizations by 36 months of age. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Washington State UniversityGiven the {{deteriorated}} {{relationship between}} {{the police and the}} people of Ghana, this study examines the causes of trust in selected urban areas in Ghana. Specifically, the study aims to: (1) test the performance theory for its applicability and generalizability in Ghana; (2) examine individual and contextual variables likely to affect Ghanaians' trust in the police. Three theoretically based research questions and four theory-driven hypotheses developed around specific indicators of the police performance theory guided this study. It was hypothesized that: (1) perception of police effectiveness will positively affect citizen's trust in the police; (2) fear of crime will {{have a negative effect on}} citizen's level of trust in the police; (3) perception of neighborhood disorder will have a negative effect on trust in the police; and (4) citizen's experiences of police corruption will have a negative effect on their trust in the police. Using representative data collected between March and June 2014 from selected urban areas/cities in five administrative regions of Ghana, the study observed three patterns attitudes toward the police in the Ghanaian socio-cultural context. The first observable pattern was that, findings from the study support the general assumption that citizens' trust and confidence in institutions increase as their perceptions of institutional performance increase. This assumption is derived from the performance theory. The second pattern that was observed from the results of the present study was that procedural justice theory can also be used to explain variations in Ghanaian's trust. Finally, using multilevel modeling technique, findings from the study revealed significant contribution of community/neighborhood-level characteristics in explaining variations in aggregate levels of trust in different neighborhoods. Specifically, <b>community</b> <b>rate</b> of disorder, community levels of income and education, as well as average fear of crime in the neighborhood exerted significant influence on the level of trust of people living in the area, controlling for their individual characteristics, such as ethnic background, perception of fairness, and exposure to the media. The findings have several implications for the Ghana Police, and by adopting a multidimensional approach, several recommendations were offered to improve and strengthen public relationship with the police.

40|$|Short-term {{variability}} in microbial food web dynamics was investigated from 3 to 17 May 2001 at 2 contrasting {{sites in the}} Urdaibai estuary (Bay of Biscay). The lower site is located {{in an area where}} tidal advection exerts a major influence, whereas the upper site is located in area where the influence of the tide is much lower and that of river runoff is markedly higher than at the lower site. The biomass of microbial plankton (phytoplankton, bacteria, non-pigmented flagellates [NPF] and ciliates) and their rates of activities (primary production, bacterial production, herbivory, bacterivory and microbial community respiration) were markedly higher at the upper site, thus showing that tidal flushing is a key factor controlling these spatial differences along the longitudinal axis of the estuary, rendering the upper channel a high productivity zone and the lower euhaline area a less productive one. Water residence time also exerted an overriding effect on chlorophyll a distribution on a temporal basis, with drastic increases in river runoff, due to heavy rain pulses, being responsible for immediate bloom dispersion in the upper channel. Bacterial density was less affected than phytoplankton biomass by increased river flow. It is hypothesised that detrital material increases caused by increases in river runoff provided an extra source of carbon for bacterial growth. On average, microbial herbivory was responsible for the fate of ca. 50 % of chlorophyll a standing stock. Herbivory rates were not significantly different on phytoplankton 0. 2 µm and on those 8 µm in size and grazing pressure on phytoplankton was lower in the more productive site. Protists 1 to 8 µm in size were the main bacterivores. No synchrony was observed between bacterial and NPF abundances. Instead a lag phase was observed between the peak densities of bacteria and NPF, which was larger at the more productive upper site than in the lower estuary and allowed bacteria in the former zone to exploit substrate availability without significant grazing control for several days. Microbial <b>community</b> <b>rate</b> of respiration was significantly correlated with bacterivory rates and NPF abundance in the upper estuary, but not in the lower zone. The median of the proportion of bacterial production removed by bacterivory was 64 % at the lower estuary station and 17 % in the upper estuary. A possible explanation for this difference could be that attached bacteria (abundant in {{the upper reaches of the}} estuary) are less accessible for protistan grazing. Bacterivory by protists accounted for a mean of 14 and 7 % of protistan herbivory at the lower and upper sites respectively...|$|E

The consistency of these declines with existing estimates of the relative {{risk of heart attack}} in individuals attributable to passive smoking exposure is poorly understood. The objective is to determine the consistency of estimates of reductions in <b>community</b> <b>rates</b> of heart attacks resulting from smoking restriction laws with estimates of the relative risk of heart disease in individuals exposed to passive smoking. Methods and Results—Meta-analyses of existing estimates of declines in <b>community</b> <b>rates</b> were compared with a mathematical model of the relationship between individual risk and <b>community</b> <b>rates.</b> The outcome measure is the ratio of <b>community</b> <b>rates</b> of acute myocardial infarction (after divided by before implementation of a smoking restriction law).

The primary reason for heterogeneity in results of different studies is the duration of follow-up after adoption of the law. The pooled random-effects estimate of the rate of acute myocardial infarction hospitalization 12 months after implementation of the law is 0. 83 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 80 to 0. 87), and this benefit grows with time.

In this note, {{a modified version of}} Pauly et al. 2 ̆ 7 s guaranteed renewability model, which addresses the problem of age-based adverse selection (Pauly et al., 1995) is presented. Their model is extended from three to 35 periods. Also, probabilities are allowed to increase by age for low-risk types using actual age-based probabilities. This extension of their work shows that {{private health insurance}} contracts available stray far from optimal contracts that deal with age-based adverse selection. This suggests that government actions to affect private insurance options are warranted...|$|R

In some sense, {{the extent to which}} these regulations ultimately affected the individual market depends in large part on the degree of risk segmentation in unregulated states. In this paper, we examine the relationship between expected medical expenses, individual insurance premiums, and the likelihood of obtaining individual insurance using data from both the National Health Interview Survey and the Community Tracking Study Household Survey. We test for differences in these relationships between states with both <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> and guaranteed issue and state...|$|R

As part of this, <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> {{has long been a}} cornerstone of the Irish private health insurance market with the objective to make PHI affordable to everyone regardless of their risk profile. Until the mid- 1990 s one insurer had a legal monopoly. However, in 1996, following the Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, the market was opened up to competition and a number of regulations were introduced to support <b>community</b> <b>rating.</b> This includes the introduction of a risk equalisation system. Its aim was to prevent selection and thus protect the <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> system while still enabling a competitive health insurance market. There have been significant obstacles to the introduction of risk equalisation due to political, legal and implementation issues. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review the history, structure and likely effectiveness of risk equalisation in Ireland. The paper provides lessons for other countries with risk equalisation systems or seeking to introduce such a system. Amongst other conclusions, it outlines the difficulties in introducing risk equalisation. <b>Community</b> <b>rating</b> Risk equalisation Risk sharing Risk selection Consumer mobility Competitive health insurance Managed Competition...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> in the optimal design of a risk {{adjustment}} scheme in competitive health insurance markets when insurers have better information on their customers’ risk profiles than the sponsor of health insurance. The sponsor offers insurers a menu of risk adjustment schemes to elicit this information. The optimal scheme includes a voluntary reinsurance option. Additionally, the scheme should sometimes be complemented by a <b>community</b> <b>rating</b> requirement. The resulting inefficient coverage of low-cost types lowers the sponsor’s cost of separating different insurer types. This allows the sponsor to redistribute more rents from low-cost to high-cost consumers...|$|R

Regression results indicate that household flood insurance purchases correlate strongly with local government mitigation activities, adjusting for hazard experience, hazard proximity, and community demography. Policy implications of this observed relationship are discussed, assuming four temporal order and floodplain development scenarios, with particular attention to the congruence of outcomes relative to policy objectives.
