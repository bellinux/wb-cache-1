5000|$|In {{two cases}} in July 2006, {{interpreting}} Articles 6(1) and 16(4) of the Brussels Convention, the ECJ held that European patents are national rights {{that must be}} enforced nationally, that it was [...] "unavoidable" [...] that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against {{the same group of}} companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available. In particular, the court set forth in grounds 41 of case C-539/03 that [...] "Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention ... does not apply in European patent infringement proceedings involving a number of companies established in various Contracting States in respect of acts committed in one or more of those States even where those companies, which belong to the same group, may have acted in an identical or similar manner in accordance with a common policy elaborated by one of them". In other words, there will be no close connection between claims as required by Article 6.1 if two closely <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> domiciled in different Contracting States act (infringe) in the same manner.|$|E

He {{was a part of}} James Derry's bid to buy Mansfield Town in March 2008, but eventually launched his own bid to buy the club. He revealed plans to rename the club [...] "Harchester United", after the fictional team in the Sky series Dream Team. This was called [...] "absolutely bizarre" [...] by Mansfield mayor Tony Egginton, who was later appointed as the club's non-executive chairman, which put doubt on Batchelor's takeover bid. He was later revealed to have had a £1.5 million bid for Accrington Stanley turned down by chairman Eric Whalley, which proposed moving a newly formed [...] "Lancashire United" [...] to Leigh and building a 10,000 seater stadium. He held talks with Chester City chairman Stephen Vaughan about purchasing the club in November. Batchelor fronted a consortium that made a £12.5 million bid to buy Southampton in July 2009. He was disqualified from acting as a company director for seven years from 2010 after he allowed two of his companies, Moornate Chemists Limited and The Besglos Polish Company Limited, to enter transactions to the benefit of <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> and himself and to the detriment of their creditors.|$|E

50|$|Existing {{transparency}} rules requires {{the disclosure of}} only minimal information. For instance, media owners are required to register only as natural and legal persons, not as individuals behind legal persons. Also, the financial flows {{and the source of}} investment are not subject to checks. The regulatory authority does not check the compliance with the rules regulating foreign organisations which operate in the media field in other countries. In 2009 an effort was pursued to regulate transparency of ownership and ownership concentration in a separate and specific law. However, the attempt failed due to the opposition by the Media Association, an association gathering the owners of print media that pressured the government to stop the adoption of the law. A new attempt to improve the regulation of ownership and market concentration in the field of media was initiated in 2011, with the drafting of the new Media Strategy. The Strategy's aims was to improve the legislation on media transparency, including by introducing the obligation to disclose information on natural and legal persons involved in the media ownership structure, on the nature and scope of their shares, the names of the ultimate owners of capital, information on their interests and shares in other media outlets and other economic enterprises, as well as on other persons having a significant degree of control or influence over a given media and data on state aid to media outlets. The new media law, the Law on Public information and Media, introduced in August 2014, regulates ownership transparency and provides that all media have to register to the Media Register, which is publicly accessible. However, according to some experts, the new law does not solve the problems connected to non-transparent ownership, including, for instance, the persisting problem that leading Serbian media outlets are hidden through a complicated networks of <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> and individuals.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the political connections of Chinese firms and workplace fatalities. The worker death rate for <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> is five times that of unconnected firms; this result also holds when we exploit executive turnover to generate within-firm estimates. The connections-mortality relationship is attenuated in provinces where officials ’ promotion is contingent on meeting safety quotas. Fatal accidents produce negative returns at <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> and are associated with the subsequent departure of well-connected executives. Our findings emphasize the social costs, as well as the firm-level benefits, of political connections...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the political connections of Chinese firms and workplace fatalities. In our preferred specification we find that the worker death rate for <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> is two to three times that of unconnected firms (depending on the sample employed), a pattern that holds for within-firm estimations. The connections-mortality relationship is attenuated in provinces where safety regulators' promotion is contingent on meeting safety targets. In the absence of fatalities, connected firms receive fewer reports of major violations for safety compliance, whereas in years of fatal accidents the rate of reported violations is identical. Moreover, fatal accidents produce negative returns at <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> and are associated with the subsequent departure of well-connected executives. These results provide suggestive evidence that connections enable firms to avoid (potentially costly) compliance measures, rather than using connections to avoid regulatory response after accidents occur. Our findings emphasize the social costs of political connections, and suggest that appropriate regulatory incentives may be useful in mitigating these costs...|$|E

40|$|Politically <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> {{are quite}} {{widespread}} around the world. Financial literature has devoted an increasing interest to this issue, focusing its {{attention on the}} presence of potential benefits for these corporations, mainly in a cross country perspective, whereas few empirical analysis are dedicated to country-specific frameworks. The paper takes into analysis 223 French industrial corporations listed since 1998 to 2010 without any interruption and their different typologies of political connections and investigates the presence of a link between any sort of political connection and firms' market power and productive efficiency. France represents a novel and interesting object of investigation for this topic, given its excellent positioning in governance indices and the time observed which overlap relevant institutional and political change, and the outbreak of economic crisis. The results show that French politically <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> have a greater market power, in relation to unconnected companies, but show lower efficiency. Furthermore, differently from some previous studies, the difference between connected and not connected firms, both in terms of market share and efficiency are greater when political links are through directors. politically connected corporations; France; capital markets; market share; productive efficiency; corporate finance; economic crisis; panel data analysis; political connections; industrial corporations; corporate governance; institutional change; political change; political links; director links...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the Efficient Market Hypothesis, {{this paper}} investigates market {{reactions}} to short-run political {{events in the}} companies connected to bi-power business–political elite {{of the state of}} Sarawak in Malaysia. We find that the under-reaction market behaviour of investors existed in politically connected firms upon the announcement of extraordinary political events. By contrast, evidence of overreaction behaviour was detected upon the holding of the Balingan general election. This study suggests that in short run political events, investors are unable to predict abnormal returns in politically <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> upon the announcement of surprising political news.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effects on the Italian {{directorship}} network of the corporate governance reform that was introduced in Italy in 2011 to prevent interlocking directorships in the financial sector. Interlocking directorships are important communication channels among companies and may have anticompetitive effect. We apply community detection techniques to the analysis of the networks in 2009 and 2012 to ascertain the effect of the reform. We find that, although the number of interlocking directorships decreases in 2012, the reduction takes place mainly at the periphery of the network whereas the network core is stable, allowing the most <b>connected</b> <b>companies</b> to keep their strategic position...|$|E
