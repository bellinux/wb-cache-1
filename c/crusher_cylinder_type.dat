50|$|Estimation of {{pressure}} using CUP and LUP units is {{performed by a}} special crusher gun, which uses pressure applied to a piston to crush a carefully manufactured and calibrated copper or lead cylinder. The amount of deformation is compared {{to the amount of}} crushing produced by different pressures in pounds per square inch. Copper cylinders are used at high pressures, such as are generated by most handgun and rifle cartridges, and lead cylinders are used for low pressures such as are generated by shotgun shells. The crusher gun has a hole in the chamber that is linked to a piston, and upon firing, this piston is subjected to the pressure of firing. The piston then acts on the calibrated <b>cylinder,</b> <b>crushing</b> it slightly. The length of the <b>crushed</b> <b>cylinder</b> is measured and compared to a chart of lengths resulting from <b>crushing</b> <b>cylinders</b> with given amounts {{of pressure}}, and the corresponding force is the CUP or LUP pressure value.|$|R

40|$|Pulping is one {{important}} step in wet coffee processing method. Pulping process usually uses a machine which constructed by wood or metal materials. A horizontal single <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine {{is the most popular}} machine in coffee processing. One of the weaknesses of a horizontal single <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine is higher in broken beans. Broken bean is one of mayor aspects in defect system that contribute to low quality. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested a horizontal double <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine which resulted in 12. 6 — 21. 4 % of broken beans. To reduce percentage of broken beans, Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has developed and tested a horizontal triple <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine. Material tested was fresh mature Robusta coffee cherries, 60 — 65 % (wet basis) moisture content; has classified on 3 levels i. e. unsorted, small and medium, and clean from metal and foreign materials.

Choosing <b>crushed</b> <b>cylinders</b> as source of recycling would result in reusing portion of the waste products of the concrete production industry. An extensive concrete batching and testing program was conducted to achieve two optimum normal and high strength concrete mixes.

Normal strength tested cylinders were used as source of the recycled aggregates for the normal strength concrete (NSC) mix and high strength tested cylinders {{were used for the}} high strength concrete (HSC) mix. Tests on the trial batches included plastic state slump and hardened state mechanical properties including cylinder compressive strength, cylinder splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and standard beams flexural strength.

The purpose of this analysis is to develop one- and two- point correlations and to investigate the flow characteristics for these two cases. The experiments are conducted for two Reynolds numbers (based on the mean air velocity and the cylinder diameter) 2000 and 8000. Two dimensional results of planar PIV reveal the important aspects of the local flow features of the circular finned and foamed cylinders.

These instabilities are characterized by the Reynolds number and include the wake, separated shear layer and boundary layer. Depending on the physical application of the cylinder, increasing the level of turbulence {{on the surface of}} the cylinder would be a target for drag reduction or heat transfer enhancement. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has been carried out to investigate the wake region behind a foamed and a finned cylinder. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the flow characteristics for these two cases. The experiments are conducted for a wide range of Reynolds numbers (based on the mean air velocity and the cylinder diameter) from 1000 to 10, 000. Two dimensional results of planar PIV reveal the important aspects of the local flow features of the circular finned and foamed cylinders.
