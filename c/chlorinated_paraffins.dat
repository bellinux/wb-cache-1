40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{maximize}} the biodegradation of the commercial <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> Cereclor S 52 using an axenic culture of Pseudomonas sp. 273. Tests of the adherence of growing cultures to hydrocarbon substrates showed differences between Cereclor S 52 and a readily degradable chlorinated alkane, 1, 10 -dichlorodecane (DCD). In the bioreactor, Cereclor S 52 was degraded by up to 73 % by means of multiple additions of DCD. This is indicative of an upper limit for the degradation of Cereclor S 52 in this system. The degradative enzymes in Pseudomonas sp. 273 {{did not appear to}} be induced by Cereclor itself, by yeast extract, or by hexadecane. The work suggests that DCD acted to induce degradative enzymes, as a cosubstrate, and as a solvent to improve the bioavailability of Cereclor S 52 in the bioreactor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although it is unexpected, pure {{mineral oils}} or {{machinery}} oils are still widely used as cutting fluids {{in many cases}} and areas. In this paper, the performance of extreme pressure (EP) additives, including <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>Paraffin,</b> Acid phosphate, and ZnDDP, was evaluated with the index of material removal ability and specimen hardness drop {{by the use of}} grinding test method. A micro-structure model of specimen surface layer under wet grinding conditions was proposed, which could be used for explaining the boundary lubrication mechanism of cutting fluids. The characteristic was revealed that organizational structure and shearing strength of specimen surface layer at wet grinding conditions descended along the out normal line direction of the specimen surface. Based on experimental research, high-performance oil-based cutting fluids were developed and tested in several machine-building factories.

50|$|By photochlorination chloroparaffins can be {{prepared}} from alkanes. Compared to thermal chlorination, {{the risk of the}} formation of secondary products by thermolysis (for example, by elimination of hydrogen chloride) is very small. The selectivity is low because the reaction takes place by a radical mechanism. Mixtures of complex composition consisting of several <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> are formed. The degree of chlorination varies and the exact composition of the resulting product mixtures is often not known. In 1985 the world production was 300,000 tonnes; since then the production volumes are falling in Europe and North America. In China, on the other hand, production rose sharply.

40|$|The {{flame-retardant}} chemicals, which commercially find {{applications in}} rubbers, {{are considered to}} be toxic chemicals, because of the liberation of their harmful volatile by products, when rubbers are on fire. From the research works in the recent past it has been established that the chemical, aluminahydrate is one of the safest and environmentally friendly flame retardants. As a result, the application of this chemical as a flame-retardant in rubbers and plastics is on the rise, at present particularly in the developed western countries. Thus in view of utilizing this chemical in local industries, as a flame retardant especially in the silica filler added rubber floor - tile compounds, an attempt has been made in this work, to evaluate the chemical for its fire retardant property in their vulcanizates. The study reveals that to obtain optimum frame retardance in the rubber floor tiles, the conventional rubber compounds containing 40 phr precipitated silica should be incorporated with atleast 105 phr of aluminahydrate in place of 5 phr of the mixture of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> wax and antimony trioxide...|$|R
40|$|Poly vinylidene {{chloride}}-vinyl chloride emulsions (PVDC) {{were added}} {{as a substitute}} for <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> (CP) in the preparation of ultra-low density fiberboards (ULDFs). The micromorphology and fire performance of ULDFs were investigated using a scanning electron microscope, limiting oxygen index instrument, and cone calorimeter. The results showed that PVDC specimens were coated with a regularly smooth film, while the distribution of CP inside CP specimens was uneven. The limiting oxygen index increased with the dosage of PVDC, then reached a plateau at 50 mL and 28 %, slightly higher than CP specimens (27. 3 %). The peak of heat release rate, mean heat release rate, mean CO, and total smoke release of PVDC specimens was reduced 43. 3 %, 13. 5 %, 38. 5 %, and 51. 5 % lower than respective CP specimens, and with nearly the same total heat release (only 0. 04 MJ/m 2 higher). Thus, PVDC exhibited excellent heat-reducing and smoke-suppressing properties and could replace CP in ULDFs.   Validerad; 2016; Nivå 2; 2016 - 12 - 01 (inah) </p...|$|R

50|$|Chlorinated alkanes {{found an}} initial {{application}} in pharyngeal sprays. These contained chlorinated alkanes in relatively large quantities as solvents for chloramine T from 1914 to 1918. The Sharpless Solvents Corporation commissioned the first industrial photochloration plant for the chlorination of pentane in 1929. The commercial production of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> {{for use as}} high-pressure additives in lubricants began around 1930. Around 1935 the process was technically stable and commercially successful. However, {{it was only in}} the years after World War II that a greater build-up of photochloration capacity began. In 1950, the United States produced more than 800,000 tons of chlorinated paraffin hydrocarbons. The major products were ethyl chloride, tetrachlorocarbon and dichloromethane. Because of concerns about health and environmentally relevant problems such as the ozone depletion behavior of light volatile chlorine compounds, the chemical industry developed alternative procedures that did not require chlorinated compounds. As a result of the following replacement of chlorinated by non-chlorinated products, worldwide production volumes have declined considerably over the years.|$|E
40|$|The {{synergistic}} effect of two fire retardants, a Si-Al compound and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin,</b> was tested on ultra-low density fiberboards (ULDFs). To further understand {{the mechanism of}} fire retardancy, morphologies of unburned and burned ULDFs were studied using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was found that as {{the volume of the}} burned ULDFs shrank, some crevices appeared. In addition, less fly ash formed on the top of specimens, and more bottom ashes remained in the original framework, with a clear network of structure built by the fibers. Carbon was almost absent in the fly ash; however, the weight ratio of C in the bottom ashes reached the maximum (> 43 %) of the composition. Oxygen, Al, and Si appeared to have varying weight ratios for different ashes. Oxygen content increased with increasing Si and Al contents. Furthermore, Cl sharply decreased to less than 1 % after combustion. Therefore, upon combustion, it was found that almost all of the substances in ULDFs, except for the Si-Al compound, were pyrolyzed to volatile carbon oxides and Cl compounds, especially the fly ash and lightweight C compounds.

CPs encompas thousands congeners with varying properties and environmental fate. Based on their carbon chain lengths, CPs are divided into short- (SCCPs; C), medium- (MCCPs; C) and long- (LCCPs; C) chained groups. They are high production volume and persistent chemicals, and their cumulative global production already surpasses that of other persistent anthropogenic chemicals (e. g. PCBs). However, international regulations are still curbed by insufficient information on their levels and fate, including bioaccumulation and toxicity potential. An increasing number of studies since 2010 demonstrate that CPs are detected in almost every compartment in the environment, including remote areas. Consensus on the long range transport and high bioaccumulation potential (BCF > 5000 & TMF > 1) has recently been reached for SCCPs, fulfilling criteria under the Stockholm Convention for designation as a persistent organic pollutant; information on their levels is, however, still sparse for many countries. M/LCCPs have received comparatively little attention in the past, but as replacement chemicals for SCCPs, MCCPs are now considered in an increasing number of studies. The limited data to date suggests MCCPs are widely used. Although data on their bioaccumulation and toxicity are still inconclusive, MCCPs and LCCPs with C may also have a bioaccumulation potential. Considering this and their high production volumes, use, and ubiquitous occurrence in the environment, a better understanding on the levels and fate of all CPs is needed...|$|R
