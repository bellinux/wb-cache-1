40|$|In the {{clinical}} refraction of the eye, aniseikonia and anisometropia are inevitably used terms. Image formation and its retinal size is {{the function of}} the power of the dioptric eye system. However, the <b>correcting</b> <b>lens</b> in front of the eye and the eye optical system represent a unique optical afocal system, in which the distance between <b>correcting</b> <b>lens</b> and corneal vertex is of utmost importance, since it determines the size (together with appropriate <b>correcting</b> <b>lens)</b> of the retinal image. In the case of a monoculus, the size of the retinal image is not important. But, when correcting one eye while the other is emmetropic, it is important to correct it in the way that the image of the corrected eye does not produce considerable aniseikonia as a consequence of anisometropia. The authors hereby present mathematical calculation proving that if the principal point of the <b>correcting</b> <b>lens</b> P 2 ̆ 72 is in the F 1 of the emmetropic eye, meaning that? is equal to the front focal length of the emmetropic eye, there is no change in the refractive eye system, i. e. it becomes emmetropic and there is no change in the size of the retinal image.

40|$|Simple {{formulae}} {{based on}} reduced eyes {{have been developed}} to predict the variation in longitudinal chromatic aberration with variation in ametropia or accommodation. Two formulae were developed, one for axial ametropia and one for refractive ametropia. The latter also served as a model for accommodation.

Combining the results of different methods gives the following predictions of change in chromatic difference of focus, between wavelengths of 400 and 700 nm, with change in each dioptre of refractive error or accommodation: axial ametropia 0. 012 to 0. 017 D (0. 6 to 0. 9 %), refractive ametropia 0. 05 D (2. 2 to 2. 4 %), and accommodation 0. 04 to 0. 05 D (2. 1 to 2. 6 %).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the processing flow and results of optical fabrication for an optical correcting lens with a free-form surface, namely a free-form lens. Because a correcting lens has no rotation axes of symmetry and its surface cannot be expressed by a continuity equation, its processing technology is different {{with that of}} general aspheric lenses. The correcting lens was firstly formed from a glass workblank with flat face using diamond abrasion wheel with spherical shape, and then loose abrasive lapped and polished with oblique axis spherical tools to decrease the surface roughness and increase the surface accuracy based on the measuring result after forming. At the lapping and polishing stages, two processing methods are employed. One is to control the processing pressure, {{and the other is}} based on dwell time. Since high precision fabrication is closely related with high precision measuring, this paper also presents a high precision non-contact optical measuring method based on image transforming for <b>correcting</b> <b>lenses.</b> The effectiveness of the processing flow and technology is confirmed by an experiment in which a workblank is processed into a satisfying correcting lens...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a new modality for improving visual acuity (VA) in pediatric patients with anisometropic amblyopia. METHODS: Retrospective and interventional case series. Medical records of 360 children with anisometropic amblyopia treated with a modality that included rotated prisms, lenses, and near activities from January 2008 to January 2012 were analyzed. Characteristics such as improvement of VA and contrast sensitivity in amblyopic eyes and resolution of amblyopia (VA≤ 0. 1 logMAR or a difference of ≤ 2 lines in logMAR between the eyes) were assessed. RESULTS: Among the patients, the mean VA of the amblyopic eyes improved from 0. 48 logMAR (SD= 0. 16) to 0. 12 logMAR (SD= 0. 16) and the mean VA improvement was 0. 36 logMAR (SD= 0. 10, P P = 0. 437). We found that better baseline VA {{may be related to}} success and shorten the time to amblyopic resolution. CONCLUSION: VA and contrast sensitivity improved with rotated prisms, <b>correcting</b> <b>lenses,</b> and near activities in children with anisometropic amblyopia. The VA improvement by this modality was comparable to other methods. However, the time to resolution of amblyopia was shorter with this method than with other modalities.

40|$|The {{design of}} the first Real-Time-Tomographic-Holography (RTTH) optical system for augmented-reality {{applications}} is presented. RTTH places a viewpoint-independent real-time (RT) virtual image (VI) of an object into its actual location, enabling natural hand-eye coordination to guide invasive procedures, without requiring tracking or a head-mounted device. The VI is viewed through a narrow-band Holographic Optical Element (HOE) with built-in power that generates the largest possible near-field, in-situ VI from a small display chip without noticeable parallax error or obscuring direct view of the physical world. Rigidly fixed upon a medicalultrasound probe, RTTH could show the scan in its actual location inside the patient, because the VI would move with the probe. We designed the image source along with the system-optics, allowing us to ignore both planer geometric distortions and field curvature, respectively compensated by using RT pre-processing software and attaching a custom-surfaced fiber-optic-faceplate (FOFP) to our image source. Focus in our fast, non-axial system was achieved by placing <b>correcting</b> <b>lenses</b> near the FOFP and custom-optically-fabricating our volumephase HOE using a recording beam that was specially shaped by extra lenses. By simultaneously simulating and optimizing the system’s playback performance across variations in both the total playback and HOE-recording optical systems, we derived and built a design that projects a 104 x 112 mm planar VI 1 m from the HOE using a laser-illuminated 19 x 16 mm LCD+FOFP image-source. The VI appeared fixed in space and well focused. Viewpoint-induced location errors were < 3 mm, and unexpected first-order astigmatism produced 3 cm (3 % of 1 m) ambiguity in depth, typically unnoticed by human observers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{finding that}} the eyes of young chicks recover quickly from form {{deprivation}} myopia (FDM) has been interpreted as indirect evidence for active emmetropization. More direct evidence would be the demonstration that correction of FDM with spectacle lenses, thereby removing the defocus signal, prevents recovery. We investigated this issue in eyes with intact and sectioned (ONS) optic nerves. Previous studies suggest that an intact optic nerve is necessary for accurate emmetropization. Seventy day-old male chicks were monocularly deprived using velcro-mounted diffusers, which were removed after 5 – 6 days and in some (n= 51), but not all cases, replaced by spectacle lenses (− 5, − 10 or − 15 D). Approximately half (n= 34) of the chicks also underwent ONS on day 1. Refractive errors and axial ocular dimensions were measured when the diffusers were first removed and thereafter at 2 – 4 day intervals over the following 1 – 2 weeks. In one case, measurements were continued at less regular intervals to 33 days. Lens powers were selected to either approximately correct or under-correct the refractive errors present when the diffusers were removed. Form deprivation in normal chicks produced large myopic shifts in refraction (means for groups range from − 9. 20 to − 16. 07 D). When the deprivation treatment was terminated, the myopia quickly decreased to negligible levels unless optically corrected. <b>Correcting</b> <b>lenses</b> stabilized the myopia to a level consistent with the lens power used. Interocular differences in axial length were consistent with an axial origin to the refractive changes. Results for the ONS groups exhibited similar trends although there was increased variability in the data. The findings support the interpretation that recovery from FDM {{is a product of}} active emmetropization. That ONS increased the variability of such responses implies that an intact optic nerve is required for accurate emmetropization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new ultra-precision {{machining}} method, i. e. pressure-based {{grinding and polishing}} with oblique axis spherical tools, for free-form lenses. The method is based on controlling the normal contact force between the tool and the workpiece.
