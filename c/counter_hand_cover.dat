60|$|Caterina {{slipped from}} the stool {{on to her}} knees, took the old Baronet's <b>hand,</b> <b>covered</b> it with tears and kisses, and then {{ran out of the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Then Jan consented, {{and the two}} men drank. And there {{passed a}} breath between them as before; and Jan with his <b>hands</b> <b>covered</b> his eyes a moment.|$|R

Allan Bayle, a forensic expert assisting the Columbia team, opined that Lopez {{was behind the}} <b>counter</b> <b>handing</b> her attacker the money, while the attacker remained {{in front of the}} counter.

Employees, from <b>counter</b> <b>hands</b> to executives, received fringe benefits including sickness and medical insurance, pension plans, interest free loans, profit sharing and bonuses. Despite his generous nature the organization was run on strict lines, and Black would not tolerate dissent.|$|R
60|$|And {{it was not}} Marguerite's {{blue eyes}} that beckoned to him now, it was not her lips that called, but the wan face {{of a child with}} matted curls hanging above a greasy forehead, and small <b>hands</b> <b>covered</b> in grime that had once been fondled by a Queen.|$|R

2500|$|During {{sessions}} of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex {{to escape the}} pain.
