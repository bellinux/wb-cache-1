5|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in several countries with different health care system models to assess the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} {{intermediate}} technology ambulances {{must take into}} account not only the operation and maintenance of the ambulance, but its construction as well. The robustness of the design becomes more important, as does the nature of the skills required to properly operate the vehicle. <b>Cost-effectiveness</b> can be a high priority.|$|E
5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 <b>cost-effectiveness</b> study shifted the focus from the F-5 to the less expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E
25|$|Demonstrating the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of {{pharmacogenomics}}: Publications for the pharmacoeconomics of pharmacogenomics are scarce, therefore {{sufficient evidence}} does {{not at this}} time exist to validate the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> and cost-consequences of the test.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{systematic}} <b>cost-effectiveness</b> review {{found that}} the reported <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of spinal manipulation in the United Kingdom compared favorably with other treatments for back pain, but that reports were {{based on data from}} clinical trials without sham controls and that the specific <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of the treatment (as opposed to non-specific effects) remains uncertain. A 2005 American systematic review of economic evaluations of conservative treatments for low back pain found that significant quality problems in available studies meant that definite conclusions could not be drawn about the most cost-effective intervention. The <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of maintenance chiropractic care is unknown.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{fourteen}} studies in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine and changing front–line drug treatment, found decision making {{limited by the}} lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the small number of <b>cost-effectiveness</b> analyses, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two <b>cost-effectiveness</b> estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of DDT spraying; the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of <b>cost-effectiveness</b> in current programs.|$|E
25|$|Fillers may {{be added}} to improve <b>cost-effectiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{systematic}} review found {{there is a}} lack of available <b>cost-effectiveness</b> evidence in TCM.|$|E
25|$|For some {{environmental}} effects cost-benefit analysis {{can be substituted}} with <b>cost-effectiveness</b> analysis. This is especially true when {{there is only one}} type of physical outcome that is sought, such as the reduction of energy use by increasing energy efficiency. Using <b>cost-effectiveness</b> analysis is less laborious and time-consuming as it does not involve the monetization of outcomes, which can be difficult in some cases.|$|E
25|$|In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{ranking of}} 10 {{antidepressants}} for efficacy and <b>cost-effectiveness</b> citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in <b>cost-effectiveness.</b> The ranking results {{were based on}} the meta-analysis by Andrea Cipriani. In another analysis by Cipriani, citalopram was found to be more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine, and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine, and venlafaxine, but less efficacious than escitalopram.|$|E
25|$|Closely related, but {{slightly}} different, formal techniques include <b>cost-effectiveness</b> analysis, cost–utility analysis, risk–benefit analysis, {{economic impact}} analysis, fiscal impact analysis, and social {{return on investment}} (SROI) analysis.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} acupuncture for chronic {{low back pain}} was cost-effective as a complement to standard care, but not {{as a substitute for}} standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented. The same meta-analysis found {{there was no difference between}} sham and non-sham acupuncture. A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain. A 2010 systematic review found that the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of acupuncture could not be concluded. A 2012 review found that acupuncture seems to be cost-effective for some pain conditions.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{discovery}} of RNA enzymes predates that of DNA enzymes the latter have some distinct advantages. DNA has better <b>cost-effectiveness</b> and DNA {{can be made with}} longer sequence length and can be made with higher purity in Solid-phase synthesis.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reported}} that the line may be built as a single-track railway to achieve <b>cost-effectiveness.</b> Under some of the earlier proposals, the link will serve {{as one of the}} sections of the Regional Express, a new intercity service connecting Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.|$|E
25|$|The Rapid Bus {{alternatives}} {{would all}} have lower capital costs than the Metro Orange Line {{because of their}} minimal construction requirements. However, because the Rapid Bus alternatives would attract fewer new riders than the Metro Orange Line, the Rapid Bus alternatives exhibit poor <b>cost-effectiveness</b> measured on a per-new-rider basis.|$|E
25|$|SCAR-less editing uses {{plasmids}} for genome modification created using circular polymerase extension cloning. Briefly, in a one-step reaction, {{this process}} can assemble and clone multiple inserts into any vector and requires no restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, or homologous recombination. Therefore, this method {{contributes to the}} <b>cost-effectiveness</b> and throughput of the no-SCAR system.|$|E
25|$|Some {{preparations}} such as nasal sprays and inhalers {{may result}} in a rapid response, but the fast onset of high blood levels may compromise safety. In addition, the expense of some of these appliances may greatly reduce their <b>cost-effectiveness.</b> In children it is unclear if intranasal fentanyl is as good as or the same as morphine.|$|E
25|$|CBA {{is related}} to (but {{distinct}} from) <b>cost-effectiveness</b> analysis. In CBA, benefits and costs are expressed in monetary terms, and are adjusted for the time value of money, so that all flows of benefits and flows of project costs over time (which tend to occur {{at different points in}} time) are expressed on a common basis in terms of their net present value.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{systematic}} review {{suggested that the}} use of spine manipulation in clinical practice is a cost-effective treatment when used alone or in combination with other treatment approaches. A 2011 {{systematic review}} found evidence supporting the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of using spinal manipulation for the treatment of sub-acute or chronic low back pain; the results for acute low back pain were insufficient.|$|E
25|$|Retail Bonds {{are driven}} by <b>cost-effectiveness,</b> {{simplicity}} of transaction charging and standardisation of market structure. The key aim of ORB is to increase distribution for bonds by opening up these markets to private investors who may have previously felt excluded from this market. This is by increasing the availability of publication on offer, detailing {{the risks and benefits}} involved in Retail Bonds, such as taxation.|$|E
25|$|From 1952 {{deliveries}} of B class {{diesel locomotives}} commenced {{and the new}} locomotives quickly proved their superiority to steam traction in availability, reliability, and <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of operation. Following successful trials, the B class locomotives replaced the S class locomotives on the Spirit of Progress roster from April 1954. None of the iconic streamlined steam locomotives were saved for preservation, all were withdrawn and scrapped by September 1954.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{construction}} stages, the Chennai MRTS {{has had its}} share of controversies and criticism, including the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of the route, accessibility, poor maintenance of stations, lack of intermodal transport facility, environmental concerns, budgeting issues and security issues. In light of these issues, which further impacted the line's low ridership, the MRTS has been working incrementally to change its image to Chennai's residents, by addressing and ameliorating the current conditions.|$|E
25|$|Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE, {{formerly}} called Effective Animal Activism) is {{an organization}} connected with the movement that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their <b>cost-effectiveness</b> and transparency, particularly those that are tackling factory farming. Faunalytics (formerly the Humane Research Council) {{is an organization}} loosely affiliated with the movement that conducts independent research on important animal welfare topics, provides resources for advocates and donors, and works with animal protection organizations to evaluate their work.|$|E
25|$|Health {{economics}} was pioneered at York and {{the university}} leads {{the world in the}} methodological development of <b>cost-effectiveness</b> analysis of health care technologies. It is home to two prominent health economics journals and has been home to many prominent names in health economics (including current Lead Health Economist at the World Bank Adam Wagstaff, ex-deputy chair of NICE Tony Culyer, current ISPOR director Paul Kind, ex-ISPOR president Mike Drummond, current chairman of York Primary Care Trust Alan Maynard).|$|E
25|$|Reimbursement {{policies}} {{will have to}} be redefined to fit the changes that personalised medicine will bring to the healthcare system. Some of the factors that should be considered are the level of efficacy of various genetic tests in the general population, <b>cost-effectiveness</b> relative to benefits, how to deal with payment systems for extremely rare conditions, and how to redefine the insurance concept of “shared risk” to incorporate the effect of the newer concept of “individual risk factors".|$|E
25|$|Although many {{government}} programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the <b>cost–effectiveness</b> of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like retail stores, warehouses, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending {{on the nature of}} the waste materials that are present.|$|E
25|$|A more {{comprehensive}} approach to measuring <b>cost-effectiveness</b> or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars, {{as well as the}} number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative human health impacts. One preliminary study found that {{it is likely that the}} detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, except perhaps in epidemics. It is similar to the earlier study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.|$|E
25|$|A {{photovoltaic}} system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by {{taking advantage of}} the photoelectric effect. Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its <b>cost-effectiveness,</b> and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP. Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.|$|E
25|$|The {{moratorium}} on new hydro projects in northern Quebec after the Great Whale cancellation forced the company's management {{to develop new}} sources of electricity to meet increasing demand. In September 2001, Hydro-Québec announced its intention {{to build a new}} combined cycle gas turbine plant—the Centrale du Suroît plant—in Beauharnois, southwest of Montreal, stressing the pressing need to secure additional electricity supply to mitigate against any shortfall in the water cycle of its reservoirs. Hydro's rationale also stressed the <b>cost-effectiveness</b> of the plant {{and the fact that it}} could be built within a two-year period.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Chai Wan on eastern Hong Kong Island was {{developed}} into a residential and industrial area, which greatly increased the traffic demand to Central. Extending the tram line from Shau Kei Wan to Chai Wan was considered, but was ultimately rejected due to low <b>cost-effectiveness,</b> as hills exist between Chai Wan and Shau Kei Wan, and difficulties arise from tunneling through the hills to make level track. It {{was replaced by the}} Island Line service — linking Chai Wan and Admiralty — which was opened to the public on 31 May 1985.|$|E
25|$|Combined medical {{management}} and behavioral treatment {{is the most}} effective ADHD management strategy, followed by medication alone, and then behavioral treatment. In terms of <b>cost-effectiveness,</b> management with medication {{has been shown to be}} the most cost-effective, followed by behavioral treatment, and combined treatment. The individually most effective and cost-efficient way is with stimulant medication. Additionally, long-acting medications for ADHD, in comparison to short-acting varieties, generally seem to be cost-effective. Comorbid (relating to two diseases that occur together, e.g. depression and ADHD) disorders makes finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more costly than when comorbid disorders are absent.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Tremont Street Subway {{south of}} Boylston station {{has been closed}} since 1962, when the last streetcar line feeding into it was replaced by bus service, and Pleasant Street Portal at its southern end has been covered over. Reuse of part of the tunnel for the Silver Line Phase III was briefly considered, but the narrow bore was found {{too small for the}} Silver Line buses which (unlike trolleys) are not fixed to their guideway. Plans for the Phase III tunnel were shifted further west to new alignments, then canceled due to questions over the project's <b>cost-effectiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Army Aviation Maintenance Squadron 100 was {{to remain}} {{responsible}} for the entire fleet of Bölkow Bo-105 of the German armed forces. Apart from missions flown by Army Aviation Liaison and Reconnaissance Squadron 100, training flights of the Army Aviation School were also supposed to continue at Celle since, in view of <b>cost-effectiveness</b> and noise pollution, {{it was thought that}} this task could not be managed by a single airfield alone. Nevertheless, due to the reorganisation/reduction of the German Armed Forces both Army Aviation Maintenance Squadron 100 and Army Aviation Liaison and Reconnaissance Squadron 100 were disbanded.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{planned to}} use Ares I to launch Orion, the {{spacecraft}} intended for NASA human spaceflight missions after the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Ares I was to complement the larger, unmanned Ares V, which was the cargo launch vehicle for Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and <b>cost-effectiveness.</b> However, the Constellation program, including Ares I was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 {{with the passage of}} his 2010 NASA authorization bill. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space Launch System as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that increasing access to contraception, including birth control pills, can be an effective strategy for climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. According to Thomas Wire, contraception is the 'greenest technology' because of its <b>cost-effectiveness</b> in combating global warming — each $7 spent on family planning would reduce global carbon emissions by 1 tonne over four decades, while achieving the same result with low-carbon technologies would require $32. If all the current unmet need for contraception were met, that would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 34 gigatonnes between 2010 and 2050.|$|E
