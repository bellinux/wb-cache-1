5|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that a flaw in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> used. Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> {{given by the}} equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|The game {{proceeds}} {{according to}} the Courier's decisions and involves many different events, factions, and characters. The main storyline follows the Courier's pursuit of Benny to both settle the score and retrieve the Platinum Chip. Along the way, the Courier encounters many groups of people with various problems that they can choose to assist with, ignore, or otherwise sabotage, resulting in positive or negative karma. Eventually, after finding Benny and the Chip, the Courier finds themselves {{in the middle of}} a conflict between three major factions: Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers, the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist democratic federation, and Mr. House (voiced by René Auberjonois), the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. It is revealed that Mr. House, a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber, ordered the Platinum Chip's delivery before the war. The <b>Chip</b> <b>is</b> a data storage device with a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness, and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man.|$|E
5|$|Cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> {{a common}} food {{in much of}} Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> called konkonte. Dried cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|R

25|$|When milling metals, the {{material}} is relatively ductile, although remaining strong even at a small scale. A Type II <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> formed, and waste may be produced as continuous swarf.

5000|$|Poker chips: Currency is {{difficult}} to stack or handle, so most poker games <b>are</b> played with <b>chips,</b> or coin-shaped tokens of uniform size and weight, usually 39mm wide and anywhere from 5 to 16 grams in weight, whose money value is determined by their color. Historically, poker <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> made of bone; however, modern casino <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> often made of clay or a clay composite and are considered the most upscale variety of poker chip; other high-end <b>chips</b> <b>are</b> made of ceramic.

25|$|Interconnect capacitance: Traditionally, {{switching}} time was roughly {{proportional to the}} gate capacitance of gates. However, with transistors becoming smaller and more transistors being placed on the chip, interconnect capacitance (the capacitance of the metal-layer connections between {{different parts of the}} <b>chip)</b> <b>is</b> becoming a large percentage of capacitance. Signals have to travel through the interconnect, which leads to increased delay and lower performance.|$|E
25|$|Over {{half the}} energy {{used by a}} 1.8V NAND flash <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> lost in the charge pump itself. Since boost {{converters}} are inherently more efficient than charge pumps, researchers developing low-power SSDs have proposed returning to the dual Vcc/Vpp supply voltages used on all the early flash chips, driving the high Vpp voltage for all flash chips in a SSD with a single shared external boost converter.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the first}} digital <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> created by Daniel Graupe. The digital chip, {{referred}} to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise. The <b>chip</b> <b>was</b> integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s. [...] In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital <b>chips</b> that <b>were</b> devoted to high-speed digital signal processing or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, <b>chips</b> <b>were</b> produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these <b>chips</b> <b>was</b> that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{architectural}} {{difference between}} DDR SDRAM designed for different clock frequencies, for example, PC-1600, designed {{to run at}} 100MHz, and PC-2100, designed to run at 133MHz. The number simply designates the data {{rate at which the}} <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> guaranteed to perform, hence DDR SDRAM is guaranteed to run at lower (underclocking) and can possibly run at higher (overclocking) clock rates than those for which it was made.|$|E
25|$|An {{electronic}} key based on RFID technology is {{integrated into the}} card, {{which can be used}} to unlock carsharing vehicles parked near train stations. Since the RFID <b>chip</b> <b>is</b> automatically included in all cards, not only the ones with carsharing capability, and since the passenger's photograph is printed on the card, it has been criticised for violating privacy rights, and DB received the 2007 Big Brother Award as a result.|$|E
