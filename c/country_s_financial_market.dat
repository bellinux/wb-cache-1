40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{attractiveness}} of U.

The paper finds {{that the presence of}} negative dollar risk premiums (i. e. expectations of a dollar depreciation net of interest rate effects) amid record capital inflows could suggest that investors may favor U. S. assets for structural reasons. One possible explanation could be that the Asian crisis created a large pool of savings searching for relatively riskless investment opportunities, which were provided by deep, liquid, and innovative U. <b>S.</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> with robust investor protection. Moreover, the continued attractiveness of U. <b>S.</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> to European investors suggests that they offer a large array of assets, with different risk/return characteristics, that facilitate the structuring of diversified investment portfolios. Looking forward, this suggests that the allocative efficiency of U. <b>S.</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> could mitigate risks of a disorderly unwinding of global current account imbalances.

A {{growing body}} of theoretical and empirical work identifies {{the ability of a}} country’s institutions to protect private property and provide incentives for investment as a key explanation for the persistent disparity in <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> development and economic performance across countries. We add to this literature by analyzing the impact of institutions on financial development using data on the financial decisions of immigrants and the native-born in the U. S. While all of the individuals whose decisions we analyze face the same formal institutional framework in the U.

This low rate is justified on the grounds that setting the rate higher—for example, at the 0. 5 percent rate that now applies to stock trades in the United Kingdom—could render <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> trading prohibitively expensive. Revenues generated by the 0. 5 percent FTT could then end up lower than at the 0. 03 percent rate, since trading values would fall excessively. However, working with a series of alternative assumptions based on actual current <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> conditions, we show that there is no scenario within our range of assumptions in which a 0. 03 percent FTT will generate more tax revenues than a 0. 5 percent FTT. Rather, considering all of our alternatives, a 0. 5 percent FTT generates between 3 and 17 times more revenue than a 0. 03 percent FTT...|$|R

We confirm the robust existence of this cycle in U. S. stock markets as well as bond markets. As most rational theories to explain the cycle were falsified by earlier empirical work, this paper sets out to test the presidential cycle election (PCE) theory as an alternative explanation. The PCE theory states that incumbent parties and presidents have an incentive to manipulate the economy (via budget expansions, taxes, etc.) to remain in power. We formulate seven different propositions relating to fiscal, monetary, tax, and political implications of PCE theory. We find no statistically significant evidence confirming the PCE theory as a plausible explanation for the presidential cycle effect. The existence of the presidential cycle effect in U. <b>S.</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> thus remains a puzzle that cannot be easily explained by politicians mis-using their economic influence to remain in power. political economy, inefficient markets, market anomalies, calendar effects...|$|R
