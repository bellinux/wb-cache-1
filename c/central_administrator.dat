40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} transcendental phenomenological {{study was to examine}} the life experiences of 11 <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> from rural school divisions in Virginia, and investigate their shared experiences when assisting and supporting marginal special education teachers. The four theories guiding this study were Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, Collins, Brown and Newman’s cognitive apprenticeship theory, Evans’ path-goal leadership theory, and Burns’ transformational leadership theory. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory discusses the environment of a child impacts their growth and development. Collins, Brown, and Newman’s cognitive apprenticeships theory in context of this study describes how master teachers or administrators must train marginal teachers. Evans’ path-goal leadership theory pertains to this study by encouraging administrators to provide supports to teachers to meet necessary goals. Burns’ transformational leadership theory supports the idea that administrators must provide motivation to their teaching staff in order to raise them to acceptable levels. This study used the following research questions: R 1 : How do <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> in rural school districts in Virginia describe their experiences when working with marginal special education teachers? R 2 : How do <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> describe their experiences working with marginal special education teachers that they had to terminate from their position?

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we address}} key {{management}} in ad hoc networks. Ad hoc networks {{are a new}} wireless networking paradigm in which mobile hosts rely on each other to keep the network connected {{without the help of}} any preexisting infrastructure or <b>central</b> <b>administrator.</b> Thus, additional vulnerabilities and features pertinent to this new networking paradigm appeared. This might render traditional solutions inadaptable. In particular, the absence of a central authorization facility in an open and distributed communication environment is a major challenge, especially due to the need for cooperative network operations. For this reason, key management is particularly difficult to implement in such networks. In this paper, we study different proposals published so far, then we propose a new solution. Our solution uses the clustering technique and derives from distributed PKI solutions presented in the literature. It combines the strength of centralized PKI in the same cluster and distributed PKI for the clusterheads leading to more suitable, economic, adaptable, scalable and autonomous key management.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} central offices {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on {{the ways in which the}} central office in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how the school district's central office supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between the central office and the principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight the importance of <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted the importance of <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that <b>central</b> office <b>administrators</b> create and establish effective support for school principals.
