50|$|The {{timing chain}} was {{hydraulic}} tensioned {{and had a}} ratchet mechanism to keep the chain tight. The timing chain rode on one pivoting <b>chain</b> <b>guide</b> resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper timing <b>chain</b> <b>guide</b> in between the camshaft sprockets. The timing chain was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different timing chain sets.|$|E

The trajectory of conveyor chain links which respectively meshed and ran on sprockets and <b>chain</b> <b>guides</b> was recorded by a high speed camera. Furthermore, impact-contact forces by a collision of components in the conveyor chain drive system during rotation were analysis.

40|$|Accurate contact {{modeling}} is {{of great}} importance {{in the field of}} dynamic chain simulations. In this paper emphasis is on contact dynamics for a time-domain simulation model of large <b>chains</b> <b>guided</b> in a closed loop track. The chain model is based on theory for unconstrained rigid multibody dynamics where contact within the chain and with the track is defined through continuous point contacts using the contact indentation and rate as means. This paper presents an implicit method to determine contact parameters of the chain model through the use of none gradient optimization methods. The set of model parameters are estimated by minimizing the residual between simulated and measured results. The parameter identification is tested on four different formulations of the Hunt-Crossly hysteresis damping factor with the aim of recognizing a superior model...|$|R

50|$|Toyota swapped the dual-row {{timing chain}} used in older engines for a single-row chain with plastic guides in 1983. The new system reduced {{drag on the}} engine but {{introduced}} a new maintenance problem. After about 100,000 miles of operation, the chain may stretch {{to the point that}} the hydraulic-operated chain tensioner cannot take up any more slack. The timing chain then impacts the plastic driver's side <b>chain</b> <b>guide,</b> breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the guide restraint, the chain will vibrate excessively on the driver's side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.|$|E

40|$|Reactive planning, {{consisting}} of pre-defined sensoraction rules, {{is well suited}} to effectively respond to dynamic changes in real-time environments. However, it is in general challenging to strategically reason about long or short-term objectives using reactive planning. Therefore, ideally, deliberative and reactive planning should be integrated. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive interleaving of deliberative and reactive planning as our approach for dealing with real-time dynamic environments. Two main aspects {{are responsible for the}} success of the approach. First, the deliberative planner uses depth-bounded forward <b>chaining</b> <b>guided</b> by goalbased heuristics. Second, the real-time state space is discretized {{as a function of the}} average time that the deliberative planner needs to generate a plan. This ensures that the state, as seen by the deliberative planner, does not change in average while the plan is being generated. When a plan fails or a new plan is needed, the reactive planne [...] ...|$|R

50|$|SRAM’s {{most recent}} {{acquisition}} {{was of the}} power meter crank manufacturer, Quarq. This acquisition took place in 2011. By 2012, SRAM had incorporated power meters into its {{top of the line}} RED road group. Also in 2012 SRAM introduced wide range 1x11 mountain bike shifting with its XX1 groupset. The new groupset made use of a 10-42 cassette and a patented single front chainring that made use of both narrow and specially shaped wide teeth to retain the chain without a <b>chain</b> <b>guide.</b> The rear derailleur for the groupset was equally revolutionary and used a parallelogram that moved only laterally, a technology called X-Horizon, which offered more precise shifting and improved chain retention over conventional rear derailleurs.By 2014, this same technology was adapted for use on cyclocross bikes with the introduction of SRAM Force CX1. The group was expanded in 2015 to use chainrings (up to 54-teeth) for other applications such as TT/Tri, road, and fitness bikes. With the expanded applications SRAM simplified the naming of the group to Force 1. The same year the company also developed a lower price point 1x11 road groupset option with similar features, Rival 1.In August 2015, SRAM announced that it would release its 11-speed wireless electronic road groupset, SRAM RED eTap. The group utilizes derailleurs with self-contained batteries to shift using wireless signals sent from the shift levers. Benefits of the system include more precise shifting, faster setup, and lower maintenance compared to a traditional mechanically activated shifting arrangement. SRAM RED eTap is currently the only available wireless shifting system and is the lightest electronically actuated groupset on the market.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe potent {{antiviral}} and antiproliferative {{activities of}} human type I interferons (IFNs) are mediated {{by a single}} receptor comprising two subunits, IFNAR 1 and IFNAR 2. The structure of the IFNAR 2 IFN binding ectodomain (IFNAR 2 -EC), the first helical cytokine receptor structure determined in solution, reveals the molecular basis for IFN binding. The atypical perpendicular orientation of its two fibronectin domains explains the lack of C domain involvement in ligand binding. A model of the IFNAR 2 -EC/IFNα 2 complex based on double mutant cycle-derived constraints uncovers an extensive and predominantly aliphatic hydrophobic patch on the receptor that interacts with a matching hydrophobic surface of IFNα 2. An adjacent motif of alternating charged side <b>chains</b> <b>guides</b> the two proteins into a tight complex. The binding interface may account for crossreactivity and ligand specificity of the receptor. This molecular description of IFN binding should be invaluable for study and design of IFN-based biomedical agents...|$|R
