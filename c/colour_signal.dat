5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The DÃ¦mons. Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} series were {{recorded}} and screened {{in black and}} white, while Series 3 to 9 were recorded and screened in colour. Even so, one episode in Series 3, Room at the Bottom, formerly only survived {{in black and white}} and remains on the official DVDs in this form. This episode has benefited from colour recovery technology, using a buried <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> (chroma dots) in the black-and-white telerecording to restore the episode back to colour and was transmitted on 13 December 2008 on BBC Two.|$|E
25|$|The {{railways}} mostly use <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> lights. Earlier {{the older}} semaphores and discs-based signalling (depending on the position or colour) were used, {{but these were}} replaced by colour signals. Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use automatic block systems. However, the signals at stations are almost invariably interlocked with the setting of points (routes) and so safety {{does not depend on}} the skill of the station masters. With the planned introduction of Cab signalling/Anti collision devices the element of risk on account of drivers overshooting signals will also be eliminated.|$|E

40|$|DE 3505368 A UPAB: 19930922 The {{coding system}} {{is used for}} colour TV {{transmissions}} which are compatible with black-and-white TV receivers. In the transmitter incoming <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> (X,Y,Z) are input to a matrix circuit (NM) which outputs modified values for the three signals. The signals are further modified by compression circuits (Q) and are passed to a second matrix (U) which outputs two <b>colour</b> code <b>signals</b> (a,b) and a luminance signal (L). The two <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> are passed through low-pass filters (TP 1,TP 2). The receiver has a first matrix (U- 1) followed by expanding or decompression circuits (Q- 1). A further matrix WM produces three <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> (R',G',B'). Further circuits produce the voltage (ER,EG,EB) fed to the three electron guns of the TV set.

40|$|The {{spectral}} sensitivity of single photoreceptors of Osmia rufa {{was determined by}} a fast voltage-clamp technique. Three receptor types were found whose {{spectral sensitivity}} functions followed a rhodopsin-like photopigment absorption function with A,,, ^ values at 348 nm (ultraviolet receptor), 436 nm (blue receptor) and 572 nm (green receptor). The Amax of the green receptor in Osmia rufa is shifted to much longer wavelengths compared with other insect species. Discrimi-nation of <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> was tested after training a bee {{at the entrance to}} its nest. The <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> were filter discs (70 mm in diameter) with a hole (10 mm in diameter) in the centre and the bees quickly learned to use the coloured disc as a marker of the nest entrance. Tests were dual forced-choice tests with two coloured discs closely positioned next to each other. 94 different tests were each repeated 5 - 15 times and were performed after training to 12 different <b>colour</b> <b>signals.</b> A photoreceptor model was used to calculate the loci of the <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> in a three-dimensional colour space and in a chromaticity diagram.

25|$|Of the {{original}} 625-line PAL colour videotapes, all except Episode Four were wiped for reuse. However, a converted 525-line colour NTSC version recorded off-air from an American broadcast was {{made available to}} the BBC. This version was abridged and unsuitable for transmission as it was not of broadcast standard (the US recordings were made on a domestic Betamax VCR from a repeat in 1978). In 1992 the <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> from the NTSC tapes was used as the basis for restoring the colour to the 16mm monochrome telerecordings of episodes one, two, three and five. These versions were subsequently repeated on BBC2 on consecutive Fridays in November/December 1992 (20/11/92 to 18/12/92 at 7.15pm). The ratings were 2.52, 2.96, 2.30, 2.19 and 2.34 million viewers respectively.|$|E
50|$|Episode 6 {{has a small}} damaged {{section on}} the American NTSC {{videotape}} which {{was used as the}} source of the <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> for the restoration, which the Doctor Who Restoration Team replaced by painstakingly recolouring the appropriate section of the b/w film recording.|$|E
50|$|Although the PAL mastertapes {{had been}} wiped NTSC copies were {{returned}} to the BBC from TVOntario in Canada in 1983. In 1987, a low 625-line monochrome tape of Episode Six was discovered at the BBC. It was recoloured by combining the black-and-white picture with the 525-line <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> of the episode, creating a superior copy to the NTSC one.|$|E

40|$|Colour and {{greyscale}} (black and white) pictures {{look different}} to us, {{but it is}} not clear whether the difference in appearance is a consequence of the way our visual system uses <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> or a by-product of our experience. In principle, colour images are qualitatively different from greyscale images because they make it possible to use different processing strategies. <b>Colour</b> <b>signals</b> provide important cues for segmenting the image into areas that represent different objects and for linking together areas that represent the same object. If this property of <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> is exploited in visual processing we would expect colour stimuli to look different, as a class, from greyscale stimuli. We would also expect that adding <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> to greyscale signals should change the way that those signals are processed. We have investigated these questions in behavioural and in physiological experiments. We find that male marmosets (all of which are dichromats) rapidly learn to distinguish between colour and greyscale copies of the same images. The discrimination transfers to new image pairs, to new colours and to image pairs in which the colour and greyscale images are spatially different. We find that, in a proportion of neurons recorded in the marmoset visual cortex, colour-shifts in opposite directions produce similar enhancements of the response to a luminance stimulus. We conclude that colour is, both behaviourally and physiologically, a distinctive property of images. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to other wiped colour episodes from the Pertwee era where the missing colour information had been inadvertently recorded on the surviving {{black and white}} film copies as a sequence of visual artefacts/dots or chroma dots, {{in the case of}} Part One of this story this information was found to be incomplete, and only the red and green <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> information was recoverable, requiring the missing blue signal information to be obtained via other means.|$|E
50|$|Despite some {{attempts}} {{to create a}} color SECAM version of the 819-line system (which would have then also had the highest pre-HDTV <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> resolution, with lines of FM encoding alternately centred on 8.82 and 8.5mhz, if arranged similarly to 625-line SECAM), France abandoned it {{in favor of the}} Europe-wide standard of 625-lines (576i50), with the final 819-line transmissions from Paris in 1984. TMC in Monaco were the last broadcasters to transmit 819-line television, closing down their System E transmitter in 1985.|$|E

50|$|In some film {{sequences}} for location {{shots in}} these programmes (shot in colour), the <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> from the telecine machine {{had to be}} switched off in the vision mixing desk before being recorded to tape, but this was partly unsuccessful, leading to some film sequences being recorded with an odd array of pale colours (as for items where the colour {{is a mix of}} two primary colours, only one primary colour would show). This is prominent in the second series of Hadleigh, for example.|$|E
50|$|British colour {{television}} was broadcast on UHF (channels 21-69), {{beginning in the}} late 1960s. From then on, TV was broadcast on both VHF and UHF (VHF being a monochromatic downconversion from the 625-line <b>colour</b> <b>signal),</b> with the exception of BBC2 (which had always broadcast solely on UHF). The last British VHF TV transmitters closed down on January 3, 1985.

50|$|This serial was {{formerly}} lost from the BBC's television archive, the colour PAL videotapes {{on which it}} was made having been wiped in the 1970s. Only a monochrome telerecording, made on film for overseas sale of the programme, survived.
