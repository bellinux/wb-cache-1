It involves only the l = 2 terms for the solid tides and also the l = 3, 4 terms for the ocean tides. The perigee of LAGEOS II results to be very sensitive to the l = 3 part of the ocean tidal spectrum, contrary to the nodes of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II. The uncertainty on the solid tidal perturbations, mainly due to the Love number k 2, ranges from 0. 4 % to 1. 5 %, while the ocean tides are uncertain at a level of 5 % − 15 %. The results obtained are used in assessing which zonal constituents, if not accounted for by the dynamical models employed in building up the orbital <b>residuals,</b> affect the <b>combined</b> <b>residuals.</b> The necessity of correctly predicting the orbital perturbations, and consequently updating the orbital determination models, turns out to be particularly stringent for the l = 2 m = 0 18. 6 -year tide and for the l = 3 m = 0 part of Sa and Ssa.

In order to accomplish this task, first of all, the reliability of the UNIFAC activity coefficient model to predict the phase equilibria of such systems was evaluated. The technical feasibility of the use of hexane, methanol and water as solvents in a single-stage mixer-settler was then investigated. The biodiesel was produced via acid-catalyzed transesterification of waste cooking oil with methanol and the stream entering the mixer was assumed to be free of unconverted oil and acid catalyst, containing only biodiesel, glycerol and methanol. Furthermore, the biodiesel was assumed to have the properties of methyl oleate, which is the major component of biodiesel made from canola oil and methanol. The ASTM limit for glycerol content of biodiesel (< 0. 02 wt%), the residence time in the settler, the ratio of the liquid phase volumes in the settler and the biodiesel loss were the major performance measures considered. Four different solvent systems were found suitable: (1) water <b>combined</b> with <b>residual</b> methanol (with optimal mass ratio of biodiesel:methanol:water of 1 : 0. 10 : 0. 97), (2) a mixture of hexane and methanol (with optimal mass ratio of biodiesel:hexane:methanol of 1 : 1. 15 : 1. 62), (3) a mixture of hexane and water <b>combined</b> with <b>residual</b> methanol (with optimal mass ratio of biodiesel:hexane:methanol:water of 1 : 0. 79 : 0. 10 : 0. 69) and (4) a mixture of hexane, methanol and water (with optimal mass ratio of biodiesel:hexane:methanol:water of 1 : 2. 27 : 0. 87 : 0. 30). In acid-catalyzed production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and methanol, the units located following the mixer-settler were designed and used in the economic evaluation of the entire biodiesel plant. The technically feasible solvent systems were then optimized based on maximizing the after-tax return on investment as a measure of the annual profitability. Although all the processes showed poor economic potentials with negative annual after-tax return on investment, the relative values were important to compare these processes. The biodiesel plants using hexane and water solvents <b>combined</b> with <b>residual</b> methanol or additional methanol with optimal biodiesel:hexane:methanol: water mass ratio of 1 : 0. 43 : 0. 10 : 0. 24 or 1 : 2. 19 : 0. 90 : 0. 34, respectively, yielded the highest annual after-tax return on investment of - 35 %. The process using water <b>combined</b> with <b>residual</b> methanol, with optimal mass ratio of biodiesel:methanol:water of 1 : 0. 10 : 0. 86 showed to be the least economically beneficial system, mainly because of its relatively low annual revenue and low total capital investment. In contrast, the process using water <b>combined</b> with <b>residual</b> methanol and the process using a mixture of hexane and water combined with additional methanol yielded the lowest and the highest biodiesel break-even prices of 1. 70 and 1. 91 $/L, respectively...|$|R
