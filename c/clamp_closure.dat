40|$|Using single-molecule {{fluorescence}} {{resonance energy}} transfer, we have defined bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) clamp conformation {{at each step}} in transcription initiation and elongation. We find that the clamp predominantly is open in free RNAP and early intermediates in transcription initiation but closes upon formation of a catalytically competent transcription initiation complex and remains closed during initial transcription and transcription elongation. We show that four RNAP inhibitors interfere with clamp opening. We propose that clamp opening allows DNA to be loaded into and unwound in the RNAP active-center cleft, that DNA loading and unwinding trigger <b>clamp</b> <b>closure,</b> and that <b>clamp</b> <b>closure</b> accounts for the high stability of initiation complexes and the high stability and processivity of elongation complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibrational}} analysis of elastic models {{suggests that the}} essential motions of large biomolecular assemblies can be captured efficiently at an intermediate scale without requiring knowledge of the atomic struc-ture. While prior work has established a theoretical foundation for this analysis, we demonstrate here on experimental electron microscopy maps that vibrational modes indeed describe functionally relevant move-ments of macromolecular machines. The <b>clamp</b> <b>closure</b> in bacterial RNA polymerase, the ratcheting of 30 S and 50 S subunits of the ribosome, and the dynamic flexibility of chaperonin CCT are extracted directly from single electron microscopy structures at 15 – 27 A ̊ resolution. The striking agreement of the presented results with experimentally observed motions suggests that {{the motion of the}} large scale machinery in the cell is surprisingly independent of detailed atomic interactions and can be quite reasonably described as a motion of elastic bodies...|$|E
40|$|All {{cellular}} RNA polymerases (RNAPs), {{from those}} of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, {{and it has been}} assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient <b>clamp</b> <b>closure</b> as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2. 6 -angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA melting in the absence of external energy sources...|$|E
40|$|DOT, DOE and NRC Type A and Type B {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transport packages routinely use industrial or military specification drums with conventional <b>clamp</b> ring <b>closures</b> as an overpack. Considerable testing has been performed on these type packages {{over the past}} 30 years. Observations from test data have resulted in various design changes and recommendations to the standard drum specification and use, enhancing {{the reliability of the}} overpack. Recently, performance capability of the 9975 conventional <b>clamp</b> ring <b>closure</b> design was questioned by the Regulatory Authority. This paper highlights the observations of recent 9974 and 9975 package testing that led to redesign of the 9975, replacing the standard <b>clamp</b> ring <b>closure</b> with a bolted ring closure. In the course of this review and redesign effort, 18 package designs and approximately 100 Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) drops of various size and weight drum packages were evaluated. A trend was observed with respect to overpack lid failures for packages utilizing conventional ring closure. Based on this trend, a limit on the ratio of the content weight to total package weight was identified, beyond which <b>clamp</b> ring <b>closure</b> failure may be expected...|$|R

While Ephraim McDowell had successfully performed the first ovariotomy in Kentucky in 1809, mortality for this operation was over 90%.

5000|$|Other {{features}} of this style of clamp include: narrow band widths, intended to provide a concentrated compression of the hose or tube; and tamper resistance, due to the permanent deformation of the <b>clamp’s</b> “ear”. If <b>closure</b> of the <b>clamp</b> “ear(s)” is performed to manufacturer's recommendations, which generally provide for constant jaw force, the sealing effect is not unduly sensitive to component tolerance variations.|$|R
40|$|Sliding DNA clamps {{are loaded}} at a ss/dsDNA {{junction}} by a clamp loader {{that depends on}} ATP binding for clamp opening. Sequential ATP hydrolysis results in closure of the clamp so that it completely encircles and diffuses on dsDNA. We followed events during loading of an E.  coli β clamp in real time by using single-molecule FRET (smFRET). Three successive FRET states were retained for 0. 3  s, 0. 7  s, and 9  min: Hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule by the γ clamp loader resulted in closure of the clamp in 0. 3  s, and after 0. 7  s in the closed conformation, the clamp was released to diffuse on the dsDNA for at least 9  min. An additional single-molecule polarization study revealed that the interfacial domain of the clamp rotated in plane by approximately 8 ° during <b>clamp</b> <b>closure.</b> The single-molecule polarization and FRET studies thus revealed the real-time dynamics of the ATP-hydrolysis-dependent 3 D conformational change of the β clamp during loading at a ss/dsDNA junction...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are {{targets for}} antibiotics. Myxopyronin binds to the RNAP switch regions to block {{structural}} rearrangements needed for formation of open promoter complexes. Bacterial RNAPs containing the major variant p 54 factor are activated by enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) and transcribe genes whose products {{are needed in}} pathogenicity and stress responses. We show that (i) enhancer-dependent RNAPs help Escherichia coli {{to survive in the}} presence of myxopyronin, (ii) enhancer-dependent RNAPs par-tially resist inhibition by myxopyronin and (iii) ATP hydrolysis catalysed by bEBPs is obligatory for functional interaction of the RNAP switch regions with the transcription start site. We demonstrate that enhancer-dependent promoters contain two barriers to full DNA opening, allowing tight regula-tion of transcription initiation. bEBPs engage in a dual switch to (i) allow propagation of nucleated DNA melting from an upstream DNA fork junction and (ii) complete the formation of the transcription bubble and downstream DNA fork junction at the RNA synthesis start site, resulting in switch region-dependent RNAP <b>clamp</b> <b>closure</b> and open promoter complex formation...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to observe}} the changes and the {{function}} of p 38 MAPK-HSP 27 signaling pathways in acute lung injury (ALI) induced by acute ischemic kidney injury in rats. Wistar rats were randomly divided into Group A (control group), Group B (acute kidney injury group), and Group C (acute kidney injury +SB 203580). The concentration of protein in BALF, neutrophil counts, PI, W/D; the concentration of TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β in plasma and BALF; and the concentrations of MDA and NO in the lung tissue started to increase 2 [*]h after the experiment in Group B, which showed a significant difference compared with those in Groups A and C. The expressions of p-p 38 MAPK and p-HSP 27 in the lung tissue began to increase 2 [*]h after the experiment in Group B, which was different from those in Groups A and C. A significant increase was observed in the F-actin expression in Group B than that in Group A. In Group B, the correlation of cytokine TNF-α, IL- 6, and p-p 38 MAPK in BALF was positive. Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by bilateral renal arteriovenous <b>clamp</b> <b>closure</b> could activate p 38 MAPK-HSP 27 signaling pathways and induce lung injury, which blocks the p 38 MAPK-HSP 27 signal pathway {{to reduce the risk}} of lung injury...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of warm ischemia on renal function. Methods: Within a multicentric study, the data about tumor-affected solitary kidney were obtained from 9 urological centers in the Czech Republic. Patients were divided into groups according to the WIT (warm ischemia time). In each group the mean preoperative serum creatinine was determined, {{as well as on}} 3 rd and 7 th postoperative day and the lowest GF postoperatively. In each group the mean R. E. N. A. L. nephrometric score was determined. Results: The study compriese data totally of 97 patients. The open approach was chosen in 78 cases, in 16 cases laparoscopic approach was chosen. The robotic surgery was performed in 3 patients. PN with zero ischemia was performed in 29 patients (30 %). Conclusion: Our findings confirm that non-clamping partial nephrectomy in a solitary kidney minimizes renal injury. For the non-clamping partial nephrectomy can be mainly indicated smaller exophyticall tumors without deep parenchymal invasion. Unfortunately, most of PN should be performed with vascular <b>clamping,</b> allowing precise <b>closure</b> of collecting system, vascular and parenchymal defect, especially for larger tumors with deep parenchymal invasion. According to our observation that WIT of 15 minutes for a kidney is safe. Clamping of [...] ...|$|R

We review here the current understanding of the clamp loader mechanism and discuss {{the implications of the}} differences between clamp loaders from the different branches of life. High-speed replication of chromosomal DNA requires the DNA polymerase to be attached to a sliding clamp (known as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, in eukaryotes) that prevents the polymerase from falling off DNA [1, 2]. In all cells and in some viruses, the clamp is a ring-shaped protein complex that encircles DNA, forming a sliding platform on which DNA polymerases and other proteins that move along DNA are assembled. Sliding clamps play a part in DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle control and modification of chromatin structure [3, 4], and defects in several clamp-associated factors are associated with cancer and other disorders caused by abnormalities in DNA replication and repair [5]. Because sliding clamps encircle DNA but do not interact tightly with it, they can slide along the doubl...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal {{replication}} is {{an essential}} process in all life. This dissertation highlights regulatory roles for two critical protein complexes {{at the heart of}} the replication fork: 1) the sliding clamp, the major polymerase processivity factor, and 2) the sliding clamp loader, a spiral-shaped AAA+ ATPase, which loads the clamp onto DNA. The clamp is a promiscuous binding protein that interacts with at least 100 binding partners to orchestrate many processes on DNA, but spatiotemporal regulation of these binding interactions is unknown. Remarkably, a recent disease-causing mutant of the sliding clamp showed specific defects in DNA repair pathways. We aimed to use this mutant as a tool to understand the binding specificity of clamp interactions, and investigate the disease further. We solved three structures of the mutant, and biochemically showed perturbation of partnerbinding for some, but not all, ligands. Using a fission yeast model, we showed that mutant cells are sensitive to select DNA damaging agents. These data revealed significant flexibility within the binding site, which likely regulates partner binding. Before the clamp can act on DNA, the sliding clamp loader places the clamp onto DNA at primer/template (p/t) junctions. The clamp loader reaction couples p/t binding and subsequent ATP hydrolysis to <b>clamp</b> <b>closure.</b> Here we show that composition (RNA vs. DNA) of the primer strand affects clamp loader binding, and that the order of ATP hydrolysis around the spiral is likely sequential. These studies highlight additional details into the clamp loader mechanism, which further elucidate general mechanisms of AAA+ machinery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVaccinia topoisomerase {{provides}} a model system for structure–function {{analysis of the}} type IB topoisomerase family. Here we performed an alanine scan of eight positions in the β 4 and β 5 strands of the N-terminal domain (Leu 57, Ile 58, Phe 59, Val 60, Gly 61, Ser 62, Gln 69 and Gly 73) and eight positions in the α 8 -α 9 loop of the C-terminal catalytic domain (Ser 241, Ile 242, Ser 243, Pro 244, Leu 245, Pro 246, Ser 247, and Pro 248). Mutants F 59 A, G 73 A, and Q 69 A displayed rate defects in relaxing supercoiled DNA that were attributed to effects on DNA binding rather than transesterification chemistry. Replacing Gln 69 conservatively with Asn, Glu or Lys failed to restore relaxation activity. Gln 69 is located along a concave DNA-binding surface of the N-terminal domain and it makes {{direct contact with the}} + 2 A base of the 5 ′-CCCTT/ 3 -GGGAA target site for DNA cleavage. Gly 73 is located at the junction between the N-terminal domain and catalytic domain and it is likely to act as a swivel for the large domain movements that coordinate DNA ingress and closure of the topoisomerase clamp around the duplex. Previous alanine scanning had identified Phe 215 in helix α 7 of the catalytic domain as contributing to DNA relaxation activity. Here we find that F 215 L resembles F 215 A in its diminished relaxation activity and its sensitivity to inhibition by salt. The Phe 215 side chain makes van der Waals contacts to Ile 98, Met 121 and Phe 101, which we propose stabilize a three helix bundle and promote <b>clamp</b> <b>closure...</b>|$|E
