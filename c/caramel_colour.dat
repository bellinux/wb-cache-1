25|$|After distillation, the unaged brandy {{is placed}} into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled.

25|$|Italian Stravecchio {{has been}} {{produced}} since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, using grapes popular in winemaking such as Sangiovese and Grignolino. Colour, texture and finish are most resembling {{those of their}} French and Spanish counterparts. Most popular brands are Vecchia Romagna, Stravecchio Branca and Stock 84. Northern Italy is also noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, Grappa, which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called barrique which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation.

25|$|Brandy is {{a spirit}} {{produced}} by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink.

5000|$|Under Irish whiskey regulations, malt whiskey {{is to be}} {{distilled}} in a pot still from a mash of 100% malted barley, {{which may}} be peated or unpeated in character (though typically unpeated malt is used).

50|$|Sandesh can be {{made with}} the use of chhena or cottage cheese. The {{simplest}} kind of sandesh in Bengal is the makha sandesh (makha = kneaded). It is prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. The sandesh is essentially hot, sweetened chhana. When shaped into balls, it is called kanchagolla (kancha = raw; golla = ball). For more complex and elaborately prepared sandesh, the chhana is dried and pressed, flavored with essence of fruits, and sometimes even colored, and cooked to many different levels of consistencies. Sometimes it is filled with syrup, blended with coconut or kheer, and molded into a variety of shapes such as conch shells, elephants, and fish. Another variant is nolen gurer sandesh, which is made with gur or jaggery. It is known for its brown or <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> that comes from nolen gur.|$|E
2500|$|E150A <b>caramel</b> <b>colouring</b> may {{be added}} to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling, to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance.

Normally, a darker colour suggests a higher age {{or the use of}} young casks, though artificial <b>caramel</b> <b>colouring</b> is permitted. Clear akvavit is called taffel; it is typically aged in old casks that do not colour the finished spirit or not aged at all.|$|R

40|$|This EFSA {{statement}} is a refined exposure assessment of caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d) {{taking into account}} additional information on its use in foods as consumed. The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 b, E 150 c, E 150 d) used as food additives in 2011. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that the anticipated dietary exposure of child and adult populations may exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for caramel colours E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d, but exposure estimates to E 150 b were below the ADI. Following this conclusion, new data from industry were submitted to EFSA providing updated use levels of caramel colours in foods ready to be consumed. A refined exposure assessment was performed for caramel colours that were exceeding the ADI in ANS Panel opinion (EFSA, 2011 a) i. e. E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d {{and concluded that the}} anticipated dietary exposure are considerably lower than in the previous exposure assessment. However, toddlers and adults have a higher exposure to <b>caramel</b> <b>colour</b> E 150 c and could still exceed the ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for this <b>caramel</b> <b>colour.</b> The estimated combined exposure to the four caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 b, E 150 c, E 150 d) are considerably lower and the group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day is not exceeded for any population group in the current review...|$|E
40|$|SCID mice engrafted {{with human}} fetal thymus and liver tissue {{fragments}} (SCID-hu mice) are currently {{considered as a}} new tool in human immunotoxicological risk assessment. Testing of various immunotoxicants exerting thymotoxicity via different intrathymic target cell types is necessary for validation of this model. Therefore, SCID-hu mice were exposed to 2 -acetyl- 4 (5) -(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroxybutyl) -imidazole (THI), the immunotoxic component in the food additive, <b>Caramel</b> <b>Colour</b> III, or the organotin compound, di-n-butyltin dichloride (DBTC). Histopathological examination of the human thymus grafts of SCID-hu mice either exposed to THI or to DBTC showed {{a reduction in the}} relative size of the thymus cortex, an effect also described in rodents, These results indicate that the human thymus is a target for the immunotoxic action of both THI and DBTC.

50|$|Independently bottled whisky is {{sometimes}} bottled at cask strength, {{which means it}} is not diluted from the strength {{that comes out of}} the barrel.

Independent Bottlers may also not chill filter the whisky, a process which involves removing fatty acids, proteins and esters to give the whisky a clearer appearance. Chill filtering can affect flavour, however, because these compounds account {{for a lot of the}} taste (the esters, for example, have a fruit-like aroma). One further measure often not taken when independently bottling whisky is the addition of spirit <b>caramel</b> for <b>colouring.</b>|$|R
