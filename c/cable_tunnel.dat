2500|$|Divers {{worked to}} tunnel under O-5s bow so lifting cables could be attached. Ajax arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> had been dug, the cable run, and a lift was attempted. [...] Sheppard J. Shreaves, {{supervisor}} of the Panama Canal’s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to Ajax’s hoist. Now the lift began. As the crane took a strain, the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew worked another cable set under the bow and again Ajax pulled. Again, the cable broke. All through the day, the men worked. Shreaves {{had been in his}} diving suit nearly 24 hours. As midnight on [...] the 29th approached, the crane was ready for another lift, this time with buoyancy being added by blowing water out of the flooded Engine Room. Then, just after midnight, the bow of O-5 broke the surface. Men from the salvage force quickly opened the torpedo room hatch, and Breault and Brown emerged into the fresh air.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{transmission}} cables installed in <b>cable</b> <b>tunnels</b> in the UK are XLPE insulated, hence they {{are limited to}} a maximum operating temperature of 90 °C.

50|$|The Saint Lawrence River HVDC Powerline Crossing is the {{crossing}} of Hydro-Québec's Quebec-New England HVDC transmission line over (and later, under) the Saint Lawrence River between Grondines and Lotbinière, Quebec, Canada. The crossing is remarkable, for being first implemented as an overhead crossing, {{and then later}} replaced by a <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Hydro-Québec wanted to complete the transmission line in time, which was only possible with an overhead crossing of Saint Lawrence River. However, due to the negative visual impact of the large towers of the overhead crossing on the local populations of Grondines and Lotbinière, {{it was decided to}} build a <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the river, although this made the project more expensive.|$|E
50|$|The site of {{the power}} station was chosen for easy {{delivery}} of coal from the Thames and by rail, {{as well as the}} abundant water supply and space on the site for expansion. A <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> was constructed under the river to supply the south bank with electricity.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of <b>cable</b> <b>tunnels</b> in large urban areas has become more popular, with the {{additional}} capital cost becoming increasingly acceptable {{in light of the}} growing difficulties incurred for large scale directly buried cable installations. Presently cable ratings for such circuits are calculated using the method of Electra 143.

This work demonstrates an improved method which removes this limitation whilst retaining the ease of use of the previous method...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, {{tunnelling}} with TBM {{is getting}} popular {{for the construction}} of <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> in urban area. Mechanized tunnelling method using shield TBM has various advantages such as minimization of ground settlement and prevention of vibration induced by blasting that should be accompanied by conventional tunnelling. In Korea, earth pressure balance (EPB) type shield TBM has been mainly used. Despite the popularity of EPB shield TBM for <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> construction, study on the mechanical behavior of <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> driven by shield TBM is insufficient. Especially, the effect of backfill grout injection on the behavior of <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> driven by shield TBM is investigated in this study. Tunnelling with shield TBM is simulated using 3 D FEM. The distance of backfill grout injection from the end of shield skin varies. Sectional forces such as axial force, shear force and bending moment are monitored. Vertical displacement at the ground surface is measured. Futhermore, the relation between volume loss and the distance of backfill grout injection from the end of skin plate is derived. Based on the stability analysis with the results obtained from the numerical analysis, the mos...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} {{software}} ADINA was employed {{in this paper}} to study the ventilation effect of a large cross-section <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> by using a computational fluid dynamics method. The temperature and ventilation zoning inside a <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel</b> were determined according to {{the characteristics of the}} large cross-section <b>cable</b> <b>tunnel.</b> With the ambient tunnel characteristics and tunnel cross-section layout being taken into consideration, a three-dimensional model for large cross-section cable tunnels was established; the computations indicate that the main influential factors of ventilation effect of large cross-section cable tunnels are intake airflow rate, intake air temperature, exhaust airflow rate, ventilation duration, tunnel length, fire door layout, and so on. The average air velocity in the tunnel was about 60 % of the intake airflow rate. The intake air temperature has much impact on tunnel temperature distribution within a range of 30 m away from the tunnel origin, as shown by a significant cooling effect when intake air temperature falls; whereas the intake air temperature has less impact on tunnel temperature distribution beyond 30 m from the tunnel origin...|$|E
