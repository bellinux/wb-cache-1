30|$|The {{reservoir}} operation schedule (with Guide Curve and integrated approach as adopted by DVC Authority) {{was used for}} simulating the operation of system of reservoirs in integrated manner, starting from 1 st June (beginning of water year in India). The integrated approach involves consideration of {{the operation of the}} Tilaiya reservoir in tandem with the Maithon reservoir, the operation of the Konar and Tenughat reservoirs in tandem with the Panchet reservoir and combined operation of Maithon and Panchet reservoirs for the Durgapur Barrage for conservation as well as flood management purposes. The operation schedule invokes attempt to maintain <b>conservation</b> <b>storages</b> of the <b>reservoirs</b> full (throughout the month of October) so as to ensure conservation requirement up to the end of summer (or up to the onset of monsoon i.e. the first week of June) along with some carry-over storage if onset of monsoon is delayed.|$|R
30|$|Operational {{policies}} for future scenario were framed for various combinations of resource enhancement and demand management strategies. Resource enhancement strategy through reallocation of <b>reservoir</b> <b>storage</b> capacity encompasses increasing the <b>conservation</b> <b>storage</b> volume at {{the expenses of}} flood control <b>storage</b> volume for <b>reservoirs.</b> Again relatively small storage reallocation seems to be viable keeping in view the uncertainty in occurrence of extreme rainfall events and risk associated with loss in flood control storage capacity, particularly, in case of extreme flood event. Analysis of historical record revealed occasional spells of moderately high inflow to Maithon and Panchet reservoirs to occur every year during non-monsoon months—the occurrence {{was found to be}} higher for Panchet reservoir (located on the main stream of Damodar river system) than for Maithon reservoir. Hence, an increase in storage capacity of the reservoirs (by reallocating 15  % of flood <b>storage</b> of Maithon <b>reservoir</b> and 20  % of flood <b>storage</b> of Panchet <b>reservoir</b> (flood <b>storage</b> capacity of Panchet reservoir being larger than that of Maithon <b>reservoir)</b> to corresponding <b>conservation</b> <b>storages</b> during season- 3 and season- 4) may be explored as a measure to improve the performance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{environmental}} {{program has}} {{also met with}} pushback from federal representatives, including a bill introduced to Congress by Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) in 2015, which would have allowed <b>conservation</b> of <b>reservoir</b> <b>storage</b> during droughts, rather than releasing it for environmental purposes. Due to the Stanislaus River's limited flow, {{it has become clear}} that not all the demands on the river can be fully satisfied, forcing federal, state and local water managers to compromise. An interim program started in 2016 allows the Stanislaus irrigation districts to sell some river water to the San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority, which represents federal contractors in the southern San Joaquin Valley, at premium prices. Because the water must travel down the Stanislaus and San Joaquin Rivers to the Delta before it can be pumped south, {{it can be used to}} fulfill Stanislaus fishery flow requirements, essentially performing double duty. In 2016, this plan was able to conserve [...] of water.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{monitoring}} method currently {{under investigation for}} CO 2 sequestration involves having multiple, vertically distributed pressure sensors in a monitoring well extending {{down to the bottom}} of the <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir.</b> While above- zone monitoring is useful for leakage detection, pressure sensors in the <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir</b> are needed to track CO 2 plume migration in the <b>storage</b> <b>reservoir</b> itself.
