In certain regions in Malaysia, some dialects are more widely used; Hokkien predominates in Penang and Kedah, while most Chinese in the former centres of tin mining, such as Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur, speak Cantonese. More recently, however, with the standardised, <b>compulsory</b> <b>use</b> of Mandarin in Chinese schools, a huge majority of Malaysian Chinese now speak Mandarin, a non-native language that originated from northern China.|$|E
25|$|Family name: A name used by {{all members}} of a family. In China, {{surnames}} gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed {{in the next several}} centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In Europe, after the loss of the Roman system, the common use of family names started quite early in some areas (France in the 13th century, and Germany in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the Scandinavian countries, Wales, and some areas of Germany, as well as Russia and Ukraine. The <b>compulsory</b> <b>use</b> of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used patronymics, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923) in Norway, and Iceland still does not use surnames for its native inhabitants. In Spain, Portugal and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named António de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as António Guterres. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero is often called Zapatero. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|After a week {{of reports}} chiefly {{concerned}} with survival accounts and tributes, on October 18 The New York Times turned to [...] "Lessons Concerning Means of Security on Ocean Steamers". [...] Among several recommendations were: the <b>compulsory</b> <b>use</b> of steam whistles or trumpets as fog signals; the construction of permanent watertight bulkheads in all passenger-carrying ships; organized lifeboat drills for passengers; better discipline and more training among seamen. Few of these suggested reforms were adopted immediately; calls for steamships sailing under the US flag to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board were resisted until after the loss of [...] 58 years later. In December 1854 The New York Times called for an official enquiry into the disaster: [...] "Whatever may be {{the extent of their}} legal responsibility, the owners, the officers and the crew of the Arctic are responsible to the public judgment... They have no right to resist any attempt that may be made to define the extent of that responsibility, nor to deprecate any degree of scrutiny into their conduct". No such investigation was ever instituted, and no one was taken to court for their actions. Some of the crewmen who landed in Quebec avoided questions by not returning to the United States; according to Shaw they [...] "disappeared on the waterfronts along the St Lawrence River and found the obscurity they wanted".|$|E

2500|$|Passengers can {{purchase}} a single-journey paper ticket at the ticket booth in the shelter. In 2013, TransJakarta introduced {{the use of}} prepaid cards or e-tickets for passenger use. The prepaid cards that are eligible as ticket are bank-issued cards of BRI BRizzi, BCA Flazz, BNI Tapcash, Mandiri e-money, Bank DKI JakCard, and Bank Mega MegaCash. The prepaid cards can be purchased and topped-up at any ticket booth in the shelter throughout the system, or at the ATM of the issuing bank. The prepaid cards, except for Bank DKI JakCard and Bank Mega MegaCash, are also valid as ticket in the Jabodetabek Commuter Train system as of June 2014, easing the integration plan between the BRT and the commuter train system. In April and May 2014, the TransJakarta management started the <b>compulsory</b> <b>use</b> of the e-tickets at several terminus in the system, based on news said that the BCA Flazz Card {{can also be used}} in Jabodetabek Commuter Train. In mid-October 2014, 56 percent passengers have used e-tickets. Now, all TransJakarta corridors and shelters applied the <b>compulsory</b> <b>use</b> of the e-tickets, since February 21, 2015. August 17, 2016 marks the start of tap-out system trial in Corridor 1 (Blok M - Kota), while similar trial was started on September 9, 2016 in Corridor 2. The system is meant to control the flow of people {{going in and out of}} the shelters, discourage illegal entrance to and exit from the shelters, and to encourage sales and usage of the [...] "e-tickets".
