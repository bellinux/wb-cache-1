50|$|Some {{clothing}} {{items were}} only available to one gender. For example, boys <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> princess outfits (excluding the Princess Minnie hat), and girls <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the Wildcats outfit.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001 Marc Terenzi met German pop star Sarah Connor at a music festival. The two soon hit it off and were dating despite Lou Pearlman's wishes. Lou Pearlman had strict rules for his boy bands: they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> facial hair, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> many piercings or tattoos, and they {{definitely}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> girlfriends. However, the relationship continued on.|$|R
60|$|Her {{thoughts}} then <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been so clear. She <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> visualized {{the immediate}} future; {{the departure of}} Le Monarque at dawn--Captain Barre receiving the signet-ring--that breakneck ride to Le Havre.|$|R
60|$|Both {{the girls}} felt their faces glow and their pulses throb; both {{knew they would}} do no good by rushing down into the mêlée. They desired neither to deal nor to receive blows; but they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> run away--Caroline no more than Shirley; they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> fainted; they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> taken their eyes from the dim, terrible scene--from the mass of cloud, of smoke, the musket-lightning--for the world.|$|R

60|$|When she {{was created}} she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> told; Queen Zurline <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> told; the great Ak himself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> told. It was {{long ago when}} the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to {{minister}} to the wants of the young trees. Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been in that}} cabin {{more than}} two minutes altogether. Say three. [...] . So he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been {{watching}} me {{more than a mere}} fraction of a minute, luckily. Still, I regretted the occurrence.|$|R
60|$|If Mr. Tetterby {{had been}} ten feet high, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{expressed}} a gentler consideration for Mrs. Tetterby's fairy-like stature; and if Mrs. Tetterby {{had been two}} feet high, she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> felt it more appropriately her due.|$|R
60|$|There {{is but one}} Homer, {{there is}} but one Shakespeare, there is but one McClintock--and his immortal book is before you. Homer <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> written this book, Shakespeare <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> written it, I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done it myself. There is nothing just like it in the {{literature}} of any country or of any epoch. It stands alone; it is monumental. It adds G. Ragsdale McClintock's to the sum of the republic's imperishable names.|$|R
60|$|Twelve {{years ago}} I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{appreciated}} this picture. One year ago I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> appreciated it. My study of Art in Heidelberg {{has been a}} noble education to me. All that I am today in Art, I owe to that.|$|R
50|$|A Rape Crisis {{survey found}} that {{one third of the}} 1000 women {{surveyed}} thought that if a woman did not fight back, then she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> experienced rape; while 60% thought that a woman <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> experienced rape if she didn't say 'no'.|$|R
60|$|He didn't know. Perhaps. He confessed he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done it. <b>Not</b> he. His {{flesh and}} blood <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> stood it. He would have felt he must see what was coming. Then he remembered that the flare might have {{scorched}} her face, and expressed his concern.|$|R
50|$|Although the Mujahideen and Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{soldiers}} {{crimes were}} proven, {{and it was}} agreed by the court that he had effective control over that unit during that time, the judges concluded that Delić <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> known about those murders at the time so he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> stopped them.|$|R

60|$|It was {{unfortunate that}} he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been removed to the Kenniston farm, {{where he would}} have been nearer medical aid in case he should need it suddenly; but he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been taken where he would have {{received}} more tender or devoted care then he did from Mr. Simpson and his wife.|$|R
6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. It <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been for the}} prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been for convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been for health or salubrity, as the breath of the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been for space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, {{men and women were}} huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been for pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it was not a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, for the camp had been deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons had been slowly arriving; it was not an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But it {{must always}} have been a lake, señor," [...] Dias said after {{thinking}} for a minute, [...] "and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been shallower, for {{there is no other}} escape than the waterfall; and however heavy the rains it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> risen higher, except a few feet, as one can see by the face of the rock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she would, sir. After you {{had gone}} up to the Hall yesterday, I went up to see her, as I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> asked you {{to let me go}} at once, if I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> found some one to take my place. She would be glad to come, sir; and I am sure she will suit you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendid!" [...] another exclaimed. [...] "It <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been better}} managed. I {{think we ought}} to give three cheers for Chris." [...] Three rousing cheers were given. [...] "After this, Chris," [...] Carmichael said, [...] "I don't think you need talk any more about resigning the command. General Symons himself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done better." ...|$|R

25|$|Since Joshua {{read from}} the Torah every word Moses had written, this implies that Moses <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been given an Oral Law, since Joshua <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> read an Oral Law from the written Torah. Secondly, there <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been {{additional}} commandments outside of the written Torah, since all the commandments that existed could be {{read from the}} Torah scroll.|$|R
6000|$|It <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been because}} of the {{expression}} in his eyes, as he fingered the wallet, for this she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see, since his face was still in shadow. It must have been just instinct--that, and the mockery of his attempt {{to make love to}} her. Had he ever loved her, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> mocked ... <b>not</b> now, that she was helpless and entirely at his mercy.|$|R
5000|$|Defendants can, where applicable, {{argue that}} {{copyright}} infringement <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> taken place, as: ...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{animals have}} played an {{important}} role in literature, oral or written. Aesop's fables, for instance, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been as popular around the world without the help of such animals as lions, foxes, mice and ants. Some of Edgar Alan Poe's stories <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> scared readers so much, either, without a support from a black cat or an orangutan...|$|R
5000|$|... "two great patriotic, {{wise and}} humane state papers…Both {{were born in}} days of doubt and darkness. Both were the outcome of {{injustice}} overleaping the bounds of right and reason.
