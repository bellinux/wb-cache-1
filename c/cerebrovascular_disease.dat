Goble Street in Hughes, Australian Capital Territory, was named for Jimmy Goble.

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality {{is expected to}} decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for {{a significant proportion of}} population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%. In 2008, the leading cause of premature death was cancer, at 29.8%, followed by ischaemic heart disease, 19.7%, and then <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> 9.2%.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} whether low concentrations of ambient air pollutants {{are associated with}} hospital admissions for ischemic cardiac and <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: Associations between daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulates and daily hospital admissions due to ischemic cardiac and <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> were studied in Helsinki, Finland, 1987 through 1989. The regression analyses controlled for weather, day of the week, season, long-term trends, and influenza epidemics. RESULTS: Admissions via emergency rooms due to ischemic cardiac diseases (n = 7005) {{were significantly associated with}} the prevailing levels of nitric oxide and ozone, and those due to <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> (n = 3737) were associated with nitrogen dioxide; these levels were only moderate. Long-term transient myocardial ischemic attacks were related to particulates, and short-term ischemic attacks were related to nitrogen dioxide.

Objective: To define the tendency lines, according to the type of <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in Cienfuegos province, over the last six years. Methods: There was realized a retrospective, and descriptive study, of a series of cases. The mortality was analyzed for the different types of <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> The data were obtained, of the monthly and annual reports of the Commission of <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results: A half rate of morbidity of 108, 89, was verified by 100 000 habitants; the mortality due to infarct and subarachnoid hemorrhages diminishes.

However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes.
