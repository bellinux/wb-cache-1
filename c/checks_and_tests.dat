Hence it was required to carried out some mandatory <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> to re certify the aircraft for flying. In this context one of the checks to be carry out on the aircraft structure is Non Destructive Testing for which Fibre Reinforced Plastic Division is responsible. NDT tests was carried out using Woodpecker (WP- 632 M) on this VT-HNS HANSA- 3 Aircraft during May 1 7 to 25 " 2007. While carrying out NDT, the measurement and marking of the defect zones were done in real time, rather than storing the data and post - processing. This procedure is adapted for all the components of the Aircraft. The adapted method is highly useful for field applications where the repair disposition can be given immediately and the repair of the damaged part can be taken up without delay.

40|$|Within the INNOVance project, the “process dossier” {{should be}} {{considered}} as a summary document strictly connected with all the informations acquired during the selection of materials, products and parts. The latter constitute the material resources required for the execution of works, besides human resources, hire and transportations. This dossier is structured into five parts as follows: List of resources needed for works; Resources analysis; Definition of the acceptance conditions for every working action related to the tasks and every production phase (preliminary, in- execution and final controls); Waste and emissions management; Health and Safety aspects. The aim of our dossier is therefore the definition of implementation method of works quality and quantity controls needed to their execution. Our model entails the identification of working actions, reduced to elementary operations in the following four stages of processing: transport from storage area to processing area, preparation of materials needed for work, materials transportation to the installation area, implementation. The procurement phase was intentionally omitted because it regards operators not involved in this process. The work was complemented by <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> performed on some companies involved into the INNOVance project.

SLS continues to pursue a 2018 first launch of Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1). At NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, LA, Boeing completed welding of structural test and flight liquid hydrogen tanks, and engine sections. Test stands for core stage structural tests at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL. neared completion. The B 2 test stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center, MS, completed major structural renovation to support core stage green run testing in 2018. Orbital ATK successfully test fired its second qualification solid rocket motor in the Utah desert and began casting the motor segments for EM- 1. Aerojet Rocketdyne completed its series of test firings to adapt the heritage RS- 25 engine to SLS performance requirements. Production is under way on the first five new engine controllers. NASA also signed a contract with Aerojet Rocketdyne for propulsion of the RL 10 engines for the Exploration Upper Stage. United Launch Alliance delivered the structural test article for the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage to MSFC for tests and construction was under way on the flight stage.

40|$|Since Einstein {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} general relativity (GR) as a theory of gravity, it has passed all experimental <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests.</b> Until recently, all of these tests {{have been done in}} the weak gravity limit. The first test of strong-field GR came just a few months ago, when the LIGO collaboration directly detected gravitational waves for the first time. Using gravitational waves as a tool to test the validity of GR requires us to know the waveforms that GR predicts from various sources. The ultimate goal of the research described in this thesis is to compute the waveform generated by a stellar mass Kerr black hole as it inspirals into a much more massive black hole (SMBH). To compute this waveform, we must first compute the inspiral trajectory of the stellar mass black hole. The trajectory of the smaller black hole differs from the geodesic structure taught in GR textbooks due to the influence of this body's mass and spin. In this thesis, I examine these two effects separately. Later work will need to consider the two effects simultaneously, but the separate impact of these effects provides insight which helps us to understand how to model these sources. The small body's mass perturbs the spacetime and pushes its trajectory away from textbook geodesic motion. I show how to compute the dissipative part of this "self force," whose average impact is equivalent to the loss of energy and angular momentum due to gravitational wave emission. I study in particular how the self force's averaged behavior changes near orbital resonances, quantifying the impact that such resonances will have on the small body's inspiral. The small body's spin couples to spacetime curvature. This coupling leads to a force which also pushes the small body's trajectory away from the geodesic. This force is comparable in magnitude to the self force associated with the small body's mass, indicating that future work will need {{to assess the impact of}} these effects together in a self consistent way in order to make accurate inspiral waveforms. by Uchupol Ruangsri.

40|$|Flash {{memory has}} become {{virtually}} indispensable in most mobile devices, such as mobile phones, digital cameras, mp 3 players, etc. In order for mobile devices to successfully provide services, {{it is essential}} that flash memory be controlled correctly through the device driver software. However, as is typical for embedded software, conventional testing methods often fail to detect hidden flaws in the complex device driver software. This deficiency incurs significant development and operation overhead to the manufacturers. As a complementary approach to improve the reliability of embedded software, model checking provides a complete analysis of a target model but the size of the target software is limited due to the state explosion problem. In this project, we have verified the correctness of a multi-sector read operation of Samsung OneNAND TM flash device driver by using both model <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing.</b> We started the verification task with the model checkers NuSMV and Spin for an exhaustive analysis of a small size flash as a pre-testing step.
