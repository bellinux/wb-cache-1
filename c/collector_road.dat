5|$|The bridge, {{as well as}} the {{remainder}} of SR225 are considered a major <b>collector</b> <b>road</b> by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which the Federal Highway Administration defines as linking towns to larger arterials. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that 9,500vehicles traveled on SR-225 along the bridge.|$|E
5|$|It passes into a {{primarily}} residential area, though several auto service shops exist {{along this}} stretch, {{as well as}} Northern Secondary School. The road heads slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small Burke Brook. After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets Lawrence Avenue East. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage traffic light, directs driver to the east before continuing north. From here to the northern terminus, it is classified as a <b>collector</b> <b>road</b> and is a wide residential street with several stop signs. The road ends {{near the edge of}} the West Don Valley at an intersection with Glen Echo Drive, adjacent to the Doncliffe Bus Loop.|$|E
5|$|NY28N is {{classified}} as a rural major <b>collector</b> <b>road,</b> {{with the exception of}} the section that is overlapped with Route30, which {{is classified}} as a rural minor arterial road. As of 2006, the Route30 overlap had an annual average daily traffic of 1,781 vehicles. Traffic volumes are reduced to 1,231 vehicles per day from the end of the Route30 overlap to the intersection with Blue Ridge Road (CR84). South of this intersection, traffic is reduced further to 350 until the hamlet of Minerva, rising to 751 south of Minerva until near the Warren county line. Traffic increases back up to 1,248 vehicles per day from there to Route28 in North Creek.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Collector</b> <b>roads</b> {{can vary}} widely in appearance. Some urban {{collectors}} are wide boulevards entering communities or connecting sections. Others are residential streets, which are typically wider than local roads, although few are wider than four lanes. Small-scale commercial areas {{can be found}} on <b>collector</b> <b>roads</b> in residential areas. Key community functions such as schools, churches, and recreational facilities can often be found on <b>collector</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Speed {{limits are}} {{typically}} 20‑35 mph (or 30‑55 km/h) on <b>collector</b> <b>roads</b> in built-up areas, {{depending on the}} degree of development and frequency of local access, intersections, and pedestrians, as well as the surrounding area (the speed tends to be lowest in a school zone).

5|$|A two-laned Ninth Line curves {{northeast}} after {{crossing and}} being crossed by two separate railway tracks (the Canadian Pacific (CP) Havelock Subdivision and the Canadian National Halton subdivision) and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway, expanding to four lanes and travelling {{along the eastern}} fringe {{of the community of}} Box Grove, alongside which it was built in the mid-2000s. On the west side is a new residential subdivision, while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock subdivision, which the road parallels, is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park. After passing Box Grove Bypass, where for some time the route ended, the road also becomes known as Box Grove <b>Collector</b> <b>Road</b> (BGCR). The route intersects 14th Avenue (York Regional Road71) and continues as before, eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park. It passes a supercenter before an interchange with Highway407, where it crosses over the toll route.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) classifies {{the most}} part of State Highway 1 as a {{national}} strategic road. The exceptions are between Kawakawa and Whangarei and south of Mosgiel, where the SH1 is classified as a regional strategic road, and north of Kawakawa where SH1 is classified as a primary <b>collector</b> <b>road.</b> The sections between Wellsford and Wairakei, between Ohau and Wellington Airport, and between Woodend and Rolleston are classified as high volume roads.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} years, the {{frequency}} of motorcycle collision in Indonesia, especially in Surabaya, is constantly increasing. This article will explain {{the use of the}} Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to estimate motorcycle collision on <b>collector</b> <b>roads</b> in Surabaya. This study uses GAMs with Gaussian distribution and logarithmic link function, as well as application of software R in data processing. The case study takes place on urban roads in Surabaya, Indonesia. In this study, 69 <b>roads</b> of 120 <b>collector</b> <b>roads</b> in Surabaya are selected. The final model of this study indicates the relationship between {{the frequency of}} motorcycle collision on <b>collector</b> <b>roads</b> with explanatory variables which consists of traffic volume, road length, accessibility, road width, number of lanes, and traffic speed. Increasing values of explanatory variables in the prediction model lead to increased risk of accidents. These findings are expected to be considered in programs planned to reduce motorcycle collision on <b>collector</b> <b>roads</b> in Surabaya and other cities...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{suburban}} system, most trips from one component to another component requires that cars enter a <b>collector</b> <b>road,</b> {{no matter how}} short or long the distance is.

Because all traffic is forced onto these roads, they are often heavy with traffic all day. If a traffic crash occurs on a <b>collector</b> <b>road,</b> or if road construction inhibits the flow, then the entire road system may be rendered useless until the blockage is cleared.
