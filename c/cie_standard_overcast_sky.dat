40|$|The angular {{distribution}} of diffuse {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) was characterised in the open and beneath deciduous and conifer forests in Quebec and British Columbia, Canada, under <b>overcast</b> and clear <b>sky</b> conditions, using a restricted field of view light sensor and hemispherical canopy photographs. The {{angular distribution}} of PAR was described by the relative light reading (RLR). In the open on overcast days, light was best characterized using the <b>standard</b> <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> distribution with the light intensity at the zenith set to {{four to five times}} greater than the light intensity at the horizon. RLR under forest stands was found to decrease with decreasing elevation angles under both <b>overcast</b> and clear <b>sky</b> conditions. Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands transmitted more light from a relatively wider angle around the zenith than the spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss and Picea mariana (Mill.)

RLR estimated with the hemispherical canopy photographs (RLR hc_corr) generally provided a comparable prediction of the effect of the canopy composition on the angular distribution of PAR...|$|R

40|$|The average {{daylight}} {{factor is}} one of the most widely used methods for predicting the internal illuminance due to daylight. It is a simple tool that can be used in the early stages of design and can give information about the luminous environment inside a room. This method is supposed to be used under <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> conditions. Expanding the use of the average daylight factor to other sky conditions will encourage the use of daylight in buildings. Several methods have been proposed for the prediction of daylight based on the <b>CIE</b> <b>Standard</b> General Sky. However, most of these methods aimed for a detailed estimation of the internal illuminance pattern. This paper aims to investigate the potential for using the average daylight factor method under the ISO/CIE Standard General Sky. 1...|$|R

40|$|Sky {{luminance}} {{distribution is}} one of the most important quantities for predicting indoor daylight illuminance levels. Overcast-sky types are essential because they are used in more general sky models and appear quite frequent in some places. This paper presents the work on the evaluation of six worldwide overcast-sky models against two-year (1999 - 2000) measured Hong Kong sky luminance data. Overcast-sky conditions were identified using cloud cover (CLD) and a subsequent interpretation the overcast skies into thin and heavy overcast types was conducted in conjunction with the clearness index (Kt). A statistical analysis of the models has indicated that the International Commission on Illumination (<b>CIE)</b> <b>standard</b> <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> model performed the best, in particular for the heavy overcast-sky condition. The Building Research Establishment (BRE) quasi-overcast-sky model showed a good agreement with the thin overcast distributions which may include a circumstance component and the sky luminance patterns being orientation dependent. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed that calculates the total quantity of daylight provided to an arbitrary place in a room by direct incident daylight, by reflected daylight from opposite buildings and ground, and by interreflected daylight from walls, ceilings and floors. Input data include the geometry of the room, the reflection coefficients of walls, ceiling, and floor, and {{the dimensions of the}} building itself and surrounding buildings. The program calculates daylight levels at all relevant places in the room. The calculation of reflected light is based on view factors and total exchange factors between rectangular surfaces, and we assume that all light is reflected diffusely from all surfaces. Using this approach we can compute the influence of reflectances from surfaces whose colors differ from that of the wall (such as doors). The program contains the formulae describing the distribution of sky luminance for <b>CIE</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Overcast</b> <b>Sky</b> [1] and CIE Standard Cloudless Sky [2]. For a cloudless sky, the program computes the shadow patterns of the surrounding buildings. It is also possible to calculate the illuminance provided by artificial lighting. ?? 1984...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} solarcalc 7. 0, a new {{implementation of}} a computer program designed {{for the analysis of}} hemispherical photographs. Our aim was to recode, optimize, enhance and recompile the previous version of solarcalc program using Realbasic, a modern, cross-platform BASIC language programming environment. The main improvements of the new version are described as follows: Programming and layout - a revision and enhancement of the original source code in a new, redesigned and user-friendly interface; Calculations - the possibility of allowing calculations for a growing season length, the possibility of defining the number of zenith and azimuth angles used for the calculations, the calculations of direct, indirect and total site factors, the inclusion of two versions of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Overcast</b> (SOC) <b>sky</b> weighting formula, the ability to compute leaf area index using two different methods and to compute the sky view factor, the ability to compute the total daily extraterrestrial radiation, the capacity of handling grayscale and color images and to manually or automatically threshold the images. The performance of the new version of solarcalc was assessed using a series of hemispherical images taken along a light gradient. Comparisons of calculated canopy light and structural indices between the new version of the program and gla (Gap Light Analyser) show highly significant positive correlations (R 2 = 1. 00), indicating that solarcalc performs similarly to gla across a variety of forest canopy openings. The incorporated modifications in the new version of the program allows for more detailed and more versatile analyses of hemispherical photographs and as such, represent a significant improvement in comparison with the previous version of the program. Finally, one of the most salient feature of solarcalc compared to other similar software is the possibility of using compiled versions of the program compatible with Macintosh, Windows and Linux/Unix operating systems, localised in English, French and Spanish languages. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of polarization in the <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> has been practically unknown. Earlier the polarization {{of light from}} heavily <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> (when the Sun's disc was invisible) has been measured only sporadically in some celestial points by point-source polarimetry. What kind of patterns of the degree p and angle a of linear polarization of light could develop after transmission through {{a thick layer of}} ice or water clouds? To answer this question, we measured the p and a patterns of numerous totally <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> on the Arctic Ocean and in Hungary by full-sky imaging polarimetry. We present here our finding that depending on the optical thickness of the cloud layer, the pattern of a of light transmitted through the ice or water clouds of totally <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> is qualitatively the same as the a pattern of the clear <b>sky.</b> Under <b>overcast</b> conditions the value of a is determined predominantly by scattering on cloud particles themselves. Nevertheless, the degrees of linear polarization of light from <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> were rather low (p <= 16 %). Our results obtained under overcast conditions complete the earlier findings that the a pattern of the clear sky also appears in partly cloudy, foggy, and smoky skies. Our results show that the celestial {{distribution of}} the direction of polarization is a very robust pattern being qualitatively always the same under all possible sky conditions. This is of great importance for the orientation of polarization-sensitive animals based on sky polarization under conditions when the Sun is not visible. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Aerosol {{indirect}} effects {{are some of}} the largest uncertainties of anthropogenic climate change. To estimate the first aerosol indirect radiative effect (or cloud albedo effect), we analyzed global solar irradiance measurements under completely <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> during the recent period of aerosol optical depth decline in Europe. Although measurements from 15 Swiss and 8 northern German sites show clear evidence for an aerosol direct radiative effect under cloud-free skies, trends of transmitted solar irradiance (SWtran) under <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> are ambiguous. Time series from 1981 to 2005 of SWtran for all overcast conditions show slightly negative, but non-significant trends. SWtran under overcast conditions with “thick ” clouds (SWtran smaller than the long term mean) exhibits on average an increasing trend of + 0. 29 [+ 0. 01 to + 0. 57] Wm- 2 / decade. The increase of SWtran under “thick ” <b>overcast</b> <b>skies,</b> however, is about 9 times smaller than the increase under cloud-free skies. Since cirrus clouds are generally excluded from and low-level stratiform clouds are more frequently represented by “thick ” <b>overcast</b> <b>skies,</b> the slight increase in SWtran may possibly result from a weak aerosol indirect effect. Alternatively, the increase in SWtran may be due to a decreasing trend in low-level stratiform cloud amount under overcast conditions observed for these sites. W...|$|R

The data from each cycle were used to calculate daily evaporation from the Idso-Jackson equation and from two other standard methods, the modified Penman and plane of zero-flux. All three methods resulted in similar estimates of evaporation under clear sky conditions; however, under <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> conditions, evaporation fluxes computed from the Idso-Jackson equation were consistently lower than the other two methods. The shortwave albedo values in the Idso-Jackson equation were then replaced with radar reflectivities and a new set of total daily evaporation fluxes were calculated.
