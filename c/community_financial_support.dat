Understanding why LoC events occur and why there are apparent differences between aircraft types is currently under investigation by Brunel Flight Safety Laboratory (BFSL). Using a case study approach for selected light aircraft used in the training environment and based upon a 29 year study of UK fatal accidents, BFSL undertook a qualitative and quantitative review of fatal stall/spin accidents using a combination of statistical and qualitative analysis. Aircraft/model design differences and published material were reviewed with respect to performance and handling qualities for possible clues, and informal interviews were conducted with type-experienced students, pilots and flying instructors. A flight test programme was executed using multiple examples (for fleet-wide attributes) of aircraft models to enable assessment and comparison of flying qualities (both qualitatively and quantitatively). Working within the continuous budget constraints of academia, a creative and cost effective flight test programme was developed without compromising safety. The two-man team (TP & FTE) used standard (unmodified) flying club and syndicate aircraft in conjunction with non-invasive low cost flight test instrumentation. Tests included apparent longitudinal (static and dynamic) stability and control characteristics, stall and low-speed handling characteristics and cockpit ergonomics / pilot workload. During this programme, adaptations were also made to the classic Cooper-Harper “point tracking” method towards a “boundary avoidance” method. The paper describes tools and techniques used, research findings, the team's lessons learned and proposed future research. It also discusses the possible application of research results in aircraft, pilot and environmental causal factors, enabling a better understanding of LoC incidents and future avoidance within the light aircraft <b>community.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>support</b> from the Thomas Gerald Gray Charitable Trust Research Scholarship Scheme was used in this study...|$|E
40|$|CRISPR-Cas 9 {{technology}} {{can be used to}} engineer precise genomic deletions with pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). This approach has been widely adopted for diverse applications, from disease modelling of individual loci, to parallelized loss-of-function screens of thousands of regulatory elements. However, no solution has been presented for the unique bioinformatic design requirements of CRISPR deletion. We here present CRISPETa, a pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model. Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target, and any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making CRISPETa equally useful for focussed or high-throughput studies. Fast run-times are achieved using a pre-computed off-target database. sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. We present pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of protein-coding and non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. In human cells, we reproducibly observe deletion efficiencies of ≥ 50 % for CRISPETa designs targeting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the MALAT 1 oncogene. In the latter case, deletion results in production of desired, truncated RNA. CRISPETa will be useful for researchers seeking to harness CRISPR for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.

In the Methods part, in the Design and Cloning of Plasmids section, a sentence was included incorrectly. The correct sentence can be found below/n/n"The Insert- 2 sequence was previously assembled from four 5 '-phosphorilated oligonucleotides (IDT) ". /n/nPlease also note in table S 3 The oligo pDECKO_seq_R is lacking one nucleotide. The correct sequence is ATGTCTACTATTCTTTCCCCBackground. CRISPR genome-editing technology makes it possible to quickly and cheaply delete non-protein-coding regulatory elements. We present a vector system adapted for this purpose called DECKO (Double Excision CRISPR Knockout), which applies a simple two-step cloning to generate lentiviral vectors expressing two guide RNAs (gRNAs) simultaneously. The key feature of DECKO is its use of a single 165 bp starting oligonucleotide carrying the variable sequences of both gRNAs, making it fully scalable from single-locus studies to complex library cloning. /nResults. We apply DECKO to deleting the promoters of one protein-coding gene and two oncogenic lncRNAs, UCA 1 and the highly-expressed MALAT 1, focus of many previous studies employing RNA interference approaches. DECKO successfully deleted genomic fragments ranging in size from 100 to 3000 bp in four human cell lines. Using a clone-derivation workflow lasting approximately 20 days, we obtained 9 homozygous and 17 heterozygous promoter knockouts in three human cell lines. Frequent target region inversions were observed. These clones have reductions in steady-state MALAT 1 RNA levels of up to 98 % and display reduced proliferation rates. /nConclusions. We present a dual CRISPR tool, DECKO, which is cloned using a single starting oligonucleotide, thereby affording simplicity and scalability to CRISPR knockout studies of non-coding genomic elements, including long non-coding RNAs.

40|$|Background Continued {{management}} of sanitation and hygiene services, post-intervention, {{is a global}} challenge, particularly in the school-setting. This situation threatens anticipated impacts of school sanitation and hygiene investments. To improve programming and policies, and increase the effectiveness of limited development resources, we seek to understand how and why some schools have well-managed sanitation post-intervention, while others do not. Methods Based on in-depth qualitative data from 16 case schools in Meherpur, Bangladesh, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions, or combinations of conditions (referred to as pathways), that lead to either well-managed or poorly managed school sanitation. We include posited sustainability determinants from the literature and factors {{that emerged from the}} cases themselves in the analysis. Results We identified three distinct pathways sufficient to support well-managed services, providing multiple options for how well-managed school sanitation could be encouraged. Two of these are applicable to both government and non-government schools: (1) quality construction, <b>financial</b> <b>community</b> <b>support</b> and a champion; and (2) quality construction, <b>financial</b> government <b>support,</b> a maintenance plan and school management committee involvement. On-going <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> for operations and maintenance was identified as a necessary condition for continued service management, which was absent from many schools with poorly managed services. However, <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> was insufficient alone and other conditions are needed in conjunction, including quality construction and incentivizing conditions, such as school management committee involvement in sanitation specifically, a sanitation champion, and/or one teacher clearly responsible for toilet maintenance. Surprisingly, the number of students per toilet (ranging from 18 – 95 students) and toilet age (ranging from 8 – 32 months) had no significant effect on sanitation conditions. Conclusions Findings corroborate those from a similar study in Belize, and comparison suggests the need for <b>financial</b> <b>community</b> <b>support</b> and the possibly tenuous reliance on local champions in the absence of adequate government support for operations and maintenance. Sub-determinants to the necessary conditions are also discussed which have implications for school sanitation in Bangladesh and may have broader relevance for other low-income countries though further research is needed...|$|R

Results from both Johansen’s (J Econ Dyn Control 12 : 231 – 254, 1988) and Toda and Yamamoto’s (J Econom 66 : 225 – 250, 1995) methodologies are quite consistent. For the first six decades of the 20 th century, a sub-period characterised by an inward oriented trade policy, we find that growth is fairly independent of foreign trade. This outcome contrasts with findings for the sub-period after the Stabilisation and Liberalisation Plan (1959), where a causal network among variables is supported.
