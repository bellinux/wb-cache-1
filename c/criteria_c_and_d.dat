40|$|Abstract Background Overviews of {{systematic}} reviews attempt to systematically retrieve and summarise {{the results of}} multiple systematic reviews. Methods for conducting, interpreting and reporting overviews are in their infancy. To date, {{there has been no}} evidence map of the methods used in overviews, thus making it difficult to determine the gaps and priorities for methods research. Our objectives were to develop and populate a comprehensive framework of methods for conducting, interpreting and reporting overviews (stage I) and to create an evidence map by mapping studies that have evaluated overview methods to the framework (stage II). Methods We searched methods collections (e. g. Cochrane Methodology Register, Meth 4 ReSyn library, AHRQ Effective Health Care Program) to identify eligible studies for both stages of this research. In stage I, cross-sectional studies, guidance documents and commentaries that described methods proposed for, or used in, overviews were used to develop and populate the framework of methods. Drafts and multiple iterations of the framework were discussed and refined by all authors. In stage II, we identified and described studies evaluating overview methods and mapped these evaluations to the framework. Results In this paper, we present results for the four initial steps of conducting an overview: (a) specification of the purpose, objectives and scope, (b) specification of the eligibility <b>criteria,</b> (<b>c)</b> search methods <b>and</b> (<b>d)</b> data extraction. Twenty-nine studies mentioned or described methods relevant to {{one or more of these}} steps. In the developed framework, identified methods and approaches were grouped according to the steps an overview author would need to undertake. Fifteen studies evaluated identified methods, all of which mapped to the search methods step. These studies either reported the development and evaluation of a new search filter to retrieve systematic reviews or compared the performance of multiple filters. Conclusion Gaps in the evaluation of methods were found for the majority of steps in the framework. More empirical studies are needed to evaluate the methods outlined and provide a comprehensive evidence map. The framework is useful for planning these evaluations and for planning methods required to deal with challenges that arise when conducting an overview...|$|R

40|$|Water {{availability}} is {{the most}} influential factor affecting plant carbon (<b>d</b> 13 <b>C)</b> <b>and</b> nitrogen (<b>d</b> 15 N) isotope composition in arid and semi-arid environments. However, there are potential differences among locations and/or species in the sensitivity of plant <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 15 N to variation in precipitation, which are important for using stable isotope signatures to extract paleo-vegetation and paleo-climate information. We measured <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 15 N of plant and soil organic matter (SOM) samples collected from 64 locations across a precipitation gradient with an isotherm in northern China. <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 15 N for both <b>C</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>C</b> 4 plants decreased significantly with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP). The sensitivity of d 13 C to MAP in C 3 plants (- 0. 660. 07 %/ 100 mm) was {{twice as high as}} that in C 4 plants (20. 360. 08 %/ 100 mm). Species differences in the sensitivity of plant <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 15 N to MAP were not observed among three main dominant plants. SOM became depleted in 13 C with increasing MAP, while no significant correlations existed between d 15 N of SOM and MAP. We conclude that water availability is the primary environmental factor controlling the variability of plant <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 15 N <b>and</b> soil <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> in the studied arid and semi-arid regions.
