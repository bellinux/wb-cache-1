40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation of an improved electro-thermal micromachined pump for drug delivery applications. Thermal actuators, which are a type of Micro Electro Mechanical system (MEMS) device, are highly useful because {{of their ability to}} deliver with great force and displacement. Thus, our structure is based on a thermal actuator that exploits the Joule heating effect and has been improved using the springy length properties of MEMS chevron beams. The Joule heating effect results in a difference in temperature and therefore displacement in the beams (actuators). Simulation results show that a maximum force of 4. 4 mN and a maximum flow rate of 16 μL/min can be obtained by applying an AC voltage as low as 8 V at different frequencies ranging from 1 to 32 Hz. The maximum temperature was a problem at the chevron beams and the <b>center</b> <b>shaft.</b> Thus, to locally increase the temperature of the chevron beams alone and not that of the pumping diaphragm: (1) The air gaps 2 μm underneath and above the device layer were optimized for heat transfer.
