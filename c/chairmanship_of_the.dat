5|$|After Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate in 1981, Mathias sought the <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Committee but was relegated to the {{relatively}} mundane <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted {{a seat on the}} influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E

He became Commander-in-Chief of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces two years later, and in 1973, became {{the head of the}} PLO's political department.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{experience}} in the militia, service with the 22nd Massachusetts, and <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Military Affairs Committee provided him with more practical military knowledge and training than any other Senator. He made use of this experience throughout the war to frame, explain, defend and advocate for legislation on military matters, including enlistment of soldiers and sailors, and organizing and supplying the rapidly expanding Union Army and Union Navy.|$|E
5|$|During 1965 and 1966, {{he served}} as the Speaker of the House, {{surprising}} observers by winning that post. Gravel convinced former Speaker Warren A. Taylor to not try for the position against him by promising Taylor <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rules Committee, then reneged on the promise. Gravel denied later press charges that he had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships. As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees and feuded with Alaska State Senate president Robert J. McNealy.|$|E

50|$|Four {{incumbent}} Republicans were {{challenged in}} primaries that centered around Gov. McDonnell's controversial transportation funding overhaul that imposed a $1.2 {{billion per year}} tax increase. 34 House Republicans voted for the bill, causing an uproar amongst conservatives. No sitting Republican delegate had faced a primary challenge since 2005. In the June 11, 2013 primary, two veteran Republicans who supported the transportation plan were defeated: businessman Dave LaRock beat 33rd District Del. Joe T. May 57%-43%, and physician Mark Berg ousted 29th District Del. Beverly Sherwood by a 51%-49% margin. Both May and Sherwood held committee chairmanships; their ouster opens <b>the</b> <b>chairmanships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transportation Committee (chaired by May) and the Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee (chaired by Sherwood). House Speaker Bill Howell and Del. Bobby Orrock handily defeated their primary challengers.|$|R
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure {{that would have allowed}} collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E
5|$|His {{confrontations}} with conservatives cost him several leadership {{positions in the}} Senate, including <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Committee. Despite isolation from his conservative colleagues, Mathias played an influential role in fostering African American civil rights, ending the Vietnam War, preserving the Chesapeake Bay, and constructing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He retired from the Senate in 1987, having served in Congress for twenty-six years (eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives and eighteen years in the U.S. Senate).|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to cover all units of measure, not just length and mass and in 1933 the 8th CGPM resolved {{to work with other}} international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement, the Consultative Committee for Units, has representatives from many international organisations including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIPM.|$|E
40|$|Most UK {{companies}} separate <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> CEO and Chairman. The former {{runs the}} company and the latter runs the board. Using turnover data on 2, 180 separate <b>Chairmanships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top 460 UK firms over the 1990 - 1998 period, I find that the Chairman {{is more likely to be}} replaced when the CEO is dismissed. Detailed data on the dismissal events suggests that Chairman replacement is associated with board restructuring. This may be necessary to bring in different skills and experience which, in turn, might facilitate changes in future corporate decisions. Moreover, I find that the Chairman's previous position, or <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>Chairmanship,</b> does not affect the association between Chairman removal and CEO dismissal. But, the increase in <b>the</b> dismissal likelihood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chairman at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> forced CEO departure is higher when she is involved in <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failing CEO. This, in turn, can be interpreted as an indication of effective governance. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2005. ...|$|R
50|$|Except for {{the second}} and third {{committee}}, all committee chairmen were elected on 10 April.

50|$|Bethard was <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Annie Shirley Edgerton (1897-1977), a Coushatta native, and the {{attorney}} Henry W. Bethard, Jr. (1898-1961), originally from Harrisonburg in Catahoula Parish in eastern Louisiana. A graduate of Loyola University New Orleans School of Law, Bethard, Jr., established his law practice in Coushatta in 1922. Bethard joined his father's firm in 1948, upon receipt of his Juris Doctor degree from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Among his civic roles were <b>the</b> <b>chairmanships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bank <b>of</b> Coushatta and <b>the</b> commissioner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana State Library, the latter position filled from 1947 to 1951.

5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} Democratic party whip, serving under party leader Lyndon B. Johnson. In addition, he retained his <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate Democratic Reelection Committee for the 1954 election cycle. He and Democratic National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell {{agreed that the}} two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations {{in order to maximize}} donations for Democratic candidates. Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having his committee provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Kistiakowsky {{was active}} in an antiwar organization, the Council for a Livable World.

5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman.

50|$|Article 148 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{constitution}} {{stipulates that}} the prime minister shall act as <b>the</b> representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet as a whole, delegate its agendas, coordinate <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> ministers, ensure <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> policy adopted by the cabinet, and issue regulations. Additionally, the prime minister acts as <b>the</b> superior <b>of</b> all civil servants. The prime minister is further assisted by a deputy prime minister (or ministers), who will act as a vice-president within <b>the</b> council <b>of</b> ministers. <b>The</b> make-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet, its distributed portfolios and its governing style, however, very much depends on the premier's personality. He or she cannot, however, hold the presidency nor any other high state office, such as <b>the</b> <b>chairmanships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Chamber <b>of</b> Control, <b>the</b> National Bank <b>of</b> Poland, or <b>the</b> Ombudsman for Citizens Rights, simultaneously.

5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican {{resolution}} was put forth {{to force him}} out of his chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the <b>Chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board of directors.|$|E
5|$|Co-founded in 1895 by Lim Nee Soon, Gan Eng Seng and Lim Boon Keng, the three-storey high Ee Hoe Hean Club was {{originally}} located on Duxton Hill but moved to Bukit Pasoh Road in 1925. The club was a social-cum-business club where like-minded Chinese businessmen could mingle and exchange ideas. Members such as Teo Eng Hock, Tan Chor Nam and Lim Nee Soon were {{actively involved in}} the Xinhai Revolution and later the establishment of the Republic of China. Among the more famous visitors to its clubhouse included Sun Yat-sen and Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1923, when Chinese businessman, community leader and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee, known as the Rubber King of Singapore and Malaya, assumed <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club, its focus shifted from being a purely social and business club to one that was politically active.|$|E
50|$|Committee {{positions}} are allocated when new parliaments are seated.
