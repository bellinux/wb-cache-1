40|$|FIFTY-THREE {{cases of}} wounds of the sclera and other coats {{of the eye}} exposing the vitreous, were {{collected}} chiefly from Sir John Parsons ' clinic at Moorfields; of these eighteen were {{in the region of}} the limbus and thirty-five were purely scleral wounds. The period covered was from 1905 to 1931. The above numbers do not include sixteen cases where the injury was so extensive that imme-diate excision was the only possible treatment. In the present investigation special attention was paid to the question of immediate infection. It was found that no case of acute infection was observed when the wound was scleral exposing the vitreous. Threatened sympathetic ophthalmitis occurred in five cases, four of which were injuries in the region of the ciliary body, and one was scleral [...] This is in accordance with the accepted view of the greater liability to sympathetic infection in the case of wounds involving the <b>ciliary</b> <b>region...</b>|$|E
40|$|Photolysis of caged {{compounds}} {{allows the}} production of rapid and localized increases in the concentration of various physiologically active compounds(1). Caged compounds are molecules made physiologically inactive by a chemical cage that can be broken by a flash of ultraviolet light. Here, we show how to obtain patch-clamp recordings combined with photolysis of caged compounds {{for the study of}} olfactory transduction in dissociated mouse olfactory sensory neurons. The process of olfactory transduction (Figure 1) takes place in the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons, where odorant binding to receptors leads to the increase of cAMP that opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels(2). Ca entry through CNG channels activates Ca-activated Cl channels. We show how to dissociate neurons from the mouse olfactory epithelium(3) and how to activate CNG channels or Ca-activated Cl channels by photolysis of caged cAMP(4) or caged Ca(5). We use a flash lamp(6, 7) to apply ultraviolet flashes to the <b>ciliary</b> <b>region</b> to uncage cAMP or Ca while patch-clamp recordings are taken to measure the current in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration(8 - 11) ...|$|E
40|$|Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart defects in humans. Despite several studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in ventricular septum (VS) development, very little is known about VS-forming signaling. We observed perimembranous and muscular VSDs in Fantom (Ftm) -negative mice. Since Ftm is a ciliary protein, we investigated presence and function of cilia in murine hearts. Primary cilia could be detected at distinct positions in atria and ventricles at embryonic days (E) 10. 5 – 12. 5. The loss of Ftm leads to shortened cilia and a reduced proliferation in distinct atrial and ventricular <b>ciliary</b> <b>regions</b> at E 11. 5. Consequently, wall thickness is diminished in these areas. We suggest that ventricular proliferation is regulated by cilia-mediated Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (Pdgfra) signaling. Accordingly, we propose that primary cilia govern the cardiac proliferation which is essential for proper atrial and ventricular wall development and hence for the fully outgrowth of the VS. Thus, our study suggests ciliopathy as a cause of VSDs...|$|R

40|$|Iris {{localization}} is {{a critical}} step for an iris recognition system because it directly affects the recognition rates. Consequently, {{in order to have}} reasonably accurate measures, we should estimate as many iris boundaries as possible which are defined by papillary and <b>ciliary</b> <b>regions.</b> Due to the contraction which is an intrinsic propriety of the pupil and the variations in the shooting angle, the pupil will not be a regular circle. So an active contour is suitable to accurately locate the iris boundaries. In this paper we focused on iris/pupil boundary and we proposed a new algorithm based on an active contour without edges applied in gray level image. First, we develop a new method to locate and fill the corneal reflection which is used not only to remove the highlight points that appear inside the pupil but also as an initial contour generator for the snake. Second, we propose to use the active contour without edges for precise pupil segmentation. This kind of snake can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient. Our algorithm seems to be robust to occlusion, specular reflection, variation in illumination and improves its efficiency in precision and time computation compared with AIPF and Gvf active contour. Another advantage is that the initial curve can be anywhere in the image and the contour will be automatically detected. The proposed algorithm is 2. 36 faster than GVF snake-based method for accurate pupil contour detection and integrodifferential method with accuracy up to 99. 62 % using CASIA iris database V 3. 0 and up to 100 % with CASIA iris database V 1. 0...|$|R

Ophthalmoscopy revealed a pigmented mass arising from the nasal ciliary body of the right eye and extending around the posterior surface of the lens, and there were pigmented particles in the vitreous. Examination of the enucleated globe showed a circumscribed, black, dense and symmetrically ovoid mass with sessile attachment to the nasal <b>ciliary</b> <b>region</b> and extension to posterior lens capsule, vitreous and along the vitreal face of the detached retina to the optic papilla. The mass was composed of heavily pigmented, plump, polyhedral cells that invaded the vitreous and the inner limiting membrane of peripapillary retina and optic papilla.

We have explored the possibility that changes in cornea 1 curvature are due to changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) during accommodation. In an in &o preparation we demonstrate that increasing the pressure will tend to flatten the cornea. We have used electrical stim~ation of the anger-Withal (EW) nucleus to further test the pressure hypothesis in t&o by recording IOP changes in the eye during EW-stimulated accommodation and by artificially modulating the IOP to assess the effects on cornea 1 curvature. During EW stimulation there {{is an increase in}} IOP on the order of l- 3 mmHg which tends to llatten the curvature of the cornea, thus e~minating changes in IOP as a possible rn~ha~ ~ of cornea 1 accommodation. Slit-lamp observations of accommodative changes at the corneo-scleral margin and electrical stimulation of dissected eyes in vitro indicate that cornea 1 accommodation is mediated by a contraction of the ciliary muscles, which exerts a pull on the inner lamella of the cornea, flattening the peripheral cornea and increasing the curvature of the central cornea. ~stological examination of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>region</b> of the eye confirms the appropriate positioning of the cillary muscles.

40|$|Background Currently, {{there is}} limited {{knowledge}} about the genetics underlying pigmentary traits in East Asian populations. Here, we report {{the results of the}} first genome-wide association study of pigmentary traits (skin and iris color) in individuals of East Asian ancestry. Methods We obtained quantitative skin pigmentation measures (M-index) in the inner upper arm of the participants using a portable reflectometer (N =  305). Quantitative measures of iris color (expressed as L*, a* and b* CIELab coordinates) were extracted from high-resolution iris pictures (N =  342). We also measured the color differences between the pupillary and <b>ciliary</b> <b>regions</b> of the iris (e. g., iris heterochromia). DNA samples were genotyped with Illumina’s Infinium Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA) and imputed using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 samples as reference haplotypes. Results For skin pigmentation, we did not observe any genome-wide significant signal. We followed-up in three independent Chinese samples the lead SNPs of five regions showing multiple common markers (minor allele frequency ≥ 5 %) with good imputation scores and suggestive evidence of association (p-values < 10 − 5). One of these markers, rs 2373391, which is located in an intron of the ZNF 804 B gene on chromosome 7, was replicated in one of the Chinese samples (p =  0. 003). For iris color, we observed genome-wide signals in the OCA 2 region on chromosome 15. This signal is driven by the non-synonymous rs 1800414 variant, which explains 11. 9 %, 10. 4 % and 6 % of the variation observed in the b*, a* and L* coordinates in our sample, respectively. However, the OCA 2 region was not associated with iris heterochromia.

40|$|Cilia are plasma {{membrane}} protrusions {{that act as}} cellular propellers or antennae. To perform these functions, cilia must maintain a composition distinct {{from those of the}} contiguous cytosol and {{plasma membrane}}. The specialized composition of the cilium depends on the <b>ciliary</b> gate, the <b>region</b> at the <b>ciliary</b> base separating the cilium {{from the rest of the}} cell. The ciliary gate’s main structural features are electron dense struts connecting microtubules to the adjacent membrane. These structures include the transition fibers, which connect the distal basal body to the base of the ciliary membrane, and the Y-links, which connect the proximal axoneme and ciliary membrane within the transition zone. Both transition fibers and Y-links form early during ciliogenesis and play key roles in ciliary assembly and trafficking. Accordingly, many human ciliopathies are caused by mutations that perturb ciliary gate function. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mutations in Nek 1 (NIMA-Related Kinase 1) are causal in the murine {{models of}} {{polycystic kidney disease}} kat and kat 2 J. The Neks are known as cell cycle kinases, but recent work in protists has {{revealed}} {{that in addition to}} roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression, some Neks also regulate cilia. In most cells, cilia are disassembled prior to mitosis and are regenerated after cytokinesis. We propose that Neks participate in the coordination of ciliogenesis with cell cycle progression. Mammalian Nek 1 is a candidate for this activity because renal cysts form in response to dysfunctional ciliary signalling. Results Here we report that over-expression of full-length mNek 1 inhibited ciliogenesis without disrupting centrosomes in the murine renal epithelial cell line IMCD 3. In contrast, over-expression of the kinase domain with its associated basic region, but without the acidic domain, caused loss of centrosomes. As expected, these cells also failed to grow cilia. Both defective ciliogenesis in response to too much mNek 1 and disassembly of centrosomes in response to expression of the kinase lacking the presumptive regulatory domain was abrogated by kinase-inactivating mutations or by removal of the coiled-coil domain. We observed that kinase-inactive, C-terminal truncations of mNek 1 retaining the coiled-coil domain localized to the cilium, and we define a <b>ciliary</b> targeting <b>region</b> within the coiled-coil domain. Conclusion Based on our data, we propose that Nek 1 plays a role in centrosome integrity, affecting both ciliogenesis and centrosome stability. </p...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that vertebrate olfactory signal transduction is mediated by independent multiple pathways (using cAMP and InsP 3 as second messengers). However, the dual presence of parallel pathways in the olfactory receptor cell is still controversial, {{mainly because of the}} lack of information regarding the single-cell response induced by odorants that have been shown to produce InsP 3 exclusively (but not cAMP) in the olfactory cilia. In this study, we recorded activities of transduction channels of single olfactory receptor cells to InsP 3 -producing odorants. When the membrane potential was held at − 54 mV, application of InsP 3 -producing odorants to the <b>ciliary</b> <b>region</b> caused an inward current. The reversal potential was 0 ± 7 mV (mean ± SD, n = 10). Actually, InsP 3 -producing odorants generated responses in a smaller fraction of cells (lilial, 3. 4 %; lyral, 1. 7 %) than the cAMP-producing odorant (cineole, 26 %). But, fundamental properties of responses were surprisingly homologous; namely, spatial distribution of the sensitivity, waveforms, I-V relation, and reversal potential, dose dependence, time integration of stimulus period, adaptation, and recovery. By applying both types of odorants alternatively to the same cell, furthermore, we observed cells to exhibit symmetrical cross-adaptation. It seems likely that even with odorants with different modalities adaptation occurs completely depending on the amount of current flow. The data will also provide evidence showing that olfactory response generation and adaptation are regulated by a uniform mechanism for a wide variety of odorants...|$|E
40|$|Primary cilia {{are found}} on many {{epithelial}} cell types, including renal tubular epithelial cells, where {{they participate in}} flow sensing. Disruption of cilia function {{has been linked to}} the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease. We demonstrated previously that the exocyst, a highly conserved eight-protein membrane trafficking complex, localizes to primary cilia of renal tubular epithelial cells, is required for ciliogenesis, biochemically and genetically interacts with polycystin- 2 (the protein product of the polycystic kidney disease 2 gene), and, when disrupted, results in MAPK pathway activation both in vitro and in vivo. The small GTPase Cdc 42 is a candidate for regulation of the exocyst at the primary cilium. Here, we demonstrate that Cdc 42 biochemically interacts with Sec 10, a crucial component of the exocyst complex, and that Cdc 42 colocalizes with Sec 10 at the primary cilium. Expression of dominant negative Cdc 42 and shRNA-mediated knockdown of both Cdc 42 and Tuba, a Cdc 42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, inhibit ciliogenesis in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Furthermore, exocyst Sec 8 and polycystin- 2 no longer localize to primary cilia or the <b>ciliary</b> <b>region</b> following Cdc 42 and Tuba knockdown. We also show that Sec 10 directly interacts with Par 6, a member of the Par complex that itself directly interacts with Cdc 42. Finally, we show that Cdc 42 knockdown results in activation of the MAPK pathway, something observed in cells with dysfunctional primary cilia. These data support a model in which Cdc 42 localizes the exocyst to the primary cilium, whereupon the exocyst then targets and docks vesicles carrying proteins necessary for ciliogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Patch clamp {{experiments}} on dissociated olfactory sensory neurons Olfactory sensory neurons were dissociated from the olfactory epithelium of newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) as de-scribed in [12, 13], salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) as in [7] or mice (BALB/c strain) as in [14]. All experiments {{were carried out}} {{in accordance with the}} Italian Guidelines for the Use of Labo-ratory Animals (Decreto Legislativo 27 / 01 / 1992, no. 116). Olfactory sensory neurons were iden-tified by their characteristic bipolar shape and only neurons with clearly visible cilia were used for the experiments. Currents were measured in the whole-cell voltage-clamp mode as previously described [13, 7, 14]. Transduction currents were elicited by odorant, IBMX, the photorelease of cAMP [13, 2] or its non-hydrolyzable form 8 -Br-cAMP [2], and were recorded at a holding poten-tial of- 50 mV. IBMX was dissolved in DMSO at 100 mM and an aliquot was added to the Ringer solution to obtain a final concentration of 0. 1 mM. IBMX was applied to the neurons through a glass micropipette by pressure ejection (Picospritzer, Intracel, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Photolysis of Caged Compounds Caged cAMP (Dojindo, Japan) and BCMCM- 8 -Br-cAMP (provided by V. Hagen, Leibniz-Institut fur Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany, [2]) were dissolved in DMSO.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} the chronology of the appearance and localization of hyaluronic acid (HA) in mouse vitreous during the embryonic and early postnatal {{stages of development}} and in human vitreous during early embryonic development. METHODS. A histochemical method using the specific affinity for HA of a bovine cartilage proteoglycan was used on mouse eyes at embryonic (11 to 18 days) and early postnatal (8 and 18 days) stages. The same technique was applied to human embryonic eyes of 6, 8, 9, and 10 weeks. RESULTS. In the mouse, HA is detected early (12 -day embryo stage) in the equatorial vitreous and in the internal portion of the corresponding retinal epithelium, behind the anterior rim of the optic cup. Later in development, HA staining extends temporarily to the posterior vitreous and to the internal layers of the posterior retinal epithelium. In human embryos, HA staining is clearly visible in the posterior vitreous and in the equatorial vitreous, where it is more intense at all the developmental stages. From the 8 -week stage onward, the internal layers of the developing retina are also heavily stained. CONCLUSIONS. HA appears very early in developing vitreous of mice and humans, and staining is observed first and predominantly in the equatorial portion of the vitreous. In contrast to human embryos, HA staining in the posterior mouse fetal vitreous is only faint and transient. In both species, staining of the internal layers of the retinal epithelium is detected in the presumptive <b>ciliary</b> body <b>region</b> and in the more posterior retina. The observed temporal and regional simultaneous localization of HA staining in the vitreous and the internal layers of the retinal epithelium is suggestive of a possible role for these cells {{in the production of}} the molecule.

40|$|Cilia are microtubule-based {{cellular}} organelles that mediate signal transduction. Cilia {{are organized}} into several structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, the transition zone (TZ), and the cilia shaft. In vertebrates, the cystoprotein Inversin localizes to {{a portion of}} the cilia shaft adjacent to the TZ, a region termed the "Inversin compartment" (InvC). The mechanisms that establish and maintain the InvC are unknown. In the roundworm C. elegans, the cilia shafts of amphid channel and phasmid sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions defined by different microtubule ultrastructure: a proximal doublet-based region adjacent to the TZ, and a distal singlet-based region. It has been suggested that C. elegans cilia also possess an InvC, similarly to mammalian primary cilia. Here we explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C. elegans <b>ciliary</b> doublet <b>region</b> and InvC. We show that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region. nphp- 2 (the C. elegans Inversin homolog) and the doublet region genes arl- 13, klp- 11, and unc- 119 are redundantly required for ciliogenesis. InvC and doublet region genes can be sorted into two modules-nphp- 2 +klp- 11 and arl- 13 +unc- 119 -which are both antagonized by the hdac- 6 deacetylase. The genes of this network modulate the sizes of the NPHP- 2 InvC and ARL- 13 doublet region. Glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components; rather, glutamylation is modulated by nphp- 2, arl- 13, and unc- 119. The ciliary targeting and restricted localization of NPHP- 2, ARL- 13, and UNC- 119 does not require TZ-, doublet region, and InvC-associated genes. NPHP- 2 does require its calcium binding EF hand domain for targeting to the InvC. We conclude that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization...|$|R

In this study, the authors examined selected regions of the anterior segment to localize and determine the content of CD 44 H, a transmembrane multifunctional glycoprotein and the principal receptor of hyaluronan. METHODS. Sections of ethanol-fixed anterior segments of six POAG and six normal postmortem eyes were analyzed by immunostaining with and without the nonionic detergent Triton X- 100, using the CD 44 H monoclonal antibody, and the avidin/biotin complex. They were visualized by Vector VIP svibstrate and were quantitated by computer-aided color image analysis. RESULTS. CD 44 H was expressed in all regions. Statistically significant decreased content of CD 44 H was observed in the POAG regions compared with normal regions—ciliary muscle (P < 0. 001), ciliary stroma (P < 0. 001), anterior iris (P < 0. 05), iris root (P < 0. 05), and trabecular meshwork (P < 0. 05) —and in a subgroup of nonlaser POAG juxtacanalicular connective tissue (P < 0. 05) and trabecular meshwork (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Signaling {{proteins}} {{are often}} sequestered into cellular domains, where different modulator proteins, and potentially lipid environments, ensure efficient signal transduction. How such domains form represents an important, largely unexplored question. Known as the antennae of the cell, cilia are organelles required for many signaling pathways, presenting an {{unique opportunity to}} explore how signal transduction is arranged spatially and regulated dynamically in the cells. Using the AFD thermosensory neurons of C. elegans as the model system, my research investigated the roles of ciliary proteins in regulating a signaling cascade {{closely associated with the}} cilium – the cGMP signaling pathway. I showed that different functional categories of ciliary proteins help establish two contiguous, yet distinct cGMP signaling compartments in the sensory end of AFD neurons. One compartment, a bona fide cilium, is delineated by Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Meckel syndrome (MKS) and nephronophthisis (NPHP) associated proteins at its base, and requires Inversin/NPHP- 2 to anchor a cGMP-gated ion channel within the proximal <b>ciliary</b> <b>region.</b> The other, a subcompartment characterized by profuse microvilli and different lipid environment, is separated from the dendrite by a cellular junction and requires BBS- 8 and DAF- 25 /Ankmy 2 for correct localization of guanylyl cyclases needed for thermosensation. Consistent with a requirement for a membrane diffusion barrier at the subcompartment base, my data revealed the unexpected presence of ciliary transition zone proteins where no canonical transition zone ultrastructure (Y-links) is observed. My results also showed that the ciliary mutants have a reduced ability in moving toward favorable temperatures, a behavior known as thermotaxis. Finally, using a novel conditional knockout method developed during this research, I showed that the cilium acts cell-autonomously for the function of AFD neurons in thermotaxis. Based on the similarities with mammalian photoreceptors, my research suggests that differential compartmentalization of signal transduction components using different classes of ciliary proteins is important for the functions of ciliated sensory neurons...|$|E
40|$|Christopher T Leffler, 1 Tamer M Hadi, 2 Akrithi Udupa, 1 Stephen G Schwartz, 3 Daniel Schwartz 1 1 Department of Ophthalmology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 2 Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center, Knoxville, TN, 3 Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA Objective: To {{determine}} whether, as {{most modern}} historians have written, ancient Greco-Roman authors believed the crystalline lens is positioned {{in the center}} of the eye. Background: Historians have written that statements about cataract couching by Celsus, or perhaps Galen of Pergamon, suggested a centrally located lens. Celsus specifically wrote that a couching needle placed intermediate between the corneal limbus and the lateral canthus enters an empty space, presumed to represent the posterior chamber. Methods: Ancient ophthalmic literature was analyzed to understand where these authors believed the crystalline lens was positioned. In order to estimate where Celsus proposed entering the eye during couching, we prospectively measured the distance from the temporal corneal limbus to the lateral canthus in 30 healthy adults. Results: Rufus of Ephesus and Galen wrote that the lens is anterior enough to contact the iris. Galen wrote that the lens equator joins other ocular structures at the corneoscleral junction. In 30 subjects, half the distance from the temporal corneal limbus to the lateral canthus was a mean of 4. 5 mm (range: 3. 3 – 5. 3 mm). Descriptions of couching by Celsus and others are consistent with pars plana entry of the couching needle. Anterior angulation of the needle would permit contact of the needle with the lens. Conclusion: Ancient descriptions of anatomy and couching do not establish the microanatomic relationships of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>region</b> with any modern degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, ancient authors, such as Galen and Rufus, clearly understood that the lens is located anteriorly. There is little reason to believe that Celsus or other ancient authors held a variant understanding of the anatomy of a healthy eye.
