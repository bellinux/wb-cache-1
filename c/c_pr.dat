The notion of radiation force, that is, the force exerted by an electromagnetic field on matter with which it interacts, is already very old and was originally analyzed by Maxwell.

All intermetallic compounds within this system, already reported in literature, could be confirmed: CdPr, <b>Cd</b> 2 <b>Pr,</b> <b>Cd</b> 3 <b>Pr,</b> <b>Cd</b> 45 <b>Pr</b> 11, <b>Cd</b> 58 <b>Pr</b> 13, <b>Cd</b> 6 <b>Pr</b> and <b>Cd</b> 11 <b>Pr.</b> The corresponding phase boundaries were determined at distinct temperatures. The homogeneity range of the high-temperature allotropic modification of Pr could be determined precisely and a limited solubility of 22. 1 at. % Cd was derived. Additionally, single-crystal X-ray diffraction was employed to investigate structural details of Cd 2 Pr; it is isotypic to the AlB 2 -type structure with a z value of the Cd site of 0. 5.

40|$|International audiencePowders of {{metallic}} oxides (ZrO 2, TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 …) {{are used as}} precursors in ceramic industry or as pigments in paints. Aggregation occurs in the suspension of such particles in water. The most often, the formed aggregates contain few primary particles. The on-line characterization of the suspension is made by spectral turbidimetry, i. e attenuation of a light beam by particles scattering and absorption. In order to analyse the corresponding signal, i. e turbidity, the scattering cross section and anisotropy factor of aggregates are needed. It exists an important literature about the calculation of the light scattering of aggregates. For instance, Xu [1] proposed an exact calculation based on a generalization of the Mie theory. In a previous work [2] we compare the exact value of scattering cross section (C sca) got from Xu’s theory to the corresponding one from the following approximations: Effective Refractive Index (ERI) method, Percival-Berry-Khlebtsov (PBK) method, Anomalous Diffraction (AD) approximation for different aggregates morphology.

The interstitial carbon atoms occupy mainly the 2 b Wyckoff site in the position (1 / 3 2 / 3 ∼ 1 / 2) and also, with a smaller occupancy rate, the Wyckoff site 2 a at (0 0 ∼ 1 / 2). In the magnetic state, the three compounds display predominantly a ferromagnetic behavior with the propagation vector k = [0 0 0]. These results are in agreement with the magnetization measurements, with TC = 10, 30 and 80 K as Curie temperature of Ce 15 Ge 9 <b>C,</b> <b>Pr</b> 15 Ge 9 C and Nd 15 Ge 9 C, respectively. Ce 15 Ge 9 C and Nd 15 Ge 9 C present a ferromagnetic alignment of the R moments along the c-axis and an antiferromagnetic spin arrangement within the (a-b) plane. For Pr 15 Ge 9 C the ferromagnetic contribution is found within the (a-b) plane, as previously observed for the isotypic compound Tb 15 Si 9 C.

A determinant of BS 107 involved in induced systemic resistance (ISR) against SCC 1 was isolated from cell-free culture. ISR bioassay-guided isolation was involved in determining active fractions during chromatography. Mass spectrometry and NMR analyses of the isolated metabolite identified 2 -aminobenzoic acid (2 -AB) as a main ISR determinant. 2 -AB at 2. 3 mM suppressed significantly disease development and exhibited no direct contact inhibition of pathogen. Reverse Transcriptase (RT) -PCR analyses of tobacco leaves revealed up-regulation of the induced resistance marker genes such as PR 1 a, PR 1 <b>c,</b> <b>PR</b> 2 and PR 4 by application of 2 -AB on the root.

40|$|Abstract Background A lumbar {{infusion}} test {{is commonly}} used as a predictive test for patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and for evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt function. Different infusion protocols {{can be used to}} estimate the outflow conductance (C out) or its reciprocal the outflow resistance (R out), with or without using the baseline resting pressure, P r. Both from a basic physiological research and a clinical perspective, {{it is important to understand}} the limitations of the model on which infusion tests are based. By estimating C out using two different analyses, with or without P r, the limitations could be explored. The aim of this study was to compare the C out estimates, and investigate what effect P r had on the results. Methods Sixty-three patients that underwent a constant pressure infusion protocol as part of their preoperative evaluation for normal pressure hydrocephalus, were included (age 70. 3 ± 10. 8 years (mean ± SD)). The analysis was performed without (<b>C</b> excl <b>Pr)</b> and with (<b>C</b> incl <b>Pr)</b> P r. The estimates were compared using Bland-Altman plots and paired sample t -tests (p Results Mean C out for the 63 patients was: <b>C</b> excl <b>Pr</b> = 7. 0 ± 4. 0 (mean ± SD) μl/(s kPa) and <b>C</b> incl <b>Pr</b> = 9. 1 ± 4. 3 μl/(s kPa) and R out was 19. 0 ± 9. 2 and 17. 7 ± 11. 3 mmHg/ml/min, respectively. There was a positive correlation between methods (r = 0. 79, n = 63, p C out = - 2. 1 ± 2. 7 μl/(s kPa) between methods was significant (p R out was 1. 2 ± 8. 8 mmHg/ml/min). The Bland-Altman plot visualized that the variation around the mean difference was similar all through the range of measured values and there was no correlation between Δ C out and C out. Conclusions The difference between C out estimates, obtained from analyses with or without P r, needs to be taken into consideration when comparing results from studies using different infusion test protocols. The study suggests variation in CSF formation rate, variation in venous pressure or a pressure dependent C out as possible causes for the deviation from the CSF absorption model seen in some patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We have {{previously}} shown that cyclin G 1 expression is reduced in fetal hearts after in utero protein restriction (PR) suggesting reduced cardiac cell cycle. However {{no difference in}} cyclin G 1 expression was seen in adult offspring hearts. We hypothesised that the hearts of adult PR group should be under greater stress to maintain cardiac output. We therefore measured brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression in fetal hearts and left ventricles of adult offspring in the control (<b>C)</b> and <b>PR</b> groups because BNP is a marker of left ventricular dysfunction during volume overload or cardiac fibrosis (Nishikimi et al. Cardiovasc Res. 2006). Methods and results: Pregnant CD 1 mice were placed on C (18 % casein) or PR (9 % casein) diet. Fetal hearts were collected on day 12 of gestation (C, n = 11, PR, n = 10) and the left ventricles (LV) of adult offspring at 6 months (C, n = 17, PR, n = 17). Fetal heart BNP mRNA expression relative to unit total RNA as measured by real-time PCR was similar in <b>C</b> and <b>PR</b> (<b>C,</b> 0. 858 F 0. 104 vs. PR, 0. 761 F 0. 096, p =NS).

40|$|During the un{{stratified}} (winter) and stratified (summer) {{periods of}} 1999 and 2000, we examined carbon (C) dynamics {{in the upper}} water column of southern Lake Michigan. We found that (a) bacte-rial respiration (BR) and planktonic respiration (PR) were major sinks for C, (b) C flux through bacteria (CFTB) was diminished in winter because of reduced bacterial production (BP) and increased bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) at colder temper-atures, and (<b>c)</b> <b>PR</b> exceeded primary production (PP) during the spring–summer transition. Draw-down of dissolved organic C (DOC), resuspended organic matter from the lake floor, and riverine organic matter likely provided organic C to com-pensate for this temporal deficit. DOC {{in the water column}} decreased between winter and summer (29 – 91 mg C m 2 d 1) and accounted for 20 %– 53 % of CFTB and 11 %– 33 % of PR. Sediment resuspen-sion events supported elevated winter heterotrophy in the years that they occurred with greatest inten-sities (1998 and 2000) and may be important to interannual variability in C dynamics. Further, riv-erine discharge, containing elevated DOC (5) and dissolved P (10) relative to lake water, peaked in the winter–spring season in southern Lake Michi-gan. Collectively, terrigenous inputs (river, stream, and groundwater discharges; storm water runoff; and atmospheric precipitation) may support ap-proximately 10 %– 20 % of annual in-lake heterot-rophy as well as autotrophy. Terrestrial subsidies likely {{play a key role in}} the C balance of even very large lakes, representing a critical linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

40|$|A DNA vaccine expressing human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) southern African subtype C Gag (pTHGag) and a recombinant baculovirus Pr 55 gag virus-like particle prepared using a subtype <b>C</b> <b>Pr</b> 55 gag protein (Gag VLP) was tested in a prime-boost inoculation regimen in Chacma baboons. The response of five baboons to Gag peptides in a gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay after three pTHGag immunizations ranged from 100 to 515 spot-forming units (s. f. u.) per 106 {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs), whilst the response of two baboons to the Gag VLP vaccine ranged from 415 to 465 s. f. u. per 106 PBMCs. An increase in the Gag-specific response to a range of 775 - 3583 s. f. u. per 106 PBMCs was achieved by boosting with Gag VLPs the five baboons that were primed with pTHGag. No improvement in Gag responses was achieved in this prime-boost inoculation regimen by increasing the number of pTHGag inoculations to six. IFN-γ responses were mapped to several peptides, some of which have been reported to be targeted by PBMCs from HIV- 1 subtype C-infected individuals. Gag VLPs, given as a single-modality regimen, induced a predominantly CD 8 + T-cell IFN-γ response and interleukin- 2 was a major cytokine within a mix of predominantly Th 1 cytokines produced by a DNA-VLP prime-boost modality. The prime-boost inoculation regimen induced high serum p 24 antibody titres in all baboons, which were several fold above that induced by the individual vaccines. Overall, this study demonstrated that these DNA prime/VLP boost vaccine regimens are highly immunogenic in baboons, inducing high-magnitude and broad multifunctional responses, providing support for the development of these products for clinical trials. © 2008 SGM...|$|E
40|$|Coherent and {{incoherent}} scattering cross sections for the elements Al, Cu, Sr, <b>Cd,</b> <b>Pr,</b> Ce, Sm, Pt, Au and Pb have been measured at 14. 93, 17. 44 and 21. 12 KeV K-alpha X-ray energies. Measurements {{have been performed}} using an X-ray tube with a secondary exciter system as the excitation source instead of radioisotopes. Bremsstrahlung radiation from the X-ray tube {{has been used to}} excite nearly monoenergetic X-rays in secondary targets. In order to improve the efficiency of the detection system the excitation source detector and the target assembly were placed in a vacuum chamber and a pressure of 10 (- 2) mbar is maintained throughout the measurements. The coherently and incoherently scattered intensity by the sample into the detector has been detected at an angle of 90 degrees using low energy HP Ge and Si (Li) photon detectors. The present system considerably reduced the scattering and background effects and improved the monochromacy. Experimental scattering cross sections are compared with the normalised integrated cross section based on form factor and {{incoherent scattering}} approximations. The present experimental results do not strongly support any set of theoretical values. More accurate experimental results and extended exact calculations of atomic form factors at more closely spaced values of incident X-ray energies and scattering angles are clearly needed if more meaningful comparison between experiment and theory are to be possible...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{how well}} predictions from the transtheoretical model (TTM) generalized from smoking to diet. Longitudinal data were used from a randomized control trial on reducing dietary fat consumption in adults (n = 1207) recruited from primary care practices. Predictive power was evaluated {{by making a}} priori predictions {{of the magnitude of}} change expected in the TTM constructs of temptation, pros and cons, and 10 processes of change when an individual transitions between the stages of change. Generalizability was evaluated by testing predictions based on smoking data. Three sets of predictions were made for each stage: Precontemplation (PC), Contemplation (<b>C)</b> and Preparation (<b>PR)</b> based on stage transition categories of no progress, progress and regression determined by stage at baseline versus stage at the 12 -month follow-up. Univariate analysis of variance between stage transition groups was used to calculate the effect size [omega squared (ω 2) ]. For diet predictions based on diet data, there was a high degree of confirmation: 92 %, 95 % and 92 % for PC, <b>C</b> and <b>PR,</b> respectively. For diet predictions based on smoking data, 77 %, 79 % and 85 % were confirmed, respectively, suggesting a moderate degree of generalizability. This study revised effect size estimates for future theory testing on the TTM applied to dietary fat...|$|R
