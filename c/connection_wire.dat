25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary <b>connection</b> <b>wire</b> that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{equipment}} can inter-connect two LANs over {{a single}} twisted pair of wires, {{such as the}} Moxa IEX Series, Cisco LRE (Long Reach Ethernet), Enable-IT Ethernet Extender Experts VDSL2, Patton CopperLink or EtherWAN Ethernet Extenders using VDSL technology. Distances of 300 m (1000 feet) at 50 Mbit/s up to 8 km at 128 kbit/s is possible. Westermo DDW products are capable of 10 miles at 30.3Mbit/s using SHDSL technology. Coaxial cable are often permitting higher speeds and larger distances than twisted pair wires.

50|$|If a {{pendulum}} bob is hanging vertically at the North Pole {{and held in}} place, the bob is stationary but is rotating (spinning) with the Earth.

If the rotation of the bob is stopped then the <b>connection</b> <b>wire</b> will twist one turn every day unless there is a connection that is free to rotate (spin) (at either end of the wire or the support structure). If the bob at the North Pole is allowed to continue to rotate (spin) then it will and the wire won't twist one turn in one day.|$|E

30|$|The {{application}} of silver as a cathode conductive material, interconnect wires, and sealing for anode lead connection for a µSOFC was studied. The addition of silver as a cathode conductive layer reduced the cell overpotential {{and increased the}} cell performance. However, {{the results showed that}} silver was also responsible for the cell degradation. Using silver in SOFC stacks reduces system durability. The silver thermal expansion did not match with the thermal expansion of the other cell materials, and therefore, caused damage to the glass sealant. Silver was also found unstable in the dual atmosphere. The results demonstrated that the microstructure of the silver anode lead <b>connection</b> <b>wire</b> changed after it had been exposed to the dual atmosphere, the solid silver wires and the seal became porous. The formation of striation structures and porosity affected the mechanical strength of the Ag interconnect wires.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Laparoscopic {{adjustable}} gastric banding is {{the most}} frequently performed bariatric procedure {{for the treatment of}} morbid obesity and is associated with low morbidity and mortality. Complications related to obesity surgery are rare and their presentation is often non-specific. Thus, it is highly important for physicians who are practising bariatric surgery to be aware of complications described in single-case studies or series when they come across similar complications even years after the primary bariatric operation. Case presentation We report the case of a 47 -year-old Malay woman who was admitted with symptoms and signs suggesting intestinal obstruction five years after gastric band placement. Conclusions In our patient, the band <b>connection</b> <b>wire</b> tube was the cause of both small bowel obstruction and colonic erosion. Computed axial tomography is the cornerstone of the investigation of such patients. After surgical removal of the connecting tube, our patient recovered without sequelae. </p...|$|E

50|$|ARINC 429 is a data {{transfer}} standard for aircraft avionics. It uses a self-clocking, self-synchronizing data bus protocol (Tx and Rx are on separate ports). The physical <b>connection</b> <b>wires</b> are twisted pairs carrying balanced differential signaling. Data words are 32 bits {{in length and}} most messages consist of a single data word. Messages are transmitted at either 12.5 or 100 kbit/s to other system elements that are monitoring the bus messages. The transmitter constantly transmits either 32-bit data words or the NULL state. A single wire pair is limited to one transmitter {{and no more than}} 20 receivers. The protocol allows for self-clocking at the receiver end, thus eliminating the need to transmit clocking data. ARINC 429 is an alternative to MIL-STD-1553.|$|R
40|$|Machine {{controllers}} {{built from}} standardized software parts, {{commonly referred to}} as components or modules, have the greatest potential to reap open architecture benefits – including plug-and-play, reusability and extensibility.

This paper will present a high-level model of component interactions in order to allow component-based machine controllers. Discussion will focus on Functionality, Infrastructure and Connection interfaces for dealing with the common software functionality such as handling normal operation, creation and destruction, parameter manipulation, <b>connection,</b> <b>wiring,</b> licensing, security, registration, binding, discovery, naming, and introspection.

The behavior of such complex feedback webs is difficult to treat analytically by classical mathematics using its tools of partial differential equations and continuous dynamics. Instead, a theoretical understanding of these networks depends on numerical simulations of idealized computer models known as discrete dynamical networks. An example are cellular automata, a powerful yet simple class of network, characterized by a universal rule and uniform nearest neighbor wiring, which are used to study processes in physical systems such as reaction-diffusion 11, and self-organization by the emergence of coherent interacting structures 14.
