5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of <b>congratulations</b> <b>to</b> José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko {{was seen as the}} most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay {{isolated}} helium on Earth {{by treating}} the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite {{with at least}} 10% rare earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun., One of the Lines in the Coronal Spectrum. Preliminary Note|author = Ramsay, William|author-link = William Ramsay|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume = 58|issue = 347–352|pages = 65–67|date = 1895|url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044106280316;view=1up;seq=79|doi = 10.1098/rspl.1895.0006}} These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. It was independently isolated from cleveite {{in the same year}} by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of <b>congratulations</b> <b>to</b> Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.|$|E
