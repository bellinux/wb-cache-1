Cleaning methods should remove <b>contaminants</b> and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential <b>contaminants</b> that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of <b>contaminants.</b>|$|E

30|$|Model 3 : it {{considers}} optimization towards the <b>contaminant</b> source location. The well {{located at the}} beginning of path line from the <b>contaminant</b> source location should have high priority for monitoring. If multiple wells are located near the <b>contaminant</b> source location on the same particle track, the ones near the <b>contaminant</b> sources will have less priority for consideration.|$|R
50|$|Anti-icing of {{aircraft}} {{is accomplished by}} applying a protective layer, using a viscous fluid called anti-ice fluid, over a surface to absorb the <b>contaminant.</b> All anti-ice fluids offer only limited protection, dependent upon frozen <b>contaminant</b> type and prevailing weather conditions. A fluid has failed when it no longer can absorb the <b>contaminant</b> and it essentially becomes a <b>contaminant</b> itself. Even water can be a <b>contaminant</b> in this sense, as it dilutes the anti-icing agent until {{it is no longer}} effective.|$|R
5|$|Barium vapor is {{condensed}} {{and packed}} into molds {{in an atmosphere}} of argon. This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure barium. Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other <b>contaminants</b> contributing less than 0.1%.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of <b>contaminants</b> such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of <b>contaminants</b> in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contaminants</b> {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. <b>Contaminants</b> that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
40|$|In many {{practical}} field problems, {{it may not}} {{be possible}} to identify the actual characteristics (location, magnitude and duration of contamination) of the groundwater <b>contaminant</b> sources. Most of the time, very sparse information regarding spatiotemporal <b>contaminant</b> concentration is available initially, which is inadequate for reliable identification and simulation of the <b>contaminant</b> plume. Simulation of the <b>contaminant</b> plume is necessary to predict the future distribution of the <b>contaminant</b> in the groundwater aquifer. It is also essential for developing an efficient contamination monitoring strategy. To address this practical problem of data inadequacy, an interactive methodology is proposed, incorporating sequential design of optimal monitoring networks. These sequentially developed and implemented monitoring networks provide feedback information on measured concentrations. These measurement information help in progressively improving the prediction of the <b>contaminant</b> plume, starting with very sparse initial information about the <b>contaminant</b> sources and spatial distribution of concentration. A Simulated Annealing (SA) based methodology is developed which utilizes feedback information to sequentially characterize the <b>contaminant</b> plume when adequate initial information regarding the <b>contaminant</b> sources is not available, and the <b>contaminant</b> sources are unknown. It is demonstrated that such an approach is potentially applicable for reliable prediction of <b>contaminant</b> plume movement in groundwater aquifers. The optimal monitoring network design is based on the objective function of minimizing the <b>contaminant</b> mass estimation error. It is shown that the proposed methodology of using feedback information on actual field measurement values from sequentially designed monitoring networks is capable of predicting the contamination plume movement in groundwater aquifers, even when very little initial measurement data are available. This proposed methodology will be very useful for accurate prediction of the <b>contaminant</b> movement in an initially unmonitored aquifer...|$|R

A model trace <b>contaminant</b> gas mixture containing 14 compounds was chosen {{with the aid of a}} FORTRAN program, on the strength of <b>contaminant</b> chemical and toxicological categories, frequency of occurrence, and worst-case concentration. The model gas mixture can be used to test trace <b>contaminant</b> control hardware for a manned spacecraft environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this article concerns <b>contaminant</b> intrusion into a water distribution system associated with transient events. A Lagrangian-based <b>contaminant</b> transport model was coupled with a Eulerian-based transient hydraulic model to study <b>contaminant</b> intrusion and its propagation in a water distribution system. The hydraulic model was used to detect negative pressures during normal system operations. The Lagrangian-based <b>contaminant</b> transport model reduced simulation time and avoided numerical dissipation and dispersion errors that often occur with Eulerian-based modeling. The proposed water quality model was used to evaluate two systems described in the literature for their potential vulnerability to <b>contaminant</b> intrusion. The new transient water quality model realistically simulated intrusion events and <b>contaminant</b> propagation in both systems...|$|R

30|$|In this {{particular}} optimization of the monitoring network, a reference value of <b>contaminant</b> concentration of 100  mg/L was used. A comparative analysis of <b>contaminant</b> scenario {{can be made}} through analyzing the concentration at the source {{and the spread of}} this ideal concentration through various methods in the model environment with that of observed <b>contaminant</b> scenario to make comparative analysis of possible scenarios of <b>contaminant</b> in the real world.|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{fractional}} {{models of}} <b>contaminant</b> transport {{lead to a}} new travel time formula for arbitrary concen-tration levels. For an evolving <b>contaminant</b> plume in a highly heterogeneous aquifer, the new formula predicts much earlier arrival at low concentrations. Travel times of <b>contaminant</b> fronts and plumes are often obtained from Darcy’s law calculations using estimates of average pore velocities. These estimates only provide information about the travel time of the average concentration (or peak, for <b>contaminant</b> pulses). Recently, {{it has been shown}} that finding the travel times of arbitrary concentration levels is a straightforward process, and equations were developed for other portions of the breakthrough curve for a nonreactive <b>contaminant.</b> In this paper, we generalize those equations to include alternative fractional models of <b>contaminant</b> transport...|$|R
50|$|To set a Maximum <b>Contaminant</b> Level for a <b>contaminant,</b> EPA first {{determines how}} much of the <b>contaminant</b> may be present with no adverse health effects. This level is called the Maximum <b>Contaminant</b> Level Goal (MCLG). MCLGs are non-enforceable public health goals. The legally {{enforced}} MCL is then set {{as close as possible to}} the MCLG. The MCL for a <b>contaminant</b> may be higher than the MCLG because of difficulties in measuring small quantities of a <b>contaminant,</b> a lack of available treatment technologies, or if EPA determines that the costs of treatment would outweigh the public health benefits of a lower MCL. In the last case, EPA is permitted to choose an MCL that balances the cost of treatment with the public health benefits.|$|R

The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits.

5|$|External {{cleaning}} {{may also}} be required to remove <b>contaminants,</b> corrosion products or old paint or other coatings. Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.|$|E
40|$|Mathematically, the <b>contaminant</b> {{transport}} in an aquifer {{is described}} by an advection-diffusion equation and {{the identification of the}} contamination sources relies on solving a complex ill posed inverse model against the available observed data. The <b>contaminant</b> migration is usually monitored by spatially discrete detectors (e. g. monitoring wells) providing temporal records representing sampling events. These records are then used to estimate properties of the <b>contaminant</b> sources, e. g., locations, release strengths and model parameters representing <b>contaminant</b> migration (e. g., velocity, dispersivity, etc.). These estimates are essential for a reliable assessment of the contamination hazards and risks. If there are more than one <b>contaminant</b> sources (with different locations and strengths), the observed records represent <b>contaminant</b> mixtures; typically, the number of sources is unknown. The mixing ratios of the different <b>contaminant</b> sources at the detectors are also unknown; this further hinders the reliability and complexity of the inverse-model analyses. To circumvent some of these challenges, we have developed a novel hybrid source identification method coupling machine learning and inverse analysis methods, and called Green-NMFk. Our method is capable of identifying the unknown number, locations, and properties of a set of <b>contaminant</b> sources from measured contaminant-source mixtures with unknown mixing ratios, without any additional information. It also estimates the <b>contaminant</b> transport properties, such as velocity and dispersivity...|$|R

Results of plasma cleaning experiments on hydrocarbon <b>contaminant</b> films showed that the optical properties of mirrors and gratings could be satisfactorily restored. Results on fused silica optical flats were inconclusive because of the insensitivity of measurement techniques to the <b>contaminant</b> films. White thermal control surfaces, degraded by the hydrocarbon <b>contaminant</b> film, could not be restored by oxygen plasma exposure. The reflectance of silvered FEP Teflon thermal control surfaces could be restored by plasma cleaning. Experiments with a silicone <b>contaminant</b> indicated {{that it could not}} be easily polymerized onto surfaces with ultraviolet radiation.

In field measurements, there is observed wide variability in the ratio of indoor air <b>contaminant</b> concentration to subslab <b>contaminant</b> concentration. Here {{various aspects of the}} relationship of subslab concentrations to indoor <b>contaminant</b> levels are explored using a three-dimensional fluid dynamics model of the process. Subslab concentrations are determined mainly by diffusional processes and they are reasonably uniform across the subslab for buildings on homogeneous soils (with no significant advective subsurface disturbance). Also, subslab concentrations do not determine the main mode of <b>contaminant</b> entry into a structure (advection or diffusion), and widely different <b>contaminant</b> entry rates can be obtained with very similar subslab concentrations, depending upon whether the soil type supports advection or not...|$|R
