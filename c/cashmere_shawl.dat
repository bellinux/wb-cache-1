25|$|The decorations:On {{one side}} of the {{courtyard}} is the temple proper, on a raised dais four feet high. The building and decorations are exquisite; the shafts of all the arches are of polished white marble inlaid with flowing flowery patterns in coloured marbles. The walls and ceiling and every available inch are painted richly, the prevailing colours being blue and gold, but all so artistically blended that the eye only takes in the general effect, which is something like that of a <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "I did {{get lots}} on 'em, and traded 'em {{off to the}} Nabobs in the {{interior}} for <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> and India silks and sich," [...] said the Captain, composedly; [...] "and brought 'em home and sold 'em at a good figure, too." ...|$|R
50|$|While {{serving as}} {{ambassador}} to Russia in February 1834, Pacha presented Czar Nicholas {{with a number}} of gifts, including a bridle/saddle/caparison worth an estimated £50,000, bracelets, 150 <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls,</b> a dozen Arabian horses, and the chief gift, a jewel-encrusted sword said to have been taken from Constantine XI's corpse, following Mehmet II's Fall of Constantinople.|$|R
6000|$|When Rebecca {{saw the two}} {{magnificent}} <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> which Joseph Sedley {{had brought}} home to his sister, she said, with perfect truth, [...] "that it must be delightful to have a brother," [...] and easily got the pity of the tender-hearted Amelia for being alone in the world, an orphan without friends or kindred.|$|R
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the pillar stood six men round a tall and stately person. His superb robe of cloth of gold was girt round him by a white <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl,</b> and his white, richly jewelled turban showed that {{he was a man of}} wealth and high rank.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{presently}} {{enters to}} write a prescription, followed by Clive's mother-in-law, who had cast Rosa's fine <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> over her shoulders, to hide her disarray. [...] "You here still, Mr. Pendennis!" [...] she exclaims. She knew I was there. Had not she changed her dress {{in order to receive}} me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, John, John!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Potter, {{about thirty}} hours after that, {{as she stood}} gazing in wild delight at a {{magnificent}} <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> which hung on her husband's arm, while Tommy was lost in admiration {{at the sight of}} a splendid inlaid ivory work-box, [...] "where ever got 'ee such a helegant shawl?" ...|$|E
40|$|Britain {{imported}} a {{vast number}} of <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> from the Indian subcontinent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These were largely male garments in India at the time, which became popular dress accessories for British women. The demand for these shawls was opportune for textile manufacturers at home – particularly in Edinburgh, Norwich, and Paisley, who launched a thriving industry of shawls, ‘made in imitation of the Indian’. There has been considerable scholarship on <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> and their European copies in textile history. However, it has enjoyed no such prominence in literary studies. This PhD thesis examines <b>Cashmere</b> and ‘Paisley’ <b>shawls</b> in works of literature. Indian shawls are mentioned in a number of literary texts, including plays, poems, novels, opera, and satire. A wide variety of writers such as Richard Sheridan, Sir Walter Scott, Jane Austen, and Wilkie Collins (to name a few) depict these textiles in their works. For these writers, I argue, shawls provide a means to explore Britain’s changing social and imperial identity through the prism of material culture. The sheer incidence of ‘shawls’ in printed discourse furthermore suggests that they went beyond the realm of everyday fashion to constitute one of the important narratives of nineteenth-century Britain. In emphasising the significance of material culture and recovering new historical contexts, this investigation raises important questions relating to the links between industry and trade, and literary production. I rely on literary criticism, scholarship on India, and textile history to examine the phenomenon of <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls.</b> In the wider context of postcolonialism, the research suggests that instead of the Saidian model which viewed the East as an abject ‘Other,’ colonies actually exerted a reverse and important influence on the imperial centre. A new emphasis on Indian things in literature, this work hopes, will contribute a fresh strand of thought to studies of imperialism...|$|R
50|$|English-born Samuel Lord (1803-1889) {{started a}} dry goods {{business}} in New York in 1824, {{and opened the}} original store that would become Lord & Taylor in 1826, on Catherine Street. The shop stocked hosiery, misses' wear, and <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls.</b> His cousin, George Washington Taylor, joined in 1834, and the store was named Lord Taylor. Sames S. Taylor, Lord's brother-in-law, replaced George Taylor in 1845. The store moved to Grand Street and Chrystie Street in 1854.|$|R
25|$|In 1846, Charles Frederick Worth {{moved to}} Paris. He arrived there {{speaking}} no French and with £5 in his pocket. By {{the time his}} mother Ann Worth died in Highgate, London, in 1852, Worth was a sales assistant at Gagelin-Opigez & Cie, a prestigious Parisian firm that sold silk fabrics to the court dressmakers, also supplying <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> (then a ubiquitous accessory) and ready-made mantles. It was here that he met Marie Vernet, who became his wife in 1851.|$|R
60|$|He carried about Amelia's white <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl,</b> {{and having}} {{attended}} under the gilt cockle-shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of Borodino (a savage cantata against the Corsican upstart, who had lately {{met with his}} Russian reverses)--Mr. Dobbin tried to hum it as he walked away, and found he was humming--the tune which Amelia Sedley sang on the stairs, as she came down to dinner.|$|E
60|$|At church time, she met {{the young}} ladies in the hall, in pink bonnets and sea-green mantillas over the lilac silks, all evidently put on {{for the first time}} in her honour, an honour of which she felt herself the less deserving, as, {{sensible}} that this was no case for bridal display, she wore a quiet dark silk, a <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl,</b> and plain straw bonnet, trimmed with white.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Katharine," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "how you've made {{me think}} of Mamma and the old days in Russell Square! I can see the chandeliers, and the green silk of the piano, and Mamma sitting in her <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> by the window, singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside stopped to listen. Papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while he waited round the corner. It must have been a summer evening. That was before things were hopeless...." ...|$|E
5000|$|Her {{collections}} are all hand crafted in Milan, Italy. She {{is best known}} for creating shoes that use exotic skins, fur, and other rare materials. In 1988 she designed a pair of satin pumps encrusted with 177.85 carats of rubies, which she sold in her store for $15,000. The Vanessa Noel label also encompasses bridal shoes, men’s footwear, <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls,</b> and other accessories. In 2015, Vanessa Noel launch her first handbag collection and her first fragrance named Stiletto {{in the form of a}} scented candle.|$|R
6000|$|While {{engaged in}} talking with these, Miss Honeyman {{came out of}} the sacred edifice, crisp and stately in the famous Agra brooch and <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls.</b> The good-natured Lady Anne had a smile and a kind word for her as for everybody. Clive went up to his {{maternal}} aunt to offer his arm. [...] "You must give him up to us for dinner, Miss Honeyman, if you please to be so very kind. He was so good-natured in escorting Ethel down," [...] Lady Anne said.|$|R
50|$|By 1830, weaving <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> with French-produced yarn {{had become}} an {{important}} Scottish industry. The Scottish Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures offered a 300 pound sterling reward to {{the first person who}} could spin cashmere in Scotland based on the French system. Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane collected the required information while in Paris and received a Scottish patent for the process in 1831. In the autumn of 1831, he sold the patent to Henry Houldsworth and sons of Glasgow. In 1832 Henry Houldsworth and sons commenced the manufacture of yarn, and in 1833 received the reward.|$|R
6000|$|At this {{juncture}} Miss Honeyman re-entered the parlour, arrayed in her Sunday bonnet, her stiff and spotless collar, her <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl,</b> and Agra brooch, and carrying her Bible and Prayer-Book each stitched in its neat cover of brown silk. [...] "Don't stay chattering here, you idle woman," [...] she cried to her attendant with extreme asperity. [...] "And you, sir, {{if you wish}} to smoke your cigar, you had best walk down to the cliff where the Cockneys are!" [...] she added, glowering at Clive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Newcome! {{you must}} go and drive on the Course with Rosa now; and the Colonel must sit and talk with me, whom {{he has not been}} to see for such a long time." [...] Clive {{presently}} went off in state by Rosey's side, and then Laura showed Colonel Newcome his beautiful white <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> round a successor of that little person who had first been wrapped in that web, now a stout young gentleman whose noise could be clearly heard in the upper regions.|$|E
60|$|I {{was indeed}} almost aghast. Never {{in my life}} had I seen {{anything}} so grotesque as this woman. To begin with {{she was more than}} ordinarily stout and unwieldy--indeed, she appeared like a veritable mountain of flesh; but what was so disturbing to my mind was that she was nothing but a hideous caricature of her lovely daughter, whose dainty features she grotesquely recalled. Her face was seamed and wrinkled, her white hair was plastered down above her yellow forehead. She wore an old-fashioned bonnet tied under her chin, and her huge bulk was draped in a large-patterned <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{mercenary}} {{young person}} distantly related to myself,' said her good father, 'did well! The mercenary young person distantly related to myself, {{did not trust}} to me in vain! I admire this mercenary young person distantly related to myself, more in this dress than if {{she had come to}} me in China silks, <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls,</b> and Golconda diamonds. I love this young person dearly. I say to the man of this young person's heart, out of my heart and with all of it, [...] "My blessing on this engagement betwixt you, and she brings you a good fortune when she brings you the poverty she has accepted for your sake and the honest truth's!"' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{marriage}} was announced {{to take place}} the next week, and a holiday was declared through the house. Nothing was talked of or discussed but the corbeille de mariage which the bridegroom had brought--the dresses, laces, sets of jewels, and <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls.</b> Dolores never had been treated with such attention by the family in her life. She rose immeasurably {{in the eyes of}} all as the future possessor of such wealth and such an establishment as awaited her. Madame Mendoza had visions of future visits in Cuba rising before her mind, and overwhelmed her daughter-in-law with flatteries and caresses, which she received in the same passive silence as she did everything else.|$|R
60|$|The {{news that}} the palace was taken spread rapidly, {{and there was a}} rush to share in the spoil. But few of the enemy were found inside; these were at once bayoneted, and then a general {{scramble}} ensued. The order had been given that no private plundering should be allowed, but that everything taken should be collected, and sold for the general benefit of the troops. Orders like this are, however, never observed, at any rate with portable articles; and Sikhs, Ghoorkas, and British alike, loaded themselves with spoil. <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> worth a hundred pounds were sold for five shillings, silk dresses might be had for nothing, and jewelry went for less than the value of the setting.|$|R
60|$|I like {{to think}} of her just as she was on that memorable day early in March of the year 1815--just as she sat that morning on a low stool close to Mme. la Duchesse's high-backed chair, and with her eyes fixed so enquiringly upon Madame's kind old face. Her fair hair was done up in the quaint loops and curls which characterised the mode of the moment: she had on a white dress cut low at the neck and had wrapped a soft <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> round her shoulders, for the weather was cold and there was no fire in the stately open hearth.|$|E
60|$|Before Vivian could answer, a tittering, so audible that {{it might}} almost be termed a shout, burst forth from the whole room. Cynthia Courtown had stolen behind Lord Alhambra, as {{he was sitting on}} an ottoman a la Turque, and had folded a <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> round his head with a most Oriental tie. His Lordship, who, {{notwithstanding}} his eccentricities, was really a very amiable man, bore his blushing honours with a gracious dignity worthy of a descendant of the Abencerrages. The sensation which this incident occasioned favoured Vivian's escape from Mrs. Felix, for he had not left Mr. Stapylton Toad with any intention of waltzing.|$|E
6000|$|You may be {{sure that}} she showed Rebecca over every room of the house, and {{everything}} {{in every one of}} her drawers; and her books, and her piano, and her dresses, and all her necklaces, brooches, laces, and gimcracks. She insisted upon Rebecca accepting the white cornelian and the turquoise rings, and a sweet sprigged muslin, which was too small for her now, though it would fit her friend to a nicety; and she determined in her heart to ask her mother's permission to present her white <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> to her friend. Could she not spare it? and had not her brother Joseph just brought her two from India? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought by}} these means {{to put off}} the fair Puttee Rooge, and hoped {{to be able to}} escape without {{subjecting}} myself to the examination of her curious eyes. After smoking for a while, an attendant came to tell me that my supper was prepared in the inner apartment of the tent (I suppose that the reader, if he be possessed of the commonest intelligence, knows that the tents of the Indian grandees are made of the finest <b>Cashmere</b> <b>Shawls,</b> and contain a dozen rooms at least, with carpets, chimneys, and sash- windows complete). I entered, I say, into an inner chamber, and there began with my fingers to devour my meal in the Oriental fashion, taking, every now and then, a pull from the wine-jar, which was cooling deliciously in another jar of snow.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed a}} mansion of those proud {{old days when}} whalers and China traders and West-Indiamen brought home gold and blacks, <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> and sweet sandalwood, Malay oaths and the jawbones of whales. The Applebys could see by the {{electric}} lights bowered in the lilac-bushes that a stately grass walk, lined with Madonna lilies and hollyhock and phlox, led to the fanlight-crested white door, above which hung the mocking tea-pot sign. The house was lighted, the windows open. To {{the right of the}} hall was the arts-shop where, among walls softened with silky Turkish rugs and paintings of blue dawn amid the dunes, were tables of black-and-white china, sports hats, and Swiss toys, which the Grimsby summer colony meekly bought at the suggestion of the sprightly Miss Mitchin.|$|R
5000|$|The Industrial Revolution, {{based on}} the textile industry, turned Paisley from a small market town to an {{important}} industrial town in the late 18th century. Its location attracted English mill owners; immigrants from Ayrshire and the Highlands poured into a town that offered jobs to women and children. However, silk fell out of fashion in 1790. The mills switched to the imitation Kashmir (<b>cashmere)</b> <b>shawls</b> called [...] "Paisley". Under the leadership of Thomas Coats (1809-1893), Paisley became the world centre for thread making. The high-status skilled weavers mobilised themselves in radical protests after 1790, culminating in the failed [...] "Radical War" [...] of 1820. Overproduction, {{the collapse of the}} shawl market and a general depression in the textile industry led to technical changes that reduced the importance of weavers. Politically the mill owners remained in control of the town.|$|R
6000|$|Foreseeing {{that their}} {{company would be}} an advantage, I hearkened favourably to the honeyed request for a few crowns. The boy Mohammed {{obtained}} six dollars; Hamid about five pounds, as I intended to make his house at Al-Madinah my home; Omar Effendi three dollars; Sa'ad the Demon two-I gave the money to him at Yambu',-and Salih Shakkar fifty piastres. But since in these lands, as a rule, no one ever lends coins, or, borrowing, ever returns them, I took care to exact service from the first, to take two rich coats from the second, a handsome pipe from the third, a [...] "bala" [...] or yataghan from the fourth, and from the fifth an imitation <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawl.</b> After which, {{we sat down and}} drew ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} we had made an {{arrangement}} to go out shopping together, and to purchase some articles of female gear, that Sam intended to bestow on his relations when he returned. Seven needle-books, for his sisters; a gilt buckle, for his mamma; a handsome French <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> and bonnet, for his aunt (the old lady keeps an inn in the Borough, and has plenty of money, and no heirs); and a toothpick case, for his father. Sam is a good fellow to all his relations, and as for his aunt, he adores her. Well, we were to go and make these purchases, and I arrived punctually at my time; but Sam was stretched on a sofa, very pale and dismal.|$|E
6000|$|The evil came of a “fairer body.” I had {{prepared}} en cachette {{a slip of}} paper, and had hid in my Ihram a pencil destined {{to put down the}} heads of this rarely heard discourse. But unhappily that red <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawl</b> was upon my shoulders. Close to us sat a party of fair Meccans, apparently belonging to the higher classes, and one of these I had already several times remarked. She was a tall girl, about eighteen years old, with regular features, a skin somewhat citrine-coloured, but soft and clear, symmetrical eyebrows, the most beautiful eyes, and a figure all grace. There was no head thrown back, no straightened neck, no flat shoulders, nor toes turned out—in fact, no “elegant” barbarisms: the shape was what the Arabs love, soft, bending, and relaxed, as a woman’s ...|$|E
60|$|Woolsey had repurchased for {{her one of}} the <b>Cashmere</b> <b>shawls.</b> She left {{it behind}} her one day at the Fleet prison, and some rascal stole it there; having the grace, however, to send Woolsey the ticket, {{signifying}} {{the place where it}} had been pawned. Who could the scoundrel have been? Woolsey swore a great oath, and fancied he knew; but if it was Walker himself (as Woolsey fancied, and probably as was the case) who made away with the shawl, being pressed thereto by necessity, was it fair to call him a scoundrel for so doing, and should we not rather laud the delicacy of his proceeding? He was poor: who can command the cards? But he did not wish his wife should know HOW poor: he could not bear that she should suppose him arrived at the necessity of pawning a shawl.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century European {{production}} of paisley increased, {{particularly in the}} Scottish town from which the pattern takes its modern name. Soldiers returning from the colonies brought home <b>cashmere</b> wool <b>shawls</b> from India, and the East India Company imported more. The design was copied from the costly silk and wool Kashmir shawls and adapted first for use on handlooms, and, after 1820, on Jacquard looms.|$|R
50|$|Possibly {{withholding}} {{a portion}} of the crew's shares, Mason disappeared after stopping at an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean; he had actually returned to New York to divide the spoils, later returning to the area aboard the Pearl. Coates, later suspected to have murdered Mason, assumed command of the ship, stopping at St. Mary's Island (near Madagascar) along with the 16-gun Nassau in October 1692 http://www.angelfire.com/realm/peggiss/shipinfo.html#Jacob, before returning to New York. When he returned to New York he carried some of the crew of pirate James Allison, whom Coates had picked up after Allison's ship Good Hope was wrecked near Madagascar; Allison himself was not recorded among them. Upon their arrival in April of the following year, Coates arranged a deal with Governor Benjamin Fletcher to pardon their former acts of piracy, as well as assuring no interference from New York authorities against further attacks, in exchange for $1,800 which would be divided between the Governor and other colonial officials (as well as presenting Fletcher's wife with jewels, silks, and <b>cashmere</b> <b>shawls</b> http://www.kellscraft.com/DutchEnglishOnHudson/DutchEnglishOnHudsonCh10.html).|$|R
