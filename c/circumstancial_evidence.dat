2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, it was {{proposed}} to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake. At {{the same time it}} was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O. esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as [...] "thrash fish" [...] or even a vermin by the British colonial authorities. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962—63. The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954—55 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, Russian {{construction}} workers found ancient ruins during {{the construction of}} a highway between Abakan and the village of Askyz (Аскыз), in Khakassia. When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists during 1941-45, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely Han Dynasty era palace. While the name of the high-ranking personage who lived there is not known, Russian archaeologist L.A. Evtyukhova surmised, based on <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence,</b> that the palace may have been the residence of Li Ling (see :ru:Ташебинский дворец).|$|E
50|$|It is {{not known}} when Inishbofin was first settled. There is no {{evidence}} of a Mesolithic, and only <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> of a significant Neolithic presence. Although there are pre-historic field systems, their age has not been definitely established and could be anywhere between Bronze Age and early Medieval. Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, found in significant numbers on the Connemara mainland, are conspicuous by their absence. Definite traces of human settlement are available only from the Iron Age onwards, such as the remains of promontory ring forts like 'Dun Mor'.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{has undergone a}} series of redesigns, which makes difficult establishing its age and the original appearance with certainty. It is assumed that the church was first built as a simple Romanesque-style basilica in the 12th century. It had detoriated significantly {{by the end of}} the 14th century, when it was restored and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is not clear who commissioned the restoration of the building; <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> points to either the Franciscans who had settled in the area or, somewhat less likely, to Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, the Kingdom of Bosnia's leading magnate and founder of the city of Jajce.|$|E
50|$|State {{and federal}} {{prosecutors}} split {{the charges and}} the Poland brothers went on trial for robbery and kidnapping in federal court on February 15, 1979, were found guilty on those charges based on the <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> alone, and were sentenced to 100 years in prison. In November 1979 an Arizona state jury returned the guilty verdict for murder and that meant {{the death penalty for}} both of them but they appealed their convictions. The Arizona Supreme Court found that the testimony of a hypnotized witness and the taser gun evidence should not have been used. They also found out that the jury had inappropriately discussed the federal trial and that meant their murder convictions were overturned and parole laws at the time meant they would be eligible for parole in less than 7 years.|$|E
50|$|A {{week after}} castrating the burglar, Deanna hires a gigolo drug addict to sodomize him. While the addict has {{his way with}} the burglar, Deanna leaves and goes to Trevor's apartment. There, Deanna discovers <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> {{indicating}} Trevor was her rapist, walks in on Trevor and Leanne having sex, and attacks them with a circular saw that was among Trevor's carpentry tools. Deanna beheads Leanne with the saw, and bashes Trevor's face in with it. Returning to her apartment, Deanna murders the gigolo by stabbing him in the neck with a knife after he reveals the burglar had died {{at some point during}} the rape. Deanna then goes to the hospital in search of Doctor Tyson, spotting him seated in his parked car, dressed like her rapist and surrounded by sadistic pornography and stun guns identical to the one she was attacked with. When Doctor Tyson tries to pull her into the car, Deanna jams a cigarette lighter into one of his eyes, and knocks him out with one of the stun guns. Having finally found her rapist, Deanna abducts Doctor Tyson, and the film ends as she prepares to torture him.|$|E
5000|$|On August 14, 1897 two {{armed men}} {{held up a}} caravan of four stages and an Army {{ambulance}} en route from Canyon to Mammoth. A total of $630 was stolen from park visitors. The resulting case: United States vs. Gus Smitzer, alias Little Gus; and George Reeb, alias Morphine Charley {{was the result of}} two weeks of interesting detective work by the U.S. Army, army scouts and Edgar Howell, the infamous poacher. Witness accounts were insufficient to identify and arrest the robbers so the Army was engaged find whatever evidence could be found near the crime. They located a variety of <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> in a recently abandoned campsite just north of Grebe Lake that tied the robbers to the scene. Edgar Howell was engaged to identify and find the robbers upon the advice of Frank Jay Haynes who believed Howell was a good man and knew all the bad guys in Yellowstone. On August 30, 1897, Smitzer and Reeb were arrested and shortly thereafter Meldrum heard the evidence and bound them over for trial in the Federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In May 1898 they were convicted and sentenced to three years in prison.

40|$|Sardinella dayi {{contributes}} to a minor extent to the sardine fishery of the Tuticorin area in the Gulf of Mannar. A few post-larval stages of this species in the size range of 1870 mnj. — 20. 25 mm and juveniles of 28 mm— 36 mm are described. The food of the post-larvae consisted mainly of copepods.

40|$|Four {{cases of}} fatal disseminated Scedosporium prolificans (inflatum) {{infection}} occurring in neutropenic patients are reported. Because of hospital renovation, {{the patients were}} cared for in a temporary hematologic facility. S. prolificans (inflatum) was isolated from blood cultures of these four patients, two of whom underwent full necropsy, and revealed abundant vegetative hyphae and ovoid conida with truncate bases in many organs. In vitro susceptibility testing of fungal strains showed all isolates to be resistant to amphotericin B, flucytosine, miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole, with MICs greater than 16 micrograms/ml. The reported infections, two in each of two rooms, occurred {{over a period of}} 1 month, with very similar clinical outcomes. <b>Circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> suggested a nosocomial outbreak, but the environmental samples collected from the rooms, corridors, and adjacent areas did not yield S. prolificans (inflatum). Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence suggested a nosocomial outbreak of S. prolificans (inflatum) infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{sudden and}} {{simultaneous}} death of twin infants is described. The search for hazards {{in the home}} and the postmortem investigation provided an insight into the possible mechanism of death. Instead of a diagnosis of simultaneous sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the infants were determined to be victims of a combination of several environmental factors that led suddenly to death. Strong <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> of nonnatural (accidental) death included sublethal levels of carbon monoxide (CO), overwrapping, and mechanical obstruction of upper airways. The literature concerning the phenomenon of simultaneous twin death is also reviewed. The simultaneous death of infant twins is a phenomenon that still evokes controversy and suspicion. The unusual nature of this curious occurence challenges the medical examiner, Police Departments, and society to determine the cause and manner of death. Smialek (1) analyzed nine cases of simultaneous twin deaths, and the evidence gathered allowed him to pinpoint SIDS as the cause of death in all cases. Beal (2) reviewed a series of simultaneous SIDS in twin pairs and found 39 cases previously reported, including the abovementionedOvid: Ramos: Am J Forensic Med Pathol, Volume 18 (1).

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported analyses of Yohkoh SXT data examining {{the relationship between}} the heating of extended coronal loops (both within and stemming from active regions) and microflaring in core fields lying along neutral lines near their footpoints (J. G. Porter, D. A. Falconer, and R. L. Moore 1998, in Solar Jets and Coronal Plumes, ed. T. Guyenne, ESA SP- 421, and references therein). We found a surprisingly poor correlation of intensity variations in the extended loops with individual microflares in the compact heated areas at their feet, despite considerable <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> linking the heating processes in these regions. Now, a study of Fe XII image sequences from SOHO EIT show that similar associations of core field structures with the footpoints of very extended coronal features {{can be found in the}} quiet Sun. The morphology is consistent with the finding of Wang et al. (1997, ApJ 484, L 75) that polar plumes are rooted at sites of mixed polarity in the magnetic network. We find that the upstairs/downstairs intensity variations often follow the trend, identified in the active region observations, of a weak correspondence. Apparently much of the coronal heating in the extended loops is driven by a type of core field magnetic activity that is "cooler" than the events having the coronal signature of microflares, i. e., activity that results in little heating within the core fields themselves. This work was funded by the Solar Physics Branch of NASA's Office of Space Science through the SR&T Program and the SEC Guest Investigator Program...|$|E
40|$|Viruses {{belonging}} to 9 {{families have been}} detected in cetaceans. We critically review the clinical features, pathology and epidemiology of the diseases they cause. Cetacean morbillivirus (family Paramyxoviridae) induces a serious disease with a high mortality rate and persists in several populations. It may have long-term effects on the dynamics of cetacean populations either as enzootic infection or recurrent epizootics. The latter presumably have the more profound impact due to removal of sexually mature individuals. Members of the family Poxviridae infect several species of odontocetes, resulting in ring and tattoo skin lesions. Although poxviruses apparently do not induce a high mortality, <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests they may be lethal in young animals lacking protective immunity, and thus may negatively affect net recruitment. Papillomaviruses (family Papovaviridae) cause genital warts in at least 3 species of cetaceans. In 10 % of male Burmeister's porpoises Phocoena spinipinnis from Peru, lesions were sufficiently severe to at least hamper, if not impede, copulation. Members of the families Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae were demonstrated in cetaceans suffering serious illnesses, but {{with the exception of}} a 'porpoise herpesvirus' their causative role is still tentative. Herpes-like viruses and caliciviruses (Caliciviridae) give rise to cutaneous diseases in Monodontidae and Delphinidae. Antibodies to several serotypes of caliciviruses were found in odontocetes and mysticetes. An unrecognized Hepadnaviridae was detected by serology in a captive Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens with chronic persistent hepatitis. Adenoviruses (Adenoviridae) were isolated from the intestinal tracts of mysticeti and a beluga Delphinapterus leucas but were not associated with any pathologies. We discuss the potential impact of Paramyxoviridae, Poxviridae and Papovaviridae on the dynamics of several odontocete populations. Raga Esteve, Juan Antonio, Toni. Raga@uv. e...|$|E
40|$|Primary lymphomas of bone are {{uncommon}} malignancies. The {{vast majority}} of them are non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), whereas primary Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) of bone is extremely rare. Patients with primary NHL of bone commonly present with local bone pain, soft tissue swelling, and a mass or a pathological fracture. There is a slight male preponderance, and most patients are over 45 - 50 years of age. Primary NHL of bone can arise in any part of the skeleton, but long bones (femurs, tibia) are the most common sites of presentation. Comprehensive immunohistochemical studies are required to establish an accurate histological diagnosis of primary NHL of bone. Most cases of primary NHL of bone are classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of hematological malignancies. On full staging evaluation, most patients have disease of stage IE or IIE according to the Ann Arbor system. Several studies indicate that patients with primary NHL of bone have a favorable outcome, especially when treated by combined modality therapy. A number of studies reported that clinical stage is the most important prognostic variable in predicting overall survival. Interestingly, the rare occurrence of primary lymphoma of bone is in contrast with the frequency of plasma cell tumors in bone. This could be due to the fact that, during normal B-cell differentiation, the bone marrow is the normal site of homing of plasma cells which are terminally-differentiated, immunoglobulin-secreting post-germinal center B-cells. In this respect, there is <b>circumstancial</b> <b>evidence</b> that primary NHL of bone may represent tumors of post-germinal center B-cells. The present review summarizes data on the histogenesis of primary NHL of bone in view of the recent histogenetic classification of DLBCL {{on the basis of the}} B-cell differentiation gene expression profiles (germinal center vs. post-germinal center B-cell differentiation) ...|$|E
