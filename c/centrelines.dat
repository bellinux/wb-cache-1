50|$|To {{address the}} problem of cross-city transit, Greater Manchester PTE (SELNEC's successor) {{proposed}} a new circular shuttle bus service between Piccadilly and Victoria stations. The new <b>Centreline</b> bus service was initially opposed by the Taxi Owners' Association, but was approved by the North Western Traffic Commissioner. <b>Centreline</b> was first operated using a fleet of Seddon Pennine IV midibuses, noted for their diminutive appearance. GMPTE also introduced an experimental battery-electric bus onto <b>Centreline,</b> the Lucas Electric Bus, which was based on the Seddon chassis and body. This was Greater Manchester's second electric bus, the first being SELNEC's experimental Silent Rider, but it was eventually taken out of service. Operated under the Greater Manchester Transport brand, <b>Centreline</b> came into operation on 1 July 1974. Passengers were charged a flat fare of 2p for each jounrney.|$|R

5000|$|Despite the re-spacing of the {{cylinder}} bores, {{the cylinder}} head castings remained unchanged. As a result, the <b>centrelines</b> of the combustion chambers {{in the head}} no longer aligned precisely with the <b>centrelines</b> of the cylinders but this did not matter greatly as the combustion chamber diameters in the head were smaller than the cylinder diameters. The 3.8 and 4.2-litre cylinder heads and cams are therefore interchangeable. The 4.2-litre engine from the factory had unsmoothed steps between the inlet manifold and head, and the manifold gaskets were not a good match for the inlet ports. These engines therefore make excellent bases for some modification, achieving approx. [...] SAE net and increased torque merely by [...] "flowing" [...] the head.|$|E

40|$|<b>Centreline</b> {{segregation}} {{appears as}} a positive segregation of alloying elements like C, Mn and P in the mid thickness region of continuously cast slabs. It is an intrinsic phenomenon for the casting process and {{it is almost impossible}} to mitigate through post processing. <b>Centreline</b> segregation can be harmful to the weldability and integrity of any fabricated steel product, especially line pipe. At present, there is no international consensus on evaluation methods of <b>centreline</b> segregation. A repeatable and objective method for evaluation of <b>centreline</b> segregation is highly desirable for both steelmaking process improvement and also for the prediction of final product performance. In the current work, a MATLAB program based on image analysis was developed to evaluate the images of <b>centreline</b> segregation by automatic measurement of segregation features. The original grey scale images of the centre line segregation were reduced to black and white images for automatic measurement. The black features of the image, representing areas of element segregation, were identified according to predefined criteria. The degree of segregation was evaluated based on equations which were developed by considering different parameters of the segregation segments, and also was evaluated by rules gleaned from experienced steelmakers...|$|R

50|$|The term {{starboard}} {{derives from}} the Old English steorbord, meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had rudders on their <b>centrelines,</b> they were steered with a steering oar at {{the stern of the}} ship and, because more people are right-handed, on the right-hand side of it. The term is cognate with the Old Norse stýri (rudder) and borð (side of a ship). Since the steering oar was {{on the right side of}} the boat, it would tie up at wharf on the other side. Hence the left side was called port.|$|E

50|$|The {{initially}} proposed mode involving simultaneous takeoffs in westerly flow {{to increase}} handling traffic capacity caused several near misses {{over the west}} side of the airport where the <b>centrelines</b> of runways 10/28 and 9/27 intersect. The runway use was changed to segregate dependent mode on 25 December 2007, which was a few days after the deciding near miss involving an Airbus A330-200 of Qatar Airways and an Indigo A320 aircraft. The new method involved use of runway 28 for all departures and runway 27 for all arrivals. This mode which was more streamlined was adopted during day hours (0600 - 2300 IST) till 24 September 2008.|$|E

In 2002, the <b>Centreline</b> name disappeared from Manchester streets as the service was rebranded as Metroshuttle. First Manchester was chosen by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) to operate the service and has retained the contract. Two routes were introduced, numbered 1 and 2.

50|$|From 1930 to 1935, Judkins formed one of {{the great}} <b>centrelines</b> in the game, teaming with centreman Eric Zschech and fellow wingman Alan Geddes. Richmond relied heavily on {{stability}} and reliability to achieve success, and being able to select the same centreline every week helped tremendously. The trio played in four consecutive Grand Finals together, winning premierships in 1932 and 1934. Judkins averaged 14 possessions in the four Grand Finals. His outstanding finals effort in this period came in the 1934 semifinal against Geelong. Judkins played a single game for Victoria and totalled 10 finals for the club. He continued to catch the eye of the umpires, polling well in the 1931 and 1932 Brownlow counts when he finished equal fifth both times.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming approach for semi-automated road extraction from medium- and high-resolution images. This method is {{a modified version}} of a pre-existent dynamic programming method for road extraction from low-resolution images. The basic assumption of this pre-existent method is that roads manifest as lines in low-resolution images and as such can be modelled and extracted as linear features. Contrary to this, roads manifest as ribbon features in medium- and high-resolution images and the goal of road extraction methods becomes the road <b>centrelines.</b> As a result, the original method can not accurately extract road <b>centrelines</b> from medium- and high- resolution images. In view of this, we propose a modification of merit function of the original approach, which is carried out by a constraint function embedding road edge properties. Preliminary results demonstrate the modified algorithm’s potential in extracting road <b>centrelines</b> from medium- and high-resolution images. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new fibre tracking algorithm to efficiently locate fibre <b>centrelines</b> (skeletons), from X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) images of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP), {{which are then}} used to generate micro-scale finite element models. Three-dimensional images with 330 nm voxel resolution of multidirectional [+ 45 / 90 /- 45 / 0] CFRP specimens were obtained by fast synchrotron X-ray CT scanning. Conventional image processing techniques, such as a combination of filters, delineation of plies, binarisation of images, and fibre identification by local maxima and ultimate eroding points, were tried first but found insufficient to produce continuous fibre <b>centrelines</b> for segmentation, especially in regions with highly congested fibres. The new algorithm uses a global overlapping stack filtering step followed by a local fibre tracking step. Both steps {{are based on the}} Bayesian inference theory. The new algorithm is found capable of efficiently define fibre <b>centrelines</b> for the generation of micro-scale finite element models with high fidelity...|$|E
