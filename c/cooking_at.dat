5|$|The Fat Duck {{is located}} in a 16th-century cottage that was further {{modified}} in the 19th and 20th centuries. Prior to the restaurant opening in the location, it was a public house called The Ringers. The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 2 May 1989. When the restaurant opened in 1995, the kitchen was staffed by owner Heston Blumenthal and one other employee. At the time the restaurant was serving meals in the style of a French bistro, such as lemon tarts, and steak and chips. Blumenthal later said that science had already begun to influence the <b>cooking</b> <b>at</b> this early stage, as already on the menu were his Triple Cooked Chips, which were developed to stop the potato from going soft.|$|E

5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in <b>cooking</b> <b>at</b> night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{increased}} internationalization of cuisines and food supply, foie gras is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to <b>cooking</b> <b>at</b> high temperature than is goose foie gras ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook goose foie gras employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to light, {{physical}} damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content {{within the}} tuber. <b>Cooking</b> <b>at</b> high temperatures—over —partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual {{clue as to}} areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|E

[...] "I'm looking forward to having no schedule, no pressure, to not caring about whether it's raining or not, just visiting with family and friends, <b>cooking</b> <b>at</b> home, trying to seriously have a child. I want no pressure for a while," [...] she said. But before Dion embarked on her two-year respite from the music industry beginning 1 January 2000, she prepared All the Way...

In that time, she's released seven English-language albums, from 1990's Unison to All the Way... A Decade of Song, and six newly recorded French albums, picking up numerous awards, including five Grammys.|$|E
500|$|Michel nearly {{decided to}} give up cooking to become an opera singer, but instead {{followed}} Albert to London, despite {{not being able to}} speak English. He would later recall that people thought he was mad for travelling to England {{in view of the fact}} that he considered the state of English <b>cooking</b> <b>at</b> the time was horrific. [...] In 1967 they opened their first restaurant, Le Gavroche at Lower Sloane Street in London. The opening party was attended by celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin and Ava Gardner. For the following week, Chaplin was reportedly shuttled across London so he could eat there. In 1972 the Roux brothers opened a second restaurant, the Waterside Inn, in Bray, Berkshire, and launched a catering business. In 1974, when Michelin stars were first awarded in the UK, Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn were both amongst those restaurants to win a star, and when a number of restaurants won two Michelin stars for the first time in 1977, both Roux restaurants were among them. Le Gavroche would move to a new location in Mayfair in 1982, and in the same year became the first restaurant in the UK to be awarded three Michelin stars. The same rating for the Waterside Inn would follow in 1985, but Le Gavroche would go back down to two stars in 1993 has not regained the three star level. In 2010, the Waterside Inn became the first restaurant outside France to hold three Michelin stars for a period of 25 years.|$|E
