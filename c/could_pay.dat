5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner {{who was living}} alone. A wealthier prisoner <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|E

5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His {{relations with the}} kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Arnold {{asked for}} Kenney to return Wilson {{to work on}} his own staff. Wilson took the long way back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson's return so Giles <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> a visit to the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff, Organization, Commitments and Requirements. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic Party Tammany Hall {{political}} machine {{had been working}} to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish, most of whom already spoke English. In March 1863, with the war continuing, Congress passed the Enrollment Act to establish a draft for the first time, as more troops were needed. In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned {{they were expected to}} register for the draft to fight for their new country. Black men were excluded from the draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for substitutes.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was paying their way.|$|E
5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E

5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775. Lever turned the house into a museum with {{a significant amount of}} natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E
5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E

5|$|Third class {{funerals}} were {{reserved for}} pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense {{in the section}} of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.|$|E
5|$|During 1938 and 1939, {{with war}} anticipated, an {{increasing}} part of Pick's {{time was spent}} in planning for the approaching conflict. The Railway Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1938 {{to act as a}} central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement {{with other members of the}} LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior management structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer <b>could</b> <b>pay</b> the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling out of the station, but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E
