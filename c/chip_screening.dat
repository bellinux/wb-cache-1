In high HIV burden settings, the cost and complexity of diagnostics limit their availability. We have developed a novel complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip based, pH-mediated, point-of-care HIV- 1 viral load monitoring assay that simultaneously amplifies and detects HIV- 1 RNA. A novel low-buffer HIV- 1 pH-LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) assay was optimised and incorporated into a pH sensitive CMOS <b>chip.</b> <b>Screening</b> of 991 clinical samples (164 on the chip) yielded a sensitivity of 95 % (in vitro) and 88. 8 % (on-chip) at > 1000 RNA copies/reaction across {{a broad spectrum of}} HIV- 1 viral clades. Median time to detection was 20. 8 minutes in samples with > 1000 copies RNA.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) has emerged as an important regulator of insulin signal transduction and {{is regarded as a}} pharmaceutical target for metabolic disorders. To find novel natural materials presenting therapeutic activities against diabetes and obesity, we screened various herb extracts using a <b>chip</b> <b>screening</b> allowing the determination of PTP 1 B inhibitory effects of the tested compounds using insulin receptor (IR) as the substrate. Cudrania tricuspidata leaves (CTe) had a strong inhibitory effect on PTP 1 B activity and substantially inhibited fat accumulation in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. CTe was orally administrated to diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice once daily for 3 weeks after which changes in glucose, insulin metabolism, and fat accumulation were examined. Hepatic enzyme markers (aspartate aminotransferase, AST, and alanine aminotransferase, ALT) and total fat mass and triglyceride levels decreased in CTe-treated mice, whereas body weight and total cholesterol concentration slightly decreased. CTe increased the phosphorylation of IRS- 1 and Akt in liver tissue. Furthermore, CTe treatment significantly lowered blood glucose levels and improved insulin secretion in DIO mice.

30|$|Reelin is a {{secreted}} extracellular glycoprotein with N-terminal f-spondin {{domain and}} C-terminal rich in positive charged amino acid group (D’Arcangelo et al., 1995; D’Arcangelo et al., 1997). The genomic organization of Reelin is highly similar between mice and human, implying evolutionary conservation in the gene structure (Royaux et al., 1997). This gene came into sight {{when it was}} discovered to function in the synaptic development of neurons such as plasticity, polarization and targeting (Borrell et al., 1999; Matsuki et al., 2010; Rogers et al., 2011). In a <b>chip</b> <b>screening</b> study aimed at capturing differentially expressing genes between dLGN and vLGN, reelin gene is identified to involve in nuclei-specific axon guidance. Reelin binds to very-low-density lipoproteins receptor (VLDLR) and low-density lipoproteins receptor-related protein 8 (LRP 8) in vivo. After binding to these receptors, Reelin activates disabled- 1 (Dab 1) to function downstream (Howell et al., 1997; Sheldon et al., 1997; Trommsdorff et al., 1999). In reln −/− mutant, two striking defects are found at P 1. First, there is a gap between IGL and the medial-lateral part of vLGN, which {{may be caused by}} the reduced projection from RGCs, and this reduction in RGC innervation leads to the shrink in the vLGN territory; another abnormality is a large number of misrouted axons originating from both eyes’ intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGCs) at the vLGN, but axons aiming at the dLGN is unaffected (Su et al., 2011). This confirms the function of reelin in specific targeting at vLGN and IGL but not dLGN. Reduced targeting in IGL and misrouted fibers also exist in 50 % Dab 1 mutant at a less modest degree compared to reln −/− mice, while in the other half, only misrouted axons are found, again less than those in reln −/− mutant.|$|E
40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD), first successfully {{carried out in}} humans in the early 1990 s, initially involved the PCR sexing of embryos by Y- (and later also X-) chromosome specific detection. Because of the problems relating to misdiagnosis and contamination of this technology however the PCR based test was superseded by a FISH-based approach involving X and Y specific probes. Sexing by FISH heralded translocation screening, which was shortly followed by preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) for Aneuploidy. Aneuploidy is widely accepted to be {{the leading cause of}} implantation failure in assisted reproductive technology (ART) and a major contributor to miscarriage, especially in women of advanced maternal age. PGS (AKA PGD for aneuploidy PGD-A) has had a chequered history, with conflicting lines of evidence for and against its use. The current practice of trophectoderm biopsy followed by array CGH or next generation sequencing is gaining in popularity however as evidence for its efficacy grows. PGS has the potential to identify viable embryos that can be transferred thereby reducing the chances of traumatic failed IVF cycles, miscarriage or congenital abnormalities and facilitating the quickest time to live birth of chromosomally normal offspring. In parallel to chromosomal diagnoses, technology for PGD has allowed for improvements in accuracy and efficiency of the genetic screening of embryos for monogenic disorders. The number of genetic conditions available for screening has increased {{since the early days of}} PGD, with the human fertilization and embryology authority currently licensing 419 conditions in the UK [1].

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} of circRNAs' expression level to the negative- and positive symptoms of patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Methods Gene <b>chip</b> <b>screening</b> was performed with the peripheral blood samples from each five of SZ patients and normal controls. Nine circRNAs showing differentiate expression were confirmed, and further verification was done by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR in 102 SZ patients and 103 normal controls. All the SZ patients were assessed with Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Results It was revealed that the expression levels of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 102315, circRNA_ 104597, circRNA_ 101835 and circRNA_ 101836 were significantly down-regulated (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and circRNA_ 103102 and circRNA_ 103704 were up-regulated in SZ group (P< 0. 01). The ΔCT value of circRNA_ 102101 and circRNA_ 103102 was positively correlated to the positive symptoms (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and the ΔCT value of circRNA_ 103704 also showed positive correlation with positive symptoms and general psychopathological symptoms (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). The ΔCT values of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 102315, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were correlated with thinking disorder (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and the ΔCT values of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 104597, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were correlated with the activation (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). The ΔCT values of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were positively correlated with paranoid (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were markedly correlated with assault (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). Therefore, circRNA_ 103704 was chosen into regressive equation of positive symptoms (P< 0. 01), and circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102315 were chosen into regressive equation of general pathological findings (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). Conclusion The expression levels of circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 103102 are obviously up-regulated in SZ patients than in normal controls, and markedly correlated with the negative and positive SZ symptoms, so might be the dominant regulatory factors in the pathological process of schizophrenia.

After the velocities of the waves traveling through the thickness of the boards were recorded, the internal bond strengths were tested. Results showed the density, internal bond state, and constituted chip geometry were the main factors influencing the velocity.

Methods: A consanguineous family of Middle Eastern origin was identified, and affected members underwent a full clinical evaluation. Linkage analysis was performed using the Affymetrix 50 K chip. Regions of homozygosity were identified. The positional candidate genes protocadherin 21 (PCDH 21), retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR), and MERTK were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and sequenced. Long-range PCR was performed to characterize the deletion. Two hundred and ninety-two probands with autosomal recessive, childhood onset, retinal dystrophies were analyzed using the Asper Ophthalmics Leber congenital amaurosis <b>chip</b> to <b>screen</b> for known MERTK mutations. Results: Analysis of a 50 K-Affymetrix whole genome scan identified three regions of homozygosity on chromosomes 2 and 10. Screening of the candidate gene MERTK showed a possible deletion of exon 8.

TGF- is a potent inducer of lung fibrosis, and it regulates the ATII cell pheno-type; however, direct TGF- target genes controlling the ATII cell phenotype remain elusive. Here, we identified the transgelin (tagln) gene as a novel imme-diate target of TGF-/Smad 3 -dependent gene expres-sion in ATII cells using a Smad 3 chromatin immuno-precipitation (<b>ChIP)</b> <b>screen.</b> Direct <b>ChIP</b> confirmed the rapid and specific binding of Smad 3 to the tagln promoter. Luciferase assays demonstrated transactiva-tion of the tagln promoter by activin-like kinase (Alk) 5 -mediated TGF- signaling. TGF- treatment resulted in rapid up-regulation of tagln, but not tagln 2, mRNA and protein expression, assessed by reverse transcrip-tion-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In vivo, tagln expres-sion was significantly increased in ATII cells of mice during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, {{as well as in}} lung specimen obtained from IPF patients, as assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of tagln using siRNA inhibited TGF [...] induced migration of lung epithelial A 549 cells, as well as primary ATII cells. We thus identified tagln as a novel target of TGF-/Smad 3 -dependent gene expression in ATII cells. Increased ATII cell expression of tagln in exper-imental and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may contrib-ute to TGF [...] dependent ATII cell injury, repair, and migration in lung fibrosis. —Yu, H., Königshoff, M. ...|$|R

The main goal {{of the current study}} was to identify other proteins secreted from ghrelin cells. An initial gene <b>chip</b> <b>screen</b> using mRNAs derived from highly enriched pools of mouse gastric ghrelin cells demonstrated high levels of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP 4) and transthyretin (TTR), both of which are known to circulate in the bloodstream bound to each other.

RBP 4 protein also was shown to be secreted into the culture medium of ghrelin cell lines. Neither acute nor chronic caloric restriction had a significant effect on RBP 4 mRNA levels within stomachs of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, although both manipulations significantly decreased stomach TTR mRNA levels. In vitro studies using PG- 1 cells showed no effect on RBP 4 release of octanoic acid, epinephrine or norepinephrine, all of which are known to act directly on ghrelin cells to stimulate ghrelin secretion.

Methods Forty patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were admitted. P 2 Y 12 reaction unit (PRU) was detected by VerifyNow. Forty patients were divided into high platelet reactivity group (high reactivity group, n= 24) and normal platelet reactivity group (normal reactivity group, n= 16) according to the results of PRU detection. Plasma CCL 2 concentration of the STEMI patients was examined by ELISA. The expressions of CCL 2 and CCR 2 in the platelets were detected by Western blotting. After CCL 2 stimulation, the kinases of which phosphorylation was changed in the platelets were screened by ARY 003 B protein chips. The phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK and HSP 27 in the platelets was tested by Western blotting after CCL 2 stimulation in {{the presence or absence of}} CCR 2 antagonist (RS 102895) or p 38 MAPK signal pathway inhibitor (SB 203580). Results The plasma CCL 2 concentration of high reactivity group was markedly higher than that of normal reactivity group. Moreover, compared with normal reactivity group, the expressions of CCL 2 and CCR 2 in the platelets of high reactivity group significantly increased.
