The capability of an electromagnetic radiating system {{depends on its}} ability to operate effectively in a complex environment, where its pattern performance can be limited by pattern distortion effects. On a modern military ship, this task is complicated by the large number of systems that are competing for prime locations. It is recommended, therefore, that a given situation be studied systematically, looking at individual pieces of the problem separately and developing intermediate conclusions. This thesis investigates computer antenna models to improve shipboard antenna systems performance for HF, VHF and UHF bands. Possible improvements for present ships might lead to the reduction of the number of existing antennas. Two different computer models are investigated for various geometry: (1) a 'multi-wire' whip antenna and (2) an inverted <b>cone</b> <b>antenna.</b> Both are modeled by using wire grids, in the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC).

Desirable features of a wideband antenna are low-profile, dual-polarization and wide bandwidth in a compact size.

The steerable MEMS antenna of this work was comprised of a planar antenna {{on top of a}} Silicon membrane. The membrane is etched to create a gimbal hinge structure and a platform which supported the antenna and gave it one or two degrees of freedom of rotation. The antennas presented were broadband and fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line which traversed the hinge structure. The antenna 2 ̆ 7 s orientation in space was designed to be changed through electrostatic actuation of the antenna platform 2 ̆ 7 s hinges. The goal of this thesis was to improve on the initial design and performance of the prototypic antenna. The best variation of the prototype antenna could rotate ± 4. 0 ° in two degrees of freedom under 800 VDC of actuation voltage and had a bandwidth of 1. 55. The mechanical and electrical aspects of the device were studied and analyzed concurrently. Three variations of the MEMS antenna platform were design and modeled; Generations 1 - 3 (G 1 - G 3). The G 1 platform was an optimized version of the prototypic MEMS platform. The G 2 platform could rotate in two dimensions but had much thinner hinges and a more robust antenna platform.

When the wave hits a buried object such as rebars in the bridge, the receiving antenna records variations in the reflected return signal. GPR data usually consist of changes of reflection strength and arrival time of specific reflections, source wave distortion, and signal attenuation. The rebar detections are marked by hyperbolic shapes in the GPR image (see Figure 4).

40|$|Biconical antennas are {{of great}} {{interest}} to those who deal with broadband applications including the transmission/reception of pulses. In particular, wide-angle conical antennas are an attractive choice in many applications including Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and the measurements of transient surface currents and charge densities on aircraft. ^ Dielectric loading in the interior region of a conical antenna can be used {{to reduce the size of}} the antenna especially at low frequencies and/or for structural strength. Therefore, having an analytical solution for the input impedance and the frequency response is very helpful in optimizing the design and understanding the behavior of the antenna. From the quasi-analytical solution for the input impedance and the electric field of a wide-angle conical antenna, it can be seen that the dielectric loading in the antenna region improves the input impedance at low frequencies, but increases the number of resonance points and the magnitude of these peaks. ^ When an inhomogeneous dielectric load is used, the magnitude of the resonance peaks is decreased (depending on the way the load is distributed), improving the input impedance of the antenna significantly. ^ Introducing a dielectric load in the interior region of an electrically short receiving <b>cone</b> makes the <b>antenna</b> behave as an electrically longer antenna. However, this is not true for the case for electrical 1 y long antennas. For the case of pulse transmission, the dielectric load affects only the amplitude. Of course, if the dielectric fills the whole space, both transmitting and receiving antennas behave as electrically longer antennas. ...|$|R
