40|$|Purpose:Stereopsis is {{the highest}} form of {{binocular}} visual processing, in which relative depth information is extracted from two slightly different retinal images. During the process, the visual brain receives and compares the signals sent from the two eyes. However, the two eyes do not always have equal access to the visual brain. Just as hand dominance, ocular dominance, the tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other, also exists. It {{is not clear whether}} fine stereopsis(lower stereothreshold and quicker response) would only be found in persons with two balanced eyes. This hypothesis has never been tested before because traditional methods to measure ocular dominance were qualitative, which can only identify the dominant eye without showing the degree of dominance. In this study, we set to quantify the relationship between stereopsis and ocular sensory dominance. Methods:Thirty subjects participated in the study. For each subject, ocular dominance was quantified with the <b>continuous</b> <b>flashing</b> technique and ocular dominance index(ODI) was computed. For stereopsis, the stereothresholds were measured with 5 viewing durations ranged from 25 to 400 ms. The functions for stereothresholds versus viewing durations were analyzed by an empirical model of quadratic summation, in the form of th= Dmin(t- 2 +Tmin- 2) 0. 5 where th is the stereothreshold at a given viewing duration(t), Tmin is the constant that determines the horizontal position of the function, which is related to the time at which the stereothreshold becomes independent of duration(critical duration).

It is long assumed that both attentional selection and perceptual grouping require consciousness, but this view has been challenged {{in recent years by}} empirical findings suggesting the opposite. In this study, we study whether awareness of a collinear contour is a prerequisite of its interplay with selective attention. We employed a phenomenon that attentional search was delayed when a target overlapped spatially with a collinearly grouped distractor in comparison to when a target did not overlap with the distractor (Jingling and Tseng, 2013). We first identified that visible long (= 9 elements), but not short (= 3 elements) collinear distractor slowed observers' detection of an overlapping target. Then we masked part of a long distractor (= 9 elements) with <b>continuous</b> <b>flashing</b> color patches (= 6 elements) so that the combined dichoptic percept to observers' awareness was a short collinear distractor (= 3 elements). We assessed whether the invisible parts impacted selective attention the same way as supra-threshold collinear parts. We found that the invisible collinear parts, like visible ones, could join the visible parts to form a full-length contour to impair search. This implies that collinear integration does not require awareness of all elements, and the interaction between collinear grouping and attention is likely at an early site where awareness is not critical for processin...|$|E

These inconsistencies may relate {{to the extent to}} which the lesions used encroach on different subfields of n. acc. and the use of different task variants. The present study compared the effects of selective lesions of shell and core subfields of nucleus accumbens (n. acc.) across aversive and appetitive trace conditioning variants. In both experiments, an auditory stimulus was contiguous with footshock or food, or presented at a trace interval. A <b>continuous</b> <b>flashing</b> light in each case provided an experimental background stimulus. Conditioning to the cues provided by the experimental chambers was also assessed.

In Experiment 1. the core lesion reduced the difference between trace and contiguously conditioned groups, in responding to the discrete noise stimulus.

Controversy exists concerning whether emotionally valenced information facilitates or inhibits orientation of spatial attention when presented without observers' awareness.

In contrast to prediction, reaction time and accuracy to the target stimuli were unaffected by the validity and valence of emotional faces, though some evidence was found for unique processing of fearful faces.

40|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to understand the essence of unilateral spatial neglect and to design an effective treatment. Attention facilitating effects in neglect patients have been reported separately both for audiovisual and for looming stimulation. The current study attempts to improve the orientation of attention to the neglected (left) hemi-space using a multisensory synchronous combination of audiovisual and looming stimulation. Unilateral spatial neglect can be described as a problem with the disengagement from the right hemi-space and a reduced attention for the left, leading to a loss of perceptual awareness for the left side of the surroundings. Because of this primarily quantitative – behavioural - difference between patients and healthy people a simulation of the effects with an experimental technique in healthy participants could be valuable. In our study the awareness of the left side of the visual field was inhibited in healthy participants using <b>continuous</b> <b>flash</b> suppression, a potent form of binocular rivalry wherein a visual stimulus presented to one eye is suppressed from awareness as a result of a rapidly changing sequence of high-contrast, contour-rich patterns viewed by the other eye.

40|$|Until recently, it {{has been}} thought that under interocular {{suppression}} high-level visual processing is strongly inhibited if not abolished. With the development of <b>continuous</b> <b>flash</b> suppression (CFS), a variant of binocular rivalry, this notion has now been challenged {{by a number of}} reports showing that even high-level aspects of visual stimuli, such as familiarity, affect the time stimuli need to overcome CFS and emerge into awareness. In this "breaking <b>continuous</b> <b>flash</b> suppression" (b-CFS) paradigm, differential unconscious processing during suppression is inferred when (a) speeded detection responses to initially invisible stimuli differ, and (b) no comparable differences are found in non-rivalrous control conditions supposed to measure non-specific threshold differences between stimuli. The aim {{of the present study was}} to critically evaluate these assumptions. In six experiments we compared the detection of upright and inverted faces. We found that not only under CFS, but also in control conditions upright faces were detected faster and more accurately than inverted faces, although the effect was larger during CFS. However, reaction time (RT) distributions indicated critical differences between the CFS and the control condition. When RT distributions were matched, similar effect sizes were obtained in both conditions. Moreover, subjective ratings revealed that CFS and control conditions are not perceptually comparable. These findings cast doubt on the usefulness of non-rivalrous control conditions to rule out non-specific threshold differences as a cause of shorter detection latencies during CFS. Thus, at least in its present form, the b-CFS paradigm cannot provide unequivocal evidence for unconscious processing under interocular suppression. Nevertheless, our findings also demonstrate that the b-CFS paradigm can be fruitfully applied as a highly sensitive device to probe differences between stimuli in their potency to gain access to awareness...|$|R

We replicated this paradigm and further investigated whether colour terms likewise influence the detection of colours or colour-associated object images suppressed from visual awareness by <b>continuous</b> <b>flash</b> suppression. This method presents rapidly changing visual noise to one eye while the target stimulus is presented to the other. It has been shown to delay conscious perception of a target for up to several minutes. In Experiment 1 we presented greyscale photos of objects.

Detection sensitivity (d') and hit rates were significantly poorer for suppressed objects preceded by an incongruent label compared to a congruent label or noise. In Experiment 2, targets were coloured discs preceded by a colour term. Detection sensitivity was significantly worse for suppressed colour patches preceded by an incongruent colour term as compared to a congruent term or white noise. In Experiment 3 targets were suppressed greyscale object images preceded by an auditory presentation of a colour term. On congruent trials the colour term matched the object's stereotypical colour and on incongruent trials the colour term mismatched. Detection sensitivity was significantly poorer on incongruent trials than congruent trials. Overall, these findings suggest that colour terms affect awareness of coloured stimuli and colour- associated objects, and provide new evidence for language-perception interaction in the brain...|$|R
