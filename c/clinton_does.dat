5000|$|She adds: [...] "Sexism is insidious, {{unconscious}} and affects {{women as well}} as men. Just because women didn't turn out in big enough numbers for Mrs <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> not mean we should dismiss the troubling sexism and misogyny that marred the campaign... The fact so many women in America voted for Mr Trump over Mrs Clinton is a get-out-of-jail-free card: female voters weren't bothered, so it can't be sexist. It can, and it is." ...|$|E
5000|$|When <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> {{not return}} from the second evening's {{installment}} of the game, where the second card was revealed to be [...] "YOU are a HOMOSEXUAL," [...] the guests return ashore and discover Clinton's corpse. Before contacting authorities, one reveals that his card reads, [...] "YOU are a HIT-AND-RUN KILLER." [...] This begins a macabre game of musical chairs of sorts, with guests jousting over who lays claim to which dirty little secret. Paranoia grows over the obvious implication that both Sheila and Clinton were killed by somebody on this yacht.|$|E

5000|$|On December 7, 2015, in a New York Times op-ed, Clinton {{outlined}} {{her plans}} for regulating Wall Street. Clinton wrote: [...] "As president, I {{would not only}} veto any legislation that would weaken financial reform, but I would also fight for tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability that go well beyond Dodd-Frank." [...] Clinton also called for an enhanced Volcker rule that would close [...] "loopholes that still allow banks to make speculative gambles with taxpayer-backed deposits." [...] <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> not support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, a law (repealed in 1999) that mandated the separation of commercial and investment banks, preferring instead other tools to combat systemic risk, including [...] "a 'risk fee' on the financial institutions with assets over $50 billion, regulations on the 'shadow banking' sector (i.e. hedge funds) and guidelines for prosecuting financial wrongdoing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hillary Clinton easily {{beat the}} [...] "uncommitted" [...] votes during pre-primary polls. However, the Detroit Free Press {{questioned}} whether {{the results of the}} Michigan Democratic Primary demonstrated anything. None of the major candidates in the Democratic Party campaigned at all in Michigan, and all had pledged not to participate in the primary. The Detroit Free Press was also questioning whether Clinton's polling results would have held up during the actual primary. J. Ann Selzer of Selzer & Company, director of The Detroit Free Press-Local 4 Michigan Poll, said, [...] "In my mind, if <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> not get a majority, then more voters were against her than with her." [...] According to the poll, if the other major contenders were to appear in the ballot, Clinton would receive 46% of the vote, Obama would receive 23%, and Edwards would get 13% while 42% of the uncommitted vote would go to Obama.|$|E
5000|$|Lord <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} an {{executive}} role in directing the operations, but is nevertheless [...] "inextricably linked to all on the estate". Clinton Devon Estates is not an incorporated entity but is governed by trustees, [...] "in partnership with the family". There are 30 different trusts involved in the governance structure. The present Director (which post was formerly known as [...] "Agent" [...] or [...] "Steward") is John Varley, appointed in 2000, a former executive at British Telecom and {{an officer in the}} Territorial Army and {{a board member of the}} Government quango Environment Agency. His employment brief was [...] "to put the estate on a more sound commercial footing and identify areas for growth, while also looking to the future". He stated in 2013: [...] "A long-term mindset influences all I do... We have to make money while also thinking about what we are leaving. The family ethos underpins all. There is the whole principle of stewardship". Since 2000 he has refocused the business away from unprofitable and risky businesses such as selling tractors, garden machinery and furniture and onto core property and land operations and has doubled net income. He attended a course at the International Institute for Management Development business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Lord Clinton’s son and heir apparent Charles Fane Trefusis, the non-executive chairman of CCH, the property investment and development arm. The estate's 10-year plan in 2013 aimed to double income once more and to complete a £14m investment in phase two of the development of Liverton business park, including the building of 500 houses, and to invest in renewable energy projects.|$|E

40|$|The Democratic and GOP {{conventions}} were {{an illustration}} of the “Two Americas” that John Edwards spoke of in 2004, writes Walter Dean Burnham. While the GOP’s convention had a hateful atmosphere, and displayed a party closing in on itself, the Democrats by contrast, focused on the ‘Politics of Joy’. Even if Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>does</b> take the White House, however, he warns that she could still be facing a GOP-held Senate and House next January, which would continue the political gridlock that President Obama has faced {{for the past two}} years...|$|E

50|$|Among the series' {{segments}} is one {{in which}} he criticized Rudy Giuliani for questioning Hillary Clinton's health, noting that <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not question Giuliani's health when she was running for the Senate from New York, even though he had previously had prostate cancer.|$|R

25|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> {{not mention}} DOMA in his 2004 autobiography. Over time, Clinton's public {{position}} on same-sex marriage shifted.

In July 2009, he officially came out in support for same-sex marriage.|$|R
25|$|Johnson County is {{at present}} and {{historically}} a powerfully Republican county.

50|$|George H. W. Bush did not {{participate}} in the weekly radio address during his term, while Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> so, often going over ten minutes with some speeches early in his term.

5000|$|BBC Magazine cites a 1998 {{statement}} [...] "I did {{not have}} sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky", by U.S. President Bill Clinton, made during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, as a [...] "non-denial denial". <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not deny that he was fellated; and under a certain legalistic definition, [...] "sexual relations" [...] does not include fellatio.|$|R

50|$|In 1996, the Republican-majority House and Senate {{voted to}} allow {{drilling}} in ANWR, but this legislation was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. Toward {{the end of}} his presidential term environmentalists pressed Clinton to declare the Arctic Refuge a U.S. National Monument. Doing so would have permanently closed the area to oil exploration. While <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> create several refuge monuments, the Arctic Refuge was not among them.|$|R
50|$|In November 2007, the Obama presidential {{campaign}} released a policy document delaying NASA's Constellation program by {{five years to}} fund education programs. There was concern that any delay would prolong the gap after the Space Shuttle's retirement, when the US would be dependent on the Russian government {{for access to the}} International Space Station. Other presidential candidates, including Hillary <b>Clinton,</b> <b>did</b> not support the delay.|$|R
50|$|He was the Democrats' {{chief counsel}} (1995-1996) on the Senate Whitewater Committee which {{investigated}} {{a variety of}} allegations involving Bill and Hillary Clinton.

50|$|During the 1990s, Bill Clinton's {{official}} photographer was Vietnam {{war veteran}} Bob McNeely, {{who chose to}} shoot his photographs in black and white.

50|$|President-elect Bill Clinton {{appointed}} Cole to his {{transition team}} for education, labor, {{the arts and}} humanities in 1992.

2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not have a {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the Clinton administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda {{to pass on to}} the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|R

50|$|Since the New Deal, {{the county}} has shown a steady trend away from the Democratic Party due to major shifts in that party’s views - {{initially}} on economic policies, and since the 1990s on social issues.
