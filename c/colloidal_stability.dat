Antibodies are highly diverse molecules, with much of the sequence variation observed within variable domain families and, in particular, their complementarity determining regions.

40|$|Functionalization of {{nanoparticles}} {{can significantly}} influence their properties and potential applications. Although researchers can now functionalize metal, metal oxide, and organic polymer nanoparticles {{with a high}} degree of precision, controlled surface functionalization of nanoscale coordination polymer particles (CPPs) has remained a significant challenge. The lack of methodology is perhaps one of the greatest roadblocks to the advancement of CPPs into high added-value drug delivery applications. Here, we report having achieved this goal through a stepwise formation and functionalization protocol. We fabricated robust nanoparticles with enhanced thermal and <b>colloidal</b> <b>stabilities</b> by incorporation of carboxyl groups and these surface carboxyl groups could be subsequently functionalized through well-known peptide coupling reactions. The set of chemistries that we employed as proof-of-concept enabled a plethora of new functional improvements for the application of CPPs as drug delivery carriers, including enhanced <b>colloidal</b> <b>stabilities</b> and the incorporation of additional functional groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or fluorescent dyes that enabled tracking of their cellular uptake. Finally, we ascertained the cytotoxicity of the new CPP nanoparticles loaded with camptothecin to human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF- 7). Efflux measurements show that the encapsulation of camptothecin enhances the potency of the drug 6. 5 -fold and increases the drug retention within the cell.

The figure of {{the zeta potential}} dependence indicates that the value of the zeta potential changes insignificantly with the pH increase for a given concentration of the electrolyte. The dependence of the zeta potential in the pH function allows to assume that pHIEP has the value < 2 and is lower than pHZPC. With the rise of absolute value of zeta potential, generally, colloidal particles have good dispersion properties, simultaneously with the rise of electrostatic repelling, it is visible for the Pyrolox™/NaCl system.|$|R

Unfortunately wood pitch fixatives do not eliminate wood resin deposition all of the time. Wood pitch deposition is a potential bottleneck in the reduction of water used to make paper. In order to address these problems a study into the nature of the interactions which occur between cationic polymeric fixatives, wood resins and wood fibres has been undertaken. During the course of these investigations a novel pitch fixative has been designed: guar gumgraft-poly(acrylamide-co-diallyldimethYlammonium chloride). The nature of interactions was explored through a number of techniques. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to quantify the interaction between cationic polymeric fixatives and wood resins; for the first time. Laser particle size analysis (LPSA) was used to determine the effect of cationic polymeric fixatives addition on <b>colloidal</b> particle <b>stability.</b> Deposition studies were used to test interaction theories between cationic polymeric fixatives, wood resins and wood fibres. It was found that wood pitch fixatives worked in one of two ways; by either disrupting <b>colloidal</b> extractive <b>stability,</b> or by maintaining <b>colloidal</b> extractive <b>stability.</b> The novel fixative GG-g-p(AM-co-DADMAC) is unique in that it takes advantage of the colloidal stabilising features of a natural product (i. e. guar gum) and the wood pitch fixative properties of a synthetic polymer (i. e. p(AM-co-DADMAC)) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChitosan-hyaluronan (HYA) {{polyelectrolyte}} complexes (PECs) {{were designed}} to maintain their <b>colloidal</b> <b>stabilities</b> in physiological ionic strength and pH, via a new concept of ternary complexes. This strategy relied on {{the formation of a}} binary PEC between chitosan and a strong polyacid, dextran sulphate (DS) or heparin (HEP), and further functionalization with HYA. The major parameter leading to stabilized colloids was a high ratio of the degrees of polymerization of chitosan versus the strong polyacid. The process afforded either positive or negative particles when HYA was used in default or in excess (vs. chitosan) for the functionalization of the binary complexes. The most stable formulations were loaded with an antiretroviral drug tenofovir (TF), and could be surface functionalized with targeting IgAs. In vitro, the cationic TF loaded ternary complexes exhibited an inhibition of infection of PBMCs by the HIV- 1 virus, superior to the free drug...|$|R

Alternatively, acidification will destabilize a dispersion with a carboxylic acid surfactant.

We describe the experimental results in the frame of a kinetic model based on population balance equations, which allows one to discriminate the contributions of the conformational and of the <b>colloidal</b> <b>stabilities</b> to the global aggregation rate. Finally, we propose an expression for the aggregation rate constant, which accounts for solution viscosity, protein-protein interactions, as well as aggregate compactness. All these effects can be quantified by light scattering techniques. It is found that the model describes well the experimental data under dilute conditions. Under concentrated conditions, good model predictions are obtained when the solution pH is far below the isoelectric point (pI) of the mAb. However, peculiar effects arise when the solution pH is increased toward the mAb pI, and possible explanations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of mixed}} ligand layers {{including}} poly(ethylene glycol) -based ligands for the functionalization of nanoparticles {{is a very}} popular strategy {{in the context of}} nanomedicine. However, it is challenging to control the composition of the ligand layer and maintain high <b>colloidal</b> and chemical <b>stability</b> of the conjugates. A high level of control and stability are crucial for reproducibility, upscaling, and safe application. In this study, gold nanoparticles with well-defined mixed ligand layers of α-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) -ω-(11 -mercaptoundecanoate) (PEGMUA) and 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) were synthesized and characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The <b>colloidal</b> and chemical <b>stability</b> of the conjugates was tested by dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV/vis spectroscopy based experiments, and their interactions with cells were analyzed by elemental analysis. We demonstrate that the alkylene spacer in PEGMUA is the key feature for the controlled synthesis of mixed layer conjugates with very high <b>colloidal</b> and chemical <b>stability</b> and that a controlled synthesis is not possible using regular PEG ligands without the alkylene spacer. With the results of our stability tests, the molecular structure of the ligands can be clearly linked to the colloidal and chemical stabilization.

50|$|Onium salts, {{which have}} been used in the {{cathodic}} process, are not protonated bases and do not deposit by the mechanism of charge destruction. These type of materials can be deposited on the cathode by concentration coagulation and salting out. As the colloidal particles reach the solid object to be coated, they become squeezed together, and the water in the interstices is forced out. As the individual micelles are squeezed, they collapse to form increasingly larger micelles. <b>Colloidal</b> <b>stability</b> is inversely proportional {{to the size of the}} micelle, so as the micelles get bigger, they become less and less stable until they precipitate from solution onto the object to be coated. As more and more charged groups are concentrated into a smaller volume, this increases the ionic strength of the medium, which also assists in precipitating the materials out of solution.

40|$|An {{important}} step toward understanding interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and bacteria {{is the ability}} to directly observe NPs interacting with bacterial cells. NPbacteria mixtures typical in nanomedicine, however, are not yet amendable for direct imaging in solution. Instead, evidence of NPcell interactions must be preserved in derivative (usually dried) samples to be subsequently revealed in high-resolution images, e. g., via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Here, this concept is realized for a mixed suspension of model NPs and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. First, protocols for analyzing the relative <b>colloidal</b> <b>stabilities</b> of NPs and bacteria are developed and validated based on systematic centrifugation and comparison of colony forming unit (CFU) counting and optical density (OD) measurements. Rate-dependence of centrifugation efficiency for each component suggests differential sedimentation at a specific predicted rate as an effective method for removing free NPs after co-incubation; the remaining fraction comprises bacteria with any associated NPs and can be examined, e. g., by SEM, for evidence of NPbacteria interactions. These analytical protocols, validated by systematic control experiments and high-resolution SEM imaging, should be generally applicable for investigating NPbacteria interactions. financial support from the following sources: grant SFRH/BPD/ 47693 / 2008 from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT); FCT Strategic Project PEst-OE/EQB/LA 0023 / 2013; project “BioHealth Biotechnology and Bioengineering approaches to improve health quality”, Ref.

50|$|At {{the onset}} of polymerization, {{polymers}} remain in solution until they reach a critical molecular weight (MW), at which point they precipitate. These initial polymer particles are unstable and coagulate with other particles until stabilized particles form. After {{this point in the}} polymerization, growth only occurs by addition of monomer to the stabilized particles. As the polymer particles grow, stabilizer (or dispersant) molecules attach covalently to the surface. These stabilizer molecules are generally graft or block copolymers, and can be preformed or can form in situ during the reaction. Typically, one side of the stabilizer copolymer has an affinity for the solvent while the other side has an affinity for the polymer particle being formed. These molecules {{play a crucial role in}} dispersion polymerization by forming a “hairy layer” around the particles that prevents particle coagulation.

This ligand exchange can produce conjugation {{with a number of}} biomolecules from DNA to RNA to proteins to polymers (such as PEG) to increase biocompatibility and functionality.
