5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., <b>clomipramine).</b> The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. <b>Clomipramine</b> (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and <b>clomipramine</b> were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clomipramine</b> {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital heart defects in the newborn. It is also associated with reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. <b>Clomipramine</b> is also distributed in breast milk and hence nursing while taking <b>clomipramine</b> is advised against.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of <b>clomipramine</b> {{is approximately}} 50%. Peak plasma concentrations occur around 2–6hours (with {{an average of}} 4.7hours) after taking <b>clomipramine</b> orally and {{are in the range}} of 56–154ng/mL (178–489nmol/L). Steady-state concentrations of <b>clomipramine</b> are around 134–532ng/mL (426–1,690nmol/L), with an average of 218ng/mL (692nmol/L), and are reached after 7 to 14days of repeated dosing. Steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, are around 230–550ng/mL (730–1,750nmol/L). The volume of distribution (Vd) of <b>clomipramine</b> is approximately 17L/kg. It binds approximately 97–98% to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. <b>Clomipramine</b> is metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP2D6. It has a terminal half-life of 32hours, and its N-desmethyl metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, has a terminal half-life of approximately 69hours. <b>Clomipramine</b> is mostly excreted in urine (60%) and feces (32%).|$|E
25|$|A {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} study found that a single low dose of 10mg <b>clomipramine</b> to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50mg fluvoxamine. In the study, single doses of 5 to 50mg <b>clomipramine</b> resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while single doses of 12.5 to 50mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with <b>clomipramine</b> and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day citalopram. These results indicate that very low doses of <b>clomipramine</b> are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that <b>clomipramine</b> achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, <b>clomipramine</b> {{may be able to}} achieve more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>clomipramine</b> shows around 100- to 200-fold {{preference}} in {{affinity for the}} SERT over the NET, its major active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (norclomipramine), binds to the NET with very high affinity (Ki = 0.32nM) and with dramatically reduced affinity for the SERT (Ki = 31.6nM). Moreover, desmethylclomipramine circulates at concentrations that are approximately twice those of <b>clomipramine.</b> In accordance, occupancy of both the SERT and the NET has been shown with <b>clomipramine</b> administration in positron emission tomography studies with humans and non-human primates. As such, <b>clomipramine</b> {{is in fact a}} fairly balanced SNRI rather than only a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).|$|E
25|$|If the {{ratios of}} the 80% SERT {{occupancy}} dosage and the approved clinical dosage range are calculated and compared for SSRIs, SNRIs, and <b>clomipramine,</b> it can be deduced that <b>clomipramine</b> {{is by far the}} strongest SRI used medically. The lowest approved dosage of <b>clomipramine</b> can be estimated to be roughly comparable in SERT occupancy to the maximum approved dosages of the strongest SSRIs and SNRIs. Because their mechanism of action was originally not known and dose-ranging studies were never conducted, first-generation antipsychotics were dramatically overdosed in patients. It has been suggested that the same may have been true for <b>clomipramine</b> and other TCAs.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>clomipramine</b> is {{similarly}} or {{more effective in}} the treatment of OCD compared to SSRIs, it is greatly inferior to them in terms of tolerability and safety due to its lack of selectivity for the SERT and promiscuous pharmacological activity. In addition, <b>clomipramine</b> has high toxicity in overdose and can potentially result in death, whereas death rarely, if ever, occurs with overdose of SSRIs. It is for these reasons that <b>clomipramine,</b> in spite of potentially superior effectiveness to SSRIs, is now rarely used as a first-line agent {{in the treatment of}} OCD, with SSRIs being used as first-line therapies instead and <b>clomipramine</b> generally being reserved for more severe cases.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for overdose and all treatment is purely supportive and symptomatic. Treatment with activated charcoal {{may be used}} to limit absorption in cases of oral overdose. Anyone suspected of overdosing on <b>clomipramine</b> should be hospitalised and kept under close surveillance for at least 72 hours. <b>Clomipramine</b> has been reported as being less toxic in overdose than most other TCAs in one meta-analysis but this may well be due to the circumstances surrounding most overdoses as <b>clomipramine</b> is more frequently used to treat conditions for which the rate of suicide is not particularly high such as OCD. In another meta-analysis, however, <b>clomipramine</b> was associated with a significant degree of toxicity in overdose.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{high doses}} of SRIs are needed for {{effectiveness}} {{in the treatment of}} OCD. Studies have found that high dosages of SSRIs above the normally recommended maximums are significantly more effective in OCD treatment than lower dosages (e.g., 250 to 400mg/day sertraline versus 200mg/day sertraline). In addition, the combination of <b>clomipramine</b> and SSRIs has also been found to be significantly more effective in alleviating OCD symptoms, and <b>clomipramine</b> is commonly used to augment SSRIs for this reason. Studies have found that intravenous <b>clomipramine,</b> which is associated with very high circulating concentrations of the drug and a much higher ratio of <b>clomipramine</b> to its metabolite desmethylclomipramine, is more effective than oral <b>clomipramine</b> in the treatment of OCD. There is a case report of complete remission from OCD for approximately one month following a massive overdose of fluoxetine, an SSRI with a uniquely long duration of action. Taken together, stronger serotonin reuptake inhibition has consistently been associated with greater alleviation of OCD symptoms, and since <b>clomipramine,</b> at the clinical dosages in which it is employed, is effectively the strongest SRI used medically (see table above), this may underlie its unique effectiveness in the treatment of OCD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clomipramine</b> is {{a strong}} SRI. Its {{affinity}} for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14nM, which is considerably {{higher than that of}} other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, amitriptyline, and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4nM, 4.3nM, and 8.3nM, respectively. In addition, <b>clomipramine</b> has a terminal half-life that is around twice as long as that of amitriptyline and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, <b>clomipramine</b> is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and imipramine. For these reasons, <b>clomipramine</b> is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, <b>clomipramine</b> is similarly potent or even more potent as an SRI than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
25|$|Cataplexy {{associated}} with narcolepsy. Which is a TGA and MHRA-labeled indication for <b>clomipramine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Clomipramine</b> is a reuptake {{inhibitor}} of serotonin and norepinephrine, or a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); that is, it {{blocks the}} reuptake of these neurotransmitters back into neurons by {{preventing them from}} interacting with their transporters, thereby increasing their extracellular concentrations in the synaptic cleft and resulting in increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. In addition, <b>clomipramine</b> also has antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, antidopaminergic, and anticholinergic activities. It is specifically an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 receptor, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5). Like other TCAs, <b>clomipramine</b> weakly blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{exceptionally}} strong serotonin reuptake {{inhibition of}} <b>clomipramine</b> likely precludes {{the possibility of}} its antagonism of serotonin receptors (which it binds to with more than 100-fold lower affinity than the SERT) resulting in a net decrease in signaling by these receptors. In accordance, while serotonin receptor antagonists like cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine are effective as antidotes against serotonin syndrome, <b>clomipramine</b> is nonetheless capable of inducing this syndrome. In fact, while all TCAs are SRIs and serotonin receptor antagonists to varying extents, the only TCAs {{that are associated with}} serotonin syndrome are <b>clomipramine</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} its dechlorinated analogue imipramine, which are the two most potent SRIs of the TCAs (and in relation to this have the highest ratios of serotonin reuptake inhibition to serotonin receptor antagonism). As such, whereas other TCAs can be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (with caution due to the risk of hypertensive crisis from NET inhibition; sometimes done in treatment-resistant depressives), <b>clomipramine</b> cannot be due to the risk of serotonin syndrome and death. Unlike the case of its serotonin receptor antagonism, orthostatic hypotension is a common side effect of <b>clomipramine,</b> suggesting that its blockade of the α1-adrenergic receptor is strong enough to overcome the stimulatory effects on the α1-adrenergic receptor of its NET inhibition.|$|E
25|$|The {{antidepressant}} {{effects of}} <b>clomipramine</b> {{are thought to}} be due to reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine, while serotonin reuptake inhibition only is thought to be responsible for the effectiveness of <b>clomipramine</b> in the treatment of OCD. Conversely, antagonism of the H1, α1-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is thought to contribute to its side effects. Blockade of the H1 receptor is specifically responsible for the antihistamine effects of <b>clomipramine</b> and side effects like sedation and somnolence (sleepiness). Antagonism of the α1-adrenergic receptor is thought to cause orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. Inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is responsible for the anticholinergic side effects of <b>clomipramine</b> like dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive/memory impairment. In overdose, sodium channel blockade in the brain is believed to cause the coma and seizures associated with TCAs while blockade of sodium channels in the heart is considered to cause cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. On the other hand, sodium channel blockade is also thought to contribute to the analgesic effects of TCAs, for instance in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clomipramine</b> is marketed {{throughout}} the world mainly under the brand names Anafranil and Clomicalm for use in humans and animals, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{may occur}} during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between {{the return of}} the original psychiatric disorder and <b>clomipramine</b> withdrawal symptoms is important. <b>Clomipramine</b> withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when <b>clomipramine</b> is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive cholinergic activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by tricyclic antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clomipramine</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, and trimipramine. <b>Clomipramine</b> is a derivative of imipramine with a chlorine atom added to one of its rings and {{is also known as}} 3-chloroimipramine. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethylclomipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of <b>clomipramine</b> is 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H23ClN2 with a molecular weight of 314.857g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 303-49-1 and of the hydrochloride is 17321-77-6.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to serotonin reuptake inhibition, <b>clomipramine</b> {{is also a}} mild but clinically significant antagonist of the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors at high concentrations. Addition of antipsychotics, which are potent dopamine receptor antagonists, to SSRIs, {{has been found to}} significantly augment their effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. As such, besides strong serotonin reuptake inhibition, <b>clomipramine</b> at high doses might also block dopamine receptors to treat OCD symptoms, and this could additionally or alternatively be involved in its possible effectiveness advantage over SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|In a {{meta-analysis}} of various trials involving fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and sertraline (Zoloft) {{to test their}} relative efficacies in treating OCD, <b>clomipramine</b> {{was found to be}} the most effective.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of <b>clomipramine</b> and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E

It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include desipramine (N-desmethylimipramine), <b>clomipramine</b> (3-chloroimipramine), trimipramine (2'-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine), and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Imipramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, <b>clomipramine,</b> dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of imipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H2N2 with a molecular weight of 280.407g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8.|$|E
25|$|Further {{criticism}} {{was directed at}} Dann's psychiatrists for failing to identify or take action regarding the signs of Dann's decreasing mental stability. At {{the time of her}} suicide, Dann was taking an unlicensed drug <b>clomipramine.</b> The effects of this drug were initially considered as contributing factors to Dann's mental well-being, but ultimately ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy has {{sometimes}} been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as <b>clomipramine,</b> imipramine, or protriptyline, {{as well as other}} drugs that suppress REM sleep. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant which blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has shown usefulness in managing symptoms of cataplexy, however, it has notable side-effects including sleep disruption.|$|E
25|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{a popular}} off-label {{use in the}} US. It is approved by the Australian TGA and the United Kingdom MHRA for this indication. Some have suggested the possible superior efficacy of <b>clomipramine</b> compared to other antidepressants {{in the treatment of}} MDD, although at the current time the evidence is insufficient to adequately substantiate this claim.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., <b>clomipramine</b> is only {{licensed}} to treat separation anxiety in dogs {{for which it}} is sold under the brand name Clomicalm. It has proven effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorders in cats and dogs. In dogs, it has also demonstrated similar efficacy to fluoxetine in treating tail chasing. In dogs some evidence suggests its efficacy in treating noise phobia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{treatment}} {{has been given}} to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches {{has been found to be}} most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, <b>clomipramine</b> was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective <b>clomipramine,</b> the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, <b>clomipramine,</b> trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, <b>clomipramine,</b> trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Although lipid rescue {{mechanism}} of action is not completely understood, the added lipid in the blood stream may act as a sink, allowing {{for the removal of}} lipophilic toxins from affected tissues. This theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for <b>clomipramine</b> toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with moxidectin toxicosis.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline is {{effective}} {{for the treatment}} of OCD in adults and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention to treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment <b>clomipramine.</b> It is generally accepted that the sertraline dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression.|$|E
