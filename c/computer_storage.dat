500|$|Bell {{was born}} in Akron, Ohio and {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he {{earned a degree in}} chemistry. After graduation, he worked for Intel as an electrical engineer before founding his own <b>computer</b> <b>storage</b> device company, SemiDisk Systems in 1982. When his company closed in 1992, Bell said he developed a [...] "phobia" [...] of financial and tax-related issues. He had been a Libertarian Party member and described his political beliefs as anarcho-libertarian. Bell attended three meetings of the Multnomah County Common Law Court (possessing no judicial authority according to Federal government laws) in Portland, Oregon, which put government officials on trial in absentia and awarded judgements against them. Bell attended these meetings in order to find government 'plants' in that group. Bell subsequently became involved in a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, which stated that he owed $30,000 to the federal government.|$|E
500|$|In August 1989, Chahi was {{impressed}} by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of Dragon's Lair had and thought that {{it would be possible to}} use vector outlines to create a similar effect using much less <b>computer</b> <b>storage.</b> After first attempting to write the graphical routines in C, he turned to assembly language. He wrote a polygon routine for the Motorola 68000 on an Atari ST to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a frame rate of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as [...] "a major turning point in the creation of the game" [...] and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work. He was able to take advantage of the Amiga's genlock capabilities to create rotoscoped animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called [...] "pixigons") to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on Deluxe Paint artwork, the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow, and he returned to using bitmapped images.|$|E
