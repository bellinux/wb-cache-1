5|$|Alongside fractals, {{chaos theory}} ranks as an {{essentially}} universal influence on patterns in nature. There {{is a relationship}} between <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> fractals—the strange attractors in chaotic systems have a fractal dimension. Some cellular automata, simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30.|$|E

5|$|While the WRO {{continues}} {{to fight the}} remnants of Deepground, Vincent transforms into Chaos {{in a desperate attempt}} to defeat Omega Weiss. Shelke dives inside Omega to find Lucrecia's Protomateria, and upon finding it, she gives it to Vincent, also telling him that his survival made Lucrecia happy. Vincent then takes control of <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> battles Omega. Omega sprouts wings and tries to ascend from the planet, but Vincent manages to destroy it, disappearing in the process. A week later, he is seen visiting Lucrecia's crystalline tomb in the Crystal Cave. He states that both <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> Omega have returned to the Planet, and he thanks Lucrecia for being the reason he survived. He is then found by Shelke outside the cave, and she tells him that everyone else is waiting for him.|$|E

5|$|Based on what rank Cole holds {{at the end}} of InFamous, two endings are possible. If Cole defeats Kessler as a Hero, he restores {{peace to}} Empire City and is hailed as a savior. Nevertheless, his estrangement from Zeke and Moya, coupled with the {{responsibilities}} of heroism, lead him to realize that he will always be alone. If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City to slip further into <b>chaos,</b> <b>and</b> disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing himself to be the strongest to ever exist.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E

5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.|$|E

Barbara's only surviving sibling, Harry, is {{in severe}} debt and commits suicide; many citizens blame Lord Devane, who helped run the South Sea Company, for the country's finances. At the Tamworth estate, Barbara and Roger attempt a reconciliation but he collapses from an apoplexy soon after while evaluating his own precarious financial situation in London.|$|E

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E

After an argument with Sakae, Wabisuke leaves the estate. Sakae later encourages Kenji {{to take care of}} Natsuki during a Koi-Koi match.|$|E
5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and <b>Chaos</b> <b>and</b> Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E

5|$|The German economy {{suffered}} severe setbacks {{after the}} end of World War I, partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> food riots. When the government failed to make the reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing <b>chaos</b> <b>and</b> horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E
