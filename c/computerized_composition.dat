40|$|Composition of piano minuets {{in early}} {{classical}} style takes an intermediate position between restricted and free <b>computerized</b> <b>composition</b> problems. One of its distinct features is that microstructure (i. e. relations between notes), macrostructure (i. e. relations between larger parts) and their interdependences {{have to be}} dealt with. In this paper, we give an overview of the process of composition which consists of the subtasks planning of macrostructure, construction of melody and rhythm, variation of melodic motives, and addition of bass and middle voices. We then present a knowledge-based approach with strategies for note by note construction of melody and melody variation. ...|$|E

In this paper, we describe a method for rule-based note by note composition of minuet melodies, which considers harmonic and structural descriptions given as prerequisite. We also present 16 -bar examples composed by the algorithm in the chord-based and the scale-based melody type with different parameter settings. The algorithm uses explicit knowledge about the composition. The paper describes sources of knowledge such as literature (especially period (historic) literature) and human experts. ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{need for}} the {{development}} of databases and standards of body composition in humans based on actual measurements, particularly the body fat rather than depending on some surrogate measures. This is because, the validity of body mass index as an indicator of body fat in cardiovascular risks and other conditions is recently challenged. Therefore, the present study was designed in an attempt to create a data base for the young Indian subjects. The body composition was assessed in 216 young male and female college students, aged between 18 and 22 years, using Futrex 5000 -A, an electronic, <b>computerized</b> body <b>composition</b> and fitness analyzer. The subjects were divided into normal, underweight and overweight subjects based on their body mass index. The results obtained showed that the body fat estimated (13 % to 25 % in males and 26 % to 35 % in females) was slightly higher in all groups as compared to 11 - 16 % (males) and 20 - 26 % (females) of some previous reports using other methods from India. Fat distribution was higher in the thigh region than in the abdomen or gluteal areas. A little over 4 % of the male and 10 % of the female subjects were overweight while 21 % of the male and 25 % of the females were undernourished despite the students were from well-to-do families. Lean body mass varied inversely with body fat ranging from 75 % to 87 % in different BMI groups. Total body water was well within the normal limits...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOptical {{reflection}} and transmission spectra of Se 80 −xTe 20 Agx (where x= 0, 5, 10 and 15, molar percent) chalcogenide thin films {{have been obtained}} in the range 300 – 1 200 nm at room temperature. Glassy samples are prepared by melt quenching technique and thin films are obtained by using vacuum evaporation technique on glass transition at room temperature. The present paper reports the effect of Ag contents on various optical parameters such as optical band gap, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient. Reflection spectra are used for calculating these optical parameters. The band gap Eg is determined from the plot of (αhν) 1 / 2 versus hν. Real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant changes slightly with the variation of Ag contents in different samples. The film exhibits indirect band gap which increases with increasing Ag content. The observed behavior is explained {{on the basis of}} Davis and Mott model for the density of states. The absorption coefficient of thin films exhibits linear dependence on photon energy. Other optical parameters are calculated by using theory of reflectivity. All the optical parameters change with the variation of the film <b>composition.</b> <b>Computerized</b> spectrophotometer JASCO-UV/VIS/NIR is used to determine optical constants...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{published}} {{data for}} the per capita consumption of water of individuals in South Africa. A daily rounded volume of 2 litres per person is usually taken as a working estimate from world wide data. As part of ongoing epidemiological studies into potential health effects {{of changes in the}} water supply to greater Town, water consumption patterns were ascertained. As health effects are often spatially ascribed to the place of residence of a person, it was necessary to ascertain how much water was drunk at home as well as away from home. Water consumed was divided into three classes: (i) water consumed from the tap, (ii) commercial beverages and (iii) water bound in food. A review of methods of conducting dietary surveys indicated that a 24 -hour recall would be the most appropriate method. Two surveys on total dietary intake utilizing a 24 -hour recall were carried out (n = 2 000 persons for each survey), one in winter and the ether in summer. The design of the survey involved a cluster sample of households that were representative of the socio-economic and demographic structure of greater Cape Town. Three pretested types questionnaires were administered by trained interviewers: (i) a placement questionnaire to describe the household composition, (ii) a recall questionnaire for individual adults and children and (iii) a recall questionnaire for babies. Particular attention was paid to the accurate ascertainment of the volumes of food and drink consumed as well as their preparation to facilitate accurate analysis. The water content of each food item was calculated by a computer program that utilized <b>computerized</b> food <b>composition</b> tables. The water consumption data was analyzed by sex, age, population group, income and the season of the year. Detailed graphs and tables are provided. Results were also standardized to the population of greater Cape Town. It was found that the difference in consumption between the White and "Coloured" population groups was greater than the difference between those people of high and low-income groups. The mean total water intake for Whites was 2. 19 litres per day, while for "Coloureds" it was 1. 26 litres per day. There is no obvious bias to account for this difference. The figures for protein consumed by the two groups, which was used as a control, are consistent with values reported in the literature. Summer consumption was higher than that during winter. The ratio of tap water consumed at home to total liquid consumed was approximately 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Music speaks what {{cannot be}} expressed, soothes {{the mind and}} gives it rest, heals the heart and makes is whole. Not {{everyone}} is gifted with a good voice but almost everyone has good ears {{when it comes to}} pleasant music. This music ranges from strictly organized compositions, through improvisational music to aleatoric forms which makes it tough to automate music generation. In this paper we try to bring in the idea of automated Carnatic music generation using genetic algorithm and its applications. Firstly a variety of compositions on specific ragas can be generated which can be improvised to deliver a good quality musical concert. This concept of automated music generation can also be applied to build an ‘online musical instrument tutorials ’ by which users get to learn any instrument level by level. The work can also be modified to produce music of same fitness as any pre existing composition by giving the latter’s notes as input. The application of <b>computerized</b> <b>composition</b> can be used in Music Therapy which is the use of a selected music to obtain the same expected changes and hormonal alterations in the body, played uninterrupted for a while, to obtain the desired positive effect. The above mentioned field of music generation can be used by the medical practitioners by selecting a raga for playing after giving the patient details and disease as input. The application is developed using Java. A Java API, called JFugue is used to support music programming...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in the mid- 1980 s, {{there has}} been a move toward using {{computers}} in writing classrooms at all levels. While the reviews of their effectiveness are mixed, computers continue to play a larger role in the teaching of composition as time goes on, possibly because today, and in the foreseeable future, computers are the way we write at work. ^ Traditionally, students have been excluded from literacy, and hence, empowerment, because of economics and social class. But today, with the predominance of computerized writing, both in the classroom and at work, we are finding a new exclusionary factor is surfacing [...] computer anxiety. ^ This study, structured in two phases, looks at computer anxiety in the composition classroom in an effort to find ways {{to deal with the problem}} so students can succeed at computerized writing. Phase one consisted of a multiple case study of two computer anxious students and preliminary quantitative studies of six other computer anxious students. Phase two examined 185 subjects with respect to prior experience and eight computer anxious subjects on various personality traits. ^ Findings show that computer anxiety is strongly correlated not with experience, but rather with the pleasantness or unpleasantness of prior experience (r =. 75954). Subjects in the study who had no previous experience with computers also were without anxiety. Further, computer anxiety may actually be programming anxiety in disguise. Students who were computer anxious often talked about bad programming experiences as the genesis of their problem. ^ Students who did prior planning, and were adventuresome and/or self-reliant had a better chance of overcoming computer anxiety than did their less adventuresome and self-reliant counterparts. ^ Task avoidance, composing with pen and paper, and editing on screen may all predispose the computer anxious student to failure in overcoming the problem. ^ The results of this study suggest that instructors in <b>computerized</b> <b>composition</b> classes should identify computer anxious students when possible, strongly discourage absences, especially early in the course, pay special attention to keeping the students on-task as much as possible, and encourage them to write on line, but edit on hard copy. ...|$|E
40|$|M. App. ScObjective This study {{describes}} {{the results of}} the baseline sub-study of a randomized double-blind, sham-exercise controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of power training in older adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary purpose of this sub-study was to define the state of total and activated JNK in skeletal muscle which had been exposed to an acute resistive bout of exercise. In addition, metabolic and clinical characteristics were investigated in an attempt to explain the variance and the metabolic relevance of the JNK expression (total JNK, tJNK) and activation (ratio of phosphorylated/total JNK, p/tJNK) observed. We hypothsized that greater JNK expression and activation would be related to impaired health status, chronic inflammation, metabolic disturbance and insulin resistance in our cohort. We hypothsized that greater JNK expression and activation would be related to impaired health status (decreasing habitual exercise amount and burdens of diseases), chronic inflammation (increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreasing anti-inflammatory cytokines), metabolic disturbance (disturbance of blood glucose and lipid regulation) and insulin resistance in our cohort. Methods Our cohort consisted of sedentary adults over 60 years of age with type 2 diabetes. The study recruited 103 participants from Aug 2006 to Dec 2009. Since the 50 th participant completed theirassessments in Apr 2009 and this thesis was to be submitted in Aug 2010, it only included analysis of baseline data from the first 50 participants which were available at the time of submission. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment 2 (HOMA 2) <b>computerized</b> model; body <b>composition</b> was measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) and anthropometrics; glucose, insulin and serum cytokines (adiponectin, c-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by serum assays, factors related to the insulin signalling pathway obtained from skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies (Insulin-like Growth Factor- 1 (IGF- 1), Tumour Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα), Interleukin 6 (IL- 6), Heat Shock Protein 72 (HSP 72), phospho-Jun N-terminal Kinase (pJNK) and total JNK (tJNK) in muscle, and Adiponetin, TNFα, IL- 6 in adipose tissue) were measured by cytokine assays and Western Blot. The secondary outcomes, including health status, medications, physical performance and quality of life, were assessed by validated questionnaires. Results 35 of the 50 subjects had baseline measures of skeletal muscle JNK. As hypothesized, higher JNK was related or had the tendency to related to potentially poorer health status: number of medications/day(r= 0. 304, 0. 081) and lower habitual physical activity (r=- 0. 333, p= 0. 055). Similarly, the relationships we found between total and activated JNK and anti-inflammatory/metabolic factors supported our hypotheses: higher tJNK was related to lower serum (r=- 0. 364, p= 0. 057) and adipose tissue (r=- 0. 465, p= 0. 060) HMW/adiponectin ratios, and higher p/tJNK was related to higher skeletal muscle IL- 6 (rho= 0. 644, p< 0. 001), lower serum total (r=- 0. 336, p= 0. 081) and HMW adiponectin (r=- 0. 504, p= 0. 006), and lower HOMA β cell function (r=- 0. 332, p= 0. 055). By contrast, the relationships we found between JNK and systemic pro-inflammatory and local anabolic factors were inconsistent with our hypothesis. Specifically, higher tJNK was related to lower serum CRP (r=- 0. 457,p= 0. 015) and higher skeletal muscle IGF- 1 (r= 0. 641, p< 0. 001). Also contrary to our expectations, higher p/tJNK was related to lower serum total cholesterol (r=- 0. 059, p< 0. 001) and LDL (r=- 0. 401, p= 0. 016). Conclusion This was the first study to describe activated and total skeletal muscle JNK expression after acute resistive exercise in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and the first study to analyze potential correlations between skeletal muscle JNK and other aspects of health status, metabolism, and inflammation in this cohort. As hypothesized, higher JNK was related to more impaired health status (age, inactivity) and inversely related to anti-inflammatory adiponectin and HOMA 2 β cell function. Unexpectedly, however, higher JNK was related to higher skeletal muscle IGF- 1 and inversely related to CRP, serum total cholesterol and LDL. Additional studies are warranted to investigate whether chronic exercise training in type 2 diabetes alters the expression and activation of JNK, and to determine whether beneficial adaptations in JNK may explain a portion of the variance in exercise-related metabolic benefits in this cohort...|$|R
