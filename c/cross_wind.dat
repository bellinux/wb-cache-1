5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive <b>cross</b> <b>wind,</b> (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the Mackinac Bridge was {{directly}} influenced by the lessons from the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which failed in 1940 because of its instability in high winds. Three years after that disaster, Steinman had published a theoretical analysis of suspension-bridge stability problems, which recommended that future bridge designs include deep stiffening trusses to support the bridge deck and an open-grid roadway to reduce its wind resistance. Both of these features were incorporated into the {{design of the}} Mackinac Bridge. The stiffening truss is open to reduce wind resistance.

Alonso attempted to overtake Bottas for fourth heading into the second turn but reduced his speed in his attempt. Ricciardo also had wheelspin off his starting position, and fell behind both Ferrari and McLaren cars. He remained on the outside line and overtook Button and Räikkönen and attacked Magnussen, passing him driving into turn 12. Pérez glimpsed space around the inside of Sutil but the additional speed required to drive alongside the Sauber meant he slid into the rear-end of Räikkönen's car. Räikkonen was able to continue but Pérez ploughed into Sutil. As the Sauber spun, it hit Pérez for a second time; both their front wheels interlocked and their suspensions were damaged.|$|E

Wind forces acting on the bridge, including both buffeting and self-excited forces, are generated in the time domain using a fast spectral representation method and measured aerodynamic coefficients and flutter derivatives. Each 4 -axle vehicle in a train is modeled by a 27 -degrees-of-freedom dynamic system. Wind forces acting on the train, including both steady and unsteady aerodynamic forces, are simulated in the time domain, {{taking into account the}} effects of vehicle speed and the spatial correlation with wind forces on the bridge. The dynamic interaction between the bridge and train is realized through the contact forces between the wheels and track with track irregularities and wheel hunting included. The proposed framework is then applied to a real long span cable-stayed bridge with a train consisting of two locomotives and 10 passenger coaches in <b>cross</b> <b>winds.</b> The results demonstrate that the proposed framework and the associated computer program can efficiently predict the dynamic response of coupled train and cable-stayed bridge systems subjected to <b>cross</b> <b>winds.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

The partial differential vibration equation of the system is converted into the ordinary differential equation by the Galerkin method and then numerically solved.

The field {{measurement results}} are used in this paper (Paper II) to verify, to some extent, the finite element based framework developed by the writers in the time domain for predicting dynamic response of coupled train and bridge systems in <b>cross</b> <b>winds.</b> In this regard, a three-dimensional finite element model is used to model the Tsing Ma suspension bridge. Wind forces acting on the bridge are generated in the time domain using a fast spectral representation method {{and based on the}} field measurement results and wind tunnel test results. Each coach in a train running on the bridge is modeled by a 27 degree -of-freedom dynamic system. The dynamic interaction between the bridge and the train is realized through the contact forces between the wheels and the track. Track irregularity is simulated using a high-order multivariate autoregressive model, whereas wheel hunting is assumed to be a sinusoidal function with a random phase. The acceleration and displacement responses of the bridge under <b>cross</b> <b>winds</b> and running trains are computed and compared with the responses measured from the field for four cases. The comparison is found to be satisfactory in general. The dynamic response and performance of trains on the bridge is also computed and evaluated. The proposed framework is found to be feasible and practical. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
