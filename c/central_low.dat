2500|$|During the mid-afternoon {{hours of}} January22, a new {{low-pressure}} area {{began to develop}} over {{the coast of the}} Carolinas as the former storm tracked into central Georgia. Owing to uncertainty in short-range guidance but a high confidence of a sharp northern edge of precipitation, many forecasts until just hours before snowfall began were predicting 12" [...] of snow or less from Allentown, Pennsylvania, toward New York City and the southern coast of New England. As the storm moved further north and rapidly strengthened, it became apparent that snowfall would be much higher farther north and forecasters quickly began upgrading their totals. Early on January 24, as the storm was leaving New England, the system began to become elongated, as a secondary low developed to the southwest of the storm's <b>central</b> <b>low.</b> On January 25, the blizzard left the East Coast of the United States; on the same day, the system was named Karin by the University of Berlin.|$|E

40|$|Lowering {{of central}} venous {{pressure}} in hepatic surgery is nowadays widely recommended and used procedure. <b>Low</b> <b>central</b> venous pressure anesthesia is associated with decreased blood loss and improved clinical outcome. There are several approaches how to reach <b>low</b> <b>central</b> venous pressure. Till now none of them is recommended as superior in terms of patient safety and clinical outcome. Concurrently there is still debate if to use the <b>low</b> <b>central</b> venous pressure anesthesia principle or {{if it could be}} replaced with a principle of anesthesia with high stroke volume variation (or another dynamic preload parameter) {{with the use of a}} more sophisticated hemodynamic monitoring method. Results of our study didn't show any significant difference between two approaches used for reduction of {{central venous pressure}}, but suggest that the principle of <b>low</b> <b>central</b> venous pressure anesthesia could be possibly replaced by the principle of high stroke volume variation anesthesia which presumes the use of advanced hemodynamic monitoring.
