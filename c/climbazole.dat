Recently, the anti-dandruff and antimycotic, <b>Climbazole,</b> was detected in waste water treatment drainages. <b>Climbazole</b> is readily used in cosmetics, and is an ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos. Shampoos contain formulations of up to 2.0% which {{is the equivalent of}} approximately 15g/L. <b>Climbazole</b> is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata at very low concentrations. Zebrafish experienced lethal effects after exposure to <b>climbazole</b> in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours. Along with Danio rerio, Lemna minor, Navicula pelliculosa, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Daphnia magna were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by <b>climbazole</b> in a concentration-dependant manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of <b>climbazole</b> on oats and turnip included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of <b>climbazole</b> can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.|$|E

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and specific ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method {{was developed and}} validated for the measurement of <b>climbazole</b> deposition from hair care products onto artificial skin and human scalp. Deuterated <b>climbazole</b> {{was used as the}} internal standard. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode was applied for the detection of <b>climbazole.</b> For quantification, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transition 293. 0 > 69. 0 was monitored for <b>climbazole,</b> and MRM transition 296. 0 > 225. 1 for the deuterated <b>climbazole.</b> The linear range ran from 4 to 2000 ng mL(- 1). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 1 ng mL(- 1) and 4 ng mL(- 1), respectively, which enabled quantification of <b>climbazole</b> on artificial skin and human scalp at ppb level (corresponding to 16 ng cm(- 2)). For the sampling of <b>climbazole</b> from human scalp the buffer scrub method using a surfactant-modified phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was selected based on a performance comparison of tape stripping, the buffer scrub method and solvent extraction in in vitro studies.

40|$|SESAMe v 3. 3, a {{spatially}} explicit multimedia fate {{model for}} China, {{is a tool}} suggested to support quantitative risk assessment for national scale chemical management. The key advantage over the previous version SESAMe v 3. 0 is consideration of spatially varied environmental pH. We evaluate the model performance using estimates of emission from total industry usage of three UV filters (benzophenone- 3, octocrylene, and octyl methoxycinnamate) and three antimicrobials (triclosan, triclocarban, and <b>climbazole).</b> The model generally performs well for the six case study chemicals {{as shown by the}} comparison between predictions and measurements. The importance of accounting for chemical ionization is demonstrated with the fate and partitioning of both triclosan and <b>climbazole</b> sensitivity to environmental pH. The model predicts ionizable chemicals (triclosan, <b>climbazole,</b> benzophenone- 3) to primarily partition into soils at steady state, despite hypothetically only being released to freshwaters, as a result of agricultural irrigation by freshwater. However, further model calibration is needed when more field data becomes available for soils and sediments and for larger areas of water. As an example, accounting for the effect of pH in the environmental risk assessment of triclosan, limited freshwater areas (0. 03 % or ca. 55 km 2) in mainland China are modeled to exceed its conservative environmental no-effect threshold. SESAMe v 3. 3 can be used to support the development of chemical risk assessment methodologies with the spatial aspects of the model providing a guide to the identification regions of interest in which to focus monitoring campaigns or develop a refined risk assessment...|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} contains nutrients {{valuable for}} a reuse in agriculture {{and can be}} the source of a multitude of chemicals used in private households and industry, too. As many of these chemicals are incompletely degraded during wastewater treatment, their residues remain partly in sewage sludge and partly in treated wastewater. Concerns are linked particularly to the so called micropollutants, i. e. anthropogenic organic substances such as personal care products, pharmaceuticals and biocides, for which scarce data on their degradability and environmental fate and particularly on their ecotoxicity are available. Thus, when reusing treated wastewater and sewage sludge for irrigation or as soil amendment for a sustainable land and water management, these wastewater-borne pollutants may enter soil, groundwater and surface water. The present work therefore aimed at assessing potential ecotoxic effects on aquatic and terrestrial organisms of reusing treated wastewater and sewage sludge. To this end, established as well as newly developed experimental approaches were used to investigate the problem on several levels. Individual wastewater-borne substances, samples from field study sites and samples from a soil column experiment simulating prolonged wastewater irrigation were examined. At the start of the experimental work, the ecotoxicity of <b>climbazole</b> was characterised towards five aquatic and five terrestrial test organisms. <b>Climbazole</b> is an azole antimycotic agent applied in cosmetics and anti-dandruff shampoos and was recently detected in relatively high concentrations in treated wastewater and sewage sludge. In the present work <b>climbazole</b> was found to be particularly toxic towards plants such as water lentils with effective concentrations comparable to those of agricultural azole fungicides. Dwarfism, that is reduced shoot elongation observed in plants, pointed at a specific, phytohormone inhibiting mode of action of <b>climbazole.</b> Furthermore, the expected influence of the soil pH on the phytotoxicity of <b>climbazole</b> was experimentally confirmed. Based on the findings for <b>climbazole,</b> two additional azole antimycotics, ketoconazole and fluconazole, and the regularly in sewage sludge detected biocide benzyldimethyldodecyl-ammonium chloride (BDDA) were investigated for their toxicity towards plants. In aqueous medium, an increasing phytotoxicity from fluconazole to BDDA, ketoconazole and <b>climbazole</b> was observed, while in soil, phytotoxicity increased from BDDA to ketoconazole, <b>climbazole</b> and fluconazole. The relatively low terrestrial toxicity of BDDA and ketoconazole probably resulted from their strong binding to soil as well as their good biodegradability. To render the exposure scenario more realistic, sewage sludge was co-applied with the four test substances in a parallel test run. However, as no detectable influence on their effective concentrations was found, it can be assumed that the current practice of assessing sewage sludge borne substances with biotests in standard soil is sufficiently realistic. In a further study, different advanced sludge-treatment technologies were assessed for their efficacy in reducing pollutants. Results from the present work indicated that effects assessed in terrestrial short term biotests only seldom correlated with the concentrations of certain pollutants. Rather, a negative correlation of the stability of the sludges, determined by the ratio of volatile to total solids, to their ecotoxicity was seen. Another aspect of the present work was the design and performance of an experimental approach to assess the environmental risk of a long-term irrigation with treated wastewater concerning the quality of soil and water in a prospective way, i. e. before the installation at field scale. For the simulation of a continuous irrigation corresponding to approximately 30 years, a percolation apparatus was developed and four different soils were percolated with treated wastewater for three months. Acute and chronic biotests with nine test organisms from different trophic levels (green algae, water lentils and water fleas as well as oilseed rape, oats, bacteria, spring tails, enchytraeids and earthworms) were used to assess the soil percolates as well as the soils with and without percolation. These investigations were accompanied by a comprehensive chemical monitoring conducted by project partners. Results indicated that the soil passage, that is the percolation through the soil, generally improved the quality of the treated wastewater as habitat for aquatic organisms which was visible by a reduction of its phytotoxicity. However, in some cases it deteriorated the water quality, probably resulting from the leaching of metals from pre-contaminated soil. A deteriorated habitat quality of the soil after the percolation with treated wastewater was observed for several test organisms and soils. In the same, mainly peaty soils, the highest accumulation of wastewater-borne micropollutants and of zinc was measured. Yet, their concentrations did not correlate to the observed biological effects. Moreover, data on ecotoxicity were only available for {{a small fraction of the}} detected substances so that their concentrations could not successfully be used to predict expected biological effects. The experimental approach used in the present work demonstrated to be an adequate tool to support the prospective evaluation of environmental risks of treated wastewater irrigation. Overall, it can be concluded that the reuse of treated wastewater on soil can improve the quality of treated wastewater but that this can come at the cost of deteriorating the quality of the soil. As these risks cannot be generalised, a comprehensive biotest battery as well as chemical analysis should be used to assess them on a case-specific basis for each respective wastewater and the respective soil...|$|E

40|$|A {{sensitive}} ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (UHPLC-MS/MS) method {{has been developed}} and validated for simultaneous quantification of zinc pyrithione (ZPT) and <b>climbazole</b> (CBZ) deposited onto human scalp from anti-dandruff (AD) shampoos. Scrubbing with a buffer solution {{was used as the}} sampling method for the extraction of ZPT and CBZ from scalp. Derivatization of ZPT was carried out prior to UHPLC-MS/MS analysis, The identification of ZPT and CBZ was performed by examining ratios of selected multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions in combination with UHPLC retention times. The limit of detection for ZPT and CBZ was established to be 1 and 2 ng/mL, respectively. This sensitivity enables the quantification of ZPT and CBZ at deposition levels in the low ng/cm(2) range. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of scalp buffer scrub samples from an in vivo study. The levels of ZPT and CBZ deposited on the scalp at different time points after application of the AD shampoo were measured. The results revealed that dual-active AD shampoo delivered more ZPT onto the scalp in a single wash than single active shampoo did. The amount of ZPT and CBZ retained on the scalp after AD shampoo application declined over 72 h...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} chiral method-based using liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry {{analytical method}} has been validated for {{the determination of}} <b>climbazole</b> (CBZ) enantiomers in waste-water and sludge with quantification limits below the 1 ng/L and 2 ng/g range, respectively. On {{the basis of this}} newly developed analytical method, the stereochemistry of CBZ was investigated over time in sludge biotic and sterile batch experiments under anoxic dark and light conditions and during waste-water biological treatment by subsurface flow constructed wetlands. CBZ stereoselective degradation was exclusively observed under biotic conditions, confirming the specificity of enantiomeric fraction variations to biodegradation processes. Abiotic CBZ enantiomerization was insignificant at circumneutral pH and CBZ was always biotransformed into CBZ-alcohol due to the specific and enantioselective reduction of the ketone function of CBZ into a secondary alcohol function. This transformation was almost quantitative and biodegradation gave good first order kinetic fit for both enantiomers. The possibility to apply the Rayleigh equation to enantioselective CBZ biodegradation processes was investigated. The results of enantiomeric enrichment allowed for a quantitative assessment of in situ biodegradation processes due to a good fit (R- 2 > 0. 96) of the anoxic/anaerobic CBZ biodegradation to the Rayleigh dependency in all the biotic microcosms and was also applied in subsurface flow constructed wetlands. This work extended the concept of applying the Rayleigh equation towards quantitative biodegradation assessment of organic contaminants to enantioselective processes operating under anoxic/anaerobic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim: Dandruff is {{a common}} scalp problem {{associated}} with flaky and inflamed skin. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a shampoo containing piroctone olamine and <b>climbazole</b> and the combination of this shampoo with a scalp tonic containing piroctone olamine and licochalcone A, derived from G lycyrrhiza inflata root extract, to reduce dandruff. Study Design/Methods: After conditioning, 102 subjects (♂ 56 and 46 ♀) with moderate to very strong dandruff affection underwent a randomized half head study for 4 weeks. The volunteers’ heads were washed regularly either with a placebo or the anti-dandruff shampoo, followed by the anti-dandruff tonic application or no treatment. In a 2 -week post-treatment phase, subjects only applied placebo shampoo. Every two weeks, trained experts assessed dandruff affection based {{on a scale of}} 1 to 6. At study start and after every 2 weeks, cytokine concentrations and anti-fungal activity of test products were determined in scalp wash-ups by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays or a Malassezia colony-forming assay, respectively. Results: Results of expert grading and anti-fungal activity revealed a significant reduction in dandruff affection and Malassezia colony-forming units after treatment with the anti-dandruff shampoo or its combination with the tonic. Dandruff affection even remained reduced in the post-treatment phase when levels of Malassezia colony-forming units had returned to baseline. Cytokine analyses proved a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory dandruff markers after treatment with both anti-dandruff products. For the shampoo/tonic combination, a superior reduction of one scalp inflammatory marker was determined even after the post-treatment phase. Conclusion: Both the rinse-off shampoo as well as its combination with the leave-on tonic excellently alleviated dandruff and its associated micro-inflammation. Both treatments showed anti-fungal activity. The superior benefit, exerted by the combination, is primarily based on the known anti-inflammatory effect of licochalcone A and the improved scalp substantivity of the leave-on application. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, mepartricin, bifonazole, <b>climbazole,</b> oxiconazole, nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, oxantel, closantel, hycanthone, pyrimethamine, and tetramisole. Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/γ-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug indatraline, were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
40|$|To {{balance the}} {{economic}} development with environmental safety and human health, China has released chemicals management legislation for which chemical prioritization and risk assessment are key issues. To support these ambitions two versions of an environmental fate and behaviour model SESAMe (Sino Evaluative Simplebox-MAMI models), have been developed with different resolutions and structures in this thesis. SESAMe is applied to hypothetical chemicals to investigate the influence of environmental parameters on chemical persistence and long-range transport potential. The environmental distribution of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the base year of 2007 and future scenario in 2030 in China has been predicted using SESAMe v 3. 0. The efficiency of different technical improvements on reducing emissions and environmental concentrations is discussed using the future scenario. Six organic chemicals, triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), <b>climbazole,</b> benzophenone- 3 (BP- 3), octocrylene (OC) and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), have also been modelled by SESAMe v 3. 3 {{to account for the}} chemical ionisation and the effect of environmental pH to chemical partitioning. The emission inventories of the six chemicals were estimated for 2012. TCS is used as an example chemical to explore the pH dependent environmental risk assessment for ionisable chemicals. Only limited freshwater areas in China were found to be in exceedance of TCS threshold levels. The influence of projected population, infrastructure,and environmental conditions on the use, emission and environmental distribution of the same six chemicals in 2030 was investigated. Infrastructure development, such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was shown {{to be the most important}} factor that will reduce the chemical emission and environmental concentrations into the future. SESAMe models have been successfully applied to a chemical released to air and other types of chemicals released to water that are subject to potential ionisation. Model estimation is demonstrated to be good by comparison with the monitoring data collected from the literature. The application of current and future scenarios demonstrates SESAMe models are potentially useful to support chemical management in China and to identify key gaps for chemical screening and risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from SPIE via the DOI in this record. Treatment of {{dandruff}} condition usually involves use of antidandruff shampoos containing antifungal agents. Different antifungal agents show variable clinical efficacy based on their cutaneous distribution and bioavailability. Using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), we mapped the distribution of unlabeled low-molecular weight antifungal compounds zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) and <b>climbazole</b> (CBZ) on the surface of intact porcine skin with cellular precision. SRS has sufficient chemical selectivity and sensitivity to detect the agents on the skin surface based on their unique chemical motifs that do not occur naturally in biological tissues. Moreover, SRS is able to correlate the distribution of the agents with the morphological features of the skin using the CH 2 CH 2 stretch mode, which is abundant in skin lipids. This is a significant strength of the technique since it allows the microscopic accumulation of the agents to be correlated with physiological features and their chemical environment without the use of counter stains. Our findings show that due to its lower solubility, ZnPT coats the surface of the skin with a sparse layer of crystals in the size range of 1 to 4 [*][*]μm 4 [*][*]μm. This is consistent with the current understanding of the mode of action of ZnPT. In contrast, CBZ being more soluble and hydrophobic resulted in diffuse homogeneous distribution. It predominantly resided in microscopic lipid-rich crevasses and penetrated up to 60 [*][*]μm 60 [*][*]μm into the infundibular spaces surrounding the hair shaft. The ability of the SRS to selectively map the distribution of agents on the skin’s surface has the potential to provide insight into the mechanisms underpinning the topical application of antifungal or skin-active agents that could lead to the rational engineering of enhanced formulations.
