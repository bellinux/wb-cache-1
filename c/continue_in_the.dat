5|$|The {{first of}} two very long stages began with {{a moment of silence}} in {{commemoration}} of the lives lost in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, led by 's Fumiyuki Beppu, the only Japanese rider in the race. Beppu's family was safe, and he chose to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the Barrel Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April. Barrel Roll was to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and control of that area was {{handed over to the}} American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a lull in the German fire allowed them to <b>continue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks. Repeatedly hit by the artillery and tanks, Bréville was in flames {{by the time the}} company's fifteen survivors reached the village.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Selena's {{brother and}} former {{principal}} record producer A.B. Quintanilla III, known as A.B., {{was planning to}} quit music and leave the Kumbia All-Starz, the successor of Kumbia Kings. Their father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., told A.B. {{that he did not}} want him to quit music, saying that his dream was that his children would <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music industry and never give up. In 2009, after performing to an enthusiastic crowd in Bolivia, A.B. decided to continue recording music.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution. However, state courts have determined that Priority One and Two Critical Services must <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of a shutdown. Services that must remain uninterrupted to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One, and some additional services are designated Priority Two. Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October, Molotov {{announced}} the Soviet demands in public, during a {{session of the}} Supreme Soviet. The Finns made two counteroffers—the first on 23 October and the second on 3 November. In both offers Finland would cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union, which was {{far less than the}} Soviets had demanded. The Finnish delegation returned home on November 13, taking for granted that the negotiations would <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2015, the {{citizens}} of Greece voted decisively (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout) to reject a referendum {{that would have given}} Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures. As a result of this vote, Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July. Negotiations between Greece and other Eurozone members will <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following days to procure funds from the European Central Bank in order to prevent an economic collapse in the country.|$|E
5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competition.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{fell ill}} with {{diarrhoea}} during the Tour's tenth stage. He was {{under pressure from}} his personal manager to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race, though members of his team encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but {{was able to get}} back on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found that he had taken amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint.|$|E
5|$|Testing was, however, able to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 {{contract}} {{to cover a}} second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time}} in May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs did seem to have been worked out.|$|E
5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. This places financial burden on airports, risks the flow of servicing processes, and has implications for the privacy of passengers. International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt {{only served}} as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County {{for about three}} months because, in November, Democrat Shibell ran for {{re-election}} against Republican challenger Bob Paul. The region was strongly Republican and Paul was expected to win. Republican Wyatt expected he would <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> job. Given how fast eastern Pima County was growing, everyone expected {{that it would be}} split off into its own county soon with Tombstone as its seat. Wyatt hoped to win the job as the new county sheriff and continue receiving the plum 10% of all tax moneys collected. Southern Pacific was the major landholder, so tax collection was a relatively easy process.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} career racing karts. He moved up through the open wheel racing ranks, winning the 2002 Infiniti Pro Series. When Foyt made his first Indianapolis 500 race in 2003, he became the {{youngest}} driver to start in the event. He continued in IndyCar for two more years until his back was injured at the 2005 Indianapolis 500. Later that season he made several NASCAR Busch Series starts. He was scheduled to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Busch Series in 2006, but the team was bought out and his contract didn't allow him to race in a non-Dodge car. He returned to IndyCar late that season. He has not raced since 2009, although he drove for his grandfather's A. J. Foyt Enterprises team in trials for the 2010 Indianapolis 500.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E
5|$|The League {{championship}} led to Sunderland {{playing in}} the Charity Shield against FA Cup-winners Arsenal. Sunderland won the shield after goals from Eddie Burbanks and Raich Carter. Their success continued in the 1936–37 season, when they achieved their first FA Cup win. They beat Preston North End 3–1 in the final as Bobby Gurney, Raich Carter, and Eddie Burbanks all scored goals at Wembley Stadium. Sunderland competed in the Charity Shield for a second successive season, this time against Manchester City who had won the League title in 1936–37; Sunderland were beaten 2–0. Their FA Cup success looked set to <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1937–38 season, {{when they reached the}} semi-finals, but they were beaten 3–1 by Huddersfield Town, to end their chances. Cochrane announced his retirement from management in 1939, after he had been in charge of Sunderland for 11 seasons, taking them to a League title, and an FA Cup win.|$|E
