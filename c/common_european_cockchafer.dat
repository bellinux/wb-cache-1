50|$|In 1929, Josef Ganz started {{contacting}} German motorcycle manufacturers Zündapp, Ardie and DKW {{for collaboration}} {{to build a}} prototype, small people's car. This resulted in a first prototype, the Ardie-Ganz, built at Ardie in 1930 and a second one completed at Adler in May 1931, which was nicknamed the Maikäfer (‘May-Beetle’, <b>common</b> <b>European</b> <b>cockchafer</b> Melolontha melolontha). News about the prototypes spread through the industry. At Adler, Josef Ganz was assigned as a consultant engineer at Daimler-Benz and BMW where {{he was involved in}} the development of the first models with independent wheel suspension: the Mercedes-Benz 170 and BMW AM1 (Automobilkonstruktion München 1).|$|E

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>cockchafer</b> Melolontha melolontha L. {{is one of}} {{the main}} pests of {{forestry}} species. The adult of this species cause defoliation in deciduous forest stands, while the larvae attack in the soil, consuming seeds or roots. In forest nurseries and also in young forest plantations that belong to Lunca Bradului Forestry Department, attacks produced by the <b>European</b> <b>cockchafer</b> Melolontha melolontha L. are reported every year. Infested areas and especially the population density are very different from one year to another and also between various location, these being determined by climate conditions, but especially by the prevention and combating methods applied in each forest nursery. In Lunca Bradului Forestry Department, annually population density evaluation was carried out by soil surveys...|$|R
