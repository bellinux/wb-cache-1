60|$|PADDY DIGNAM: (Earnestly) Once I {{was in the}} employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, <b>commissioner</b> <b>for</b> <b>oaths</b> and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, {{the wall}} of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That {{buttermilk}} didn't agree with me.|$|E
60|$|Solicitor, I think. I {{know his}} face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor, <b>commissioner</b> <b>for</b> <b>oaths</b> and affidavits. Dignam {{used to be}} in his office. Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.|$|E

50|$|In England and Wales {{there are}} two main classes of notaries - general notaries and scrivener notaries. Their {{functions}} are almost identical. All notaries, like solicitors, barristers, legal executives, costs lawyers and licensed conveyancers, are also <b>commissioners</b> <b>for</b> <b>oaths.</b> They also acquire the same powers as solicitors and other law practitioners, {{with the exception of the}} right to represent others before the courts (unless also members of the bar or admitted as a solicitor) once they are commissioned notaries. In practice almost all English notaries, and all Scottish ones, are also solicitors, and usually practise as solicitors.|$|R

50|$|It is {{the duty}} of all Magistrates to sign a Statutory Declaration when asked to do so, and the Magistrate's Clerk is {{entitled}} to a fee of 1s. Most of the liberal-minded magistrates will witness the Declaration at their own house, or any other convenient place. Some, however, refuse to do that except in the law court. A Statutory Declaration may also be witnessed by a <b>Commissioner</b> <b>for</b> <b>Oaths,</b> and some other officials.|$|E

5000|$|In {{practice}} {{the need for}} notaries in purely English legal matters is very small; for example they {{are not involved in}} normal property transactions. Since a great many solicitors also perform the function of <b>commissioners</b> <b>for</b> <b>oaths</b> and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by notaries relates to international matters in some way. They witness or authenticate documents to be used abroad. Many English notaries have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification. The work of notaries and solicitors in England is separate although most notaries are solicitors. The Notaries Society gives the number of notaries in England and Wales as [...] "about 1,000," [...] all but seventy of whom are solicitors.|$|R

25|$|Administration of the Supreme Court {{is managed}} by its registry, which handles {{matters such as}} {{receiving}} and storing court documents filed in the court, and ensuring they are transmitted to judges for use during hearings. The Registry is headed by the Registrar who is assisted by the Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars and Assistant Registrars. These officers are appointed by the President on the Chief Justice's recommendation, and {{are members of the}} Judicial Branch of the Singapore Legal Service. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, registrars deal with certain types of court proceedings in chambers, such as the assessment of damages, hearings of bankruptcy petitions and applications, interlocutory matters and pre-trial conferences. Registrars are also appointed as district judges or magistrates, which enables them to conduct preliminary inquiries to determine whether there are enough grounds for trying accused persons for criminal offences in the High Court. The Registry is also staffed by <b>commissioners</b> <b>for</b> <b>oaths,</b> interpreters, clerks and process servers. Justices' law clerks, who work directly under the Chief Justice's charge, assist Judges and Judicial Commissioners with legal research, particularly for Court of Appeal matters.|$|R
5000|$|The stories {{feature the}} {{activities}} of a small law firm called Jonas Pickett, Solicitor and <b>Commissioner</b> <b>for</b> <b>Oaths,</b> recently started by Pickett, a man [...] "on {{the wrong side of}} sixty". He was not, as he was fond of explaining to his friends, a retired solicitor. He was a retreating solicitor. Having made as much money as a bachelor of modest habits was likely to use in the rest of his lifetime, but not wishing to rust in idleness, he had abandoned a successful practice in north London and set up a modest office in Shackleton-on-Sea.|$|E
50|$|Notaries in Sri Lanka {{are more}} akin to civil law notaries, their main {{functions}} are conveyancing, drafting of legal instruments, etc. They are appointed under the Notaries Ordinance No 1 of 1907.

Alternatively, attorneys at law who pass the conveyancing exam are also admitted as a notary public under warrant of the Minister.

He will marry a faithful wife who will, in a dream, discover where the treasure is hidden. Carnero is also told that he will recover a treasure that he has lost, which leaves him slightly puzzled as he cannot remember having had one.|$|E

He was {{admitted}} to the bar by New York's courts at about the same time, though the details of his legal studies are not known, and accepted an appointment from New York's governor as a <b>commissioner</b> <b>for</b> administering <b>oaths.</b> These pro-New York activities caused local people loyal to Vermont to look on Knight with disfavor, and after two individuals were killed in a dispute between New York officials and the Vermonters who opposed them (the 1775 Westminster massacre), Knight fled Vermont for fear of retribution. He resided in Boston and then New York City, and returned to Brattleboro the following year.|$|R
