Through the different optimisation runs, it is assessed that gust load cases can be critical and are difficult to constrain with the sole use of static load cases. Several cases are evaluated with different gust parameters and wing boundary conditions. Effects of control efficiency and engine location are also studied.

In this paper, a retrospective of <b>computational</b> fracture <b>mechanics</b> in concrete structures (ComFraMCoS) is presented through five lenses. These lenses clarify research trends through an historical overview. We intend to interlace the views through these lenses to sometimes offer admittedly slanted insights, to question {{the status quo and}} to provoke thought and discussion about future directions of ComFraMCoS. ...|$|R
