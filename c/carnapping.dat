As a consequence, Schiemer’s defense of <b>Carnap’s</b> extremal axioms against Hintikka’s criticism fails. We will reconcile <b>Carnap’s</b> treatment of extremal axioms and Hintikka’s observation by taking into account the practice of axiomatics in the early twentieth century.

Celine is unable to deal with JB's indecision and finally realizes that she has once again lost JB to Jackie. Grieving with the loss of JB, Celine recklessly uses her charms to land a lucrative account for the company, but her actions are caught on security cameras. JB is hurt and rejects Celine completely, causing her to go on a self-destructive drinking and partying spree. Jackie returns to her old life bringing new preferences, new convictions, and new habits. The subtle changes at first puzzle but later infuriate JB and her father. But Jackie learns to stand up for herself. This part of the series also delves more into the lives of several secondary characters, particularly Jackie's estranged parents, Fidel (Christopher de Leon) and Monique (Bing Pimentel). Their troubled marital past is revealed in bits and pieces—in her loneliness, Monique had given into the temptation of an extra-marital affair because her husband was emotionally distant. When he learned of the affair, Fidel threw her out of his home and cut her off without a single cent. Monique has been living with a gay beautician friend since then.

His chief idea was to make a bridge between science and experience and to transmit the connection between the terms of various scientific fields. Some of <b>Carnap's</b> ideas were questioned by Otto Neurath, who shared with <b>Carnap</b> the physicalistic approach, but had a different view on the desirable features of the protocolar sentences. Within <b>Carnap's</b> theory, protocolar sentences were intended to refer to the sensory characteristics of the physical world. The very conception of protocolar sentences was inspired by physicist's or psychologist's reports, but protocolar sentences in Carnapean sense could also be produced by animals or machines. <b>Carnap</b> originally believed some protocolar sentences to be fundamental and unquestionable. They should have afforded a safe ground for the development of science. Neurath's objections against such a view forced <b>Carnap</b> to adjust his own theory. <b>Carnap</b> also gave up his hopes of total verification, but still expected his theory to enable the confirmation of the general statements of the form "Every X is Y.

To see this, however, we need to see why the Newman problem raised in the context of recent work on structural realism is no problem for <b>Carnap’s</b> conception; and we also need to locate <b>Carnap’s</b> work on theoretical terms within his wider program of Wissenschaftslogik or the logic of science...|$|R

40|$|<b>Carnap's</b> {{epistemological}} {{program was}} attacked by Quine's "Two Dogmas", especially {{in the sense that}} the distinction between analytic and synthetic assumed in <b>Carnap's</b> epistemology is untenable.

Rather, there are some philosophers who argue that Quine's criticism is invalid, recently. In this paper, I reevaluate the validity of Quine's criticism to analyticity, aiming at the difference of understanding the role of analyticity in epistemology. The structure of this paper is following. First, it is shown that in evaluation of Carnap/Quine dispute about analyticity it should focus on the definition of analytic sentences as truths by virtue of semantical rules. Second, it is argued that the unintelligibility charge of Quine to analyticity is applied not to explicans but to explicandum. Third, the difference between <b>Carnap</b> and Quine is shown to be in whether the empirically specifiable explicandum is needed or not for intelligibility of analyticity. Then, the interpretation is proposed that this difference comes from the difference in style of understanding analyticity, that is, difference between Quine's descriptive stance and <b>Carnap's</b> revisionary/normative stance. And, finally, I conclude that <b>Carnap's</b> concept of analyticity can be secured by taking <b>Carnap's</b> revisionary/ normative stance...|$|R
