For a given wire temperature, an attempted motion {{in excess of the}} wire's ability to melt the foam can lead to wire drag and poor surface finish of the <b>cut</b> <b>foam.</b> Conversely, dwelling in the foam any longer than strictly required to melt the cut path can lead to excessively thick kerf.

5000|$|A hot-wire foam cutter {{is a tool}} used to <b>cut</b> {{polystyrene}} <b>foam</b> {{and similar}} materials. The device consists of a thin, taut metal wire, often made of nichrome or stainless steel, or a thicker wire preformed into a desired shape, which is heated via electrical resistance to approximately 200°C. As the wire is passed through the material to be cut, {{the heat from the}} wire vaporises the material just in advance of contact.|$|R
40|$|Hot-wire cutting is {{a common}} {{material}} removal process used to shape and sculpt plastic foam materials, such as expanded polystyrene (EPS). Due to the low cost and sculpt-ability of plastic foams they are popular materials for large sized (> 1 m³) prototypes and bespoke visual artefacts. Recent developments in robotic foam sculpting machines have greatly increased the ability of hot-tools to sculpt complex geometrical surfaces bringing the subject {{into the realm of}} subtractive rapid prototyping/manufacturing. Nevertheless <b>foam</b> <b>cut</b> objects are not being exploited to their full potential due to the common perception that hot-wires are a low accuracy cutting tool. If greater accuracy for hot-wires can be obtained, it could provide a low cost method of producing high value functional engineering parts. Polystyrene patterns for lost foam casting are one such possibility. A nonlinear transient thermal finite element model was developed with the purpose of predicting the kerf width of hot-wire <b>cut</b> <b>foams.</b> Accurate predictions of the kerfwidth during cutting will allow the tool paths to be corrected off-line at the tool definition stage of the CAM process. Finite element analysis software (ANSYS) was used to simulate the hot-wire plastic foam cutting. The material property models were compiled from experimental data and commonly accepted values found in literature. The simulations showed good agreement with the experimental data and thus the model is thought to be reliable. The simulations provide an effective method of predicting kerf widths, under steady state cutting conditions. Limitations and further developments to the model are described...|$|R

40|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foam {{is used in}} many different applications because of its high insulating capacity. CFC- 11 has been the predominant blowing agent due to its advantageous properties, especially its low thermal conductivity. To prevent a depletion of ozone in the stratosphere {{and an increase in}} global warming, the use of CFCs and similar compounds is now being phased out. Less environmentally harmful alternatives thus have to be developed. In order to study the performance of blowing agents their concentration and their distribution in the foam must be measured. A method for analysis of the cell gases in rigid foam was developed. Partial pressures of all gases in the cells could thus be determined as well as the amount of condensed blowing agent. Three methods involving heating and weight-loss determination were elaborated for the determination of the blowing agent distribution in rigid foam. A combustion method was also applied and a method for solvent extraction developed. Experiments were performed both on pieces of foam and on powdered foam. The analytical methods were applied in several studies, mainly on rigid {{polyurethane foam}}s blown with CFC- 11, water or cyclopentane.

The 3 D map allows the reconstruction of the foam structure. Different methods of stereo image processing were tested.

40|$|Abstract Salt water environments {{are very}} harsh on {{materials}} that are used within them. Many issues are caused by either corrosion and/or internal degradation to the materials themselves. Composites are better suited for this environment due to their high strength to weight ratios and their corrosion resistance, but very {{little is known about}} the fracture mechanics of composites. The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding for the behavior of a composite boat hull under a shear loading, similar to the force water applies on the hull as the boat moves through the water; then attempt to strengthen the composite sandwich panel against the shear loading. A parametric study was conducted to investigate monotonic in-plane shear loading for composite sandwich panels used in commercial naval vessels. In order to model a conventional composite boat hull, test specimens were composite sandwich panels made of a Divinycell H 100 foam core with four layers of fiberglass on both sides of the core. Specimens were tested under a monotonic loading with a rate of 0. 2 in/min, and tested until complete failure using the standard test. Seawater specimens were manufactured in the same manner as the original test specimens, but then were submersed in either filtered seawater or the ocean. The differences between the filtered pieces and the ocean allowed us to determine if any changes found in the composite sandwich panels were related to environment conditions or if the changes were related to the saltwater interaction itself. To create these different environments the seawater specimens were taken to the Avila pier where 36 specimens were placed in a tub that was fed filtered saltwater, while 30 specimens were placed in a plastic mesh with weights and lowered to a depth of approximately 30 ft. in the ocean. Three specimens were then removed at monthly intervals from both filtered and ocean environments. Shear Keys were created as a method to strengthen the composite sandwich panels against the shear force that the previous specimens had been tested to. Eight Shear Keys were then placed into groves <b>cut</b> into the <b>foam</b> core (four on each side) and the four fiberglass layers were laid on top. Testing showed that the seawater did have an initial effect on the composite sandwich panels. The filtered pieces showed a decrease in yield strength and stiffness the longer they were subjected to the seawater. The raw unfiltered pieces placed in the ocean saw an even higher decrease in their yield strength and decrease in stiffness. However, for both the unfiltered and raw specimens there was an increase in the ultimate strength and fracture point of the specimens. The effects of the sea water seemed to taper off after the 3 rd month however. The Shear Key specimens were tested with a 4 mm and an 8 mm Shear Key. The 8 mm Shear Keys showed a decrease in shear strength, which was primarily due to removing too much material from the core and weakening the specimen. It was concluded that the decrease in area created a force concentration at the deepest part of the Shear Key causing the premature failure. The 4 mm Shear Key showed an increase in the yield strength, ultimate strength, and fracture point. A finite model was built to simulate the original test specimen along with the 4 mm and 8 mm Shear Key cases, and the results were compared to the experimental results. The numerical results showed that it was possible to relate the experimental results to the linear or elastic portion of the plots. There was a difference between the maximum displacement of the model and the actual specimens, but this was attributed to potential inaccurate comparison of the loading on the model compared to the actual specimens. The correlation between the model itself and the experimental data was close enough to conclude that it could be used for predicting baseline trends. Further investigation of the specimens should include looking into the effects of a cyclic shear loading on the specimens. This combined with the seawater element used in this thesis would provide further insight to the initial degradation seen in the seawater specimens, and could potentially provide a closer relation to current hull failures. In addition to including a cyclic loading another numerical model should be created. A model that could be constrained both locally and globally would provide more accurate results. The FEM should also include the ability to run a crushable foam core model within the solver which would also increase the accuracy of the numerical solution...|$|R
