40|$|The coding {{method has}} the stereo audio {{spectral}} values grouped into scale factor bands (28), with formation of sections each containing {{at least one}} scale factor band. The audio spectral values are coded within each section using a <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> selected {{from a number of}} <b>coding</b> <b>tables.</b> Each <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> is identified by a <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> number transmitted alongside the coded stereo audio spectral values.

40|$|The method {{involves}} grouping spectral {{values and}} detecting a group affected by noise. If a group is not noise affected a <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> out of several tables is allocated for redundancy coding of that group, while the <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> {{allocated to the}} group is referred to by a <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> number. If a group is noise affected, an additional <b>coding</b> <b>table</b> number, not referring to a <b>coding</b> <b>table,</b> is allocated to the group in order to signal that the group is noise affected and, therefore, will not be redundancy coded.

In this paper, we present a memory-based VLC decoder which is quite suitable for the applications with user-defined tables. By parallel loading data into memories, the <b>coding</b> <b>tables</b> can be changed with much less time. The codeword-boundary prediction algorithm breaks the recursive dependency of decoding procedures. As a result, the VLC decoder can be realized on multi-processor architecture and hence the decoding throughput is enhanced significantly. Additionally, the INDEX-OFFSET symbols that can recover all data with pure VLC codeword and smaller table size are presented. Simulation {{results show that the}} combination of the proposed VLC decoder and user-defined table can achieve high decompression rate. As a result, it is quite suitable for high data rate applications with user-defined <b>coding</b> <b>tables,</b> such as MPEG- 4...|$|R

50|$|Identifiers {{assigned}} to entries in a table are 16-bit integers and therefore have {{a range of}} 65536 values. This is too few to cover the world, so separate tables are formulated for each country or region of a country.

The coverage is intended for providing traffic advisory information on high-use roads. Traffic-based route planning, on the other hand, requires coverage of all or almost all major roads and, therefore, is not adequately supported by TMC location <b>code</b> <b>tables</b> as they are currently formulated.|$|E
