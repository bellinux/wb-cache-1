Shortening the channel seems to allow a better control of the instrument at low blowing pressures and makes the sound spectrum richer in high harmonics, but it also reduces considerably the pressure at which the instrument overblows.

50|$|Outside of aesthetics, {{chamfering}} {{is part of}} {{the process}} of hand-crafting a parabolic glass telescope mirror. Before the surface of the disc can be ground, the edges must first be <b>chamfered</b> <b>to</b> prevent chipping.

40|$|AbstractIf the {{decision}} is made not to apply a toroidal <b>chamfer</b> <b>to</b> tungsten monoblocks at ITER divertor vertical targets, exposed leading edges will arise {{as a result of}} assembly tolerances between adjacent plasma-facing components. Then, the advantage of glancing magnetic field angles for spreading plasma heat flux on top surfaces is lost at the misaligned edges with an interaction occurring at near normal incidence, which can drive melting for the expected inter-ELM heat fluxes. A dedicated experiment has been performed on the COMPASS tokamak to thoroughly study power deposition on misaligned edges using inner-wall limited discharges on a special graphite tile presenting gaps and leading edges directly viewed by a high resolution infra-red camera. The parallel power flux deducted from the unperturbed measurement far from the gap is fully consistent with the observed temperature increase at the leading edge, respecting the power balance. All the power flowing into the gap is deposited at the leading edge and no mitigation factor is required to explain the thermal response. Particle-in-cell simulations show that the ion Larmor smoothing effect is weak and that the power deposition on misaligned edges is well described by the optical approximation because of an electron dominated regime associated with non-ambipolar parallel current flow...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of 3 -D and 2 -D {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling as well as experimental testing of the labyrinth seal with hexagonal honeycomb cells on the stator wall was performed. For the 3 -D and 2 -D CFD models, the hexagonal honeycomb structure was modeled using {{the concept of the}} baffle (zero-thickness wall) and the simplified 2 -D fin, respectively. The 3 -D model showed that even a small axial change of the tooth (or honeycomb wall) location, or a small circumferential change of the honeycomb wall location significantly affected the flow patterns and leakage characteristics especially for small tooth tip clearance. Also, the local details of the flow field were investigated. The seven basic procedural steps to develop a 2 -D axisymmetric honeycomb labyrinth seal leakage model were shown. Clearly demonstrated for varying test conditions was the 2 -D model capability to predict the 3 -D honeycomb labyrinth flow that had been measured at different operating conditions from that used in developing the 2 -D model. Specifically, the 2 -D model showed very close agreement with measurements. In addition, the 2 -D model greatly reduced the computer resource requirement needed to obtain a solution of the 3 -D honeycomb labyrinth seal leakage. The novel and advanced strategy to reduce the turbine ingress heating, and thus the coolant requirement, by injecting a ??coolant isolation curtain?? was developed numerically using a 3 -D CFD model. The coolant isolation curtain was applied under the nozzle guide vane platform for the forward cavity of a turbine stage. Specifically, the isolation curtain serves to isolate the hot mainstream gas from the turbine outer region. The effect of the geometry change, the outer cavity axial gap clearance, the circumferential location of the injection curtain slot and the injection fluid angle on the ingress heating was investigated. Adding the <b>chamfer</b> <b>to</b> the baseline design gave a similar or higher maximum temperature T* max than did the baseline design without chamfer, but implementation of the injection curtain slot reduced substantially T* max of the outer region. In addition, a more desirable uniform adiabatic wall temperature distribution along the outer rotor and stator surfaces was observed due to the presence of the isolation curtain...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{fracture}} strength of three techniques used to re-attach tooth fragments in sound and endodontically treated fractured teeth with or without fiber post placement. Material and methods: Ninety human lower incisors were randomly divided into three groups of 30 teeth each. In group A teeth were not subjected to endodontic treatment; while teeth from groups B and C were endodontically treated and the pulp chamber restored with a composite resin. All teeth were fractured by an axial load applied to the buccal area in order to obtain tooth fragments. Teeth from each group were then divided into three subgroups, according to the re-attachment technique: bonded-only, buccal-chamfer and circumferential chamfer. Before the re-attachment procedures, fiber posts were placed in teeth from group C using dual cure resin luting cement (Duo-Link). All teeth (groups A-C) had the fragments re-attached using a same dual cure resin luting cement. in the bonded-only group, no additional preparation was made. After re-attachment of the fragment, teeth from groups buccal and circumferential chamfer groups had a 1. 0 mm depth chamfer placed in the fracture line either on buccal surfaceor along the buccal and lingual surfaces, respectively. increments of microhybid composite resin (Tetric Ceram) were used in subgroups buccal chamfer and circumferential <b>chamfer</b> <b>to</b> restore the chamfer. The specimens were loaded until fracture in the same pre-determined area. The force required to detach each fragment was recorded and the data was subjected to a three-way analysis of variance where factors Group and Re-attachment technique are independent measures and Time of fracture is a repeated measure factor (first and second) and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: The main factors Re-attachment technique (p = 0. 04) and Time of fracture (p = 0. 02) were statistically significant. The buccal and circumferential chamfer techniques were statistically similar (p > 0. 05) and superior to the bonded-only group (p < 0. 05). The first time of fracture was statistically superior to second time of fracture (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The use of fiber post is not necessary for the reinforcement of the tooth structure in re-attachment of endodontically treated teeth. When bonding a fractured fragment, the buccal or circumferential re-attachment techniques should be preferable in comparison with the simple re-attachment without any additional preparation. None of the techniques used for re-attachment restored the fracture strength of the intact teeth. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|For over 100 years, {{piston rings}} {{have been used}} in the {{internal}} combustion engine to create, during operation, a seal between the cylinder wall and the piston (Figure 1). In operation, the heat generated on the top ring, will cause the piston to deform and tilt. To accommodate with this effect, designers have improved the performance ring by applying a <b>chamfer</b> <b>to</b> the contact face of the ring to reduce the concentration of stress on the ring when the piston tilts (Figure 1). It can be found that the piston ring coatings (MoS 2 based) can lose structural integrity and state of the art rings incorporate a chamfer as shown in Figure 2 a, is to chamfer the coating on the ring contact face up to the substrate material. In the current design the coatings covers the full length of the chamfer which can lead to excessive stress concentration in A (Figure 2). This paper examines the effect of the contact chamfer and proposes a new solution to relieve active stress from the performance ring. Use of COMSOL Multiphysics: In operation, the piston ring is surrounded by gas acting on it, using effect of chamfer design has been considered using Love's equation in conjunction with Stone's equation for force ad Miler's equation for gas pressure modeling. Dimensional changes on the piston due to changes in thermodynamic and tilt created during BDC to TDC cycle generates stress concentration on A. Structural mechanic bloc from COMSOL has been used for the simulation where variables defined from (Love 1929; Mittler and Mierbach 2009; Neuber and Federhofer 1951; Stone and Ball 2004) equations. The chamfer geometry was controlled through variable inputs such as coating thickness, ring thickness, distance from the ring angle ring to cylinder to incorporate the tilt. The simulation has considered variables such as position, time to impact during contact between the cylinder liner and the piston ring coating. To better represents the two surfaces contacting a multiple meshing procedures. These procedures allows for the shearing process to simulate at 10, 000 rpm. COMSOL has enabled to generate a single simulation considering aspects mentioned above. Results: The results of this simulation confirmed ISO 6622 - 1 on dimensions for ring contact chamfer (Figure 4). When engine operate at 6, 000 to 12, 000 rpm localized high stresses are found on the contact chamfer face of the ring. With a new proposed designed (Figure 2 b) the concentrated stress at this point is reduced. Conclusion: The piston ring will go through several thermal dynamic changes inducing structural damage to the component. The present methodology has been to use to reduce highly localized stresses on chamfer placed on the contact face by reducing its dimension. This design alteration may runs in conjunction with Love's theory of elasticity...|$|E

An experimental study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening method. Four half-scale beam-column joints, including one control specimen and three strengthened specimens, were prepared and tested under quasi-static cyclic loading. Strengthening schemes include ferrocement jackets with or without skeleton reinforcements and one or two chamfers. Experimental results have indicated that the proposed strengthening method is effective to move plastic hinge from the joint to the beam and enhance seismic performance of beam-column joints. Shear stress and distortion within the joint region are also reduced significantly in strengthened specimens. Skeleton reinforcements in ferrocement provide limited improvement, except on crack control. Specimen strengthened by ferrocement jackets with one chamfer exhibits slight decrease in peak strength and energy dissipation but with increase in ductility as compared with that of two chamfers. Finally, a method for estimating moment capacity at beam-column interface for strengthened specimen is developed.
