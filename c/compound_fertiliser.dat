40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{epidemiological study}} was to investigate possible associations between occupational exposure, respiratory symptoms and change in lung function among employees at a mineral fertiliser production plant. Material and methods Lung function indices (forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and lung diffusing capacity (DLCO)) were measured in 2007 and 2010 among employees at a fertiliser production plant. In 2007, 349 persons participated (86 % of those eligible). Of the 283 participants remaining at work three years later, 6 % did not participate in the second phase of lung function measurement. In addition to those participating in 2007, 34 additional employees participated in 2010, for a total of 383 participants. The employees consented to spirometry test and diffusing capacity test and answered a respiratory symptoms questionnaire during each testing session. In 2007, rhinometry was performed {{at the same time as}} the lung function testing. In 2010, the subjects at the plant answered a questionnaire on work history with an emphasis on the three-year follow-up period. The employees were classified in job groups by production department according to their principal affiliation during follow-up. Study participants tested only once were grouped in the department they served on the day of lung function testing. Employees in the administration or working in average less than 2 hours/week in the production were assigned to the job-group “Other”. The exposure assessment was performed in 2007 - 08 in all the departments at the plant; ammonia, nitric acid, <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> and calcium nitrate departments, as well as a shipping area. A total of 178 inhalable and 179 thoracic personal aerosol mass fraction samples were collected from randomly chosen workers (N= 141), whereof 23 % of the workers participated more than once. Masses of inhalable and thoracic aerosol fractions were measured gravimetrically. Water-soluble and water-insoluble aerosol fractions were analysed for the major constituents, Ca, K, Mg, and P. Concentrations of F-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -and SO 42 - in the water-soluble aerosol fraction and leachates from impregnated gas filter-pads were analysed. NH 3, CO, and NO 2 were measured using direct-reading electrochemical sensors. In addition, a sub study on exposure assessment using video exposure monitoring strategy was conducted during a week in May 2009 to identify short-term peak episodes. Results An adjusted, statistically significant decline in FEV 1 of 18 mL/year during the followup was found for the total group, but no significant decline in FVC. The workers in the nitric acid department had a statistically significant decline in FEV 1, but the absolute decline was of the same magnitude as for those in the Ammonia and <b>Compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> A departments. DLCO showed a statistically significant decline of 0. 068 mmol/min/kPa/year for the total group. The prevalence of selected self-reported respiratory symptoms; morning cough, cough with phlegm, cough with phlegm > 3 months/yr, and wheezing, varied between 6. 5 to 26. 2 %, with only morning cough showing a statistical significant increase from 8. 0 % in 2007 to 13. 7 % in 2010. No association was found between respiratory symptoms and the decline in lung function indices, and borderline significant correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The median inhalable and thoracic aerosol mass concentration exposure levels were 1. 1 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 93 - 45) and 0. 21 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 085 - 11), respectively. The highest median aerosol mass concentrations were found in the <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> departments with median inhalable mass air concentration of 3. 0 mg/m 3 in <b>Compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> C and median thoracic mass air concentration of 0. 78 mg/m 3 in <b>Compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> A. The median air concentrations of CO, NH 3, and NO 2 in all departments were predominantly below the limit of detection (2 ppm, 3 ppm, 0. 2 ppm, respectively). However, some short-term peak episodes of NH 3 and NO 2 were detected, e. g. when performing tasks like cleaning and sampling for quality control. Conclusion An observed adjusted decline in lung function indices was found in this three-year follow-up of workers at a nitrate fertiliser plant. The prevalence of morning cough increased in the follow-up period, but no association between respiratory symptoms and decline in lung function indices was found. A borderline correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The exposure levels for aerosols and gases were generally low with many measurements below the limit of detection. No plausible exposure related explanation for the overall lung function decline during follow-up was found. List of papers. The papers are removed from the thesis due to publisher restrictions.

40|$|Returning {{waste to}} {{agricultural}} land is a holistic systems approach {{to meet the}} challenging task of future food supply. As nutrient contents in organic material often are unbalanced {{in comparison to the}} plants’ needs, the aim of this paper was to study the fertilisation effect of waste-based NPK <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> products and their potential to substitute conventional fertilisers in agricultural plant production. A pot experiment with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. italicum) as experimental crop was conducted where the four N-rich waste resources meat and bone meal (MBM), composted fish sludge (CFS) and two types of industrial compost (Dynea 2009 and Dynea 2004) were tested alone and in combination with K-rich bottom wood ash (BWA). Fertilisation levels (150 kg N ha- 1 + 120 kg K ha- 1; 300 kg N ha- 1 + 240 kg K ha- 1) were based on total N and K content in Nrich waste and BWA, respectively. Treatments with BWA, artificial <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (minNPK) and calcium nitrate (minN) only, as well as an unfertilised control were used as references. Availability of mineral N was the key limiting factor to plant growth. Mineral fertiliser treatments resulted in the highest total yields being significantly different from all waste combinations Plants that received MBM or CFS fertilisation had good and even biomass production throughout the season, but fertilisation effects were limited by mineralised N. Mineral fertiliser equivalents of MBM and CFS treatments were between 48 - 73 %. MBM treatments increased the amount of soluble P in plant-soil systems to amounts that were higher than total P applied with the fertiliser product. MBM might therefore be a more valuable alternative P-fertiliser than one assumed so far. CFS seems to be more appropriate as an ingredient in alternative NPK fertiliser products than MBM because of reduced effects on residual P in the soil, good availability of P in the material, as well as a wider N:P ratio and relatively high initial amounts of mineral N. Dynea composts had poor fertilisation effects and can therefore rather be classified as soil conditioners than as fertilisers. K fertilisation effect of BWA was hidden by sufficient K supply from the soil but K-AL values of soils that were fertilised with BWA were significantly higher than soils of unfertilised control treatments. MinN + BWA treatments had poor establishment due to local pH increase and initial P deficiency, but leaching or denitrification of NO 3 -N was avoided so that the treatments still resulted in vigorous plant growth {{towards the end of the}} season. Before waste-based NPK fertiliser products are ready for commercial production, further studies have to be done on the optimisation of their N fertilisation value...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) is a {{nutrient}} element {{necessary for}} plant growth and development. However, excessive inputs of N {{will lead to}} inefficient use and large N losses to the environment, which can adversely affect air and water quality, biodiversity and human health. To {{examine the effects of}} controlled-release fertilisers (CRF) on yield, we measured ammonia volatilisation, N use efficiency (NUE) and photosynthetic rate after anthesis in summer maize hybrid cultivar Zhengdan 958. Maize was grown using common <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (CCF), the same amount of resin-coated controlled release fertiliser (CRFIII), the same amount of sulphur-coated controlled release fertiliser (SCFIII) as CCF, 75 % CRF (CRFII) and SCF (SCFII), 50 % CRF (CRFI) and SCF (SCFI), and no fertiliser. We found that treatments CRFIII, SCFIII, CRFII and SCFII produced grain yields that were 13. 15 %, 14. 15 %, 9. 69 % and 10. 04 % higher than CCF. There {{were no significant differences in}} grain yield among CRFI, SCFI and CCF. We also found that the ammonia volatilisation rates of CRF were significantly lower than those of CCF. The CRF treatments reduced the emission of ammonia by 51. 34 % to 91. 34 % compared to CCF. In addition, after treatment with CRF, maize exhibited a higher net photosynthetic rate than CCF after anthesis. Agronomic NUE and apparent N recovery were higher in the CRF treatment than in the CCF treatment. The N uptake and physiological NUE of the four yield-enhanced CRF treatments were higher than those of CCF. These results suggest that the increase in NUE in the CRF treatments was generally attributable to the higher photosynthetic rate and lower ammonia volatilisation compared to CCF-treated maize...|$|E

In 1970 three production plants were commissioned: of sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and fertiliser. The plants in Police {{as one of the}} first in the country produced <b>compound</b> <b>fertilisers</b> (NP).

40|$|The {{results of}} a further follow up of two cohorts of men {{identified}} as manufacturers of fertilisers in the 1961 and 1971 censuses of England and Wales are reported.

In the 1961 cohort the previous findings are replicated [...] low mortality from all causes, all cancers, and all circulatory diseases, and no evidence of dose response relation nor excess mortality from cancer at any site. In the 1971 cohort there remain more deaths from cancer than expected {{but none of the}} observed deaths from individual cancers differs significantly from expectation by comparison with national mortality rates or rates for other employed men. Evidence of an association between cancer mortality and frequency of exposure to nitrate containing dust is strengthened in the reanalysis of the 1971 cohort after longer follow up, but a negative trend, significant for digestive organ cancers, is observed in the analysis by product type in which manufacturers of straight nitrogen and <b>compound</b> <b>fertilisers</b> might have been expected to be most at risk. Failure to find specifically any excess mortality from gastric cancer and the contradictory dose response relations, weigh against the notion that the nonsignificant excesses of cancers in the 1971 cohort are related to nitrate exposure...|$|R

40|$|Senecio vulgaris (groundsel), healthy or inoculated with rust (Puccinia lagenophorae), {{was grown}} in a {{nutrient}}-poor sand-soil mixture amended with a <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> {{to provide a}} range of nutrient regimes. The greatest number of pustules per plant occurred on unamended soil but fertiliser addition increased the sporulating area of each pustule: the leaf area occupied by pustules was unaffected by nutrient supply. Since total leaf area increased with increasing nutrient supply, the percentage of total area that was infected declined. Plant and root dry weights increased with nutrient supply and decreased with rust infection. Infection also reduced root fresh weight and length, which were little changed by nutrient supply, but reduced leaf area only under the most nutrient-rich conditions. The ratios of root length: leaf area (R:L) and, especially, root:shoot dry weight (R:S) were reduced by infection. Root length per unit root weight was increased by infection when expressed {{on the basis of}} dry weight but {{not on the basis of}} fresh weight. Conversely, increasing nutrient supply decreased root length:weight only on the basis of fresh weight. The concentrations of P and K per unit dry weight were increased in rusted leaves but that of N was unchanged. Because infection increased the dry weight: fresh weight ratio (d. wt:f. wt) of leaves, concentrations of P and K on a fresh weight basis increased by up to 3 -fold over those in controls and that of N was also substantially increased. On a dry weight basis, the concentration of N and K, but not P, increased in the roots of rusted plants. However, since d. wt:f. wt of roots was decreased in infected plants, the concentrations of N and K were unchanged on a fresh weight basis and that of P was significantly reduced. Rates of uptake of N, P and K were significantly increased in rusted plants both on the basis of root dry weight and root length. This was attributed to increased ‘shoot demand’ on each unit of root which, in turn, reflected the decreased R:S and R:L of infected plants...|$|E
30|$|Leaching of {{nutrient}} {{might be}} influenced by sorption capacity of biochar. Lower amount of nutrient leached in biochar amended soil may indicate higher retention of nutrient in the medium, and more nutrients available for plant uptake. The capability of biochar to reduce NH 4 +-N losses was frequently reported under controlled environment (Sika and Hardie 2014; Kammann et al. 2014) and natural leaching condition (Ventura et al. 2013; Sorrenti et al. 2012). These evidence suggested that the physico–chemical characteristics of biochar, which has high cation exchangeable capacity (Liang et al. 2006) and surface area {{with the presence of}} polar and non-polar surface site (Cheng et al. 2008; Ding et al. 2010) make it a good soil nutrient-retaining additive. Another possible theory is that NH 4 +-N may have remain clogged inside biochar pores structures (Saleh et al. 2012) as biochar pore sizes varies due to its production method and types of feedstock. In contrast, biochar showed insignificant effect on NO 3 −-N leaching throughout the study period. Theoretically, anion exchange capacity of biochar is usually very low (Mukherjee et al. 2011; Taghizadeh-Toosi et al. 2011) and eventually decreased over time (Cheng et al. 2008). Thus, NO 3 − ions were not strongly held on biochar surfaces. Regardless of the treatment rates, most of inorganic N leached was mainly in the form of NO 3 −-N. The ammonium-nitrate based of <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (NPK blue) used in this study was presumably responsible for the greater concentration of NO 3 −-N leached. Biochar amendment also did not influence the cumulative concentration of P in leachates. Previous studies suggested that P was not likely sorbed {{to the surface of the}} majority types of biochar (Yao et al. 2012; Hale et al. 2013; Zheng et al. 2013) due to the negative surface charges. Therefore, negligible effect of EFB biochar on P release pattern was expected and confirmed by the leaching results. The amount of K leached was highest as compared to control and corresponded well with the amount of biochar applied. This reflected the relatively high K content from EFB biochar (Tables  2 and 4) which led to higher K released, especially at the early stage.|$|E
40|$|Para avaliar o azoto disponibilizado para as plantas a partir de fertilizantes minerais e orgânicos, foi instalado um ensaio em vasos com azevém anual. Os fertilizantes utilizados foram: Casca de Castanha (CC) com 0, 6 % de azoto (N); Estrume de Bovino (EB), com 2, 3 % de N; Beira Adubo (BA), um guano {{comercial}} com 3, 0 % de N; Nitrato de Amónio (NA), com 20, 5 % de N, Entec (En), adubo com um inibidor da nitrificação, com 26 % de N; e Fertigafsa (Fg), adubo composto ternário 4 - 16 - 12. Estabeleceu-se também uma modalidade Testemunha (T) sem N. Todos os fertilizantes foram aplicados em dose equivalente a 200 mg de N por kg da fracção terra fina de um solo com textura franco-limosa, com pH (H 2 O) 5, 2 e 27 g kg- 1 de matéria orgânica. Em todos os vasos foi aplicada uma solução nutritiva sem N. A sementeira foi efectuada a 1 de Outubro de 2004. Após germinação, foram mantidas 50 plantas por vaso. A produção de biomassa foi avaliada em 6 cortes, entre 9 de Novembro de 2004 e 4 de Agosto de 2005. Foi avaliada a produção de biomassa, o N exportado e o N aparentemente recuperado (NAR). A produção média acumulada de matéria seca variou significativamente entre 1, 7 e 4, 1 g/vaso em T e NA, respectivamente. A modalidade NA registou a exportação mais elevada (167 mg N/vaso) e o maior valor de NAR (64 %). Entre os fertilizantes minerais destacou-se o menor valor de NAR associado a En (45 %), enquanto que os materiais orgânicos BA e EB tiveram comportamento semelhante entre si (24 e 22 %, respectivamente). Nestas condições, os fertilizantes orgânicos (BA e EB) e En foram pouco efectivos na libertação de N para a cultura. Os resultados fazem antever dificuldades na gestão destes fertilizantes em culturas anuais de ciclo curto, uma vez que estas podem ficar privadas de N durante fases importantes do seu desenvolvimento. A {{pot experiment}} with italian ryegrass {{was carried out}} to evaluate the N release from several fertilisers and organic amendments. The fertilizing materials were: chestnut fruit bark (CC), with 0. 6 % N, farmyard manure (EB), with 2. 3 % N, Beira Adubo (BA), a commercial organic amendment with 3 % N; ammonium nitrate (NA), with 20. 5 % N; Entec (En), a fertiliser with a nitrification inhibitor, with 26 % N; Fertigafsa (Fg) a 4 - 16 - 12 <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> and control (T) without N fertilisation. All the fertilisers were applied at a rate equivalent to 200 mg N per kg of soil (< 2 mm). A silt-loam soil with pH(H 2 O) 5. 2 and 27 g kg- 1 of organic matter {{was used in the}} soil/fertiliser mixtures. A nutrient solution without N was added to all the pots. The crop was sown on the 1 st October, 2004. After crop emergence, the plants were thinned to 50 plants per pot. Six harvests of ryegrass were taken between November 9, 2004 and August 4, 2005. Nitrogen uptake and apparent N recovery (NAR) were also estimated after the determination of tissue N content. Total dry matter yields (6 cuts) were significantly different between treatments. Extreme values ranged between 1. 7 g/pot (T) and 4. 1 g/pot (NA). The higher N uptake was recorded in the NA treatment (167 mg N/pot), as well as the higher NAR (64 %). Entec produced the lowest NAR (45 %) among the mineral fertilisers. The organic amendments BA and EB showed similar NAR, 24 and 22 %, respectively. The N released from BA, EB and En during the growing season was very low. The results stress the difficulties in properly managing this kind of fertilisers in annual crops with short growing cycles, where a N shortage could occur during important phases of crop development...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} can {{be traced}} back to the early 20 th century, initiated by the Austrian spiritual philosopher Rudolf Steiner. It was later diversified by a number of key people, and more recent versions are guided by principles issued by the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements (IFOAM), founded in 1972. Organic practices were built upon the life philosophies and convictions of the founders regarding how to perceive nature. Today, those original views and ideas are considered as history. However, to understand the principles and opinions of modern organic agriculture, such as the exclusion of water-soluble inorganic fertilisers, we analysed the original ideas and arguments of the founders, who shared the common principle of relying on natural processes and methods, seen as a prerequisite for human health. For example, the British agriculturalist Sir Albert Howard, who together with Lady Eve Balfour founded the British Soil Association, claimed that healthy soils are the basis for human health on earth. In their view, healthy soils could only be obtained if the organic matter content was increased or at least maintained. Later, the German physician and microbiologist Hans-Peter Rusch together with the Swiss biologists Hans and Maria Müller, focused on applying natural principles in agriculture, driven by the conviction that nature is our master and always superior. Even though these early ideas have been abandoned or modified in modern organic agriculture, the principle of the founders regarding exclusion of synthetic <b>compounds</b> (<b>fertilisers</b> and pesticides) is still the main driver for choosing crops and pest control methods...|$|R
40|$|In Finland {{selenium}} {{has been}} added to fertilisers for 20 years. This has been founded on comprehensive, long-term research and monitoring as well as measures undertaken because of the results. The addition of selenium to fertilisers in Finland may be considered an excellent example of good collaboration between companies, research and authorities which has improved the quality of Finnish food and raised the selenium intake from food to a sufficient level in view of human and animal health. In Finland the shortage of selenium in the nutrition of domestic animals was detected as early as the 1950 s and 1960 s. The issue became topical again in the 1970 s, when the low selenium content in Finnish food had been proven in extensive scientific studies. The selenium intake of the Finnish population was below all recommendations. In December 1983 the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry set up a Selenium Working Group to draft a proposal concerning the addition of selenium to the general fertilisers. Another task of the Working Group was to draw up a research and monitoring plan for observing the impacts of the added selenium on the soil, plants, feedingstuffs and foodstuffs of plant and animal origin. The selenium intake of humans and animals was also to be studied and monitored. The work group assessed the impacts of the added selenium and, where necessary, gave proposals for revising the selenium quantities to be added. In accordance with the proposal of the Selenium Working Group, selenium {{has been added}} to multinutrient fertilisers used in agriculture and horticulture. At first the quantity added was 16 mg of selenium per kilo of fertiliser for cereals and 6 mg/kg for grasses. In spring 1990 the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry decided, based on a proposal of the Selenium Working Group, to lower the quantity of selenium to be added to solid multinutrient fertilisers to 6 mg per kilo of fertiliser, and the addition of selenium to other fertilisers was prohibited. This was done because the increase in the selenium content in cereals and selenium intake was higher than expected. There was also some uncertainty as to the possible environmental impacts of the added selenium in fertilisers. The reduction led to a considerable decrease in the selenium content of feedingstuffs, fodder cereals and domestic foodstuffs. The Finnish Fertiliser Act was amended in 1993, and the Decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry issued under the Fertiliser Act in 1994 also adjusted the maximum allowable quantity of selenium in fertilisers. Now 6 mg of selenium as selenite could be added to multinutrient and inorganic <b>compound</b> <b>fertilisers</b> intended for agriculture and horticulture. However, the decision did not concern EC fertilisers. In 1998 the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry decided to commission the Agricultural Research Centre of Finland (later MTT Agrifood Research Finland) to carry out the selenium monitoring. The legislation on fertilisers was last amended {{on the basis of a}} proposal of the Selenium Working Group in 1998, when the quantity of selenium to be added to inorganic <b>compound</b> <b>fertilisers</b> for agriculture and horticulture was raised by a Decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry from 6 mg to 10 mg of selenite per kilo of fertiliser. Again this decision did not concern EC fertilisers. The decision was based on observations which showed that the selenium intake of domestic animals and humans had decreased, first as a result of the reduction in the selenium quantity in 1990, and then due to the decrease in the use of multinutrient fertilisers. The conditions for environmental support and restrictions on the use of phosphorus had already clearly reduced the use of multinutrient fertilisers so that the selenium quantity per hectare of arable land has been decreasing. The monitoring of selenium continues in Finland, but so far the Selenium Working Group has given no indications to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of any need to adjust the selenium quantities in inorganic fertilisers in the upcoming Fertiliser Product Act. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

40|$|Water melons Cue: Water melons {{have been}} {{cultivated}} {{by people in}} Africa for over 4000 years, and long before {{that would have been}} collected from the wild by people {{in the southern part of}} the continent, where they are a native plant. Spread into Europe from north Africa around a thousand years ago, and into South America by the Spanish colonists, they grow best in places that have long, hot summers, and are more resistant to drought than other types of melon. They tend to be popular with both farmers and shoppers, because of their high juice content, and the high price they can fetch in the market. The common cultivated varieties are very distinctive, with their dark green outer skin and bright red flesh. Ousman Konateh has been growing water melons on the outskirts of Banjul in The Gambia, for more than twenty years. Ismaila Senghore talked to him about what he had learned during this long period of successful farming. IN:		?On an area of land of 30 metres by 30 metres? OUT:		? whenever they have the possibility. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ousmane Konateh, a water melon farmer from Banjul in The Gambia. Transcript Konateh	(Vernac) On an area of land of 30 metres by 30 metres you can harvest up to a thousand watermelons and that is only the first harvest because you can harvest up to three times. In the last harvest you can also make up to 300 watermelons. Senghore	Now Mr Konateh let?s now look at the aspect of growing the crop itself. Now you said the soil was good but what about a situation where the soil conditions and water conditions are not very good. Do you think you will still have a good harvest? Konateh	(Vernac) For the soil aspect actually even on poor soil conditions watermelons do very well. But it would be necessary to apply <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser</b> which you can buy and mix it with the soil and then grow your melons. You can also grow them using animal dung, like cow dung for fertiliser. That will also be very, very productive and you can have very good sweet watermelons from there. It is also important to know that sandy soils are better than clay soils. Senghore	Now let?s talk a bit about the pests, because insects can also be a bit of a problem? Konateh	(Vernac) Well on the side of pests actually one must just contact the agricultural extension workers who give very good advice. Because when it is flowering time it would be necessary to spray the crop and when it starts fruiting it will also be necessary to spray maybe weekly to control pests. But actually the best thing to do is to contact the agricultural extension workers who are always with us and helping us, giving us advice. They are the experts so definitely they are very helpful in that respect. So we do not have difficulty in that area. Senghore	Mr Konateh, what would you tell anybody who has never grown watermelon anywhere in the Third world? What good advice would you tell such a person if he wants to embark on growing watermelon and what incentives can attract a person to this particular crop? Konateh	(Vernac) Actually the first thing to think about if you want to farm watermelons is to get the seeds and get the land and of course the other inputs that are necessary. And when it comes to guarding also the field because you would need to guard it against thieves and against animals that may pilfer the farm. Of course it can be a crop that you can use as an intervention, for example for late starting of the rainy season. If you were away travelling or you were sick and you could not grow on time now an opportunity is there for you to still grow watermelons and they can produce. Because the growing season is very short, it is about just two months you can plant your seeds, even at the end of the rains with minimum water you can still harvest. And if you are a normal farmer and the rains are good, everything is OK. You can still grow melons and it would be an added income, an added value on your yearly earnings. But it is important to know that they are in fact also possible to grow at the beginning of rains and that is when you know you have a lot of productivity. The only problem is that a lot would also get spoilt because of the amount of water at that time. But the important thing to note is that the early season crops are the most valuable because at that time it is out of the market and then they fetch very, very high value. So I would advise everybody to go into the production of watermelons whenever they have the possibility. End of track. Ousman Konateh, who has been growing water melons on his farm outside Banjul in The Gambia for over 20 years, explains some basic rules for producing this popular food crop...|$|E
40|$|Low soil {{fertility}} in the Eastern Cape Province (EC) {{is attributed to}} poor agricultural management, which reduces organic matter, among other factors. Conservation agriculture (CA), consisting of no-till, soil cover and rotations, is being promoted to improve soil quality and productivity. Soil biological parameters respond to the overall effects of management on the physical and chemical components of soil. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of oat (Avena sativa) and grazing vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) cover crops on soil biological activity after five years under CA and evaluate light organic matter fractions, MBC and activities of selected enzymes as early indicators of organic matter build up under in no-till maize based CA system. The study was based on soil samples collected from a five year trial with rotations of maize and sole covercrops and two younger trials (4 and 28 months) with oat and grazing vetch bicultures. In the five year old trial, oat and grazing vetch were planted at four fertiliser regimes (i) Fertilizer applied to cover crops and maize (F 1), (ii) fertilizer applied to cover crops only (F 2), (iii) fertilizer applied to maize only (F 3) and (iv) no fertilizer applied (F 4)) to give a 2 × 4 factorial plus control laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Fertilizer was applied at 10 kg P ha- 1, as a compound (6. 7 % N; 10 % P; 13. 3 % K) at planting and grazing vetch was inoculated with Rhizobium legunominosarium biovar viciae. Oat was top dressed using limestone ammonium nitrate (LAN – 28 % N) at 7 weeks after planting (WAP) to make a total of 45 kg N ha- 1. Three weeks after termination of the cover crops, all plots were split in half and maize was planted and fertilizer applied at 0 and 60 N kg ha- 1. A third of the N was applied at planting (6. 7 % N; 10 % P; 13. 3 % K). In the biculture trials, the treatments were 90 % oat + 10 % vetch, 70 % oat + 30 % vetch, 50 % oat+ 50 % vetch, 100 % vetch and 100 % oat and laid out in a RCBD with three replicates. Only basal fertilizer was applied to the cover crop at planting at 13. 34 kg N ha- 1, 20 kg P ha- 1 and 26. 66 kg K ha- 1 using 2 : 3 : 4 (30 + 0. 5 % Zn) <b>compound</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> After cover crop termination, SC 701 maize variety was planted, and fertilised at 60 kg N ha- 1 with a third of the N applied as a basal. In the five year old trial, oat and vetch gave significantly (P < 0. 05) higher MBC and activities of all soil enzymes measured than the weedy fallow at 0 - 5 and 5 - 20 cm depths. Fertilization of cover crop (F 2) and maize (F 3) gave similar MBC. The F 4 in cover crops gave similar dehydrogenase activity with F 3 under weedy fallow and that for vetch rotation was the same for F 3 in oat. The F 4 for grazing vetch had similar β-glucosidase activity as F 1 and similar urease activity as F 1, F 2 and F 3 of oat rotations. Acid and alkaline activity in F 1 had similar results to F 2. In the younger trials, biculture treatments did not improve total C, and N when compared with the weedy fallow. Dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, arylsulphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities were higher in the 28 month trial compared to the 4 month one while urease was higher in the 4 -month old trial. Treatments with more than 50 % oat content had higher acid phosphatase activity in the 4 - than 28 month old trial. Effects of cover crop, as the main factor, was significant in all enzymes (P < 0. 05), with 70 % oat + 30 % vetch treatment having the highest dehydrogenase and arylsulphatase while for alkaline phosphatase it had similar results to 90 % oat + 10 % vetch. For β-glucosidase and urease, effects of cover crop as the main factor were also significant with sole vetch giving the highest activity for both enzymes. Acid phosphatase activity was highest in sole oat. Particulate OM was highest in the 100 % oat treatment and declined with decrease in the proportion of oat in the biculture. The 50 % oat + 50 % vetch treatment had similar POM to the 70 % oat + 30 % vetch in the 4 month old trial and to the 90 % oat + 10 % vetch in the 28 months old trial in the 0 - 5 cm depth (P < 0. 05). In the 5 - 20 cm depth, the 70 % oat + 30 % vetch treatment had similar POM to the 90 % oat + 10 % vetch in the 28 month old trial. The 70 % oat+ 30 % vetch had greatest WSC and MBC followed by the 90 % oat + 10 % vetch, with the 50 % oat + 50 % vetch being similar to 100 % vetch and 100 % oat (MBC only). The 28 months old trial had greater POM and WSC than the 4 months trial. The findings of this study imply that the use of grazing vetch and fertilization of cover crops only improves soil biological activity, represented by MBC and enzyme activities, after 5 years of maize-cover crop rotations in low input conservation agriculture system. Bicultures, particularly the 70 % oat + 30 % vetch, work better than their sole crops in improving organic matter fractions, MBC and enzyme activities and that POM, WSC, MBC, enzyme activities are useful early indicators of soil organic matter build-up of CA systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} tea {{development}} in Tanzania {{from the early}} part of this century to the present is summarised. Average yields of made tea from well managed estates in the Mufindi district have increased from around 600 kg ha- 1 in the late 1950 s to 3000 kg ha- 1 at the present time: by comparison, yields from smallholder farms have remained much lower, averaging only 400 - 500 kg ha- 1. There have been a large number of technical, economic and other changes over the last 30 to 40 years. The removal of shade trees, the use of herbicides, the application of NPK <b>compound</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> the introduction of irrigation (on some estates) and changes in harvesting policy have all contributed to the increases in yield. Financial and infrastructural problems have contributed to the low yields from many smallholders and others, and have limited the uptake of new technology. The contribution of research is reviewed, from the start of the Tea Research Institute of East Africa in Kenya in 1951, through to the development of the Marikitanda Tea Research Centre in Amani in 1967; the Ngwazi Tea Research Unit in Mufindi (1967 to 1970, and from 1986), and lastly the Kifyulilo Tea Research Station, also in Mufindi in 1986. The yield potential of well fertilized and irrigated clonal tea, grown at an altitude of 1800 m, is around 6000 kg ha- 1. This potential is reduced by drought, lack of fertilizer, bush vacancies and inefficient harvesting practices. The corresponding potential yields at high (2200 m) and low (1200 m) altitude sites range from 3000 - 3500 kg ha- 1 up to 9000 - 10000 kg ha- 1 and are largely a function of temperature. The opportunities for increasing yields of existing tea, smallholder and estate, are enormous. Tea production in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania is about to expand rapidly. Good, appropriate research is needed to sustain this development over the long term, and suggestions on how best this is done in order to assist the large scale producers as well as the smallholders, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pervaporative {{irrigation}} is a {{membrane technology}} {{that can be}} used for desalination and subsurface irrigation simultaneously. To irrigate, the tube-shaped polymer membrane is buried in soil and filled with water. Due to the membrane transport process, water enters the soil in vapor phase, drawn across the membrane when the relative humidity in the air-filled pores is low. Soils are typically humid environments, however, the presence of hygroscopic <b>compounds</b> such as <b>fertilisers</b> decreases the humidity. For example, at 20 oC the humidity in air in equilibrium above a saturated ammonium nitrate solution is 63 %. Here, experiments showed that the presence of fertilisers in sand increased the water flux across the membrane by an order of magnitude. An expression for vapor sorption into sand containing different hygroscopic compounds was developed and combined with a model of vapor and liquid flow in soil. The success of the model in simulating experimental results suggests that the proposed mechanism, adsorption of moisture from the vapor phase by hygroscopic compounds, explains the observed increase in the flux from the irrigation system...|$|R
40|$|Malting barley has {{to fulfil}} several quality demands {{to be fully}} accepted, and paid, by the malting industry. The {{cultivar}} has to be selected by the industry, {{the vitality of the}} lot has to be high, the husk has to be uninjured and the grain protein content has to be at the proper level and as even as possible. Flat protein levels are hard to achieve, as the grain protein over malting barley fields often vary 3 % around the field mean. The urge for even protein makes this crop a natural object for precision agriculture research, but surprisingly little has been reported. In the present project, precision agriculture methods have been used to monitor grain yield and grain protein of Swedish malting barley. The goal of the project has been, for spring sown Swedish malting barley, to understand the reasons for and patterns of the variability in grain protein, and design a method for fertilisation with a potential to produce more even protein with the proper mean level. It seems possible to design such a fertiliser system, provided that a restrained amount of <b>compound</b> NPKS <b>fertiliser</b> is combi-drilled at sowing and that the second fertiliser application as calcium nitrate is distributed, at the latest, at the two node stage of the barley. The second application needs the control from a remote sensor using an appropriate vegetation index. The most commonly used vegetation indices did not correlate well with the grain yield, or with the grain protein level at such an early stage, possibly because of disturbing reflections from the soil. However, a set of recently developed indices for maize did correlate with the patterns of both grain yield and grain protein. To get the mean values between years and places right, the regression algorithms also needed a measure of thermal stress during grain filling. A thermal stress index was designed as a temperature sum during three weeks, and a threshold for the temperature sum was optimised to 20 °C...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural liquid {{livestock}} wastes are {{an important}} potential source of valuable nitrogen-containing compounds such as ammonia and proteins. Large volumetric quantities of these wastes are produced in areas with a high livestock production density. Much technological research {{has been carried out}} in the past to recover nitrogen compounds from livestock wastes, usually within the framework of a more or less complete waste treatment process. A large part of this research did not result in applicable technology due to various technical and/or economical reasons. However, increasing interest in both the negative environmental aspects of agricultural liquid wastes and in recycling of valuable compounds promote further development of technologies for recovery valuable nitrogen compounds. In this paper the most important technologies to recover nitrogen compounds as valuable products are briefly discussed and evaluated. For each technology the stage of development, the applicability and the obtained experience is discussed. The evaluation covers biological conversion techniques like enzyme synthesis from ammonium and production of algae, chemical processes such as precipitation of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>compounds</b> and separation techniques such as stripping, partial condensation, and membrane chemo-sorption. It is emphasised that practical implementation of a technology can only be successful if both liquid animal waste producers and potential buyers and users of products of the treatment processes are heavily involved in the development of technology - a development that should start at farm level...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{forecast}} increases in crop productivity reliably over a whole rotation is frequently restricted {{by a lack}} of experimental data measured con-sistently over a long enough period of time. Four long-term trials in Australasian plantation Pinus radiata D. Don, in which responses to fertiliser have been measured for between 10 and 18 years, are analysed here to examine whether responses increase, decrease, or are maintained with the passage of time. Three of the four experiments showed a diverging and <b>compounding</b> response to <b>fertiliser</b> throughout the periods of measurement. Such a finding appears to be in complete accord with widely held principles of crop growth and yield. Never-theless, the same result was not achieved in the fourth trial; after a highly significant response of 4. 5 m 2 /ha in stand basal area 4 years after fertiliser application, the response eroded to 2. 0 m 2 /ha after a further 6 years of growth. Other examples are cited where fertiliser responses were either compounded or partially lost with time. Sites with marginal or marginally-induced nitrogen deficiency seem likely to exhibit sustained responses but grossly deficient sites may not necessarily behave similarly. Examination of the residual errors in the trials, and their effects over time, suggests that experimental variation is a function of site, as well as a response to basic growth and size factors...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} about the factors {{influencing}} the purchases of fertiliser and prescription farming in general and Pivot fertilisers and the Pivot Prescription Farming in particular. The purchase of Pivot fertilisers {{in this study is}} defined to be a decision about Pivot as the main fertiliser company. Meanwhile, the purchase of Pivot Prescription Farming is defined as whether or not farmers purchase the Pivot Prescription Farming for the on going activities of their farms. Prescription farming, in this study, refers to services associated with farm inputs such as soil testing and plant analysis. Farmers' decision-making process on the farm inputs, including the choice within a product class, might be dominantly influenced by the problem-solving process. However, the human factors in the farmers' decision is also important. Thus, the farmer's decision-making process is likely to be based on a combination of cognitive and emotional models. In the context of farm income, farmers normally face three stages on the problem of their income allocation. First, allocation to production, consumption and savings. Second, allocation to the categories of generic products in farm activities such as tractors, <b>compound</b> feed and <b>fertilisers.</b> Third, allocation within a product class such as a particular product type or brand. Since the purchase of fertiliser and prescription farming might be categorised as an out-stock situation, the buying process for these inputs only involves stage three. Past research has indicated that the purchase of fertilisers from a particular firm might be affected by quality, price, service, availability of fertiliser, distribution coverage and a specific relationship with the firm. Past studies on the use of soil testing and plant analysis, which are some elements of prescription farming, have shown that price, turnaround time, reliability of results, service and follow up of the service have influenced the use of these services. Additionally, knowledge about available providers, which reflects the amount of information possessed, may influence the purchase. The quantitative analyses in this study use existing data from Pivot Ltd. The method used in this study is logistic regression. The decision on the purchase of Pivot Prescription Farming is involved in the model for the decision on Pivot as the main fertiliser company, and vice versa. For this particular sample, the results revealed that no variable was found to be significant in explaining the decision about Pivot as the main fertiliser company. Only the purchase of Pivot Prescription Fanning and some dummy variables for types of farm and states were significant. The result may indicate that subjective norm appears in the outcome. For the decision about the purchase of the Pivot Prescription Farming, knowledge about service provider, follow up, turnaround time and the decision on Pivot as the main fertiliser company significantly affected the purchase. Those results indicated that farmers who chose Pivot as their main fertiliser company were more likely to purchase the Pivot Prescription Farming, and vice versa. The results also revealed {{that there is a need}} to do further research to incorporate with the important issues such as brand loyalty, consumer attitude formation, and the multipersonal influence in farm enterprise, in a better survey with more exhaustive data collection methods.

40|$|Accidents in {{the field}} and on the farm require as much {{attention}} as the appalling lack of safety elsewhere in the food chain. For producers, processors and consumers worldwide, safety measures are often too little, too late and for the unorganised too far away. We all need to eat, and we all need to live. Agriculture is what makes us what we are. Why then do we treat agriculture so badly? At one end of the food chain, in the consumer s shopping basket, there are shrill yelps about food safety. They {{are only part of the}} issue and, with all due respect, a small part of the safety equation. All along the food chain, from the plough to the plate, there is scant respect for the safety of those who produce and process food. Their health and safety is vital, and not only for themselves: without a safe production process, without safe producers, there are no safe consumers. Agriculture is not a romance. Among everything else it means to us, it is a rough, tough world of injury, disability, disease and death. It is the third most hazardous sector after mining and construction. About half of the world s 250 million workplace injuries are estimated to occur in agriculture. Each year, worldwide, according to estimates from the International Labour Office (ILO), 170, 000 workers are killed in the agricultural sector. The sector employs half the world s labour force, with about 1. 3 billion workers active in agricultural production. About 10 per cent (17, 000) of these deaths take place in sub-Saharan Africa. The agricultural labour force in ACP States and other developing countries is known for its high levels of self-employment, although overall half is in some form of waged employment. Self-employed or not, no worker deliberately injures himself or herself, although many people will take highly dangerous shortcuts in their work, under pressure to produce and earn marginal incomes. But danger there is, partly rooted in a lack of safety awareness and education, partly in incomplete training and instructions, and in part in the age-old predominance of gain over sane. Danger! Farmers at work The high levels of fatalities and injuries in agriculture twice as high as most other sectors are due to its special conditions. Much agricultural work involves multiple tasks and multiple locations, most of them in the open air, exposing workers to climatic conditions. Much work is seasonal, with added urgency. Workers are in frequent or constant contact with animals and plants, and are exposed to bites, poisoning, infections, parasitic diseases, allergies and toxicity. The postures required in many agricultural tasks, coupled with ill-designed manual tools or mechanical equipment, lead to injury and disabilities. The levels of exposure to pesticides and other chemicals are renowned many small-scale farmers are unaware of the dangers of pesticides and have no practical access to either clear instructions or protective clothing. The safety position on formal, large-scale farms is often no better. The ILO reports many cases in Zimbabwe and Ethiopia where neither training nor protection is available to most workers, at least not to casual or temporary workers. Away from the field, the lack of safety is equally alarming. Small, ill-lit, ill-ventilated workplaces with poorly-protected equipment are often the icons of agro-processing plants, at least in the informal sector. The risks for the safety of workers, and the hygiene of the end-product, are serious. Read the rule-book As production intensifies, the techniques for crop cultivation and livestock rearing, food processing and distribution become more complex. The introduction of more machinery and numerous chemical <b>compounds,</b> from <b>fertilisers</b> to cleaning agents, each bring potentially harmful human and environmental effects in their wake. And yet the sector, and those agencies and legislative bodies which provide its enabling environment, are failing to accompany these changes with appropriate information, training and, to be blunt, safety legislation. There are already about twenty conventions on occupational safety and health (OSH) which have been adopted by the governments, employers and workers organisations which comprise the ILO. Countries such as Sweden and Finland have ratified 85 % or more; most ACP States between four and none. Even where laws can be realistically applied, agriculture is often omitted from OSH legislation of many countries. In Kenya and Brazil, for example, labour laws apply to agriculture as well as to other industries but the laws of Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo exclude agricultural workers completely or partially. The legislation of yet other countries has a wider scope: in Fiji, Namibia and South Africa, employers are required to safeguard the safety and health of people other than employees who might be affected by the work of the enterprise. It is the casual labourer and self-employed farmer who are least likely to be protected. In Ethiopia it is estimated that 80 per cent of national economic activity falls outside the Labour Code, consisting of small-scale and subsistence farming. Women often fall into these categories, working on self-employed smallholdings and as seasonal labourers. In all, more than 700 million agricultural workers worldwide, and more than 130 million in ACP countries, fall outside the theoretical or real protection of OSH legislation. Where there is no enforcer The well-known saying Safety begins at home applies in agriculture as much as in any other sector. The unacceptable numbers of occupational fatalities and injuries in agriculture could clearly be substantially reduced by a more general safety -mindedness among workers. This is a question of on-the-job training, to be sure, but also of general education. One by one, the measures are easy enough to list. How about encouraging blacksmiths to add covers to chopping machines, or involving women in designing lighter hand tools which cause less muscle strain? It is at the grassroots level that safety will take hold, but it is at other levels that it will be made possible. At a seminar on Safety and Health organised in Bamako, Mali, by the ILO, the International Union of Food workers (IUF) and the CTA in December 2000, participants called for action across the political and legislative stage, as well as by civil society and development bodies (more about this in Spore 92). Safety in agriculture is, though, virgin territory in terms of development policies; it has, quite simply, been neglected by many bodies of national and global governance for decades. That could be about to change, with a Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention being presented for adoption to the general conference of the ILO in June 2001. It is ambitious, it is overdue and, praised be its designers, it is inclusive. It insists that the specific needs of self-employed farmers, women, seasonal workers and young workers be addressed, and that they enjoy protection equivalent to that provided to other workers in agriculture. It does not, however, cover subsistence farming, forestry or agro-processing, the latter being covered in principle by industrial conventions. For those accustomed to working in the formal sector, whether government inspectors or trade union organisers, this convention will challenge attitudes and ways of work. The task of getting it adopted is in itself a massive challenge, as the participants to the Bamako seminar affirmed. The harder, and even more necessary, task is to find ways and means to implement it. We all need to eat, and we all need to be safe. [summary points] Among measures needed to promote occupational safety and health in agriculture: - school curriculum development and media campaigns on safety awareness - re-training of extension workers, agricultural engineers, government inspectorates and trade unions - incentives (credit, awards, prizes) for safe tools and equipment - promotion of safe use, storage and disposal of chemicals at all stages of agricultural production - strengthening enforcement capacity of national safety bodies - inclusion of national safety bodies in agricultural policy formulation and implementation - overall legislative framework, adoption of ILO Convention See 'Links' for access to Safety and Health informationAccidents {{in the field}} and on the farm require as much attention as the appalling lack of safety elsewhere in the food chain.
