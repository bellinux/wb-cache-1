But there is a supporting important <b>skill,</b> it is <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skill.</b> Therefore, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> {{is very important}} to express opinion. The ability of every student about English is different, some students are interested in speaking English like expressing pinion, they are free to express their ideas, thought and feelings. Therefore, they have to master <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> so that they can express their idea. According to Ucon, Izza in Hemisphere theory (2012), <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> is a process that learners demanded to express and evaluate the information.

Billed as doing [...] "for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India", Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people, including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skills.</b> He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves" [...] and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country.

500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skills,</b> insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E

It is a non-experimental quantitative research for students in Assalam Kinder-garten. There are some <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> indicators, such as clarity, accuracy, precision, depth, breath, relevance, and logic. By using assessment based on criterion referenced inter-pretations, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skill  is so real and absolute, while by using assessment based on norm referenced interpretations, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> is so relative depends on their groups. Based on criterion referenced interpretations, there are 24 students can’t think critically because their scores are lower than minimum limit and 10 students can think critically because their scores are higher than minimum limit. Based on norm referenced interpreta-tions, there are 19 students think critically above average and 15 students think critically under average. So, the assessment of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> for early age children can be strong foundation to prepare the best stimulation for optimalizing their <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> until mature in the future. Abstrak Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mempelajari secara komprehensif penilaian keterampilan berpikir kritis untuk anak-anak usia dini berdasarkan penilaian acuan kriteria dan penilaian acuan norma. Ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif non-eksperimental untuk siswa di TK Assalam. Ada beberapa indikator keterampilan berpikir kritis, seperti kejelasan, akurasi, presisi, kedalaman, keluasan, relevansi, dan logika. Dengan menggunakan penilaian acuan kriteria, keterampilan berpikir kritis menjadi nyata dan mutlak, sementara dengan menggunakan penilaian acuan norma, keterampilan berpikir kritis menjadi sangat relatif tergantung pada kelompok mereka. Berdasarkan penilaian acuan kriteria, ada 24 siswa tidak dapat berpikir kritis karena nilai mereka lebih rendah dari batas minimum dan 10 siswa dapat berpikir kritis karena nilai mereka lebih tinggi dari batas minimum. Berdasarkan penilaian acuan norma, ada 19 siswa berpikir kritis di atas rata-rata dan 15 siswa berpikir kritis di bawah rata-rata. Jadi,  penilaian keterampilan berpikir kritis untuk anak-anak usia dini dapat menjadi dasar yang kuat untuk mempersiapkan stimulasi terbaik untuk mengoptimalkan keterampilan berpikir kritis mereka sampai matang di masa depan.
