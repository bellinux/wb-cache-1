40|$|Reduction of {{graphene}} oxide {{is primarily}} important because different reduction methods {{may result in}} graphene with totally different properties. For systematically exploring the reduction of graphene oxide, studies of the temperature-dependent electrical properties of graphene oxide (GO) are urgently required. In this work, for the first time, broadband dielectric spectroscopy was used to carry out an in situ investigation on the transition of the electrical properties of GO paper from - 40 to 150 degrees C. The results clearly reveal a very interesting four-stage transition of electrical properties of GO paper with increasing temperature: insulator below 10 degrees <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> 1), semiconductor at between 10 and 90 degrees <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> 2), insulator at between 90 and 100 degrees <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> 3), and semiconductor again at above 100 degrees <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> 4). Subsequently, the transition mechanism was discussed in combination with detailed dielectric properties, microstructure and thermogravimetric analyses. It is suggested that the temperature-dependent transition of electronic properties of GO is {{closely associated with the}} ion mobility, water molecules removal and the reduction of GO in the GO paper. Most importantly, the present work clearly demonstrates the reduction of GO paper starts at above 100 degrees C...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} phase transformations in {{metastable}} beta Ti 15 Mo alloy were investigated by an in situ electrical resistance measurement {{in a wide}} range of temperatures from 196 C to 850 C. Different temperature ranges of the evolution of electrical resistance were correlated with underlying phase transformations. In the low temperature range, stage I (from 196 C to 220 C) the decrease of electrical resistance with increasing temperature is caused by the dissolution of ωath (formed during quenching by athermal shue transformation) which is accompanied by the relaxation of lattice strain, while the diffusional assisted growth of ωiso in the range from 220 C to 380 <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> II) is the main mechanism causing the increase of resistance. Another decrease of the resistance in the range from 380 C to 550 <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> III) is explained by the dissolution or transformation of ωiso. The increase of resistance above 550 <b>C</b> (<b>stage</b> IV) is related to the growth of α-phase particles. The fully reversible character of ωath growth and dissolution during heating and cooling in the stage I up to 100 C was confirmed by temperature cycling during repeated in situ resistance runs from RT. Pre-ageing of samples at 300 C promotes the formation of ωiso particles. Subsequently, ωath particles are not created, which is fully consistent with electrical resistance measurements. The presence of ωath and the orientation relationship between ω and β were identified by the electron diffraction...|$|E

40|$|The {{inherent}} brittleness {{of ceramics}} {{often results in}} catastrophic failure due to microcrack damage caused by thermal treatment or mechanical loading. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been performed to analyze microcrack damage in ceramics caused by thermal shock [1 – 7]. Hasselman [1, 2] proposed a simple model describing the strength behavior of ceramic materials {{as a function of}} thermal shock temperature difference ΔT. The important characteristic parameter in this model is the critical temperature difference, ΔT c. For thermal shock temperature differences less than ΔT <b>c</b> (<b>stage</b> I, Fig. 1) ceramics retain their strength. Thermal shocks with temperature differences equal to ΔT <b>c</b> (<b>stage</b> II) are characterized by unstable crack propagation and instantaneous decreases in strength. Above ΔT c is a plateau of constant strength (stage III), where cracks are subcritical and gradual decrease in strength is observed at higher thermal shock temperatures (stage IV).

40|$|Bicycle {{infrastructure}} is being constructed in Australia to encourage safer and faster cycling trips. However, {{there has been}} limited evaluation {{of the impact of}} infrastructure investments. This study examined the behavioural impact of a new segment of a dedicated bikeway (Veloway 1 [V 1] <b>Stage</b> <b>C)</b> that links southern suburbs with Brisbane city centre. The V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> opened in June, 2013. Cyclists who used a pre-existing shared path that links southern suburbs with the city centre completed an intercept survey pre- and post-V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> opening. Cyclists who used the V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> after it opened completed the same survey at the same time post-V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> opening. Survey data were complemented by GPS bicycle count data from cyclists riding on the main cycle routes into the city centre from southern suburbs: the V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C,</b> the pre-existing shared path and a major arterial road. Survey data showed that pre- to post-V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> opening, average bicycle trip distance of cyclists using the shared path decreased (p= 0. 002), and the main catchment area of that path narrowed to suburbs to the west of it (p< 0. 001). Compared to cyclists using the shared path post-V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> opening, those using the V 1 were travelling longer distances (p= 0. 02) and were more committed to making their trip by bicycle (p= 0. 001). The GPS bicycle counts increased monthly on the V 1 <b>Stage</b> <b>C</b> after it opened (p< 0. 002). GPS bicycle counts on the alternative routes did not change (p= 0. 84).

40|$|In a {{previous}} report, we identified Sebox {{as a new}} candidate maternal effect gene that is essential for embryonic development and primarily impacts the two-cell (2 <b>C)</b> <b>stage.</b> The present {{study was conducted to}} determine the mechanism of action for Sebox in this capacity, as shown by changes in the expression levels of other known MEG mRNAs after Sebox RNA interference (RNAi) in oocytes. Sebox-knockdown metaphase II (Mll) oocytes displayed normal morphology, but among the 23 MEGs monitored, 8 genes were upregulated, and 15 genes were unchanged. We hypothesized that the perturbed gene expression of these MEGs may cause the arrest of embryo development at the 2 <b>C</b> <b>stage</b> and examined the expression of several marker genes for the degradation of maternal factors and zygotic genome activation. We found that some maternal mRNAs, c-mos, Gbx 2, and Gdf 9, were not fully degraded in Sebox-knockdown 2 C embryos, and that several zygotic genome activation markers, Mt 1 a, Rpl 23, Ube 2 a and Wee 1, were not fully expressed in conjunction with diminished embryonic transcriptional activity. In addition, Sebox may be involved {{in the formation of the}} subcortical maternal complex through its regulation of the upstream regulator, Figla.

The influence of DM on patient survival in different HCC stages is not known. A prospective dataset of 3, 182 HCC patients was collected between 2002 and 2014. Patients were divided into three groups according to BCLC stages (BCLC stage 0 and stage A, BCLC stage B, BCLC <b>stage</b> <b>C</b> and <b>stage</b> D). We compared the cumulative survival rate of diabetic and non-diabetic patients in different BCLC groups. The correlation between DM and overall survival was also analyzed by multivariate Cox regression model within each group. DM is present in 25. 2 % of all patients. Diabetic patients had lower cumulative survival in BCLC stage 0 plus BCLC stage A group (log rank p< 0. 001), and BCLC stage B group (log rank p = 0. 012), but not in BCLC <b>stage</b> <b>C</b> plus BCLC <b>stage</b> D group (log rank p = 0. 132).
