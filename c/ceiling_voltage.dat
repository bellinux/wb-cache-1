40|$|The Norwegian Network Code FIKS {{from the}} Norwegian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Statnett, states that {{synchronous}} generators ≥ 25 MVA {{must have a}} static excitation system. It also includes requirements on the step time response and the available field winding <b>ceiling</b> <b>voltage</b> of the excitation system. An improved brushless excitation system is in operation in some pilot power plants. A rotating thyristor bridge is controlled via Bluetooth. The step time response is as fast as conventional static excitation systems. However, a <b>ceiling</b> <b>voltage</b> factor of 2 requires the thyristor bridge to operate at firing angles about 60 degrees. High torque pulsations, low power factor and low utilization of the exciter is the end result. New power electronic interfaces on the shaft results in a betterutilization of the designed exciter and improves the mechanical performance {{as well as the}} controllability of the generator field winding. Permanent magnet rotating exciters increase the field forcing strength of the synchronous generator, yielding improved transient stability (Fault Ride-Through req.). Brushless exciters also reduces regular maintenance of the generator. The thesis includes experiments on a state of the art synchronous generator test setup including constructed PM exciter and different power electronic solutions. Some investigations has been done on industrial power plants as well...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of an investigation}} into the possible suppression of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) instability of the 1072 MVA nuclear powered turbo-generators to be installed at Koeberg Power Station in South Africa. The auxiliary excitation control strategy considered feeds a signal derived from generator speed through a phase advance compensator into the rotary excitation system. It is found that the classical automatic voltage regulator and governor loops are of little use in suppressing subsynchronous resonance, and that the auxiliary excitation control signal is only of limited use. The two main limiting factors are the slow speed of response of the existing conventional exciter and its inadequate <b>ceiling</b> <b>voltage</b> levels...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: This study {{presented}} an alternative procedure for the starting of large Inductions Motors (IM) in isolated generation systems. Approach: In isolated generation systems on stand-by or base load, the starting of the IM provoked sags frequently beyond {{the ability of}} the other consumers in the plant to stand. Manufacturers' solutions always recommend a supersized generator to decrease transient reactance and achieve smaller sags. These calculation procedures were based on the theory presented by Beeman (1955). Instead of supersizing the generator, a good but expensive solution, the present authors had undertaken research into how to improve the Synchronous Generators (SG's) capacity to stand the start of IM without exceeding the field and armature temperature limits and with small sags. Results: The method utilized consisted of decreasing the response time of excitation, thus increasing <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Voltage</b> (CV). The advantage of this method besides leading to a reduction in the investment involved permits retrofitting in electrical plants already installed. Tests on updated industrial equipment whose CV of a 250 kVA SG was increased from 2. 7 - 5. 4 were presented with their respective oscilographic records which show a reduction in sag from 40 - 34 %. With this solution was possible to start a 75 HP IM without supersize the SG. Conclusion: Computational simulations in MATLAB are also given and were compared with experimental results to validate the simulations. Models in the frequency and time domains are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the high}} <b>voltage</b> <b>ceiling</b> imposed by {{electrical}} discharge, in order to accelerate particles to higher energies, techniques involving dynamic fields rather than static fields are used. Electrodynamic acceleration can arise from either of two mechanisms: non-resonant magnetic induction, or resonant circuits or cavities excited by oscillating RF fields. [...] Electrodynamic accelerators can be linear, with particles accelerating in a straight line, or circular, using magnetic fields to bend particles in a roughly circular orbit.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} voltage amplifier, {{including}} power stages of most audio power amplifiers, DC bias voltage is negative relative to cathode potential. Instant grid voltage (sum of DC bias and AC input signal) should never rise above cathode potential to prevent grid-to-cathode currents that overload preceding amplifier stages and may cause severe even-order distortion. High transconductance tubes develop significant grid currents even with small negative bias; in these cases, maximum instant <b>voltage</b> <b>ceiling</b> is lowered to -1.0..-0.5 Volt.|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{electrical}} equipment (generally regarded as being over 50 volts) is {{not permitted to}} be exposed in the plenum space above a drop <b>ceiling.</b> High <b>voltage</b> wiring must be enclosed in conduit or raceways, and must be physically isolated from low-voltage wiring. High voltage electrical devices similarly must be enclosed in a plenum space, inside a metallic container. Similarly, electrical outlets for domestic powered devices are not permitted inside the plenum space, though outlets can be installed on ceiling tiles inside electrical boxes, with the sockets exposed on the exterior bottom face of the drop ceiling. The purpose of these restrictions is to limit flame spread inside the unseen plenum space, {{in the event of}} high voltage equipment or wiring failure. Low voltage cabling is permitted because current flow is typically negligible so the risk of overheating and fire is limited.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new z-axis high-sensitivity silicon-micromachined capacitive accelerometer fabricated us-ing a three-mask dissolved-wafer process (DWP). It employs capacitive sensing using overlap-area variations between comb electrodes and a torsional suspension system to provide high sensitivity without compromising bandwidth, full-scale range, or the pull-in <b>voltage</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Excellent electrical sensitivity is obtained by using high-aspect-ratio comb fingers with narrow air gaps of 2 m {{and a large}} overlap area of 12 m 300 m. Torsional suspension beams 150 m long with a cross-sectional area of 12 m 3 m are used to improve the mechani-cal gain. Simulations of the capacitance between sense fingers show a highly linear region over a wide 14 -m tip deflection range. Accelerometers were fabricated and yielded sensitivities of 263 – 300 mV/g, a nonlinearity less than 0. 2 % over a range of 4 to + 3 g, a full-scale range of 4 to + 6 g, and pull-in voltages greater than 8 V. A 3 -dB cutoff frequency of 35 Hz was measured in air. The calculated thermomechanical noise in the sensor is 0. 28 mg over this bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{generalized}} Kurokawa {{noise analysis}} applicable to both low- and high- oscillators is proposed for phase modulation (PM) and amplitude modulation (AM) noise. A theoretical {{correspondence between the}} new generalized Kurokawa theory and the impulse sensitivity function and the per-turbation projection vector (PPV) is also derived in the absence and presence of AM to PM noise conversion. The importance of AM to PM noise conversion effect is investigated next using a modified Van der Pol oscillator with fourth-order nonlinear capac-itances and a harmonic short. The same analytic solution for the phase noise is derived for both the new generalized Kurokawa and the PPV analysis and is found to match {{the results from the}} conversion matrix method in two commercial harmonic-balance circuit simulators. The proposed generalized Kurokawa theory is then applied to a bipolar junction transmitter Colpitts oscillator and a CMOS ring oscillator and is verified to yield comparable results to those ob-tained from the matrix conversion method. Finally, the general-ized Kurokawa noise is also found to be able to predict well the experimentally measured <b>ceiling</b> of the <b>voltage</b> noise spectral den-sity at low offset frequencies for a transmission-line pseudomor-phic HEMT oscillator.
