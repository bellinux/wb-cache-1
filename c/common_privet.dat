50|$|Following {{the opening}} of the railway a public house and hotel was built across the Alton-Gosport road from the station. This was {{initially}} named 'The Privett Bush' (a pun on the <b>common</b> plant named <b>Privet).</b> The hotel is still in business, now named 'The Angel'.|$|R
50|$|In the British Isles it is {{the only}} native <b>privet,</b> <b>common</b> in hedgerows and {{woodlands}} in southern England and Wales, especially in chalk areas; it is less common in northern England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, where it only occurs as an escape from cultivation.|$|R
50|$|Forestiera segregata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the olive family known by the <b>common</b> names Florida <b>privet,</b> Florida swampprivet, and southern privet. It is native to the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands, the Lesser Antilles, including Anguilla, and Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Ligustrum vulgare (wild privet, also {{sometimes}} known as <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> or European privet) is {{a species of}} Ligustrum native to central and southern Europe, north Africa and southwestern Asia, from Ireland and southwestern Sweden south to Morocco, and east to Poland and northwestern Iran.|$|E
50|$|A main {{threat to}} the species is the loss and {{disturbance}} of its cedar glade habitat. About 50% of the region's cedar glades have been lost since European settlement, and remaining glades are fragmented and altered by grazing, cultivation, and residential development. Many are affected by activity related to roadways, such as herbicides, road construction, grading, trash dumping, and off-road vehicles. Modified glades no longer maintain themselves through the natural processes of drought, wildfire, and erosion, and the openings shrink as woody vegetation closes in. The sunny open spots required by the plant are reduced. The process is hastened by invasive species of plants, especially <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> (Ligustrum vulgare) and bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii).|$|E
50|$|The site is of {{considerable}} interest to ecologists in that {{several species of}} exotic woody shrubs have naturalized {{in the area to}} the exclusion of the native woody flora. The exotic shrubs that have become rampant are common buckthorn and <b>common</b> <b>privet.</b> Preferential deer herbivory of native species seems to be the primary cause of this invasion, and a deer exclusion has been attempted. The arboretum also has heavy and repeated infestation with Japanese beetle and this may also {{play a role in the}} dynamics of the shrub community which has developed in the garden over the last seventy years. The arboretum is currently directed by Dr. Ranessa Cooper and hosts art programs and children's programs during the summer.|$|E
50|$|The main {{tree species}} in the Espy Bog include pin oak, silver maple, American elm, white pine, ash, and red maple. The shrub layer in the wetland complex {{consists}} of various species that are common in wetlands. These include poison sumac, buttonbush, smooth alder, silky dogwood, spicebush, willow, winterberry holly, and meadow-sweet. However, some introduced species have also been observed in the wetlands. These include buckthorn, <b>common</b> <b>privet,</b> Morrow's honeysuckle, and multiflora rose. The herbaceous layer contains several types of wetland fern as well as monkey flower, northern blue flag, marsh purslane, marsh St.-John's-wort, bulbiferous water hemlock, two tearthumb species, swamp milkweed, and skunk cabbage. Various sedges and grasses occur in meadow-like openings in the wetland complex, as does soft rush.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} two-year {{investigations}} conducted in productive nurseries on one-, two-, three- and four-year-old seedlings of <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> {{the occurrence of}} powdery mildew, anthracnose and leaf spot disease were stated. Leaf spot diseases and necroses on <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> leaves were caused by a complex of filamentous fungi with a prevalence of Alternaria alternata, Epicoccum purpurascens, Phomopsis cf. ligustri-vulgaris, Botrytis cinerea and Cercospora ligustri. Fungi, monophagous to <b>common</b> <b>privet,</b> such as: Ph. cf. ligustri-vulgaris, C. ligustri, Septoria cf. brunellae and Thedgonia ligustri were recorded among the casual agents of leaf spot disease. One-year-old seedlings of <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> were the most susceptible to infection with A. alternata and E. purpurascens necrotrophs. The highest intensity of leaf spot diseases on <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> leaves observed {{at the end of}} vegetation period, whereas premature defoliation took place from June to October. Despite the occurrences of numerous leaf spot diseases on <b>common</b> <b>privet</b> leaves (in both years from May to October) neither seedlings â€™ defoliation nor their growth inhibition were observed and therefore any considerable decrease in their decorative values or their disqualification as commercial material were stated...|$|E
