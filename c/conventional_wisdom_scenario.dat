The Targets IMage Energy (TIME) model of which a concise description is given, is used to explore the consequences of divergent assumptions about some uncertain and controversial issues. The IPCC-IS 92 a <b>Conventional</b> <b>Wisdom</b> <b>scenario</b> is used as a reference and, in combination with two other scenarios, discussed in the context of other recently published global energy scenarios. � 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper {{is to focus on}} a set of "not-impossible" but still plausible land use patterns in Europe until the middle of the next century. Changes in technologies and environmental transformations are vital determinants for future land use patterns that are taken into account. The paper therefore makes an assessment of the following: (1) A <b>Conventional</b> <b>Wisdom</b> <b>scenario</b> for agriculture covering the period 1980 - 2030. This scenario is based on the consideration that present trends of increasing yields in European agriculture are extrapolated. (2) A scenario for changing land use patterns for the period 1980 - 2030, considering various trends in the application of new technologies (i. e., a scenario that is based on a rapid increase in land productivity, and a scenario to improve the marginal land, and which is based on the adaptation to poor local environmental conditions). (3) A scenario for changing land use patterns that is based on a change in climate. Two scenarios of climate change are included here: (i) for the year 2030 that is based on an analysis of historical analogues, and (ii) for the year 2050 that is based on a general circulation model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} scenarios computed with IMAGE 2. 0, {{an integrated}} {{model of the}} global environment and climate change. Results are presented for selected aspects of the society-biosphere-climate system including primary energy consumption, emissions of various greenhouse gases, atmospheric concentrations of gases, temperature, precipitation, land cover and other indicators. Included are a "Conventional Wisdom" scenario, and three variations of this scenario: (i) the <b>Conventional</b> <b>Wisdom</b> <b>scenario</b> is a reference case which is partly based on the input assumptions of the IPCC's IS 92 a scenario; (ii) the "Biofuel Crops" scenario assumes that most biofuels will be derived from new cropland; (iii) the "No Biofuels" scenario examines {{the sensitivity of the}} system to the use of biofuels; and (iv) the "Ocean Realignment" scenario investigates the effect of a large-scale change in ocean circulation on the biosphere and climate. Results of the biofuel scenarios illustrate the importance of examining the impact of biofuels on the full range of greenhouse gases, rather than only CO 2. These scenarios also indicate possible side effects of the land requirements for energy crops. The Ocean Realignment scenario shows that an unexpected, low probability event can both enhance the build-up of greenhouse gases, {{and at the same time}} cause a temporary cooling of surface air temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. However, warming of the atmosphere is only delayed, not avoided. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the value of {{scenario}} planning to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), and further examine the challenges constraining the uptake of scenario planning by SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual review of the literature on scenario planning in SMEs intended to unpack and capture the possible underlying reasons accounting for the limited uptake of scenario planning by managers/owners of SMEs has informed the formulation of this paper. Findings: The study uncovered that SMEs’ managerial mental models, SMEs’ managerial time orientation, severe resource constraints, and industry complexity are some of the salient factors inhibiting the use of scenario planning among managers/owners of SMEs. The author develops a framework of propositions that account for the complexity and challenges of scenario planning by SMEs for future empirical examination and validation. Originality/value: The <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> is that <b>scenario</b> planning is carried out by large and established firms, and that SMEs are unable to adopt and practice the technique. This paper uncovers that SME have substantial needs for scenario planning, but are only able to engage in simple foresight activities such as brainstorming, desk research, networking and expert interviews to monitor their external environment. They are unable to effectively use scenario planning in its purest form as in large firms. By bringing together the reasons accounting for the difficulty of SMEs to practice scenario planning in its purest form as large firms do, the study therefore extends the limited discourse on scenario planning among SMEs. Implications are discussed and areas for future empirical studies provided...|$|R

Our result also holds true if there exist investment adjustment costs.
