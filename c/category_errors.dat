It would appear so, as she says (p. 146), “Having argued that category mistakes are infelicitous because they suffer from presupposition failure, a natural question one might raise at this point is what separates category mistakes from other instances of presupposition failure?” If one really believed that <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> were presupposition failures, the answer to this question would be “nothing”; one would not posit any significant differences between e.g. presuppositions triggered by a definite description and those triggered by a factive verb (other than obvious superficial differences).|$|E
40|$|Aberrant {{semantic}} processing {{has been}} linked to the etiology of formal thought disorder (TD) symptoms in schizophrenia. In this cross-sectional study, two prominent theories, overactivation and disorganized structure of semantic memory (SM), were examined in relation to TD symptoms using the continuum approach across two established semantic tasks (direct/indirect semantic priming and categorical fluency). The aim was to examine the validity of the two TD theories in relation to TD symptoms in schizophrenia. Greater direct and indirect priming, fluency productivity and <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> were expected if the data supported the overactivation theory. Reduced fluency productivity and increased <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> would be characteristic of disorganized storage. Fifty-seven schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients and 48 controls completed a clinical assessment and the semantic tasks. There was significantly reduced direct priming in patients compared to controls (p<. 05), while indirect priming was not significantly different; there was no association between TD and degree of priming. Patients produced more category-inappropriate words (p<. 005) than controls, which was related to increasing severity of circumstantiality. The pattern of results was more indicative of a disorganized SM storage problem in this sample. This phenomenon may underlie some TD symptoms in general schizophrenia. The findings strengthen the relationship between SM deficits and TD symptoms, though this appears to differ between individual symptoms. The authors discuss the value of the continuum approach in addressing research questions in TD etiology. Given low levels of TD in this study, replication of these findings in a sample with greater TD is desirable. (JINS, 2015, 21, 1 - 10) ...|$|E

The panel contains 10 antimicrobial agents in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 3 % lysed horse blood, similar in concept to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference broth microdilution method for testing streptococci. A group of 210 isolates of S. pneumoniae {{were selected to}} include isolates with previously documented resistance to agents incorporated in the MICroSTREP panel, as well as recent invasive clinical isolates. All isolates were tested simultaneously with the MICroSTREP panel and an NCCLS reference panel whose drug concentrations were prepared to coincide {{with those of the}} MICroSTREP panel. Of the 210 isolates, 5 failed to grow in the MICroSTREP panel; 3 of those also did not grow in the reference panel. Essential agreement of MICs determined by the two methods (test MIC ± one dilution of the reference MIC) was 99. 6 % overall and ranged from 98. 0 % with chloramphenicol to 100 % with penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin. There were no very major or major interpretive <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> resulting from the MICroSTREP panel tests. Minor interpretive <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> ranged from 12. 2 % with cefotaxime and 9. 8 % with ceftriaxone (due mainly to clustering of MICs for the selected strains near the breakpoints) to 0 % with chloramphenicol and vancomycin.

40|$|Aberrant {{semantic}} processing {{has been}} linked to the aetiology of formal thought disorder (TD) symptoms in schizophrenia. Two prominent theories, overactivation and disorganized structure of semantic memory, were examined in relation to TD using both implicit (priming) and explicit (fluency) semantic tasks. This study aimed to examine if both theories operated independently or in tandem; and if this differed at the implicit and explicit levels. Greater direct and indirect priming, fluency productivity and <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> were expected for the overactivation theory. Reduced direct priming, fluency productivity and increased <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> would be characteristic of disorganized storage. 57 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients and 48 controls completed a clinical assessment and the semantic tasks. Results showed significantly reduced direct priming in patients compared to controls (p<. 05), while the greater indirect priming was not significant. There was no association between TD and degree of priming. Patients were less likely to recognize a non-word in a task with more related pairs (p<. 05), degrading with severity of positive TD (r=. 30, p<. 001). Although patients produced more category inappropriate words (p<. 005), TD overall did not influence fluency error rates, although negative TD was associated with reduced category and letter productivity (p<. 001). Misattribution, but not semantic overactivation, at the implicit level appears related to TD. At the explicit level, negative TD appears more associated with slower processing than inaccuracy. Overall, the findings support semantic disorganization as a more trait-type impairment contributing to TD symptoms, with overactivation perhaps more characteristic of the acute TD state. Executive dysfunction may combine with semantic dysfunction in the presentation of TD symptomatology...|$|E

40|$|The IEEE 754 {{standard}} for oating-point arithmetic {{is widely used}} in computing. It is based on real arithmetic and is made total by adding both a positive and a negative infinity, a negative zero, and many Not-a-Number (NaN) states. The IEEE infinities {{are said to have}} the behaviour of limits. Transreal arithmetic is total. It also has a positive and a negative infinity but no negative zero, and it has a single, unordered number, nullity. We elucidate the transreal tangent and extend real limits to transreal limits. Arguing from this firm foundation, we maintain that there are three <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> in the IEEE 754 standard. Firstly the claim that IEEE infinities are limits of real arithmetic confuses limiting processes with arithmetic. Secondly a defence of IEEE negative zero confuses the limit of a function with the value of a function. Thirdly the definition of IEEE NaNs confuses undefined with unordered. Furthermore we prove that the tangent function, with the infinities given by geometrical con- struction, has a period of an entire rotation, not half a rotation as is commonly understood. This illustrates a category error, confusing the limit with the value of a function, in an important area of applied mathe- matics trigonometry. We brie y consider the wider implications of this category error. Another paper proposes transreal arithmetic as a basis for floating- point arithmetic; here we take the profound step of proposing transreal arithmetic as a replacement for real arithmetic to remove the possibility of certain <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> in mathematics. Thus we propose both theo- retical and practical advantages of transmathematics. In particular we argue that implementing transreal analysis in trans- floating-point arith- metic would extend the coverage, accuracy and reliability of almost all computer programs that exploit real analysis essentially all programs in science and engineering and many in finance, medicine and other socially beneficial applications...|$|E

Existing solutions that detects specific kinds of flaws are substantially different from each other, so aggregate use of them may be incompatible and require substantial changes in the current system and computing practice. Intrusion detection systems {{may not be the}} answer either, because they are inherently inaccurate and susceptible to false positives/negatives. This dissertation presents a taxonomy of security flaws that classifies program vulnerabilities into finite number of <b>error</b> <b>categories,</b> and presents a security mechanism that can produce accurate solutions for many of these <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> in a modular fashion. To be accurate, a solution should closely match the characteristic of the target <b>error</b> <b>category.</b> To ensure this, we focus only on <b>error</b> <b>categories</b> whose characteristics can be defined in terms of a violation of process integrity.

To prove that this approach can cover many <b>error</b> <b>categories,</b> we develop a classification of program security flaws and find error characteristics (in terms of a process integrity) from many of these categories.

Discretization error is introduced by replacing the continuous radiative transfer equation with a finite-dimensional linear system, usually by means of boundaryelements and a corresponding projection method. Finally, computational errors perturb the finite-dimensional linear system through imprecise form factors, inner products, visibility, etc., as well as by halting iterative solvers after a finite number of steps. Using the error taxonomy introduced in the paper we examine existing global illumination algorithms and suggest new avenues of research. [...] ...|$|E

Although this conceptually remarkably clear field has contributed to systems chemistry a lot [25], some chemists, mostly but not exclusively on the experimental side {{have proven to be}} surprisingly refractory to conceptual clarity. Experimental results are not in the void and, contrary to naïve presuppositions, they do not “speak for themselves”: they are interpreted within a hypothetico-deductive framework. Attention should thus be given to conceptual issues, since <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> trigger one to look for supporting theory in the wrong file. Collectively autocatalytic systems without (at least) second-order catalysis have not much to do with hypercycles or cooperation sensu evolutionary biology beyond a vague resemblance on the grounds of a network and autocatalysis being involved.

30|$|The hypercycle is {{a system}} of replicators, whose members are auto- and cross-catalytic: {{replication}} of each member is catalyzed {{by at least one}} other member of the system. Therefore, the kinetics of growth of every member is at least second order. In ecology such systems are called mutualistic whose members are cooperating with each other. The dynamics of such systems are described broadly by the replicator equation. In chemistry hypercycles are often confused with collectively autocatalytic systems in which the members catalyze each other’s formation rather than replication (growth being therefore first-order). Examples of this confusion abound in the literature. The trouble is that such <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> mistakenly imply that the available theories of hypercycles and cooperation are applicable, although in fact they are not. Cooperation in population biology means a higher-order interaction among agents with (at least the capacity of) multiplication. From the point of evolution, what matters is the genetic effects on the cooperative act. As systems chemistry has one of its roots in the theoretical biology, insights from this field ought to be respected even by experimentalists, let alone theoreticians.|$|E
40|$|We thank Dr. Baverstock [1] for his {{interest}} in reading our article and his time in writing his comments for our work [2]. We, however, respectfully disagree with his statement that we made “two <b>category</b> <b>errors</b> ” associated with {{the assessment of the}} occurrence of “genomic instability ” by determining the frequencies of delayed- or late-occurring chromosomal damage. Our disagreement is based upon the well-known fact that radiation-induced genomic instability (or delayed/late-occurring damage) can be manifested in many ways. These include late-occurring chromosomal damage, or mutations, or gene expression, or gene amplifications, or transformation, or microsatellite instability, or cell killing [3 – 9]. Such phenomena have been detected many cell generations after irradiation. We agree that genomic instability may well be the consequence of epigenetic changes. Another mechanism mentioned by Dr. Bavertock as being probably unlikely is the reversibility of damage. This potential may not be discarded off-hand, as Dr. Baverstock prefers to do. There is much reproducible evidence of adaptive protection that depending on absorbed dose precisely may reverse early damage, an...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} privacy has divided lawyers, {{scholars}} and policymakers for decades, {{not only in}} terms of whether it is a good or bad thing, but even what it is. Some say it is a human right, some that it is a prerequisite for democracy; others note that individuals are prone to breaching their own privacy and are remarkably relaxed about it, and have described various privacy paradoxes or other common inconsistencies in attitude; some argue that it is unenforceable; still others argue that it is a blocker to the knowledge economy and the socially-beneficial use of big data; and many more say that whatever its merits it is dead. In this talk, Kieron O'Hara will argue that the reason for this apparently confused disarray is that different privacy discourses are going on simultaneously, talking past each other and cheerfully committing various <b>category</b> <b>errors.</b> He sets out a series of seven types of privacy discussion, which are distinct but relatable to each other, as ! a first step towards clearing up some of the confusion, and argues that privacy itself is strongly implicated at the boundaries between the self and world.

These included 42 penicillin-resistant (MIC, > or = 2 micrograms/ml) and 14 cefotaxime-resistant (defined here as an MIC of > or = 2 micrograms/ml) isolates. E test strips were applied to the surface of Mueller-Hinton sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 35 degrees C in 5 % CO 2 for 20 to 24 h.

40|$|I {{would like}} to take issue with Rithidech et al., authors of the paper {{entitled}} “Lack of genomic instability in mice at low doses ” [1] who claim to have shown that their results on the measurement of late occurring chromosome aberrations after irradiation of SCID mice with X-rays show that lower doses (0. 05 Gy) do not induce genomic instability. Their earlier work at higher doses (0. 1 and 1. 0 Gy) on the same strain of mouse indicated that de novo chromosome aberrations were detected at 6 months post-irradiation. This was taken, almost certainly correctly, to be an indication of the presence of genomic instability: late appearing chromosome damage, as the authors note, seems to be a reliable indicator of the process.
