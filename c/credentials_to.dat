5|$|Other {{actions taken}} at the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of <b>credentials</b> <b>to</b> female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. By the fall of 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E

We propose a mechanism whereby the client formulates a single trust primitive by associating a subset of required attributes in a standard <b>credential</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a trust relationship. Client privacy is preserved because only those required attributes are revealed. After negotiation, a trust group element with dynamic validation is used to represent this trust relationship. 1...|$|R
