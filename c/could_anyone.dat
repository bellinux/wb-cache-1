500|$|The {{exact nature}} of LeHand's {{relationship}} with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was romantically involved with William C. Bullitt Jr., U.S. ambassador to Russia and later France, from 1933 to 1940, but apparently never contemplated marriage to him. Her devotion to the Roosevelt family and dedication to her career were the most likely impediments to marriage, though she once asked a friend, [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> ever come up to FDR?" ...|$|E
500|$|Geldray {{was born}} Max Leon van Gelder, on 12 February 1916 in Amsterdam, Netherlands to Jewish parents. His father, Leon van Gelder, was a {{commercial}} traveller, {{and his mother}} was Margarite, née Baillosterky. By 1922 Leon was the European Manager for Maja perfume and the family moved out of Amsterdam to Bilthoven. Both parents could play the piano—Leon was self-taught and played by ear, while Margarite was classically trained—and it was Leon who started to teach Geldray how to play. He developed love of jazz music after hearing Louis Armstrong on the radio in 1928; Geldray later wrote [...] "how <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> not love its energy, its vitality and the freedom of its form? And Louis Armstrong among all the players, became something [...] special to me".|$|E

[...] He added that it communicated the [...] "energy of British popular culture {{over the past few decades}} and the gaiety of our Olympic ceremonies." [...] Billington praised Boyle, Devlin and Daldry, who had done a [...] "tremendous job in lending what might have been orthodox Olympic rituals a blast of theatrical vitality." [...] While Alexis Petridis writing for the same paper said that the lack of a [...] "gasp inducing moment" [...] spoilt the show. Jan Moir of the Daily Mail queried whether the ceremony truly reflected Britain's musical heritage and described the opening section as [...] "dull, dull, dull". [...] She asked [...] "how <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> follow the Opening Ceremony for entertainment?", challenged [...] "the logic" [...] of clips of artists such as Bush and Bowie who had [...] "declined to appear", and said that the fashion section was [...] "dreary".|$|E

In the same newspaper, on the following day, Keith Watson commented that the episode [...] "was like watching Carry On Up the Asteroids", but nevertheless stated that [...] "as dramatic cocktails go, [...] was out of this world", and gave the episode four stars out of five. The Times commented that the episode was [...] "good, salacious, knockabout fun", the best thing about Torchwood that [...] "everyday Cardiff hums alongside psychotic blowfish and time loops", and asked [...] "when extraterrestrial push comes to intergalactic shove, how <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> object to a series that begins with a blowfish driving a sports car?". The Guardian stated that parts were [...] "very, very, funny" [...] and the episode was largely [...] "a hoot". However, The Daily Telegraph felt that the series fared better on BBC Three, but on BBC Two it was [...] "both far too pleased with itself and surprisingly amateurish".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and contributed to}} the film's success.

Film critic Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express, opined that [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] had set [...] "the precedent for several generations of jilted lovers". On [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana", singer Charulatha Mani wrote, [...] "The subtle pathos that P. Susheela imparts when she sings 'sol sol..en uyire' is notable." [...] P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language to sing a song perfectly, we need not know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Sonnathu neethanaa... Nenjil Oru Aalayam [...] )". Rajadhyaksha and Willemen called [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] "a classic number about unrequited love." [...] Following Viswanathan's death in July 2015, the news agency, Press Trust of India wrote that [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] was [...] "memorable for the deep sense of solace it offered to wounded hearts." [...] Anand Venkateswaran of The Wire noted, [...] "MSV’s style is less about making words sit in a meter than about a musical empathy with the meaning. <b>Could</b> <b>anyone</b> else have set to tune the first line of ‘Sonnadhu nee daana‘, of Nenjil Or Alayam (Muthuraman, 1962)?"

[...] Terry Staunton of Record Collector was even more negative, defining the album as a set [...] "of 60s soul covers of baffling irrelevance" [...] and wondering, [...] "what possible use <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> have for weedy-voiced faded Xeroxes of songs readily available in their wondrously uplifting original form?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The deaths drew intense {{public and}} media scrutiny. On July 14, Medicis had its sharpest one-day decline in stock price since February. News {{of the death}} and {{investigation}} received international coverage in various countries including Brazil, New Zealand, Finland, Spain, and the United Kingdom throughout July and August. In early September, various Forbes writers, including true crime writer Cathy Scott and lawyer Victoria Pynchon, expressed doubts about the investigators' conclusions; Pynchon described the ruling as an [...] "embarrassing public blunder." [...] The Daily Beast published a column by trial lawyer Roy Black, in which he criticized [...] "half-baked theories" [...] about Zahau's death, in particular stating the lack of DNA evidence: [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> do all this without leaving behind a scintilla of microscopic evidence? They {{would have to have}} been wearing a full rubber suit or some type of space suit and levitated over the scene." [...] He called on the media and public to [...] "stop calling it murder." [...] On September 19, it was reported that local Coronado author Kathleen McKenna would be writing a book on the case; McKenna expressed doubts that Zahau's death was a suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Pollock was {{included}} to tour England with the South African team in 1965. In the Second Test at Trent Bridge, Pollock made 125, an innings he described {{in his autobiography}} as his best. He made his runs out of 160 added in 140 minutes, the last 91 of his runs coming in 70 minutes. He had come in at 16/2, and the score had declined to 80/5, before his partnerships with the captain Peter van der Merwe and with Richard Dumbrill enabled the score to reach 269. John Woodcock wrote in The Cricketer, [...] "Not since Bradman's day <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> recall having seen an English attack treated in such cavalier style." [...] while the same correspondent in The Times said, [...] "I {{can think of no}} innings played against England since the [...] war which was so critical and commanding: I can think of none more beautifully played." [...] E.W. Swanton wrote in The Daily Telegraph that it was an innings [...] "which in point of style and power, of ease and beauty of execution is fit to rank with anything in the annals of the game." [...] In the second innings, Pollock scored 59. It was a notable match for the Pollock brothers; older brother Peter took 10 wickets in total as South Africa won the match and, therefore, the three Test series 1–0. His performances during that English season saw him named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1966, acclaimed as [...] "one of the most accomplished batsmen in contemporary cricket".|$|E

2500|$|In 1892, when Charles F. Lummis {{was visiting}} Acoma {{he listened to}} the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa. [...] Their access to the top was on the {{southern}} side where a large piece of the butte was said to have spalled off and formed a ramp, a [...] "stone ladder", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone {{on either side of the}} fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end[...] The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley. [...] In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops. [...] One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the [...] "stone ladder", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird swooped down and scooped up the four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1718, Hitchen {{published}} his pamphlet [...] "A True Discovery of the Conduct of Receivers and Thief-takers, in {{and about the}} City of London: To the Multiplication and Encouragement of Thieves, Housebreakers, and other loose and disorderly Persons" [...] dedicating it to the Lord Mayor Sir William Lewen, the Aldermen and Common Council of London. The tract shows Hitchen disguised as a social reformer and moralist giving his recommendations for rooting out the iniquities by imprisoning all the thief-takers and receivers. Hitchen did not directly name Wild in his first pamphlet but made an obvious allusion when talking about [...] "the regulator" [...] and [...] "the thief-taker". The word [...] "regulator" [...] should have had very negative connotation due to king James II's [...] "Committees of Regulators" [...] appointed to change {{the result of the}} elections for the king's favour. By the time the pamphlet was written the word might have had the meaning of [...] "a boss" [...] indulged in bribery and corruption. The under-marshal chose the word for his second pamphlet written as a counterattack to Wild's [...] "Answer" [...] and named it [...] "The Regulator: or a Discovery of the Thieves, Thief-takers, and Locks, alias Receivers of Stolen Goods in and about the City of London." [...] This treatise did not appear as effective as promised in presenting the ways to prevent crime. It was written worse than Wild's and due to the author's illiteracy could not be seriously taken by its audience. Neither <b>could</b> <b>anyone</b> be deceived by the statement on the title page, that it was written [...] "By a Prisoner in Newgate". Probably called an [...] "unthinking scribbler...expos'd to the world in his own treatise" [...] by Wild, only whom [...] "such a bundle of nonsense" [...] could be composed, reflects on the society's view.|$|E
