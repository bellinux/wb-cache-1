5|$|Inside: This final segment {{opens with}} shots of Donovan showering, toweling off and {{wandering}} idly around his room, intercut with shots of African-American telephone repairman Tommy Moore checking various poles and lines outside, Donovan spots Moore from his balcony. Moore sees Donovan as well. The {{remainder of the}} segment consists of Donovan's fantasized sexual encounters with Moore throughout the house intercut with shots of Donovan sniffing poppers and penetrating himself with a large black dildo. The segment ends following Donovan's climax with the dildo, with the real Moore <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> the house and {{closing the door behind}} them.|$|E
25|$|The team {{then decided}} against sending Cavendish {{to the fall}} monument, the Giro di Lombardia. Its profile, even hillier than the Giro del Piemonte, meant it was {{unlikely}} that Cavendish would finish that race either. Sporting director Valerio Piva explained that having Cavendish start that race only to pull out after riding for an hour would be disrespectful to Cavendish, the rainbow jersey, and the race itself. The squad therefore sent only six riders to the race instead of the customary nine, and Sivtsov in 43rd place was the only classified finisher. The next day, Martin took the team's final victory in their history at the Chrono des Nations single-day time trial. It was perhaps the most dominant victory of Martin's career, with no rider <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> two minutes of his winning time. Coincidentally, Amber Neben of the women's HTC-Highroad team also took victory at this event, closing the team's history with double success.|$|E
25|$|Ants are the {{greatest}} threat of predation for P. exigua. Many of the wasps’ traits, such as polygyny and protective nest structures, are suggested to be survival tactics against ant predation pressures. P. exigua are also observed to swarm and use scent-trail diversions as defense strategies. During Megaselia infestation, workers attempt to destroy all infested cells in order to terminate the parasitoids. However, wasps are often unable to eradicate the phorid pupae due to their strong attachment to the cell bottom. If the workers fail, then the wasps close the nest entrances and the colony flees to another location in the neighborhood {{to build a new}} nest. Once they have established a new nest, wasps will entirely close the old nest’s entrance, which prevents the encroaching parasitoid flies from <b>coming</b> <b>inside.</b> The wasps also fan their wings and use their mandibles to peck attack the phorid flies. Since P. exigua seem to be specialized against the common predation of ants, Megaselia easily defeat the wasps’ defense strategies and frequently invade the species nests.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound in}} the video {{consists}} of a mixture of noises <b>coming</b> from <b>inside</b> {{and outside of the}} room, as well as the hum of the videotape itself. Sounds <b>coming</b> from <b>inside</b> are mostly the sounds of Campus walking and shuffling about. Outside, sounds such as cars driving and honking and dogs barking can be heard.|$|R

500|$|Starting in the {{previous}} day's finishing commune of Brioude, the fourth stage was packed full of climbs, {{with a total of}} seven {{over the course of the}} [...] parcours. The last two climbs– both <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> the final [...] of racing– were both second-category ascents of the Côte de Talencieux and the Côte de la Sizeranne, with gradients of 8.1% and 6.6% respectively. The Côte de la Sizeranne, which was situated [...] from the finish in Saint-Vallier, had most recently featured during the first stage of the 2012 Critérium du Dauphiné; the climb had been a catalyst to a late-stage attack from Cadel Evans, Jérôme Coppel and Andrey Kashechkin, with the trio managing to hold off the advancing peloton by just four seconds. Along with the seven climbs, there were two intermediate sprint points at La Chaise-Dieu and Saint-Romain-d'Ay.|$|E
2500|$|The day's {{stage was}} entirely {{situated}} within the autonomous community of Aragon, {{starting in the}} city of Huesca before heading south towards the outskirts of Alcañiz and the Motorland Aragón circuit, which has hosted several motorsport championship events since being opened in 2009. The finish of the stage itself came on the start-finish straight of the track, having completed almost one lap of the [...] circuit. Despite the parcours of the [...] stage being undulating, there were no categorised climbs during the stage, with the day's two intermediate sprint points both <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> the final [...] of the stage. As a result, the stage was again suited towards the sprinters due to the circuit's wide, sweeping bends.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{extension}} of the stage by , two new climbs were added to the route. The second-category Passo del Tonale was set to test the riders– the 7.5% average climb of , <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> the opening [...] of the stage– while the first-category Hofmahdjoch, 9.5% over , was due to be ascented halfway through the stage. Further adverse conditions overnight dropped even more snow on the scheduled itinerary, and ultimately, race organisers cancelled the stage on safety grounds; the first weather-related cancellation of a stage in the Giro since 1989– when the sixteenth stage was cancelled– and the first cancellation of any form since 2001, when the peloton refused to race in the eighteenth stage, after drug raids. Competing riders and teams supported the decision that the race organisers made in relation to the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Forrest is {{very quick}} {{and also has}} very good ball control and {{dribbling}} skills. This gives him the capability of beating his man and going down the wing, or <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> and beating several players. His then manager, Neil Lennon, has said how over his first few seasons at Celtic {{he has been able}} to extend the distance of his [...] "explosive runs" [...] from 15 or 20 yards up to 30 or 40 yards. Forrest is also a very good finisher and, although predominantly right footed, also capable with his left. Forrest has great fitness levels and is generally able to keep playing at a very high intensity throughout the whole of a match. He has been described as a very enthusiastic player who has an incredible hunger and desire for the game and shows great bravery and vision in his play. Former Rangers winger, and Scotland under-21 teammate, Gregg Wylde described him as being the kind of player who never hides from his responsibility during a match.|$|E
2500|$|The Boiler House was a scare maze first {{introduced}} in 2008, and was situated {{next to the}} Alton Towers Hotel. Originally, the scare maze was set in an abandoned industrial facility and featured live actors in make up. This was changed in 2009, when a new storyline was added. The scare maze later featured the fictional [...] "Hamble Twins" [...] serial killers hiding in the industrial building, and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes. Visitors queued outside, past a van labelled [...] "Alton News 24", from which television screens play news reports on {{the activity of the}} serial killers. Guests then walk through a covered walkway, which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view. Once inside, a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of <b>coming</b> <b>inside.</b> The murderers then appear and kill him, before chasing visitors away. Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque, latex mask. They appear at different points in the maze, creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once. Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used. For the 2011 Scarefest, The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector, where they both shared the old Black Hole tent. After three years it did not return for the 2012 season.|$|E

We shall bring up off Cherbourg and start at daylight; and shall, I hope, be well down towards the bay of Avranches by nightfall. There is no fear of a British cruiser till we get out towards Ushant. They do not care about <b>coming</b> <b>inside</b> the islands; what with the fogs, the rocks, and the currents, it is safer outside than in. Besides, there is little to be picked up except coasters like ourselves, and fishing boats. There is hardly any foreign trade between Havre and Brest. It is from there down to the mouth of the Gironde that their cruisers are so thick. From Ushant to Boulogne there are plenty of them, but these are chiefly occupied in guarding their ships going up and down the Channel from our privateers, which run out from every port: Dieppe and Havre, Granville, Avranches, and Saint Malo." ...|$|E
