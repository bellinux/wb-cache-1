5|$|Nepenthes rajah is {{also known}} to {{occasionally}} trap other small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals, or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher, and <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Other arthropods, such as centipedes, also fall prey to N. rajah.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} known to {{occasionally}} trap vertebrates and even small mammals, with drowned rats having been observed in the pitcher-shaped traps. It {{is one of only}} two Nepenthes species documented as having caught mammalian prey in the wild, the other being N. rafflesiana. N. rajah is also known to occasionally trap small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals and <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the staple prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart works {{within the}} neo-classical {{tradition}} of art, {{and believes that}} greatness and respect for posterity are important considerations. In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to Bill McLaren, a rugby union broadcaster: [...] "I do not do sportsmen and I <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said, [...] warning that memorials are often hastily erected. Advocates of the memorial described the remarks as insensitive, and said that [...] "To have Bill {{looking down on the}} fans at Murrayfield, microphone in hand, would bring a huge smile to so many faces." ...|$|E

500|$|Kantrowitz deemed Tillman [...] "the Senate's wild man", {{who applied}} the same {{techniques}} of accusation and insinuation that had {{served him well}} in South Carolina. In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to attack {{any member of the}} committee who does not deserve to be attacked [...] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel... in easy reach of the sugar trust". Simkins, though, opined that Tillman's speeches in the Senate were only inflammatory because of his injection of personalities, and if that is disregarded, his speeches, when read, come across as well-reasoned and even conservative.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reading of}} 'giants' is {{difficult}} for {{it is hard to}} imagine that Germanic 'giants' could have non-antagonistic relations with any human people. It seems likely that there is perhaps intentional ambiguity here between 'giants' and 'Jutes/Frisians'. [...] Stuhmiller makes the keen observation that after the Finn Episode, no form of eoten or eotan occurs in the poem, ambiguous or otherwise. This is striking because 'giants' <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> disappear from the poem at this point [...] The poet's song of Finn occurs immediately Beowulf has slain Grendel, the eotan who has been tormenting the Danes ...|$|E

2500|$|Lindner's bill {{to remove}} state human rights {{protection}} for gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender {{people did not}} get a committee hearing and was never brought up for a vote in the House. Governor Tim Pawlenty said he was “deeply troubled by Lindner's comments” adding “From my standpoint, his comments and perspective <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> reflect where the Republican Party is or should be.” Pawlenty said he “wouldn't sign Lindner's proposed human rights repeal legislation as written.” This despite “concerns about portions of the current law.” (In his 2002 gubernatorial campaign he called his 1993 vote as [...] a freshman legislator, “to include sexual orientation in the human rights law, which prohibits certain forms of discrimination based on such factors as race, ethnicity, religion and disability status” as “the one vote he regrets.”) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} {{attracted}} widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies {{such as the}} United Nations and Amnesty International. On 24 September 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon stated: [...] "As Muslim leaders {{around the world have}} said, groups like ISIL – or Da’ish – {{have nothing to do with}} Islam, and they <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> represent a state. They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'." [...] ISIL has been classified a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries (see [...] ). Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see [...] ). The group was described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan.|$|E
2500|$|Feurt-incised pottery (beginning around 1100 CE) of the Fort Ancient Tradition appears along today's Ohio and West Virginia state {{bordering}} shores using shell tempering {{with its}} decorated incised oblique lines. It ranges {{from the lower}} Scioto and Guyandotte rivers and upstream to the lower Muskingum and Little Kanawha rivers area, central to the greater area of the 'Mouth of the Great Kanawha River'. James L. Murphy in 1968 reports, [...] "The strap handles recovered from the site (Hobson Feurt site) <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> resemble Madisonville or [...] "Clover Complex" [...] material. Nor does the material strongly resemble Monongahela wares." [...] Gartley, Carskadden, and Morton in 1976 reported, [...] "The presence of lug handles rather than straps and the paucity of decorative motifs other than punctates distinguish Philo Punctate (A.D. 1230-A.D. 1260) from later Feurt ceramics in the Muskingum valley." ...|$|E

2500|$|FACTNet filed a lawsuit, and on September 14, 1995 a Federal {{judge ruled}} the seizure illegal because it {{violated}} FACTNet's {{right to free}} speech on the internet, and ordered the RTC to return all computers and files that were seized. [...] In his ruling in United States District Court, Judge John Kane stated: [...] "The public interest is best served by the free exchange of ideas." [...] Nevertheless, FACTNet states that it has incurred irreparable damage, as the secrecy of its documents had been violated by the RTC. [...] An attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation approved of the Judge's decision in the matter, stating: [...] "They <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the right to seize everything and to fish around. There seems to be this thought that things that are contained on a computer aren't subject to the same protections. I think the law is catching up." [...] Helena K. Kobrin a Church of Scientology attorney with the firm Moxon & Kobrin, defended the seizures of the computers, saying after the judge's decision: [...] "The decision yesterday was a very sad day for intellectual property owners and a very sad day for the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{played a}} major {{diplomatic}} role as Minister to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803, and again from 1825 to 1826. Although he was a leading Federalist, Thomas Jefferson kept him in office until King asked to be relieved. Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Britain and the United States (at least until it became hostile in 1805). With that in mind, {{he was able to}} successfully reach a compromise on the passing of the Jay Treaty being an avid supporter of it. King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in wake of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In a September 13, 1798 letter to the Duke of Portland, King said of potential Irish refugees, [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think they will be a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country." [...] Also, while in Britain, he was in close personal contact with South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and facilitated Miranda's trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to Venezuela.|$|E
