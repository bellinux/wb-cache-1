25|$|During {{the time}} that the incunabula expert, Dr. Victor Scholderer, Deputy-Keeper in the Department of Printed Books at the British Museum, spent in Aberystwyth during the Second World War, he took an {{interest}} in the National Library's small collection of fifteenth-century printed books and produced a Hand-list of incunabula that was published as a supplement to the National Library of Wales Journal. The hand-list and its addenda and <b>corrigenda</b> describes 129 books, mostly printed in Germany, Italy and France, although examples from the Netherlands and England were also listed. Scholderer noted that some of the forty-five books printed in France, particularly those in the vernacular, were very rare.|$|E
25|$|In 1767, in de {{second volume}} of the twelfth edition of the Systema Naturae, the name xuthus was first given as xanthus by Linnaeus (page 751, n° 34). He had used the name a second time in the same work (page 767, n° 122). In the unpaged <b>corrigenda,</b> {{inserted}} {{at the end of}} the same volume, Linnaeus corrected the first name to xuthus. In a ruling, given in an Opinion, the commission has to cover al questions involved, and every name dealt with should be placed either on the Official List or on the Index. Therefore also the name xanthus, as published by Linnaeus in 1767 on page 751 of Systema Naturae (but not the one on page 767), was eventually placed on the Index.|$|E
25|$|Addenda and <b>corrigenda</b> sheet issued with Italy 1915–1919, Falls {{commissioned}} for {{the volume}} 1939 but resigned to take job with The Times {{and replaced by}} Wynne. Draft chapters circulated and received strenuous objections from General Sir Hubert Gough to being blamed for failures, noting that GHQ had planned much of the offensive and should receive {{a share of the}} blame. Wynne rewrote certain passages, adding some comments from Gough; Edmonds, Wynne and Gough corresponded during the writing which Wynne finished in 1946. Edmonds rewrote parts in 1948, correcting in a fourth draft what he judged to be errors by Wynne who declined to be named as author of the work. for reason of economy, there was no map case, large maps were supplied in a folder on the back cover.

500|$|The {{following}} pages are chiefly {{designed for the}} use of those who have no previous knowledge of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament; but since the Author has endeavoured to embody in them the results of very recent investigations, he hopes that they may prove of service to more advanced students. He asks the reader's indulgence for the annexed list of Addenda et <b>Corrigenda,</b> both by reason of the peculiar character of his work, and the remoteness of West Cornwall from Public Libraries. He might easily have suppressed the greater part of them, but that he has honestly tried to be accurate, and sees no cause to be ashamed of what Person has well called [...] "the common lot of authorship." [...] He has only to add that he has not consciously borrowed from other writers without due acknowledgement, and to return his best thanks to the Rev. H. O. Coxe for important aid in the Bodleian, and to Henry Bradshaw Esq., Fellow of King's College, for valuable instruction respecting manuscripts in the University Library at Cambridge.|$|E

2500|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed by}} Pope Pius IV in 1561 to undertake the task, but it worked slowly and ineffectively. A second {{committee was}} appointed by Pope Pius V in 1569. Pope Sixtus V appointed a third committee, who took as their base text the Louvain Vulgate edition of 1583 (based on the edition of Hentenius), recording variant readings from authoritative manuscripts in the margin. A recommended text was presented in 1589. Sixtus was dissatisfied with the result, judging {{that it was too}} far from the familiar printed editions. He had substantial changes made to the text, using the Vulgate edition of Robertus Stephanus corrected to agree with the Greek; and introducing personal changes, including an entirely new system of verse divisions. This revised version was hurried into print; and suffered from misprints in the Old Testament. In addition, three whole verses were found to have been dropped from the Book of Numbers; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing or a 'wild' editorial choice. [...] The Bible appeared in 1590 and is known as Sistine Vulgate. Sixtus immediately issued <b>corrigenda</b> as pasted slips to be inserted into copies. After the Pope's sudden death, Robert Bellarmine warned that the work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church. The College of Cardinals stopped all further sales, and bought and destroyed as many copies as possible.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pembroke only {{wrote to}} our hero one letter, {{but it was}} of the bulk of six epistles of these {{degenerate}} days, containing, in the moderate compass of ten folio pages, closely written, a precis of a supplementary quarto manuscript of addenda, delenda, et <b>corrigenda</b> {{in reference to the}} two tracts with which he had presented Waverley. This he considered as a mere sop in the pan to stay the appetite of Edward's curiosity until he should find an opportunity of sending down the volume itself, which was much too heavy for the post, and which he proposed to accompany with certain interesting pamphlets, lately published by his friend in Little Britain, with whom he had kept up a sort of literary correspondence, in virtue of which the library shelves of Waverley-Honour were loaded with much trash, and a good round bill, seldom summed in fewer than three figures, was yearly transmitted, in which Sir Everard Waverley of Waverley-Honour, Bart., was marked Dr. to Jonathan Grubbet, bookseller and stationer, Little Britain. Such had hitherto been the style of the letters which Edward had received from England; but the packet delivered to him at Glennaquoich was of a different and more interesting complexion. It would be impossible for the reader, even were I to insert the letters at full length, to comprehend the real cause of their being written, without a glance into the interior of the British cabinet at the period in question.|$|E
