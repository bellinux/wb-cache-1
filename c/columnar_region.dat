Prior {{to the time}} of eye opening, lateral activation was restricted to a narrow <b>columnar</b> <b>region.</b> During the week following eye opening, the extent of lateral propagation of activity more than doubled. Selective interruption of specific pathways in the slice, combined with pharmacological and anatomical experiments, determined that this lateral propagation was mediated by horizontal projections made within layer 23.

We find that the dislocations are generated inside the islands and propagate into the silicon spacers remaining confined within the <b>columnar</b> <b>regions</b> above the islands themselves.

Although these regions must be very rare, as all molecular dynamics simulations show, they {{have a profound effect}} on the field emission capability of this flat material because they provide an internal field-enhancement mechanism. In this paper, we calculate the internal local field around such <b>columnar</b> <b>regions,</b> with the additional restriction that they do not make contact with the cathode; otherwise the problem has a well-known solution. Our problem is physically and mathematically more complicated, as now the 'metallic region' surface is not equipotential with the cathode. We have managed to solve it by requiring that the total charge on the columnar metallic structure is zero. Our findings show that such regions produce an enhancement factor that is a fraction (typically 0. 5) of the known ratio h/r (h = height and r = radius). As these structures become longer and approach the cathode, this fraction increases towards unity, but not linearly. A sudden jump occurs when contact with the cathode is established. The most interesting result is the following: Just before contact with the cathode, the local field at the cathode-facing end of such a structure increases considerably above the value h/r. The physical ramifications of these results are discussed, especially in relation to emission onset. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

We investigate {{the effect of}} spatially varying stiffness on the load-deformation response under zero-lateral strain conditions using numerical simulations of correlated random fields, where the granular medium is represented by a non-linear stress-dependent meso-scale model. Results show that stiffness heterogeneity results in higher global compressibility {{as compared to the}} homogeneous medium with the same arithmetic mean stiffness. Furthermore, the non-homogeneous stress field that develops inside the granular mass is characterized by focused load transfer along <b>columnar</b> <b>regions,</b> higher stress anisotropy and lower horizontal-to-vertical stress ratio K 0 than in a granular medium of homogenous stiffness. As the applied stress increases, the inherent stress-dependent response of the granular material leads to a more homogenous stress field.

To elucidate {{the relationship between}} columnar organization in IT cortex and the variability among neurons with respect to object selectivity, we used optical imaging technique to locate <b>columnar</b> <b>regions</b> (activity spots) and systematically compared object selectivity of individual neurons within and across the spots. The object selectivity of a given cell in a spot {{was similar to that}} of the averaged cellular activity within the spot. However, there was not such similarity among different spots (> 600 mm apart). We suggest that each cell is characterized by 1) a cellspecific response property that cause cell-to-cell variability in object selectivity and 2) one or potentially a few numbers of response properties common across the cells within a spot, which provide the basis for columnar organization in IT cortex. Furthermore, similarity in object selectivity among cells within a randomly chosen site was lower than that for a cell in an activity spot identified by optical imaging beforehand. We suggest that the cortex may be organized in a region where neurons with similar response properties were densely clustered and a region where neurons with similar response properties were sparsely clustered...|$|R

The variety of stimulus selectivity in a column may work {{as a tool to}} disregard subtle changes in input images when the system is directed to invariant recognition. Alternatively, if we emphasize the differences in selectivity of cells within a column, the columns can be compared to differential amplifiers, each of which represents variety within a group of features.

40|$|In the {{developing}} growth plate, periarticular chondrocytes proliferate, differentiate into columnar chondrocytes, and then further differentiate into postmitotic hypertrophic chondrocytes. Parathyroid hormone–related (PTH-related) protein (PTHrP), regulated by Indian hedgehog (Ihh), prevents premature hypertrophic differentiation, thereby maintaining {{the length of}} columns. Ihh regulates cartilage development through PTHrP-independent pathways as well. Here we show that Ihh stimulates differentiation of periarticular to columnar chondrocytes (periarticular chondrocyte differentiation) and thereby regulates the length of columns independently of PTHrP. Mosaic ablation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor in the growth plate caused upregulation of Ihh action, PTHrP upregulation, acceleration of periarticular chondrocyte differentiation, and elongation of the <b>columnar</b> <b>region.</b> Decreasing Ihh action in these mice reduced elongation of columns, whereas decreasing PTHrP showed only a modest effect on column length. Overexpression of Ihh caused PTHrP upregulation, elongation of columns, and acceleration of periarticular chondrocyte differentiation. PTHrP heterozygosity in this model had a minimal effect on the elongation of columns. Moreover, the elongation of columns and stimulation of periarticular chondrocyte differentiation in these models were still observed when PTHrP signaling was maintained so that it remained constant. These results demonstrate that Ihh acts on periarticular chondrocytes to stimulate their differentiation, thereby regulating the columnar cell mass independently of PTHrP...|$|E

40|$|Low {{temperature}} calorimetry {{was used}} to determine the distribution of the superconducting transition temperature in binary and Ta-doped wires fabricated by the Bronze route and by the Powder-In-Tube (PIT) method. From this analysis we were able to discern the effects of Sn and Ta compositions on the distribution of the superconducting parameters Tc and Bc 2 in the different samples. The influence of the heat treatment conditions on the superconducting properties was investigated for the PIT wires. In particular we determined the field dependence of the distribution for a commonly used reaction schedule (675 / 84 h) and for an optimized heat treatment (625 / 320 h). For the first time, we show that the wire reacted at 625 / 320 h exhibits two separated contributions in the distribution directly related to the grain morphology of the A 15 layer: a narrow peak determined by the large grains, with a lower Bc 2, and a broad peak due to the fine grains, with a higher Bc 2. The kinetics of the Sn diffusion in Nb and the growth rate of the A 15 layer were experimentally studied. The influence of Ta doping on the A 15 phase formation was analysed by electron microscopy, the growth rate and the grain morphology in binary and Ta-alloyed Bronze route wires with the same filament layout being compared at different stages of the heat treatment. At the end of reaction, the well known microstructure comprising equiaxed and <b>columnar</b> <b>regions</b> was observed in the filaments of both the binary and the Ta-alloyed wires.

However, in order to use these structures in large-scale integrated devices, accurate control over their spatial positioning is required. We show here that, by a suitable engineering of the deposition process, it is possible to obtain self-organization resulting in well ordered clusters composed of regularly disposed nano-sized islands. Elastically relaxed Ge islands act as a stressor for a Si layer subsequently deposited (Ge has a 4 % larger lattice cell). This effect results in a modulation of the lattice parameter and strain field in the Si over-layer. In particular the Si lattice in the <b>columnar</b> <b>region</b> on top of the buried islands is tensile strained and will act as preferential nucleation site for the subsequent Ge island growth.

Microstructure, texture and mechanical properties achieved under standard conditions have been investigated, alongside numerical modelling of the electron beam and attempts to modify solidification through the addition of boron. Experimentation reveals an asymmetric electron beam which can be manipulated to produce different material responses. The electron beam has been used in this work, at its least powerful, as a means of preheating powder particles and, at its most powerful; to produce what is effectively a macro-scale electron beam weld.

I Observed microstructures indicate a complicated thermal history that is capable of producing diffusion-less and diffusional transformation products.

40|$|A volume average {{solidification}} {{model is}} extended to incorporate fragmentation {{as the source}} of equiaxed crystals during mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification. This study is to use this model to analyze the role of fragmentation in the formation of as-cast structure. Test simulations are made for the solidification of a model alloy (Sn- 10 wt. %Pb) with two different geometries. The first one is a 2 D rectangular domain (50 × 60 mm 2) as cooled from the top boundary. Solidification starts unidirectionally as columnar structure from the top. The solute (Pb) enriched interdendritic melt is heavier than the bulk melt, and sinks downwards, hence leads to solutal convection. Fragmentation phenomenon occurs near the columnar tip front. The fragments are transported out of the <b>columnar</b> <b>region,</b> and they continue to grow and sink, and finally settle down and pile up at the bottom. The growing columnar structure from the top and pile-up of equiaxed crystals from the bottom finally lead to a mixed columnar-equiaxed structure, in turn leading to a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). The second geometry is a 3 D plate, 100 × 60 × 10 mm 3, as cooled laterally from one side. It was cast experimentally and analyzed for the as-cast structure. The equiaxed fragments are produced in the solidification front and transported into the bulk melt, leading to a special pattern of as-cast structure: columnar structure in the cool wall side and equiaxed structure in the upper left corner near the hot wall side, extending downwards to the middle bottom region. Numerically calculated as-cast structures agree with the experiment results...|$|E

The effects of the refiners on the as-cast structures and tensile properties of the K 4169 superalloy with different casting conditions were studied by analyzing specimens 110 mm long and 20 mm in diameter.

These inefficiencies are probed by studying variations in response across a unit pixel cell in a 55 μm pitch double-sided 3 D pixel sensor bump bonded to TimePix and Medipix 2 readout ASICs. Two complementary characterisation techniques are discussed: the first uses a custom built telescope and a 120 GeV pion beam from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN; the second employs a novel technique to illuminate the sensor with a micro-focused synchrotron X-ray beam at the Diamond Light Source, UK.

40|$|This {{research}} concerns weldments in P 91 {{steel and}} their creep behaviour. Its scope covers three main topics: the microstructure and creep {{response of the}} (i) weld metal, (ii) parent metal, and (iii) the effect of extended thermal exposure and creep on the weldments. Microstructural examination of the weld metal revealed an inhomogeneous structure, with each bead consisting of a <b>columnar</b> <b>region,</b> a coarse-grained region and a fine-grained region (the latter two regions resulting from heat-treatment of the weld bead by deposition of subsequent beads). The columnar regions exhibited high hardness whereas the coarse and fine grained regions exhibited lower hardnesses. SEM imaging revealed that the precipitate distribution throughout the weld was somewhat inhomogeneous, due to inadequate mixing in the weld pool during welding, leading to segregation and liquation effects. Examination by TEM revealed a fine martensitic structure with a distribution of chromium carbides, in addition to Mn-rich inclusions. Anisotropy of microstructure was assessed by metallographic examination on planes with normals parallel to and perpendicular to the welding direction. Creep tests on this material were performed, with the stress axis both parallel and perpendicular to the welding direction. Anisotropic creep behaviour was observed and correlated with the microstructural anisotropy. Failure life is significantly longer when uniaxial creep stress {{is parallel to the}} welding direction. The columnar regions of the weld were observed to be creep-strong with a low strain to failure whereas the coarse and fine grained regions were observed to be creep-weak with a higher strain to failure. Microstructural variations within weldments as a function of time and temperature have also been investigated. Specimens were aged at five temperatures between 760 °C and 650 °C for up to 12000 hours. At all exposure temperatures, the parent metal showed little change in terms of fine (subgrain) microstructure and hardness. Significant degradation of the weld metal microstructure was observed. This consisted of recrystallisation, emanating from the weld bead boundaries; in some cases, the recrystallised areas made up approximately 40 % of the metallographic section. The hardness of the recrystallised regions was typically 170 kgf mm- 2, whereas that of the non-recrystallised areas was 240 kgf mm- 2. TEM examination of the weld metal showed significant change, in the form of transformation of fine martensitic lath structure to larger, more equi-axed subgrains. Creep tests of aged crossweld samples showed accelerated minimum strain rates and reduced failure lives. It was also observed in crossweld specimens creep-tested at three stress levels between 70 MPa and 93 MPa that the failure location moved from the fine-grained HAZ to the parent at the highest test stress. The HAZ failures exhibited extensive cavitation restricted to the HAZ, and low failure ductility. The high stress parent metal failure, on the other hand, showed high ductility and extensive voiding and grain deformation within the parent metal microstructure. An assessment of the effect of strain on microstructural evolution has been made. This is deemed significant, and strain is believed to accelerate precipitate coarsening and martensite recovery processes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Creep {{failure of}} the weld {{structure}} in P 91 steel components in high temperature power plant applications is often a key factor limiting the lifetime of the components. Whilst creep failure in weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) regions has been studied widely, the creep properties of the weld metal itself have been less well documented. In this work, the creep response of P 91 weld metal in isolation was investigated in terms of microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. The microstructural examination of P 91 multi-pass weld metal revealed a typical weld metal structure including columnar regions and refined regions. The <b>columnar</b> <b>region</b> exhibited high hardness whilst the refined region exhibited lower hardness. The anisotropic creep behaviour of P 91 weld metal was observed in creep tests of both longitudinal and transverse specimens at 650 ºC and various stress levels. This behaviour can be correlated with the microstructural anisotropy observed, where longitudinal specimens with banded columnar regions and refined regions parallel to the stress axis had longer creep life than transverse specimens with overlapped typical-shape beads. Longitudinal weld specimens showed higher strain to failure than transverse specimens. The microstructural investigation of creep tested P 91 weld metal revealed two primary modes of creep fractures. In addition to creep fractures along columnar grain boundaries (typical of weld metal creep failure), creep fractures were also found along creep-weak white-bands which had formed at the inter-bead boundaries. The white-band regions consisted of material where the M 23 C 6 carbides had dissolved during creep testing; the loss of carbides had allowed recrystallisation of the martensitic structure to ferrite and consequently this material was much softer than the bulk weld metal. The element mapping over the weld metal by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) demonstrated that there was significant inhomogeneity {{in the distribution of}} certain elements, most significantly, chromium, manganese and molybdenum. This inhomogeneity resulted in strong activity gradients in carbon (even though the carbon concentration was homogeneous following welding) resulting in carbon loss from the alloy-depleted regions, the associated dissolution of carbides and the recrystallisation that accompanied this, and thus the poor mechanical properties which resulted in creep failure. The inhomogeneity in the distribution of certain alloying elements can be partially attributed to the solute partition of alloying elements during weld solidification which has been confirmed with examination of simulation P 91 TIG welds. However, the homogeneity of weld metal in this case required mixing of a base steel (the core rod in the weld consumable) and particles of various ferro-alloys (delivered into the weld pool from the flux). It is argued that poor mixing in the stagnant layer (unmixed zone) at the solid-liquid interface during weld solidification also makes a significant contribution to the formation of alloy-depleted regions. The formation of white-bands has been modelled using Thermo-Calc based on the understanding of the formation mechanism involving solute partition and subsequent carbon diffusion out of the alloy-depleted region. A good correlation to experimental results has been shown in the prediction of limiting carbon concentration and M 23 C 6 carbide content in white-bands. In addition, it was also suggested that depletion of carbides and carbon are strongly linked and that depletion of alloying elements only above a critical value will result in total carbide loss and thus recrystallisation into a white-band...|$|E

The {{results show that}} the macrostructure of the ingot consists of two crystallization structures: one is a quite narrow, fine, equiaxed grain region at the edge and the other is a <b>columnar</b> grain <b>region,</b> which plays a leading role. The typical columnar structure shows no discontinuity between the CrMoV, NiCrMoV, and transition zones. The average secondary arm-spacing is coarsened from 35. 3 to 49. 2 μm and 61. 5 μm from the bottom {{to the top of the}} ingot. The distinctive features of the structure are attributed to the different cooling conditions during the ESR process. The Ni, Cr, and C contents markedly increase in the transition zone (TZ) and show a slight increase from the bottom to the top and from the surface to the center of the ESR ingot due to the partition ratios, gravity segregation, the thermal buoyancy flow, the solutal buoyancy flow, and the inward Lorentz force. Less dendrite segregation exists in the CrMoV zone and the transition zone due to a stronger cooling rate (11. 1 and 4. 5 °C/s) and lower Cr and C contents.

40|$|Transcrystallisation {{induced by}} {{annealing}} in the polypropylene (PP) component of nanostructured polymer-polymer composites (NPC) was studied for two different polymeric fillers. In {{contrast to the}} typical narrow <b>columnar</b> transcrystalline <b>regions</b> around filler fibres in common glassfibre reinforced PP, volume-filling transcrystallisation was observed for both of the polymer fillers, thus resulting in reorientation of the PP matrix crystals instead of an expected isotropisation. Two colddrawn blends of PP with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) or polyamide 66 (PA 66), respectively, namely PET/PP and PA 66 /PP both in a ratio of 50 / 50 wt. % were investigated by means of wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) of synchrotron radiation during heating, melting of only the low-melting component (PP) at 200 C yielding an isotropic melt, and subsequent crystallisation upon cooling. A strong epitaxial effect of the persistent embedded microfibrillar component (PET or PA 66) on the non-isothermal crystallisation behaviour of PP during its cooling to room temperature was found. The composites obtained after such thermal treatment represented anisotropic semi-crystalline nanocomposites, in which the PP crystallites were reoriented. The ultimate structure for the PET/PP blend exhibited crystals with their molecular axis tilted at approx. 49 {{with respect to their}} initial orientation (parallel to the fibre axis). In the PA 66 /PP blends the ultimate structure returned to the initial orientation of the PP chains parallel to the fibre axis, but with a broadened orientation distribution. Results of similar studies on other blends are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Surface 3 of alloy AA 6111 -T 4, {{even deeper}} into the weld material, showed similar results. Finally, we note {{that we did not}} perform a {{complete}} inves-tigation of the base metal. However, some preliminary results indicate that the 6111 base metal had a much stronger texture than the 5182. This difference could be another reason why the 6111 material had a stronger texture in the <b>columnar</b> grain <b>region</b> of the weld. From these results, we can conclude that a strong cube tex-ture forms in laser-welded AA 5182 -O and AA 6111 -T 4 alloys and that the strength of the texture depends on the particular alloy and the depth through the weld zone. In particular, we note that the columnar grains that form {{on either side of the}} weld centerlines and appear to grow out from the parent metal into the liquid are highly textured, with a 001 direction parallel to the growth direction. This result is in agreement with studies of solidification in aluminum alloys that reported that a cube direction is a preferred growth direction. [15] Given that mechanical properties are strongly dependent on texture,[16] one would expect this texture could have a strong effect on the local mechanical response of the welds.

40|$|In quasi-two-dimensional (quasi- 2 D) quantum magnets, {{the ratio}} of Neel {{temperature}} T-N to Curie-Weiss temperature Theta(CW) is frequently used as an empirical criterion to judge the strength of frustration. In this work, we investigate how these quantities are related in the canonical quasi- 2 D frustrated square or triangular J(1) -J(2) model. Using the self-consistent Tyablikov approach for calculating T-N we show their dependence on the frustration control parameter J(2) /J(1) in the whole Neel and <b>columnar</b> antiferromagnetic phase <b>region.</b> We also discuss approximate analytical results.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of mono-disperse colloidal particles in a chromonic liquid crystal was investigated. Poly(methyl methacrylate) spherical particles {{with three different}} functionalizations, with and without surface charges, were utilized in the nematic and columnar phases of disodium cromoglycate solutions. The nematic phase was completely aligned parallel to the glass substrates by a simple rubbing technique, and the <b>columnar</b> phase showed <b>regions</b> of similar alignment. The {{behavior of}} the colloidal particles in the chromonic liquid crystal depended critically on the functionality, with bromine functionalized particles not dispersing at all, and cationic trimethylammonium and epoxy functionalized particles dispersing well in the isotropic phase of the liquid crystal. At {{the transition to the}} nematic and especially the columnar phase, the colloidal particles were expelled into the remaining isotropic phase. Since the columnar phase grew in parallel ribbons, the colloidal particles ended up in chain-like assemblies. Such behavior opens the possibility of producing patterned assemblies of colloidal particles by taking advantage of the self-organized structure of chromonic liquid crystals...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{critical}} current density in YBa 2 Cu 307 _ x (YBCO) thin films grown on deliberately miscut (1. 6 °) LaA 103 { 001 } substrates that also contain a small mosaic spread of subgrain orientations have shown an anomalous angular dependence of Je. A strong, magnetic field-dependent peak in Jc is observed when the magnetic field is oriented between the c-axis (the film normal direction) and the a-b-plane; in this orientation flux pinning is normally not strong. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {{has been used to}} determine the defects which are responsible for the flux pinning related to the anomalous Je peak. [001] columnar defects have been observed to penetrate fight through the YBCO films. The diameters of the <b>columnar</b> defect <b>regions</b> are ~ 3 - 5 nm, which is near ideal for producing the observed anomalous pinning and high J¢. Numerous tacking faults involving excess Cu-O layers have also been observed; these can also serve as effective flux pinners. Small-angle planar boundaries perpendicular to the substrate are rarely seen. Images of the YBCO-substrate interface reveal that some of the columnar growth defects initiate at substrate steps/dislocations. The YBCO unit cells grown on the upper and lower terraces of a substrate step have a relative shift of c/ 3 [001]; thus, the Cu-O planes are broken within a region less than 10 mn from the substrate, presumably reducing the superconducting order parameter in this region and leading to pinned vortices ituated on these sites. Thus, the columnar defects initiated from the interface and the stacking faults are useful for pinning flux through the entire film thickness...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{central nervous}} system of Phidippus, while {{comparable}} to that of other spiders in most respects, is distinguished by the extraordinary development of visual processing centers, associated with the complex visually-directed behavior of these animals. The primary neuropile of the anterior medial eyes consists of two distinct <b>columnar</b> synapsing <b>regions.</b> There is some evidence that the geometry of this structure may correspond to the arrangement of receptors in the anterior medial eyes. First-order interneurons link this primary neuropile with a less structured, massive secondary neuropile {{at the top of the}} syncerebrum. The optic nerve fibers of each lateral eye synapse in a convoluted primary neuropile. Two distinct first order interneuron types join this neurcroile to a lateral eye neuropile and the protocerebrum on one hand, and to the glomerular layer of the corpora pedunculata on the other. Each of these interneurons branches to form two separate synapsing regions in the primary neuropile. The small optic nerve of the posterior medial eyes synapses in a glomerular neuropile. Large interneuron fibers associated with this neuropile lead to the protocerebrum. This structure suggests a special role for information provided by the posterior medial eyes, perhaps in the regulation of diurnal activity patterns. In the corpora pedunculata, intrinsic fibers synapse anteriorly with first-order interneurons of the lateral eyes, and form linear fibers bearing numerous synaptic glomeruli in the pedunculus. The latter is the site of extensive synapsing with extrinsic fibers. The corpora pedunculata are considered to be secondary visual centers, quite possibly concerned with directed orientation to visual stimuli. In structure they are the analogs, rather than the homologs, of similar structures observed in annelids and in other arthropods. This distinction supports the separation of the Chelicerata from the latter groups. The structure of the central body agrees with its accepted role as either a major association center, or as the source of complex programmed behavior...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{structural}} organisation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) {{is an important}} step towards determining its functional organisation. Here we investigated the organisation of PFC using different neuronal tracers. We injected retrograde (Fluoro-Gold, 100 nl) and anterograde (Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Fluoro-Ruby, 100 nl) tracers into sites within PFC subdivisions (prelimbic, ventral orbital, ventrolateral orbital, dorsolateral orbital) along a coronal axis within PFC. At each injection site one injection was made of the anterograde tracer and one injection was made of the retrograde tracer. The projection locations of retrogradely labelled neurons and anterogradely labelled axon terminals were then analysed in the temporal cortex: area Te, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex. We found evidence for an ordering of both the anterograde (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes: p< 0. 001) and retrograde (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes: p< 0. 001) connections of PFC. We observed that anterograde and retrograde labelling in ipsilateral temporal cortex (i. e. PFC inputs and outputs) often occurred reciprocally (i. e. the same brain region, such as area 35 d in perirhinal cortex, contained anterograde and retrograde labelling). However, often the same specific <b>columnar</b> temporal cortex <b>regions</b> contained only either labelling of retrograde or anterograde tracer, indicating that PFC inputs and outputs are frequently non-matched...|$|R
