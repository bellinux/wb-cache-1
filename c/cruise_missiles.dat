5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk <b>cruise</b> <b>missiles,</b> rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. <b>Cruise</b> <b>missiles</b> {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using <b>cruise</b> <b>missiles</b> also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E

5|$|Whereas some <b>cruise</b> <b>missiles,</b> such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. <b>Cruise</b> <b>missiles,</b> as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, the Government of India, {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Russia to design, develop, manufacture and market a Supersonic <b>Cruise</b> <b>Missile</b> System which has been successfully accomplished by 2006.

40|$|The {{tomahawk}} <b>cruise</b> <b>missile</b> can fly a 1000 {{miles and}} hit a target {{the size of a}} car and is a crucial element of the American weapons arsenal. This paper explains how a <b>cruise</b> <b>missile</b> works. It will focus on the <b>cruise</b> <b>missile’s</b> launch, flight, low radar visibility and its guiding systems. Figure 1 In essence, the <b>cruise</b> <b>missile</b> is a small plane without a pilot. It is 6. 25 m long and 0. 52 m in diameter. As figure 1 shows, the missile incorporates a turbofan engine, a fuel tank, a conventional bomb, air intake and four different guiding systems. At launch a loaded <b>cruise</b> <b>missile</b> weighs about 1450 kg. A solid rocket booster causes the initial acceleration and launch of the <b>cruise</b> <b>missile.</b> After that the turbofan engine takes over, propelling the <b>missile</b> to a <b>cruising</b> speed of 880 km/h. The acceleration of a <b>cruise</b> <b>missile</b> and its flight involve Newton’s second and third laws of motion. Newton’s third law says that “to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction”. This law can explain how the solid rocket booster causes the missile’s initial acceleration. The propellant in the rocket booster burns very fast an...|$|R
5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and <b>cruise</b> <b>missiles</b> in West Germany.

5|$|When the Cold War {{ended in}} 1991, {{there were more}} than 500 US nuclear weapons in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were Ground Launched <b>Cruise</b> <b>Missiles,</b> and {{approximately}} 100 were B57 nuclear depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155mm nuclear artillery shells. The <b>cruise</b> <b>missiles</b> were withdrawn in 1991 {{under the terms of the}} 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range nuclear weapons. The last US warheads, including the B57s and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American nuclear weapons then remaining in the UK were 110 or so B61 nuclear bombs stored at RAF Lakenheath for USAF F-15E Strike Eagles, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British WE.177 nuclear bombs used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British nuclear weapons were British warheads on the Trident missiles of the s.|$|E

5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons.

One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more <b>cruise</b> <b>missiles</b> to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
