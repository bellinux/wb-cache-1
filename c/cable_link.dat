25|$|In {{its early}} years, {{instead of buying}} most of the {{expensive}} items needed to run a television station, Tarzian had his own engineers and technicians design and build the items needed. For example, an overhead microphone boom cost approximately $300. Tarzian employees built one for less than $30. When Tarzian decided to start broadcasting network programs, establishing a coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>link</b> from Cincinnati would prove impractical, so Tarzian built his own microwave relay system from Cincinnati to Bloomington.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the murder}} of 54 Japanese sailors by Paiwan aborigines near the southwestern tip of Taiwan in 1871, the punitive Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan {{revealed}} {{the fragility of the}} Qing dynasty's hold on Taiwan. As a result, the Qing sent the imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen to Taiwan to strengthen its defense. In Tainan, Shen made several efforts to modernize the defenses including inviting French engineers to design the Eternal Golden Castle in Erkunshen. He also recommended setting up a telegraph <b>cable</b> <b>link</b> between Tainan and Amoy. Some parts of the castle were built using bricks taken from Fort Zeelandia.|$|E

25|$|Following the airport's {{certification}} {{for passenger}} service, Santa Maria {{was selected to}} operate as the air traffic control centre for North Atlantic region, under the responsibility of Portugal by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization (PICAO), in the first semester of 1946. During this period, due to an absence of coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>link</b> between Europe and the United States, Santa Maria became an important international centre for communications. Communications were limited to teletype and radio. With the 1965 installation of coaxial cable between the United States and England, all communications between the two continents began to intersect at Santa Maria. The airport was classified an ETOPS alternate, having suitable facilities to accommodate transatlantic flights needing to make an emergency landings.|$|E
