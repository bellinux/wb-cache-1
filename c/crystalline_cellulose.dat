The treatments resulted in either partial or complete decomposition of the celluloses and the decomposed products were primarily recovered as hydrolyzed, dehydrated and fragmented ones as well as organic acids in the water-soluble (WS) portions.

The outcome from the WS portions at 270  °C/ 10  MPa/ 15  min showed that the degree of difficulty for decomposition is lower in group II (cell II, cell IIIII, cell IVII) than group I (cell I, cell IIII, cell IVI), indicating that group II is less resistant to decomposition by HCW treatment. Therefore, the decomposition behaviors of the cellulose are due to the inherent differences in the crystalline structures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the `parallel-up' {{structure}} of the cellulose crystal, a crystallographic approach to study the mode of action of cellobiohydrolase Cel 7 A on Valonia cellulose microcrystal has been carried out. After incubation with Cel 7 A, most of the initially smooth and well defined Valonia microcrystals displayed fibrillation. However, as the hydrolysis reaction was rather heterogeneous, some microcrystals remained superficially intact. Close investigation on such crystals revealed polar morphology: one end was narrowed extremely or pointed. Electron microdiffraction analysis of these crystals evidenced that the narrowing of the microcrystals occurs at their reducing end side. This was also confirmed by the visualization of selective reducing end labeling at the pointed ends of microcrystals. These lines of investigation are the first demonstration that the processivity of Cel 7 A action against insoluble highly <b>crystalline</b> <b>celluloses</b> is unambiguously toward non-reducing ends from reducing ends...|$|R

[...] In addition to the important role it plays in biofuel production, xylanase is utilized in a number of other industrial and biotechnology applications due to its ability to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose.

The amino acid sequence of the protein deduced from celE DNA sequence led us to the supposition that CelE is a three-domain protein. Recombinant CelE and a truncated form deleted of the putative cellulose binding domain (CBD) were obtained. Deletion of the CBD induces a total loss of activity. Exhibiting rather low levels of activity on soluble, amorphous, and <b>crystalline</b> <b>celluloses,</b> CelE is more active on p-nitrophenyl–cellobiose than the other cellulases from this organism characterized to date.

All of these features suggest that CelE is a cellobiohydrolase which has retained a certain capacity for random attack mode. We measured saccharification of Avicel and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose by associations of CelE with four other cellulases from C. cellulolyticum and found that CelE acts synergistically with all tested enzymes.
