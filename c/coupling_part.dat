40|$|Vapor-phase {{molecules}} are adsorbed at air-water interfaces to a {{much greater}} extent than can {{be accounted for by}} air-water partition coefficients, indicating that interface adsorption can play an important role, and this can be very important for environmental phenomena. Based on a statistical thermodynamic analysis, we separate the observable free energy of adsorption into a dimensionality change and a <b>coupling</b> <b>part</b> so that the modeling effort is correctly focused on the <b>coupling</b> <b>part.</b> Based on this analysis, we present two kinds of models for predicting partitioning between the vapor phase and the macroscopic surface of liquid water. The first model, called SM 5. 0 R-Surf, involves atomic surface tensions developed previously for bulk solvation in organic liquids and a set of four solvent descriptors that characterize the properties of the water layer at the air-water interface. The latter descriptors are treated as parameters that are determined empirically by optimization for a set of 85 solutes for which the air-water surface adsorption coefficient (Ki/a) is known experimentally. The resulting descriptorsindicate that interfacial water has increased hydrogen bond acidity and increased hydrogen bond basicity as compared to bulk water. A second kind of model involves an empirical correlation of the interfacial-water partition coefficient Ki/w with the calculated van der Waals surface area, and this kind of model can be based either on experimental data, yielding the semiempirical surface area (SESA) model, or on theoretical data, yielding the semitheoretical surface area (STSA) model.

The {{system uses}} the MCU to {{complete}} the functions such as regularly collecting, computing, error handling, storage, data transmission control, and so on, for the parameters required measurement. The system consists of four components: sensor and modulation circuit part, A/D transformation and send part, optical fiber <b>coupling</b> <b>part</b> and the receiver display part. The system has the following characteristics: The encoder is used to encode and send the digital signal of the measured parameters. Through the optical fiber coupling, this system displays the corresponding measurement parameters after decoding by the decoder. System circuit design is simple, easy debugging, reliable of information transmission, high precision of data transmission, particularly good anti-interference, no need of great sending power.

The reflecting layer is <b>coupling</b> <b>part</b> of the emitted laser light back into the internal VCSEL cavity causing self-mixing interferometry. By applying pressure and consequently changing the external cavity length, this interference signal adopts a periodic shape corresponding to half the VCSEL wavelength. The use of unpackaged VCSELs limits the sensor dimensions and minimizes the distance between two adjacent sensing points. A proof-of-principle setup is developed and the integrated sensing principle has been demonstrated using a polydimethylsiloxane transducer layer. A 850 -nm VCSEL is used and forces up to 300 mN are applied resulting in a 2 -mV peak-to-peak variation of the electrical driving voltage...|$|E

30|$|In this {{publication}} we presented a {{holistic approach to}} achieve double digit speedups for analog transient simulation of large-sized circuits compared to existing state-of-the-art KLU [23, 38] solver. The novelty of our approach consists in the combination and extension of existing approaches in a unique and unprecedented way. In {{the first step of}} our approach we partition the circuit such that the system matrix and right-hand side can be built in parallel, while minimizing the fill-in rate in the resulting coupling system of the BBD matrix. For solving the coupling system during the simulation we introduced an adaptive ϵ approach for the ILU(ϵ) preconditioned GMRES solver which solves the <b>coupling</b> <b>part</b> efficiently. As an additional speedup measure we introduced the partition bypass method. If certain criterions are met during the Newton iteration of a time step, the partition bypass method skips significant computations of the Newton loop. The numerical examples clearly underline not just the robustness of our approach but its true speedup potential especially for large-sized circuits in the frame of an industrial analog simulator.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} many medical {{measurements}} are {{directly or indirectly}} influenced by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). For example pupil size or heart rate may demonstrate striking moment-to-moment variability. This review intends to elucidate the physiology behind this seemingly unpredictable system. The review is split up into: 1. The peripheral ANS, parallel innervation by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, their transmitters and co-transmitters. It treats questions like the supposed sympatho/vagal balance, organization in plexuses and the 'little brains' that are active like in the enteric system or around the heart.

30|$|The final {{objective}} of our partitioning {{approach is to}} ensure that all block matrices can be LU decomposed by a static pivoting solver. The fill-in minimization reordering does always symmetric row and column swapping, so that the diagonal elements remain on the diagonal. Node voltage MNA variables can be used for static pivoting, since they have nonzero diagonal entries. However, the branch current MNA variables which are required by voltage sources and inductors have no diagonal entries in all analyses. Therefore they require a neighboring node voltage MNA variable for pivoting. This row swapping between these two MNA variables must be possible within one partition or within the <b>coupling</b> <b>part</b> of the system. In this last step of the partitioning, it is ensured that all current MNA variables and their neighbor node voltage MNA variables are either in the same partition block matrix A_i,i or in the coupling system A_c,c. For this reason, if necessary, further MNA variables are moved to the coupling system. In other words, we ensure that all current paths are contained completely either in a unique partition matrix or in the coupling matrix. In this way it is always ensured that the diagonal entries will stay nonzero during the block-wise Gaussian eliminations.|$|E
