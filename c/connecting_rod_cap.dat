Subsequently, the aircraft was damaged during an emergency landing at night in a marshy area about 1 to 2 mi from the airport. An exam of the engine revealed the #5 <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>cap</b> bolt had failed, which resulted in further damage of the engine. Probable cause: Failure of the #5 connecting rod bolt. Factors related to the accident were: Dark night and the soft and wet (marshy) terrain conditions in the emergency landing area.|$|E
50|$|In {{a splash}} {{lubrication}} system no oil pump is used. Instead the crankshaft dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and due to its high speed, it splashes the crankshaft, <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> {{and bottom of the}} pistons. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> big end <b>caps</b> may have an attached scoop to enhance this effect.

50|$|The VTR1000F was {{introduced}} in 1997 using an all new 90-degree V-twin engine and a HMAS (Honda Multi-Action System) fork and shock. The bike also ushered in several new design concepts for Honda such as the semi-pivotless frame, where the engine is a stressed member with the swingarm bolted directly to it. Other innovations were side radiators, single-casting engine case, <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> with <b>cap</b> screws instead of nuts, and 38 mm intake valves, the largest Honda has ever used on a production motor at that time. The largest carburetors ever put on a production motorcycle (48 mm). In order to overcome response irregularities typical for larger V-twin engines, Honda figured out different camshaft profiles and intake manifold dimensions for the two cylinders, and the power control of the engine was praised in motorbike surveys.Cycle World list a quarter-mile time and speed of 11.03-second/124.26-mph.|$|R

A number of fatigue failures {{were attributed to}} the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of 'football head' bolts. In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The <b>rod</b> <b>cap</b> forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, {{the design of the}} Essex V6 engine used {{a new version of the}} 351W <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively.

The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> with cracked <b>caps</b> and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. The SRT-4 intercooler was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by Valeo, unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Every {{vehicle that}} uses an {{internal}} combustion engine requires at least one <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> depending upon the number of cylinders in the engine. <b>Connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is a structural member in the engine, which transfers reciprocating motion in to rotary motion of crank shaft. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> while transferring the power from piston to crank shaft takes load from piston due to combustion process in the combustion chamber and inertia forces of the reciprocating parts (piston & <b>connecting</b> <b>rod)</b> due to this the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> may fail.
