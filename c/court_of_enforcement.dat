40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that credit constraints {{can lead to}} the inability to enforce contracts, thereby creating inefficiency. If time elapses between the contract period and the enforcement period, a credit constrained agent that uses the proceeds of trade to fund consumption faces a greater cost to enforce a contract than an unconstrained agent. This allows the other party to a contract to hold up the credit constrained agent, thereby creating inefficiency. This is demonstrated for two types <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> mechanisms; <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> a one-time trade via the <b>courts,</b> and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> a long-term trade via a punishment strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine how the European Union has applied, and {{potentially}} will apply, the principle of subsidiarity in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> EU competition laws. This article thus focuses on how the Union envisages national court participation in the application and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> EU competition laws rather than how, in practice, Member State courts have exercised their concurrent jurisdiction in enforcing Articles 85 and 86. Part One provides a brief introduction to EU competition law enforcement and examines two recent decisions by the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Justice and the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> First Instance clarifying the relationship between the Commission and the national courts in enforcing EU competition rules. Part Two overviews the procedures national courts should follow in enforcing competition rules as recently set forth in the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s 1993 Notice on Cooperation with National Courts. Part Three assesses the impact decentralization may have on the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s and national courts 2 ̆ 7 <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> EU competition law.

40|$|After severe {{discussions and}} almost eighty years <b>of</b> court-based <b>enforcement</b> the {{legislator}} {{decided it was}} time for a change. New Serbian Enforcement and Security Act has established enforcement agents as new legal profession. New Law distinguishes between (private) enforcement agents and court bailiffs. Only graduate and experienced lawyer who has passed special exam and meets other conditions can be appointed as enforcement agent. His primary duty is to carry the enforcement out, but in some situations he is solely responsible for the whole enforcement procedure. When it comes to collection of utilites (state companies are enforcement creditors) enforcement procedure is almost completely in hands <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agent. The system <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents is not organized in a way that fosters competition. It is closed system that leads to monopoly and possible corruption. Enforcement agents are primarily responsible to the Ministry of Justice, and not so much under the <b>court's</b> supervision. Chamber <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents is not completely autonomous but under control of the Ministry <b>of</b> Justice. Besides <b>enforcement</b> agents court bailiffs still continue to exist.

50|$|Four Idaho lesbian couples filed {{a lawsuit}} in U.S. {{district}} court in November 2013, challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage. On May 13, 2014, U.S. Chief Magistrate Candy W.

She wrote: The defendants offered no evidence that same-sex marriage would adversely affect opposite-sex marriages or the well-being of children. Without proof, the defendants' justifications echo the unsubstantiated fears that could not prop up the anti-miscegenation laws and rigid gender roles of days past.
