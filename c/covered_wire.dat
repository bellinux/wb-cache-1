40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} fluid flow-meter based on the {{inductive}} response of glass covered FeSiB amorphous wires, arranged as vertical active cores {{with respect to the}} flow of a liquid in a pipe of circular or rectangular diameter. Arrays of parallel FeSiB glass covered wires, fixed at the one end and free at the other are set normal to the fluid flow inside of an array of thin coils, thus covering the whole cross section of the fluid conduit. An excitation coil is also used for static flow measurements. The displacement of each glass <b>covered</b> <b>wire</b> corresponds to the local velocity of the fluid. It has been determined that the uncertainty of the voltage output dependence on the fluid flow is better than 1 %. So, the profile of the fluid velocity along the cross section of the fluid conduit can be determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{radiation}} field of toroidal-like, timedependent current configurations is investigated. The infinitesimal time-dependent configumtions are found outside which the electromagnetic strengths disappear but the potentials survive. For {{a number of}} time dependences, their finite radiationless counterparts can be found. In these oses topologically non-hivial (unremovable by a gauge transformation) electromagnetic potentials exist outside sources. The well-define $ rule obtained for constructing time-dependent infinitesimal so!" suggests the existence of finite non-trivial radiatio?less sources with an arbitrary time dependence. The latter can be used m cany out timedependent Aharonov-Bohmlike experiments and to transfer the information. Using the Neumann-Helmholtz parametrization of the-nt density we represent the timedependent electromagnetic field in a form convenient for applications. 1. Introduclion Interest in timedependent currents flowing in toroidal coils arose from the following remark made by James Clerk Maxwell in his memoir On physical lines of force [I]: 'Let B, figure 3, be a circular ring of uniform section, lapped uniformly with <b>covered</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|E

It scars the past and threatens the future. The work is a memoir and a memorial seeking formal structure. The structure is tense with antitheses: the barbed wire???s rigid containment against the silk???s supple fragility, the grey grid???s horizontal and vertical stability against the bright wire???s diagonal tipping, the texture???s tactile invitation against its pointed threats. Warm and cool greys emphasize surface, quiet and mystery. Colors used under veils of grey fabric or as linear elements woven on the surface create contradiction and ambiguity. The linear qualities come from strands of barbed wire, <b>covered</b> <b>wire,</b> strips of China silk and of silk screen ???Silk,??? which is really transparent polyester.

Architecturally, they {{are meant to}} be columns, built up of successive growth layers and pieced together in jigsaw puzzle fashion. The form of each column evolves through collaboration between it and me, in a struggle between both our wills; it endeavors to swell out against my determination to contain it. Consequently, the irregularly formed columns are unstable and fail in their duty, with the marks of our conflict residing in the bulges and indents of each individual. Their life cycles involve dismantling and rebuilding and so I have begun to merge the processes of construction and deconstruction. In situ is created from the process of painting the wire components and setting them to dry on transparent polyester paper. Residual paint from the drying process leaves an imprint on the transparent paper. Like a sonogram of my fetal creations, in situ generates an image of the developing constructions. [URL]...|$|E
