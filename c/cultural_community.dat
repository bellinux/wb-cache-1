The movement was pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and <b>cultural</b> <b>community.</b> Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly.

5|$|First {{settled by}} Europeans in the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown from}} a {{collection}} of small rural villages and farms to become fully urbanised with a diverse <b>cultural</b> <b>community.</b> Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of Toronto.|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the years}} <b>cultural</b> <b>communities</b> {{across the world}} have borne witness to many unending {{attempts}} at the destruction of their places of worship.

This article seeks to argue and demonstrate that <b>cultural</b> <b>communities</b> in South Africa stand to benefit from the properly construed and rich earth jurisprudence arising out of the courtroom experiences of some of the <b>cultural</b> <b>communities</b> identified elsewhere in the world.

25|$|These {{communities}} {{became very}} marginalised within {{a town of}} poor education and hostile working-class ethics.

25|$|Born in London in the 1940s, John Barham studied piano, trumpet {{and music}} {{composition}} at the Royal College of Music.

25|$|While {{the show}} does derive {{some of its}} humour from {{exploring}} the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is {{the simple fact of}} being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood <b>cultural</b> <b>community.</b> Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, not to be a political platform.

25|$|Traditions within various {{cultures}} {{promote the}} passing down of certain toys {{to their children}} based on the child's gender. In South American Indian communities, boys receive a toy bow and arrow from their father while young girls receive a toy basket from their mother. In North African and Saharan cultural communities, gender {{plays a role in}} the creation of self-made dolls. While female dolls are used to represent brides, mothers, and wives, male dolls are used to represent horsemen and warriors. This contrast stems from the various roles of men and women within the Saharan and North African communities. There are differences in the toys that are intended for girls and boys within various cultures, which is reflective of the differing roles of men and women within a specific <b>cultural</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

40|$|Many history museums hold {{collections}} that {{originate from}} specific <b>cultural</b> <b>communities.</b> Because museums {{are becoming increasingly}} community focused, {{it is especially important}} to involve community in how museums care for and manage these collections. This thesis examines how history museums with cultural collections build relationships with the communities the collection originated from, as well as how history museums involve <b>cultural</b> <b>communities</b> in the management and care of these collections. A literature review and case studies of museums that hold collections of interest to <b>cultural</b> <b>communities</b> is presented. It is concluded that flexibility and individualizing relationships through interaction are key in developing collaboration between museums and communities. Finally, recommendations are offered, including that museums should share collections policies with <b>cultural</b> <b>communities</b> and engage them with the collections through specific projects that may lead to the development of institutional documentation...|$|R
25|$|At {{the first}} post-war {{constituent}} assembly convened in Paris in November 1945 to draft {{the constitution of}} the French Fourth Republic, Madagascar was represented by two doctors named Joseph Raseta and Joseph Ravoahangy. They formed the MDRM political party together with future writer Jacques Rabemananjara in early 1946. All three leaders were the descendents of Hova who had been politically prominent in the former Merina royal court. The party's platform was built on national independence from France. The movement was pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island as part of the global Francophone economic and <b>cultural</b> <b>community.</b> Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly.|$|E
500|$|The park faces Cincinnati Music Hall, {{home to the}} Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Cincinnati Opera, Cincinnati May Festival, and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.

Memorial Hall, a Beaux Arts theater built by Hannaford in 1908, is immediately south of Music Hall, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Since 2005 the area has also been home to the Art Academy of Cincinnati, founded in 1869. Formerly aligned with the Cincinnati Art Museum, it became an independent college of design in 1998.

While it is traditional for players to host public celebrations with the trophy in their hometowns, Lucic chose to keep the day private, explaining that [...] "I grew up a Canucks fan. I know how it is." [...] Following the Canucks' defeat in the Finals, fans had staged an hours-long riot in Downtown Vancouver. More personally, posters of Lucic at a local <b>cultural</b> <b>community</b> centre were defaced. Also, an appearance by Lucic at a Greek festival in Vancouver sparked a public brawl; The Vancouver Sun reported that Lucic did not throw any punches. While Lucic's day with the Cup was private, many of his functions were held in public venues, which were reportedly well received by passers-by. He brought the trophy to his hometown church, St. Archangel Michael Serbian Orthodox Church in Burnaby, for a gathering of approximately 350 people and on a harbour cruise with friends and family. He finished the day atop Grouse Mountain, the same place {{where he and his}} Vancouver Giants teammates took the Memorial Cup after their CHL victory in 2007.

500|$|The Eskaya, less {{commonly}} known as the Visayan-Eskaya, is the collective name for the members of a cultural minority found in Bohol, Philippines, which is distinguished by its cultural heritage, particularly its literature, language, dress and religious observances. After the Eskaya first came to public attention in 1980, these cultural practices were the subject of intense speculation on the part of local journalists and amateur historians who made diverse claims about the ethnolinguistic status of the Eskaya people. The unique Eskayan language and writing system in particular {{has been a source of}} fascination and controversy. Some journalists argued that the Eskaya were historically displaced from the Middle East, while others suggested that the community was a cult speaking an invented language. According to Eskaya mythology, the language and script was created through divine inspiration by the ancestor Pinay who based it on the human body. Suppressed by the Spanish colonists, Pinay's language was said to have resurfaced under the leadership of Mariano Datahan (ca. 1875–1949), a veteran of Bohol's republican army. Although the historical existence of Pinay cannot be confirmed, more recent studies that combined linguistic analysis with oral history and genealogical research provide evidence that the Eskaya language was most likely created and disseminated within a generation by a charismatic individual. [...] Today, the Eskaya are officially classified as an Indigenous <b>Cultural</b> <b>Community</b> under The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 (Republic Act No. 8371). A number of reports have suggested that Eskaya linguistic and cultural education has been in steady decline since the mid-1980s, although promising revitalisation efforts have also been documented.|$|E
