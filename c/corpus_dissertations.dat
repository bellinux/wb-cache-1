Initially, we examine the cultural conditions that operate in the insertion of these themes in contemporary practices in education. Next, we aim to establish a mapping of the main investigative trends in the area, using as a <b>corpus</b> <b>dissertations</b> and theses produced in Brazil between 2004 and 2009. Three investigative tendencies are prevalent: school practices, curricular and technology policies, and contemporary cultural dynamics and sociability. Finally, we seek to establish some investigative perspective in the field, as well as some investigative assumptions for the studies of school curricula and their contemporary policies...|$|E

While prior work in HCI and visualization has proposed {{a variety of ways}} of presenting keyphrases, less {{attention has been paid to}} selecting the best descriptive terms. In this article, we investigate the statistical and linguistic properties of keyphrases chosen by human judges and determine which features are most predictive of high-quality descriptive phrases. Based on 5, 611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a <b>corpus</b> of <b>dissertation</b> abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction. Precision-recall measures find that our technique generates keyphrases that match those selected by human judges. Crowdsourced ratings of tag cloud visualizations rank our approach above other automatic techniques. Finally, we discuss the role of HCI methods in developing new algorithmic techniques suitable for user-facing applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{proposed}} by Biber et al. (1999 : 966, 972), stance requires the communication of assessments and value judgments concerning the described situation by appeal to evidence (evidentiality), {{assessment of the}} degree of likelihood concerning the described situation (epistemic modality), and the arguments regarding the necessity or desirability of the situation obtaining (deontic modality). The present study investigates authorial stance in doctoral dissertations of native and non-native academic authors of English. It is designed to analyze evaluation adjectives in doctoral dissertations produced in the field of English Language Teaching, Applied Linguistics, English Language and Literature and Modern Languages between 2005 and 2012. Throughout the study, a total number of fifty-one evaluation adjectives were examined across three sets of <b>corpora</b> including <b>dissertations</b> written by native speaking academic authors of English (NAEs), Turkish-speaking academic authors of English (TAEs) and Spanish-speaking academic authors of English (SAEs). The items in question were identified through WS Tools (Scott, 2012) over three corpora, which were subsequently compared with regard to their frequency using a log likelihood test. Findings of the study have revealed that these adjectives were significantly underused by TAEs and SAEs against NAEs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyse the language policy of French Polynesia {{and the status of}} the French language in comparison with the Polynesians languages. French Polynesia is a French overseas-collectivity and a part of the French republic {{as a result of its}} colonisation in the 19 th century. This dissertation aims to treat different aspects which can be found in a multilingual society such as the officiality and teaching of languages. On the basis of four qualitative interviews with linguists and teachers in French Polynesia we examine the language policy and its consequences for the Polynesian society. One of our major results is that the influence of the language policy is so powerful that it can lead to a loss of the status of the Polynesian languages.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} substantively place Chicana/o literary studies {{in dialogue with}} the field of trauma studies, a field in which the robustness of minority letters remain under-theorized. The legacies of British and Iberian colonization, the ongoing racialized abuses of communities, the Mexican cession of 1848, the continued struggle for civil rights, the recent censure of Ethnic Studies, are all events marked by systematic racial wounding. For this reason {{in order to understand}} trauma more comprehensively, I look to Chicana/o literature to analyze how trauma and healing continue to be theorized, and aesthetized within American writing. Tracing an aesthetic of trauma and healing throughout the Chicana/o literary <b>corpus,</b> this <b>dissertation</b> explores in detail a poetics that I insist reflects the relationship between trauma, colonial wounding, and the palliative function of Curanderismo. Opening in the sixteenth century in order to explore the relationship between coloniality, Americanity, and racial wounding, the project then turns to the twentieth and twenty-first century. Divided into five chapters, which define narrative broadly, I read closely to extract a cluster of ideas that comment on trauma and healing. Chapter I, examines the geopolitics of knowledge and Mesoamerican colonial writing. Chapter II, contemplates Curanderismo and the key concept figure of the Curandera across the archive by analyzing texts from disparate historical sections within the Chicana/o literary canon. Chapter III explores Américo Paredes’ novel, George Washington Gómez as trauma fiction. Chapter IV, places Gloria Anzaldúa’s writing in conversation with Manuel Muñoz’s texts.

Abstract : This {{dissertation}} {{sought to}} identify elements in sign language poetry that would {{answer the question}} {{whether or not it}} possessed rhythm, and in which way this rhythm would be constituted, based primarily on the research of Valli (1993), Blondel and Miller (2001), Sutton-Spence (2005), and Machado (2013). With the aspects found in these authors, I created ten groups on Elan linguistic analysis software for the analysis of Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) poems. These were: glosses, sign repetition, rhyme, morphism, pauses and holds, movement size, movement emphasis, movement duration, visual sonority, and symmetry. The <b>corpus</b> of this <b>dissertation</b> is composed of two Libras poems, Nelson Pimenta's "Bandeira Brasileira", and Fernanda Machado's "Voo sobre Rio".

The commonly employed subordination-based complexity measures cannot adequately capture {{the development of}} syntactic complexity of noun phrases expected of advanced student academic writing (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011). Following the call for more {{research in this area}} (e. g. Lu, 2011, p. 57), the current study compared noun phrase complexity in two corpora: one is a <b>corpus</b> of MA <b>dissertations</b> written by Chinese EFL students and the other comprises published research articles in applied linguistics journals. The study examined overall noun phrase complexity using an automatic syntactic complexity analyzer and specifically identified features of one aspect of NP complexity: NP postmodification. The quantitative results were further contextualized in a textual analysis of excerpts from the two corpora for demonstrating the significance of NP complexity to the establishment of discourse coherence. Results of the analyses showed significant underdevelopment of NP postmodification complexity in student writing relative to published texts, meanwhile explicating the circumstances under which the difference is meaningful. Implications of the findings for the teaching of EFL academic writing were also discussed. Department of Englis...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{songs are}} {{generally}} considered formally simplistic, based around alternation of verse and chorus, the latter functioning as the song’s selling point—an easily identifiable advertisement for the song-as-commodity. However, many rock songs composed {{in the last}} ten to fifteen years are not structured in this way. Pieces composed by artists in the genres known as “post-rock,” “art rock,” “math-metal,” and “neo-prog” often feature forms that, instead of treating a repeated chorus as the dramatic high point, emphasize a single moment of climactic material at the end; and some present new material from beginning to end, resulting in an entirely through-composed formal structure. This dissertation explores the link between these post-millennial experimental rock genres and the experimental song forms used by artists in those genres. Chapter One includes a literature review, identifies a mode of thought I call the “Verse/Chorus Paradigm,” and then presents a concise rock historiography that casts certain artists and genres on either side of that paradigm, either as conventional or experimental. In Chapter Two, I suggest revisionist theories of conventional rock form, present new models of climaxes and endings, and define experimental formal structures that will be used throughout the analyses in later chapters. 	 “Terminally-Climactic Form”—a formal type I have identified throughout post-millennial rock music—is the topic of Chapter Three. In this form, a single moment of new material at the end acts as the song’s focal point, rather than the chorus, the de facto focal point in conventional rock. I construct archetypes and provide analyzed examples for three classifications of Terminally-Climactic Form: two-part, three-part, and extended. In Chapter Four, I explore the more radical departure from conventional rock forms made possible by through-composition. Toward this aim, I construct a genetic taxonomy of four through-composed types based on an analogy to formal alleles; just as in Chapter Three, each of these types is supported with analyzed examples from the post-millennial experimental rock <b>corpus.</b> My <b>dissertation</b> concludes by considering some formally ambiguous pieces, and suggests how my formal theories might be adapted to analysis of more familiar, conventional rock music. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that texts are not {{translated}} word by word but in larger units which are, {{from the perspective}} of the target language, more or less monosemous. This dissertation argues that translation units are the smallest such units, and that they can be identified in parallel corpora. It aims to show that these translation units and their target language equivalents can be extracted from parallel corpora and can be re-used to facilitate new translations. The concept of translation units and their equivalents will enable translators to translate competently into languages other than their native language, something not sufficiently supported by traditional bilingual dictionaries. For my exploratory study presented here, I will use the Hong Kong Legal Document Parallel <b>Corpus</b> (HKLDC). This <b>dissertation</b> starts with the definition of the concept of the translation unit and its equivalent and goes on to describe a method of extracting translation unit candidates. These candidates are then validated by further analysis. It will also test the hypothesis that each complete translation unit has only one translation equivalent. Finally, by comparing the translation equivalents extracted from the corpus with those provided by traditional dictionaries, this dissertation will argue that parallel corpora, as the repository of the translation units and translation equivalents, can, by complementing traditional translation aids, facilitate translation. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} cost-complexity-performance relationship between two automatic language identification systems. The {{first is a}} state-of-the-art archi¬tecture, trained on about three hours of phonetically hand-labelled telephone speech obtained from the recognised OGLTS corpus. The second system, introduced by our¬selves, is a simpler design with a smaller, less complex parameter space. It is a vector quantisation-based approach which bears some resemblance to a system suggested by Sugiyama. Though trained on the same data, it has no need for any labels and is therefore less costly. A number of experiments are performed to find quasi-optimal parameters for the two systems. In further experiments the systems are evaluated and compared {{on a set of}} ten two-language tasks, spanning five languages. The more com¬plex system is shown to have a substantial performance advantage over the simpler design - 81 % versus 65 % on 40 seconds of speech. However, both results are well under reported state-of-the-art performance of 94 % and would suggest that our systems can benefit from additional attention to implementation detail and optimisation of various parameters. Given the above, our suggested architecture may potentially provide an adequate solution where the high development cost associated with state-of-the-art technology and the necessary training <b>corpora</b> are prohibitive. <b>Dissertation</b> (M Eng (Computer Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|Dhamma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and most difficult concepts in Pali Buddhism. Its significance lies in the fact that the term points to both the essence and the goal of Buddhism. Its ambiguity, how- ever, results from the variety of the term 2 ̆ 7 s interpretations depending on its contexts. This dissertation analyzes the concept of dhamma in the writings of the two foremost interpreters of Thai Buddhism in the modern and contemporary periods, Vajiranana (1860 - 1921) and Buddhadasa (1906 -), who, in differing ways, attempt to recover the original teaching of the Buddha 2 ̆ 7 s dhamma. The study first describes the range of meanings of the term in the Pali canonical materials, and selected western interpreters, before focusing on its normative and popular significance in Thai Buddhism. After discussing the histori- cal context in which Vajiranana and Buddhadasa have worked, the dissertation then provides a detailed exposition of their interpreta- tions of dhamma. Through an analysis of their institutional roles and written <b>corpus,</b> the <b>dissertation</b> establishes the distinctive nature of the substance and method of their teachings. We find that Vajiranana closely follow the Theravada scholastic tradition as epitomized by Buddhaghosa; and that his strong emphasis on dhamma as moral norm is consistent with the efforts of the Thai government of his days to use religion to help build a strong nation-state. Buddha- dasa breaks away from traditional Theravada exegetical methods and attitude toward scriptures. Advancing a theory of religious lan- guage/truth not unlike Madhyamika, he emphasizes the ontological nature of dhamma. In particular, he interprets dhamma in terms of the Thai term for 2 ̆ 2 nature, 2 ̆ 2 dhammajati, which he equates with 2 ̆ 2 the normal 2 ̆ 2 (pakati), dependent orgination (paticcasamuppada), and emptiness (sunnata). ^ In addition to analyzing the content of their thought to get at their distinctive interpretations of dhamma, the dissertation also contrasts the styles of Vajiranana and Buddhadasa in terms of Weberian-type categories, viewing Vajiranana as a charismatic priest and an ideal of the Buddha 2 ̆ 7 s right-hand disciple [...] a scholar-administrator (ganthadhura) monk [...] while Buddhadasa is a charismatic prophet and an ideal of the Buddha 2 ̆ 7 s left-hand disciple [...] a forest-dwelling meditator (vipassanadhura) monk. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the role of {{transfer}} on French EFL learners’ production of textual phrasemes, i. e. multi-word units that organise the referential content of a text, e. g. contrasting (in contrast to, differs significantly from), concluding (in conclusion, it can be concluded that) (Granger and Paquot, 2008). The study applies Jarvis’s (2000) methodological framework on learner corpus data. The International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) (Granger et al. 2009) appears to be ideally suited to analysing the three potential effects of L 1 influence described by Jarvis (2000). Intra-L 1 -group homogeneity in French EFL learners’ performance is investigated by comparing all the essays written by French learners to verify whether they behave as a group with respect to a specific L 2 feature. Inter-L 1 -group heterogeneity in learners’ interlanguage performance is verified by a comparison of the French component of ICLE and other L 1 sub-corpora (e. g. texts produced by German, Dutch and Swedish learners). Unlike Jarvis (2000), I made use of comparison of means tests and post hoc tests to confirm this second L 1 effect. To establish intra-L 1 -group congruity between learners’ L 1 and interlanguage performance, French EFL learners’ use of a specific multiword sequence is compared to the use of its equivalent form in a comparable corpus of essays written by French-speaking students collected at the University of Louvain, i. e. the <b>Corpus</b> de <b>Dissertations</b> Françaises (CODIF). Applying Jarvis’s (2000) unified framework on learner corpus data unveils interesting patterns of transfer of function, transfer of the phraseological environment, transfer of style and register, and transfer of L 1 frequency. Learners’ knowledge of words and word combinations in their mother tongue includes a whole range of information about their preferred co-occurrences and sentence position, stylistic or register features, discourse functions and frequency. Primings for collocational and contextual use of (at least a restricted set of frequent or core) L 1 lexical devices are particularly strong in the mental lexicon of adult EFL learners. They are the result of many encounters with these lexical items in L 1 speech and writing. Mental primings in the L 1 lexicon probably influence EFL learners’ knowledge of English words and word sequences by priming the lexico-grammatical preferences of an L 1 lexical item to its English counterpart. These results support Kellerman’s (1984) claim that the ‘hoary old chestnut’ according to which transfer does not afflict the more advanced learner “should finally be squashed underfoot as an unwarranted overgeneralization based on very limited evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} theory and application of Gesture Form Analysis, which systematises necessary processes of spatial conceptualisation for understanding a specific gesture type (pointing, drawing, representing etc.). Eight gesture form operations are proposed, which are combined in a modular fashion. They are applied {{in the analysis of}} gestures of the <b>dissertation</b> <b>corpus</b> and of other literature. The gesture type Pointing At Location is composed of the operations Articulator Profiling (e. g., straight extended arm, hand and index), Shape Profiling (the predominant axis, a line, is profiled), Continuation (the line is continued, indicating a direction), and Intersection (the line intersects with the surface of an object in a point: the location pointed at). The gesture type Drawing ‒ while otherwise containing the same operations as Pointing At Location ‒ requires adding the operation of Trace Leaving (by moving the arm ‒ and hence all the other forms created by the above operations ‒ the point leaves a trace in form of a line). The geometrical operations of Gesture Form Analysis (and the constituent forms specified in parentheses) consider specifically the spatial modality of gesture, taking a first step towards a strictly form-based gesture semantics. The systematic analysis of operations across gesture types results in a gesture typology, in which the dimensions of all constituent forms are defined; thus being open to computational application. The fundamental theoretical distinction of gesture form being non-equivalent to the mere physical form of the articulators (articulator form) is supported by an object-description study in an optical motion-capture system. The methods include operationalising three-dimensional gesture data, for example by a plugin for the video-annotation software Elan...|$|R
40|$|As {{pointed out}} by Richard Hamilton, 'commentaries on {{individual}} odes are arguably the most obvious need in Pindaric scholarship' (Bryn Mawr Classical Review 1999. 01. 01). My dissertation is a small step toward satisfying this need. The choice of the Third and Fourth Isthmians has been motivated {{by the lack of}} a thorough and upto-date commentary and by the fact that this pair of odes poses a number of interpretative problems with resonances throughout the entire epinician <b>corpus.</b> The <b>dissertation</b> opens with four essays that address the major problems besetting the interpretation of the two odes. The first, 'Isthmians 3 and 4 : One or Two Poems?', examines critically the arguments about {{the relationship between the two}} poems. Section two, 'Isthmians 3 and 4 : Imitation at the Symposium', argues that Isthmian 3 is an improvised piece imitating Isthmian 4. On the basis of evidence from Pindar and Bacchylides, I follow J. Strauss Clay in positing the symposium as the most likely performance setting of this poem. Section three, : Context and Performance of Short Epinician Odes', raises doubts about the now orthodox assumption that short epinician odes like Isthmian 3 were performed at the sites of the games and proposes plausible alternative scenarios. The last section, 'Isthmian 4 : and Performance of Pindar's Odes', takes cue from Pindar's reference to the topography of the sanctuary of Herakles at Thebes and the vivid account he gives of the sacrifices performed at the local festival of Herakleia (Isthm. 4. 61 - 6). After examining in extenso references to geographic and architectural landmarks in Greek poetry, I suggest that the nature of such descriptions is uninformative about the performance-setting and is often mimetic, i. e. aiming to evoke places in the mind of the audience rather than drawing attention to what they can see for themselves. My text follows the Teubner edition of Snell-Maehler. The deviations are minimal and are listed in the note preceding the text. The accompanying translation has no pretension for literary merit and is meant primarily to complement the text and the commentary. The purpose of the commentary is to provide a comprehensive exegesis, which may be useful both while reading the two odes from start to finish or merely consulting notes on individual lines and passages. The emphasis is on matters of literary, philological, historical, and linguistic significance. Metrical issues have been for the most part left out. Naturally in a work of this kind attempts to come up with new and original interpretations go hand in hand with assimilation and analysis of previous scholarship. Where I felt unable to shed any new light, I tried to provide ample bibliography on the question. As a rule, though, doxography for the sake of doxography has been avoided...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of multimedia enabled devices, particularly {{the incorporation of}} cameras in mobile phones, and the accelerated revolutions in the low cost storage devices, boosts the multimedia data production rate drastically. Witnessing such an iniquitousness of digital images and videos, the research community has been projecting the issue of its significant utilization and management. Stored in monumental multimedia corpora, digital data need to be retrieved and organized in an intelligent way, leaning on the rich semantics involved. The utilization of these image and video collections demands proficient image and video annotation and retrieval techniques. Recently, the multimedia research community is progressively veering its emphasis to the personalization of these media. The main impediment in the image and video analysis is the semantic gap, which is the discrepancy among a user’s high-level interpretation of an image and the video and the low level computational interpretation of it. Content-based image and video annotation systems are remarkably susceptible to the semantic gap due to their reliance on low-level visual features for delineating semantically rich image and video contents. However, {{the fact is that}} the visual similarity is not semantic similarity, so there is a demand to break through this dilemma through an alternative way. The semantic gap can be narrowed by counting high-level and user-generated information in the annotation. High-level descriptions of images and or videos are more proficient of capturing the semantic meaning of multimedia content, but it is not always applicable to collect this information. It is commonly agreed that the problem of high level semantic annotation of multimedia is still far from being answered. This dissertation puts forward approaches for intelligent multimedia semantic extraction for high level annotation. This dissertation intends to bridge the gap between the visual features and semantics. It proposes a framework for annotation enhancement and refinement for the object/concept annotated images and videos datasets. The entire theme is to first purify the datasets from noisy keyword and then expand the concepts lexically and commonsensical to fill the vocabulary and lexical gap to achieve high level semantics for the <b>corpus.</b> This <b>dissertation</b> also explored a novel approach for high level semantic (HLS) propagation through the images corpora. The HLS propagation takes the advantages of the semantic intensity (SI), which is the concept dominancy factor in the image and annotation based semantic similarity of the images. As we are aware of the fact that the image is the combination of various concepts and among the list of concepts some of them are more dominant then the other, while semantic similarity of the images are based on the SI and concept semantic similarity among the pair of images. Moreover, the HLS exploits the clustering techniques to group similar images, where a single effort of the human experts to assign high level semantic to a randomly selected image and propagate to other images through clustering. The investigation has been made on the LabelMe image and LabelMe video dataset. Experiments exhibit that the proposed approaches perform a noticeable improvement towards bridging the semantic gap and reveal that our proposed system outperforms the traditional systems...|$|R
40|$|Across species, {{increases}} {{in white matter}} volume outpace {{increases in}} gray-matter volume, but increases in gray- matter volume outpace increases {{in the size of}} the <b>corpus</b> callosum. This <b>dissertation</b> explores the hypothesis that this hyposcaling of the callosum stems from the impact of the conduction delays and cellular costs of the long- distance connections on normal developmental mechanisms. Neuroanatomy research to date has only indirectly examined this relation, using measures such as brain volume. The research in this dissertation uses diffusion tensor imaging to more directly measure the relation between the length of the interhemispheric connections and the degree of connectivity [...] the ratio of between-area connections to total projection neurons in the areas connected. Using tractography to detail the patterns of interhemispheric connectivity and to determine the length of the connections, and formulae based on histological results to estimate degree of connectivity, we show that, across normal young adult males, connection length is significantly negatively correlated with degree of connectivity in the anterior, posterior, and body of the callosum. Using the same methodology, in typically developing boys a significant relation between connection length and degree of connectivity was found only in the posterior of the callosum. The combined results indicate that the relation between connection length and degree of connectivity develops during childhood and adolescence. Children with autism are known to have enlarged brains during the first years of life. This is predicted to lead to decreased long-distance connectivity. To explore this prediction, neural networks which modeled inter- hemispheric interaction were grown at the rate of either typically developing children or children with autism. By 2 years of simulated age, the networks that modeled autistic growth showed a reduced reliance on long-distance connections, performance reductions, and reductions in structural connectivity. Using the same methodology as with the adults and children, the relation between connection length and degree of connectivity in adults with autism was examined. Connection length and degree of connectivity showed the typical negative relation, but with a reduced degree of connectivity in anterior regions [...] the locus of development during the period of maximal brain overgrowth, and where axon diameters are smalles...|$|R
40|$|Esta tese tem por objetivo analisar, em três romances irlandeses (The Gathering, de Anne Enright, The Blackwater Lightship, de Colm Tóibín e The Light of Evening, de Edna O‟Brien), como as protagonistas das obras percebem ou entendem suas famílias, tanto a partir do ponto de vista através do qual suas histórias são narradas, quanto através do modo como compreendem suas próprias gerações e as gerações de suas mães e avós. Através dessas percepções, procurou-se analisar também as alterações políticas e culturais pelas quais a Irlanda passou, ao longo do século XX. Esse período marca dois grandes acontecimentos históricos para o país: sua independência, em 1922, e seus anos de glória e crescimento econômico, iniciados por volta de 1990, com o chamado Tigre Celta, e que durou até 2008. A análise dos romances selecionados como corpus desta tese, de acordo com seus pontos de vista narrativos e os contextos histórico, político e {{cultural}} em que eles estão inseridos é também uma forma de analisar a contribuição que seus autores deram para nosso próprio entendimento da Irlanda enquanto nação. This {{doctoral dissertation}} {{has as its}} aim to analyse in three Irish novels (The Gathering, by Anne Enright, The Blackwater Lightship, by Colm Tóibín, and The Light of Evening, by Edna O‟Brien), how the female main protagonists of the novels perceive or understand their families, {{from the point of}} view through which their stories are narrated, as well as through the way they understand their own generation and those of their mothers and grandmothers. Through these perceptions the dissertation also tried to analyse the political and cultural transformation Ireland went through in the Twentieth Century. This period witnessed two great historical events for the country: its Independence in 1922, and its glorious years of economic development, which began around 1990, with the so called Celtic Tiger Years, and lasted until 2008. The analysis of the selected novels as the <b>corpus</b> of this <b>dissertation</b> according to their narrative points of view and the historical, political and cultural contexts in which they are set is also a way of analysing the contribution their authors gave to our own understanding of Ireland as a nation...|$|R

Cicero’s Philippics and Plutarch’s Life of Antony are the key components of this <b>corpus,</b> but this <b>dissertation</b> also encompasses writings about Antony by authors ranging from Propertius to Cassius Dio and covers the reception of this material in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Each chapter uses a metabiographical approach to examine a particular stylized persona that these authors project onto Antony. Chapter 1 investigates why authors invest Mark Antony with the attributes of a stage actor with a frequency rivaled only by similar treatments of later emperors like Caligula and Nero. Chapters 2 and 3 analyze the representation of Antony as a tyrant in Latin-language authors and Greek-language authors, respectively. Chapter 4 delineates the different ways that authors conceive of Antony’s love for Cleopatra {{as a type of}} madness. Chapter 5 uses Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar as a test case for applying the metabiographical methodology to a post-classical literary text and focuses on Shakespeare’s innovative deployment of Antony as a paragon of eloquence. By analyzing the manifestations these personae in different authors, I uncover new ways of understanding why competing portrayals of Antony take shape across time and across genre, and I map out the evolution of the idea of Mark Antony as it is manufactured over time in literature. I argue that the distortion of Antony that takes place in our sources is less an artifact of his rivals’ propaganda than a product of the historio-biographical process itself. I show how recurring biographical motifs exhibit subtle variations from author to author that signal alignments with particular rhetorical traditions, highlight key themes, or encode commentary upon the authors’ own cultural milieux. The principal contribution my project makes to our understanding of Greco-Roman literature is to demonstrate how Mark Antony is exploited as a malleable cultural touchstone. Recent work in metabiography has illuminated how Julius Caesar and Cleopatra perform this role as well, but our understanding of the processes that produced icons like these remains incomplete without a comparable study of Mark Antony. This dissertation fills this gap...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 In nature, {{evolution}} {{has given rise}} to the astonishing and wonderful diversity of organisms on this planet. In the laboratory, directed evolution can be a powerful technique to generate variants of a given protein with novel characteristics. The end products of the selection for desired traits from large combinatorial sets of mutants can also yield insight into protein structure and function. In both laboratory and nature, new mutations may be beneficial, but are often neutral or deleterious to overall protein function. One salient question that arises is the degree of tolerance of a protein to random amino acid change. A major part of the <b>corpus</b> of this <b>dissertation</b> addresses this question of protein tolerance to random change. This basic question is quantitatively defined as calculating the probability that a random amino acid replacement will lead to a protein's functional inactivation. Using the human DNA repair enzyme 3 -methyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), we develop a method to calculate inactivation probabilities from libraries of AAG mutants harboring random mutations throughout the gene. This analytical method is then applied to a range of diverse proteins. Remarkably, inactivation probabilities were observed to be similar among many proteins. To delineate the nature of tolerated mutations, 244 surviving AAG mutants were sequenced. Over 920 tolerated mutations were assembled into "substitutability indices" of each amino acid position across the entire AAG gene and mapped onto secondary and tertiary structures. I discuss the general factors determining the tolerability of amino acid substitutions within the same chapter. The next section of this dissertation describes the use of targeted random oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis to study the AAG enzyme active site. Selection for altered properties yield novel human DNA glycosylases with altered active sites. This study also reveals the degree of plasticity of the human AAG substrate recognition pocket and highlights the essential residues for substrate recognition and catalysis. This dissertation demonstrates a general approach to understanding proteins' tolerance to random mutations, and to creating novel DNA glycosylases. This work can serve as a stepping stone toward new enzymes remove select altered DNA bases for potential therapeutic and biotechnological applications...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{writing is}} an {{enterprise}} which integrates knowledge of different domains, i. e. the subject’s content, rhetoric, academic discourse, the genre they are writing, and research skills (Bartholomae, 1985; Read, et al. 2001; Johns, et al. 2006). The integration {{of these elements}} makes thesis writing a challenging endeavour, especially when facing it for first time, {{as is the case}} for undergraduates. Thesis writing at undergraduate level becomes more challenging when the writing is in a foreign language. In Mexico, undergraduate students are often required to write a thesis in English. However, researching writing at undergraduate level has sometimes been undervalued as undergraduates are considered to lack an authorial voice (Helms-Park & Stapleton, 2003; Stapleton, 2002). Based on the premise that every piece of writing contains voice (Ivanič, 1998), an element of authorial identity, I focus my research on exploring authorial identity. In my study I analyse how undergraduates, novice writers, express authorial identity across their dissertation chapters. I propose a framework for the analysis of authorial identity (Ivanič, 1998, Hyland, 2010, 2012) and communicative functions, and apply it to a <b>corpus</b> of undergraduate <b>dissertations.</b> The <b>corpus</b> consists of 30 dissertations that are written in English as Foreign Language in the area of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages and Applied Linguistics (TESOL/AL) and translation. The framework includes analysis of first person pronouns, passives, impersonal constructions, reporting verbs and evaluative adjectives, which were found to be keywords in these dissertations compared to a reference corpus (the British English 2006 or BE 06 corpus). The framework I propose will facilitate the analysis of the writer’s identity and communicative functions as they occur in each chapter of their dissertations. I also include a case study focussing on one participant with the aim of integrating the suggested framework with awareness and understanding of the participant’s self-presentation as a writer. I include some pedagogical implications for L 2 writing research, suggesting that students could be made aware of the full range of choices available in academic writing and how they project different authorial identities. I close my thesis by exemplifying the framework within my own case of authorial identity and with a reflection on the authorial identity of speakers of other languages in dissertation writing...|$|R

The three main specific objectives {{of this study are}} (a) to identify the structure of acknowledgements written by postgraduate students at the Faculty of Education UiTM, (b) to identify the obligatory and optional moves that help to realize the structure of those acknowledgements, and (c) to examine gender differences in the display of gratitude in those acknowledgements. A contextual analysis that involves qualitative and quantitative approaches were used for the study that involved collection and analysis of a <b>corpus</b> of masters <b>dissertation</b> acknowledgements (MDAs) written by Malay and Bumiputera postgraduate students at the Faculty of Education, Universiti Teknologi MARA. The following models were adopted as analysis models: Al-Ali's (2006 : 37) modified Generic Structure of English Dissertation Acknowledgements written by non-native Arab writers which was modified from Hyland's (2004 : 308) Generic Structure of Dissertation Acknowledgements; and Mingwei & Yajun's (2010 : 103 - 104) analysis of linguistic features in masters and PhD acknowledgements which was adopted from Hyland & Tse (2004). The findings of the study revealed that the acknowledgement structure of MDAs at the Faculty of Education UiTM has the same structure as the model by Al-Ali (2006). While maintaining the model by Al-Ali (2006), a modified generic structure of MDAs that is representative of the discourse community of postgraduate students at the Faculty of Education, UiTM is proposed. In the case of gender differences, {{the results of the study}} indicated that there are differences across gender in terms of the presence of the moves/steps in the structure of acknowledgement and linguistics patterns in the thanking acts and authorial choice. The results of this study proves that the acknowledgement is in itself a genre with a specific communicative purpose written based on the accepted norms of the society and the academic culture of a particular discourse community; and that it is vital that students are to be made aware of the writing conventions of this genre especially non-native speakers of the language as to aid their understanding of the writing processes and the workings of academic writing. This study recommends that future works should be done with a larger national corpus with special investigations into the patterns and variations of generic structure, linguistic features and grammatical structures across academic levels, race and ethnicities, as well as gender...|$|R
40|$|First and {{foremost}} this dissertation concerns itself with inclusive manners of environmental governance. In a broad sense, it addresses the science-politics interplay in environmental governance. It focuses upon two main issues: the expert-lay interplay and the inter-relation between activism and science. Particularly, the dissertation looks at how these relations {{take place within}} the MST (Movimento Sem Terra/Landless People’s Movement), {{which is one of}} the largest social movements in Latin America. During the last ten years, a fraction of this movement has transformed itself towards taking a more environmentalist stance. Such a change has come along with an increasing process of “expertification” of the movement and a renewed interest in the “democratization of science”. Within MST there is an important debate on how to include local and traditional knowledges in the production of “scientific facts”. To a large extent, the arguments and descriptions presented in this work are based upon an ethnographic research carried out by the author between January 2005 and September 2006. The dissertation includes collaborations with Doctor Roger Strand and Doctor Kjetil Rommetveit. The arguments presented here build upon theoretical approaches of science and technology studies as well as environmental studies (mainly sociology and anthropology). The thesis tries to integrate empirical and descriptive work with theoretical and normative reflection. The ethnographic descriptions show how the environmentalist fraction of MST has adopted, reinterpreted, contested and mobilized scientific images and claims, adapting them to MST’s political agenda. Furthermore, the dissertation presents some conceptual suggestions in the pursuit of more inclusive environmental governance. The arguments are organized around four main issues: 1) the social perceptions of science, identity and collective action; 2) trust in science and experts; 3) the constitution and social distribution of expertise; 4) inclusive environmental governance. These issues are investigated and discussed through the four papers that make up the <b>corpus</b> of the <b>dissertation.</b> In general terms, the dissertation concludes that the expert-lay interplay should be understood as deeply embedded in particular contexts of power relations. Categories such as “expert”, “science”, “ecology”, “lay”, “citizenship”, “transparency” or “democracy”, are given different meanings and uses by different actors, in accordance with particular contexts of action. Those categories are partly the result of power relations. But in part, they are also re-conceptualised and mobilized in new social struggles. They shape new realities of environmental governance in the global and local levels. Science and politics (in this case, science and environmental activism) are co-produced in complex and often unpredictable ways. In the pursuit of“real” inclusive environmental governance, empirical work on how this co-production takes place is needed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{critical}} reappraisals {{have undermined}} the coherence – and validity – {{of the principles}} defining modern art and artistic production. Traditional art historical categories, periodizations, sub-periodizations, even the very divisions modernism and postmodernism, while useful, are no longer sufficient to define {{a history of the}} artistic object, or artistic identity for the modern age. I propose that a biopolitical perspective, with a shift in focus away from the object and towards the artistic body restores, in part, a coherent narrative to a modern art history. This thesis sketches the contours of an artistic sub-category I have coined “bio-aesthetics” within the framework of biopolitics, drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito. I locate a set of clinical mechanisms within the domains of aesthetics, artistic perception, subjectivity and performativity. My primary thesis is that the drive toward embodiment, toward the referent, or perhaps more precisely toward the real, expressed in formalism’s zeal for medium specificity, and in the modern aesthetic project of grounding artistic experience within the somatic, was set into play by a clinical configuration that emerged from the eighteenth century’s laboratories and clinics, expounding a life science of bodies. The <b>corpus</b> of my <b>dissertation</b> focuses on four significant moments within an archaeological schema spanning the eighteenth to the late twentieth centuries. Each chapter focuses on significant historical materializations of the bio-aesthetic, and together form a historical progression from a biological corporealisation of the sensate, to the psycho-medical individualization of the artist subject, or perhaps, the clinical performer. My corpus begins with the eighteenth-century formalization of a somatically-based aesthetics, culminating in the aesthetics of Immanuel Kant. By separating the action of aesthetic contemplation from rational logos, Kant positioned aesthetic experience and artistic creativity in a place of peculiarity or pathology. I then trace the repercussions of bio-aestheticization both in the emergence of the flat picture plane as an index of the clinicalization of artistic visual consciousness, and in the concurrent psycho-medical conflation of artistic subjectivity with pathology in nineteenth-century texts on degeneracy. I conclude with the development, in the later part of the twentieth century, of a new modality of clinical performativity, taking up the self-identification of artists with a psycho-medical identity, and the embracing of medical themes and ordeals as artistic subjects. This collapse of a metaphoric position of aesthetic difference with an actual medical history and body is explored on two levels: first, in a consideration twentieth-century high-modernist criticism and in an examination of minimalist and performance-based works, including those of Beuys, Wilke, Morris and Gober. The irony that emerges from my study is that coherence is achieved within the heroic modernist pursuit of purity of medium and individual genius by a corresponding a master narrative of illness. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how grammatical {{functions in}} transitive sentences (i. e., `subject' and `direct object') are distributed in written Swedish discourse {{with respect to}} morphosyntactic as well as semantic and referential (i. e., prominence-based) information. It also investigates how assignment of grammatical functions during on-line comprehension of transitive sentences in Swedish is influenced by interactions between morphosyntactic and prominence-based information. In the dissertation, grammatical functions are assumed to express role-semantic (e. g., Actor and Undergoer) and discourse-pragmatic (e. g., Topic and Focus) functions of NP arguments. Grammatical functions correlate with prominence-based information {{that is associated with}} these functions (e. g., animacy and definiteness). Because of these correlations, both prominence-based and morphosyntactic information are assumed to serve as argument interpretation cues during on-line comprehension. These cues are utilized in a probabilistic fashion. The weightings, interplay and availability of them are reflected in their distribution in language use, as shown in <b>corpus</b> data. The <b>dissertation</b> investigates these assumptions by using various methods in a triangulating fashion. The first contribution of the dissertation is an ERP (event-related brain potentials) experiment that investigates the ERP response to grammatical function reanalysis, i. e., a revision of a tentative grammatical function assignment, during on-line comprehension of transitive sentences. Grammatical function reanalysis engenders a response that correlates with the (re-) assignment of thematic roles to the NP arguments. This suggests that the comprehension of grammatical functions involves assigning role-semantic functions to the NPs. The second contribution is a corpus study that investigates the distribution of prominence-based, verb-semantic and morphosyntactic features in transitive sentences in written discourse. The study finds that overt morphosyntactic information about grammatical functions is used more frequently when the grammatical functions cannot be determined on the basis of word order or animacy. This suggests that writers are inclined to accommodate the understanding of their recipients by more often providing formal markers of grammatical functions in potentially ambiguous sentences. The study also finds that prominence features and their interactions with verb-semantic features are systematically distributed across grammatical functions and therefore can predict these functions {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The third contribution consists of three computational models of incremental grammatical function assignment. These models are based upon the distribution of argument interpretation cues in written discourse. They predict processing difficulties during grammatical function assignment in terms of on-line change in the expectation of different grammatical function assignments over the presentation of sentence constituents. The most prominent model predictions are qualitatively consistent with reading times in a self-paced reading experiment of Swedish transitive sentences. These findings indicate that grammatical function assignment draws upon statistical regularities in the distribution of morphosyntactic and prominence-based information in language use. Processing difficulties in the comprehension of Swedish transitive sentences can therefore be predicted on the basis of corpus distributions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (DLitt (Ancient Studies. Biblical Languages)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Each {{language}} has some means or system of referring to participants. This {{system of reference}} includes a participant’s initial introduction, continuing reference to the participant, as well as reintroduction after some period of absence. A number of morphological, syntactic and pragmatic issues impinge upon the kinds of encoding {{used to refer to}} participants in various contexts. The primary concern {{of this study is to}} provide a cross-linguistic, discourse-functional description of the encoding of participants in Biblical Hebrew narrative. Our description is based on the analysis of a preliminary test corpus of Exod 1 - 12, which is then applied to our <b>dissertation</b> <b>corpus</b> of Gen 12 - 25. In order to narrow the scope of the project, the data considered in this dissertation will be limited to the corpora of Exod 1 - 12 and Gen 12 - 25. It will not consider embedded reported speeches, but instead focuses exclusively and exhaustively on the narrative proper of these two corpora. Dooley and Levinsohn (2001 : 112) have identified three basic linguistic functions a participant reference system must be capable of accomplishing: • Semantic: “identify the referents unambiguously, distinguishing them from other possible ones”. In other words, the reader must be able to track ‘who did what to whom’, • Processing: “overcome disruptions in the flow of information”, • Discourse-pragmatic: “signal the activation status and prominence of the referents or the actions they perform”. We propose that these three functions are not discrete categories, but represent a hierarchical entailment scheme. In other words, overencoding a participant to accomplish the processing function at the same time accomplishes a semantic function of identifying the participant. The study begins by providing a description of the default encoding based on the semantic and cognitive constraints present in various discourse contexts. Our methodology is to develop a set of default encoding principles based on the semantic function of participant reference which can account for as much of the attested data as possible. These default principles are also used to identify pragmatically-motivated departures from the default norms. The non-default encoding is construed as explicitly marking the presence of some linguistic feature. The non-default encoding data are then grouped based on the pragmatic effects they achieve, and are described in light of attested cross-linguistic principles. We claim that the processing function of participant reference is accomplished in Biblical Hebrew through the redundant relexicalization of agents. These redundant NPs have the pragmatic effect of segmenting the discourse into distinct developments. Next we describe the pragmatic use of referring expressions as accomplishing the discourse-pragmatic function of thematic highlighting. Finally, we describe participant encoding which exceeds that necessary for the processing function as accomplishing a second discourse-pragmatic function of cataphorically highlighting a following speech or event. The above-mentioned model is ultimately applied to Gen 27 to demonstrate its explanatory value for exposition of Biblical Hebrew narrative...|$|R
