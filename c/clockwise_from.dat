5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard. At each corner was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. <b>Clockwise</b> <b>from</b> north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E

5|$|Each game also {{features}} three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and award cash to whoever rings {{in with the}} right answer. The first determines who is interviewed first by the host, the second determines who starts round 1, and the third determines who starts round 4. Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits. Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> the contestant who began round 1.|$|E
5|$|Originally various {{buildings}} were {{built around the}} curtain wall. Moving <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> {{the entrance to the}} Inner Court, the shape of the 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on the curtain wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent {{to the site of the}} first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was probably also used as a cannon emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward is {{guarded by}} four large {{circular}} towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> the north-east, {{they were called}} Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors', Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer's Towers respectively. Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials {{in a similar fashion}} to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E

25|$|The Hoddle Grid is {{the layout}} of the streets in the centre of the {{original}} Melbourne City Centre. The grid was laid out in 1837 by Robert Hoddle. All major streets are one and half chains (99ft or 30m) in width, while all blocks are exactly 10 chains square (10 acres, 201m × 201m). It is one mile (1.6km) long by half a mile wide (0.80km). The grid's longest axis is oriented 70 degrees <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> true north, to align better with the course of the Yarra River. The majority of Melbourne is oriented at 8 degrees <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> true north–noting that magnetic north was 8° 3' E in 1900, increasing to 11° 42' E in 2009. It covers the area from Flinders Street to Queen Victoria Market, and from Spencer Street to Spring Street.|$|E
25|$|These radials are {{supplemented}} by two-digit codes which are routes {{that may be}} slightly less important, but may still be classified as trunk routes, although many of these routes have {{lost a lot of}} their significance due to motorway bypasses, or the upgrading of other A-roads. These routes are not all centred on London, but as far as possible follow the general principle that their number locates them radially <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> the associated single digit route. For example, the A10 (London to King's Lynn) is the first main route <b>clockwise</b> <b>from</b> the A1, the A11 (London to Norwich) is the next, then the A12 (London to Great Yarmouth) and the A13 (London to Shoeburyness); the next radial is the A2, followed by the A20 (London to Dover), and so on. These roads have been numbered either outwards from or clockwise around their respective hubs, depending on their alignment.|$|E

Also the center-field scoreboard was atop the right-field wall and the Giants Pavilion Building were two separate buildings.|$|E
