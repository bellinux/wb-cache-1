5|$|During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed {{a lawsuit}} against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the {{previous}} week. Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled First Contact. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published Contact and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation.

5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for <b>compensatory</b> <b>damages</b> for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

50|$|In view of Abramowicz's {{prominent}} {{activity in}} the Lithuanian Calvinist synod {{at a time of}} increased Counter-Reformation in the Commonwealth, his ability to retain high offices, was taken as sign of King Władysław's faith in his leadership. The confidence proved particularly well-founded during the 1645 event known as the Trubchevsk incident (incydent trubecki), as Lithuanian nobles rose in opposition to the king's treaty with Russia, which signed away the fortified border town of Trubchevsk. The king sent Abramowicz {{at the head of a}} company of King's Guards to restore order and oversee the territorial transfer. In the aftermath, the Lithuanian Tribunal lodged a high complaint against Abramowicz for illegal expropriation of property and sentenced him to loss of honor, banishment and a high <b>compensatory</b> <b>damage.</b> The sentences were never carried out due to the intervention of the king, who rewarded Abramowicz's loyalty with advancement to the Trakai Voivodeship.|$|R

40|$|In many states, legislatures have {{mandated}} juryless fact-finding {{in common}} law– based civil cases by imposing <b>compensatory</b> <b>damage</b> caps that effectively lessen the jury’s traditional and historic role as injury valuator. The {{primary purpose of}} most caps was to reign in “excessive” civil jury verdicts, which allegedly caused “skyrocketing” medical malpractice insurance premiums and litigation costs. But no legislatively imposed cap is triggered by a preliminary finding of excessiveness. Trial judges have no authority to determine whether application of a cap is just or fair to the (often) severely injured plaintiff. Despite a shared interpretive methodology {{with regards to the}} nature and scope of civil jury trial rights, states sharply disagree on the constitutionality of caps. This split does not lie in any textual interpretation of the type of civil jury trial right provided in state constitutions, for disagreement exists even among states with identical clauses. This Article explores juryless fact-finding in civil cases by turning to Sixth Amendment jurisprudence on mandatory criminal sentencing guidelines. At first blush, <b>compensatory</b> <b>damage</b> caps appear to have little in common with criminal sentencing. Caps reduce a jury’s damage findings to a fixed amount. Sentencing guidelines designated which facts were necessary to support a particular sentence. Yet, both remove the jury or ignore the jury’s factual findings during a significant part of a civil case: the civil jury is removed or ignored during the “damages” phase of a case and the criminal jury is removed or ignored during the “punishment” phase of a case. Thus certain caps and certain mandatory guidelines sentencing schemes lessened the jury’s role as fact-finder and intruded on the jury’s verdict or decree. This Article explores both as parallel mandates of juryless fact-finding in civil and criminal cases. Sixth Amendment jurisprudence has recently rejected mandatory juryless factfinding for purposes of fixing punishment in criminal cases. Mandatory guidelines that required either reconsideration of a jury’s factual findings or consideration of new facts were initially allowed on the theory that legislatures had authority to designate certain facts in a criminal case as “elements” of the offense that required a jury. Other facts could be designated “enhancements” to the punishment and did not require a jury. This grant of legislative authority was short lived. The Court has recently held that a criminal jury is required to find any fact that increases the maximum and minimum punishment. In other words, a jury is required to make factual findings that determine the high and low end of a criminal sentence regardless of whether a fact is labeled an element or an enhancement. Moreover, such factual findings are enforceable in other stages of the criminal case. Seventh Amendment jurisprudence remains undeveloped on the issue of mandated juryless fact-finding in civil cases, but the Sixth Amendment offers three lessons about common law criminal juries that arguably should apply in the civil context. First, modern procedures cannot significantly alter certain common law characteristics of the jury trial right. Second, mandatory removal of the jury as the primary fact-finder was not authorized in common law cases. Third, a common law jury’s factual determinations were fully enforceable unless exceptional circumstances were presented. This Article applies these lessons to <b>compensatory</b> <b>damage</b> caps. This Article urges adoption of cap alternatives that encourage individual review upon necessity. Such alternatives should also advance a state’s dual interests to protect both civilly liable defendants from unreasonably high awards and severely injured plaintiffs from unreasonably low awards...|$|R
