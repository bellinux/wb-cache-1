30|$|There {{could be}} a variety of {{heterogeneous}} IoT devices (e.g., smart meters, smart inverters) clustered in a microgrid which represent extensive entry points and communication links that are unintentionally exposed to potential attackers. Without an inherent cybersecurity design, intra-microgrid communications are vulnerable to a multitude of <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents.</b> For example, attackers are likely to compromise smart meters they can easy access for discovering private power consumption profiles (e.g., by installing malware) [49]. <b>Cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> (e.g., malware infection, denial-of-service) originated in a compromised IoT device can quickly propagate and overwhelm the entire microgrid communication and control system due primarily to their ubiquitous connectivity. Consequently, traditional solutions designed for securing Internet services are deemed inadequate for protecting microgrid communications from potential <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents.</b> The diverse properties of hardware components and software applications further complicate the design and implementation of microgrid-specific cybersecurity enhancement solutions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Information is a {{critical}} asset on which all modern organizations depend to meet their mission objectives. Military organizations, in particular, have embedded Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) into their core mission processes {{as a means to}} increase their operational efficiency, exploit automation, improve decision quality, and enable real-time situational awareness. However, an extreme dependence upon ICT results in an environment where a <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> can result in severe mission degradation, or possibly failure, with catastrophic consequences to life, limb, and property. In this paper, we present the initial results of an experiment designed to measure the utility of a <b>Cyber</b> <b>Incident</b> Mission Impact Assessment (CIMIA) notification process. CIMIA is focused upon minimizing the consequences following an information incident by maintaining real-time situational awareness of mission critical resources so appropriate contingency actions can be taken in a timely manner to assure mission success. The results of the experiment show that implementing a CIMIA notification process significantly reduced the response time required for subjects to recognize and take proper contingency measures. The research confirms that timely and relevant notification following a <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> is an essential element of mission assurance.

A questionnaire was sent to state chief information officers and/or state chief information security officers to determine current capability and procedures for responding to a national cybersecurity incident. Nineteen states replied with 227 responses relating to information sharing between states and the federal government; use of established cybersecurity event and response definitions, coordination and control mechanisms, and terms; use of risk-based approaches to <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> planning, including remediation based on workflows and procedures; establishment of thresholds when predefined boundaries are crossed; and instigation of varying courses of action. As a result of the survey, the author recommends increasing knowledge and information flow between state and federal agencies regarding national cyber incidents; the establishment of regional cybersecurity hubs throughout the nation; and the creation of a national <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> teleconferencing network and prearranged protocols for situational awareness and communication of courses of action following a cybersecurity incident.

There is {{a large body of}} research on cyber conflict, but there is very little quantitative analysis to support the theories or to assist in predicting future use of cyber operations. Using a logistic regression analysis, this thesis studies cyber conflicts between dyadic rivals from 2001 to 2011 to answer under what conditions <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> occur between dyadic rivals in the past in the hopes to better analyze and predict future <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents.</b> The data demonstrate that the geographic proximity between dyads increases the probability of a <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> occurring while any or both of the dyads holds membership in NATO causes a decrease in the probability that cyber operations occur between dyadic rivals.

30|$|A {{key problem}} in {{cyberattack}} forecasting with unconventional signals {{is that not}} all signals produce values {{on a regular basis}} since many are event driven. This adds onto the potential errors due to incorrect sensor readings, unavailability of observation for a period of time, or problems in the data processing pipeline. An intelligent signal imputation method is needed to deal with signal sources that do not report values for a significant period of time. In addition, these signals may have different significant lags i.e. time elapsed between the observed public data to the <b>cyber</b> <b>incident.</b> A systematic way to capture the diverse significant lags with imputed signal values is non-trivial and requires a system-level design. Adding more to the challenge, successful <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> are expected to be rare events for a reasonably protected organization, resulting in imbalanced data. Imbalanced data can lead to biased or inaccurate models where the predictive power of unconventional signals is not captured. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of all these problems individually and as an integrated system. The overall system is tested using the <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> data provided by an anonymized company nicknamed K 9.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of Web technologies has driven a broad implementation of network-based {{applications in the}} financial industry, as well as resulted {{in a variety of}} cyber risks throughout the domain. As one of the risk management solutions, cybersecurity insurance (CI) is an alternative solution for dealing with cybersecurity risk in the financial industry by transferring some of the risk burden to an insurance company. It has become a popular approach for compensating some of the financial loses of cybersecurity events. ^ However, the cost of cybersecurity insurance also leads to a heavy financial burden, which also affects risk mitigations when it is applied. The major problem is the difficulty of maximizing insurance returns by selecting insured items in terms of their demands under the certain financial budget. ^ The problem of the research is to find an adaptive approach for financial service institutions to achieve an efficient and effective cybersecurity risks transfer by using cybersecurity insurance under a firm financial budget. The difficulties address few aspects, including understanding <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents</b> and their threats levels, cognizing the relationships between <b>cyber</b> <b>incidents,</b> cybersecurity insurance items, and making decisions on selecting insurance items considering both financial costs and insurance demands. ^ To address the issues above, this dissertation concentrates on the problem of maximizing the cybersecurity insurance returns in terms of the available funds. ^ The main contributions of this work are threefold; First, we perform feasibility study starting with proposing a novel secure big data <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> analytics framework based on the survey, which is designed to produce a strategy map for implementing cybersecurity insurance under a certain financial constraint; second, we develop an approach using <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> classification for ontology-based knowledge representation, which is supported by semantic <b>cyber</b> <b>incident</b> classification model; finally, we create a new approach of risk prediction model based on decision tree method for information classification. ^ The research solves the problem of cybersecurity insurance plan generation by developing a cost reduction strategy with Greedy algorithm run through two rounds of greedy to obtain cost effective plan with higher cyber risk weight. We implement experimental evaluations to prove the effectiveness and performances and the results show that our proposed framework and models are feasible for practical deployments. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, the United States {{government}} {{declared a}} cyber attack as equal to {{an act of}} war, punishable with conventional military means. Cyber operations, cyber crime, {{and other forms of}} cyber activities directed by one state against another are now considered part of the normal relations range of combat and conflict, and the rising fear of cyber conflict has brought about a reorientation of military affairs. What is the reality of this threat? Is it actual or inflated, fear or fact-based?

40|$|Use of {{automatic}} <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms (AIDA) in advanced freeway management systems has been sporadic and scarce. The current study investigates {{the causes of}} such limited implementation. A survey was carried out among the system managers, operators and end users, {{as well as the}} decision makers who set the operational policies and the priorities for future system enhancements. The survey responses point to a general consensus that the unacceptably high rates of false alarms generated by available <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms is the major deterrent. This study not only provides an understanding of the causes of the limited implementation of <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms, but also allows a direct comparison between the conventional <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> technologies and automatic <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> technology {{on the basis of their}} performance. Despite the lackluster performance of AIDA to date, 90 % of the survey respondents feel that the current methods of <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> are insufficient either at present (70 %) or will be so in the future (20 %). This finding alone motivates a need to redouble research efforts aimed at developing robust and accurate automatic detection methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to improve the reliability of automatic freeway <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> by applying the fuzzy logic system and neural networks. A Fuzzy Logic Incident Patrol System (FLIPS) is proposed to combine a fuzzy logic system and the learning capabilities of neural networks to form a connectionist model. The proposed system can be constructed automatically from training examples to find the optimum input/output term sets, input/output membership functions, and fuzzy logic rules. ^ The output of FLIPS is an <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> index which represents the possibility of an incident. These continuous indices can be sent to a freeway traffic operations center for further analysis. One example of such further analysis is the conversion of the continuous incident index value into a binary value predicting the absence or presence of an incident. The Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Threshold System (FLATS) is developed for this purpose. The FLATS produces an adaptive threshold for the conversion task based on the current <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> index provided by FLIPS. FLATS itself is also a fuzzy logic system with a recurrent neural network structure. Therefore, the threshold serves both as input and output parameters for FLATS. Like FLIPS, the FLATS can also be generated automatically from training examples. ^ In total, four artificial intelligence <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> models have been developed to evaluate the benefits of the proposed integrated learning process and adaptive threshold technique. The evaluation results show that the integrated learning process and adaptive threshold technique can significantly improve <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> performance. The FLATS-I, which incorporates proposed integrated learning process and adaptive threshold technique, exhibits superior <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> performance. ^ Finally, the research conducted comparisons of the FLATS-I with conventional <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms (i. e., the McMaster algorithm, the California algorithm, and the filtering technique) using the same incident database collected in Toronto, Canada. The evaluation results indicate that the FLATS-I provides promising improvements in the <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> and the persistence check technique used in the McMaster algorithm may not be an effective method to improve <b>incident</b> <b>detection.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} paper investigates a hybrid model using logistic regression with a wavelet-based feature extraction for detecting traffic incidents. A logistic regression model is suitable when the outcome can take {{only a limited}} number of values. For traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection,</b> the outcome is limited to only two values, the presence or absence of an incident. The logistic regression model used in this study is a generalized linear model (GLM) with a binomial response and a logit link function. This paper presents a framework to use logistic regression and wavelet-based feature extraction for traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection.</b> It investigates the effect of preprocessing data on the performance of <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> models. Results of this study indicate that logistic regression along with wavelet based feature extraction can be used effectively for <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> by balancing the <b>incident</b> <b>detection</b> rate and the false alarm rate according to need. Logistic regression on raw data resulted in a maximum detection rate of 95. 4 % at the cost of 14. 5 % false alarm rate. Whereas the hybrid model achieved a maximum detection rate of 98. 78 % at the expense of 6. 5 % false alarm rate. Results indicate that the proposed approach is practical and efficient; with future improvements in the proposed technique, it will make an effective tool for traffic <b>incident</b> <b>detection...</b>|$|R
