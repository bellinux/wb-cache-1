40|$|It is {{well known}} in the art that metal tubes used in heat {{transfer}} devices are susceptible to wear, erosion and other degradations which may create weaknesses or other potential failure points. One typical prior art method to determine the cause of damage to a tube involves making a circumferential cut on the tube wall and removing the entire section of the tube having a damaged portion thereon. This method is useful where a straight length portion of the tube has been affected. However, access to more constricted areas and removal of relatively large sections of tubing is limited where the cutting procedure is performed from the interior of the tube. A tube <b>cutter</b> <b>tool</b> is insertable into a tube for cutting a coupon from a damaged site on the exterior of the tube. Prior to using the tool, the damaged site is first located from the interior of the tube using a multi-coil pancake eddy current test probe. The damage site is then marked.

A topological space describing the swept volume will be built as a stratified manifold with corners. Singularities of the variety are loci of points where the Jacobian of the manifold has lower rank than maximal. It is shown that varieties appearing inside the manifold representing the removed material are due to a lower degree strata of the Jacobian.

40|$|In this paper, {{sequences}} of six human tyrosinase, retrieved from Swiss Prot database are analyzed and characterized using In silico tools. Primary structure analysis shows {{that most of}} the tyrosinase are hydrophobic in nature due to the high content of non-polar residues. The presence of cysteines in the most of the tyrosinases sequences infer that these proteins may form disulphide (SS) bonds, which are regarded as a positive factor for stability. The aliphatic index computed by Ex-Pasy’s ProtParam infers that tyrosinases may be thermolabile {{for a wide range of}} temperature. Secondary structure analysis shows that some of the tyrosinases have predominant α-helical structures and rest of the tyrosinases have mixed secondary structure. The very high coil structural content of most of the sequences is due to the rich content of more flexible glycine and hydrophobic proline amino acids. Proline has a special property of creating kinks in polypeptide chains and disrupting ordered secondary structure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a system development that extends haptic modeling {{to a number}} of key aspects in product development. Since haptic modeling has been developed based on physical laws, it is anticipated that a natural link between the virtual world and practical applications can be established based on haptic interaction. In the proposed system, a haptic device is used as the central mechanism for reverse engineering, shape modeling, real time mechanical property analysis, machining tool path planning and coordinate measuring machine (CMM) tolerance inspection path planning. With all these features in a single haptic system, it is possible to construct a three dimensional part by either haptic shape modeling or reverse engineering, then performing real-time mechanical property analysis in which the stiffness of a part can be felt and intuitively evaluated by the user, or generating collision free <b>cutter</b> <b>tool</b> path and CMM tolerance inspection path.

30|$|Online {{assessment}} of {{remaining useful life}} (RUL) of a system or device has been widely studied for performance reliability, production safety, system conditional maintenance, and decision in remanufacturing engineering. However, there is no consistency framework to solve the RUL recursive estimation for the complex degenerate systems/device. In this paper, state space model (SSM) with Bayesian online estimation expounded from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm is presented in order to derive the optimal Bayesian estimation. In the context of nonlinear & non-Gaussian dynamic systems, SMC (also named particle filter, PF) is quite capable of performing filtering and RUL assessment recursively. The underlying deterioration of a system/device {{is seen as a}} stochastic process with continuous, nonreversible degrading. The state of the deterioration tendency is filtered and predicted with updating observations through the SMC procedure. The corresponding remaining useful life of the system/device is estimated based on the state degradation and a predefined threshold of the failure with two-sided criterion. The paper presents an application on a milling machine for <b>cutter</b> <b>tool</b> RUL assessment by applying the above proposed methodology. The example shows the promising results and the effectiveness of SSM and SMC online {{assessment of}} RUL.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of free-form machining, CAM {{software}} offers various modes of tool-path gen- eration, depending on the geometry of the surface to be machined. Manufactured surface quality results from the choice of machining strategy and machining parameters.

The 3 D surface roughness parameter is therefore defined according to both an influential machining strat- egy parameter and the surface description.
