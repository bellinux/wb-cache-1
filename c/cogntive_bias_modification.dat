40|$|Objective: In alcohol-dependent patients, alcohol cues evoke {{increased}} activation in mesolimbic brain areas, such as {{the nucleus}} accumbens and the amygdala. Moreover, patients show an alcohol approach bias, a tendency to more quickly approach than avoid alcohol cues. Cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training, which aims to retrain approach biases, {{has been shown to}} reduce alcohol craving and relapse rates. The authors investigated effects of this training on cue reactivity in alcohol-dependent patients. Method: In a double-blind randomized design, 32 abstinent alcohol-dependent patients received either <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training or sham training. Both trainings consisted of six sessions of the joystick approach-avoidance task; the <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training entailed pushing away 90 % of alcohol cues and 10 % of soft drink cues, whereas this ratio was 50 / 50 in the sham training. Alcohol cue reactivity was measured with functional MRI before and after training. Results: Before training, alcohol cue-evoked activation was observed in the amygdala bilaterally, {{as well as in the}} right nucleus accumbens, although here it fell short of significance. Activation in the amygdala correlated with craving and arousal ratings of alcohol stimuli; correlations in the nucleus accumbens again fell short of significance. After training, the <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> group showed greater reductions in cue-evoked activation in the amygdala bilaterally and in behavioral arousal ratings of alcohol pictures, compared with the sham training group. Decreases in right amygdala activity correlated with decreases in craving in the <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> but not the sham training group. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> affects alcohol cue-induced mesolimbic brain activity. Reductions in neural reactivity may be a key underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effectiveness of this training...|$|R

40|$|Background: The core {{symptoms}} of bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are recurrent episodes of binge eating. Despite negative {{psychological and physical}} consequences, BN/BED patients show uncontrollable approach tendencies towards food. This cognitive bias occurs {{at an early stage}} of information processing. Cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> (CBM) directly targets such biases and {{has been shown to be}} effective in treating several mental disorders. In alcohol addiction, automatic action tendencies towards alcohol cues and relapse rates were successfully reduced by a specific form of CBM, termed approach <b>bias</b> <b>modification.</b> Based on these findings and data from a proof-of-concept study in people with high levels of food craving, CBM is considered a promising new treatment approach for BN/BED. Given the similarities between BN/BED and addictive disorders, the rationale for using approach <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> appears to be particularly strong. The aim of the present study is to examine whether, compared to a sham training, computerised approach <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> (10 sessions) can reduce binge-eating episodes in BN/BED patients from pre-treatment to follow-up. Additionally, we will investigate whether this CBM programme also reduces global eating disorder psychopathology, trait and cue-elicited food craving, food intake as well as approach and attentional bias towards visual food cues. Treatment acceptance will be determined by attrition rates and responses on a feedback form. Methods This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group superiority trial with two parallel arms. A total of 54 BN/BED patients will be recruited. Approach bias towards food will be retrained by a computer task adopting an implicit learning paradigm. Patients in the control condition (sham) will conduct a similar task but will not be trained to avoid food cues. Methods: against bias include public registration, randomisation by a central study office, standardisation of the treatments and blinding of assessors. Furthermore, the session number and duration will be equivalent in the two conditions. Discussion: This is the first registered randomised controlled trial of approach <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> in a clinical BN/BED sample. Results from this study will provide an indication of the efficacy of approach <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training for BN/BED and the potential mechanisms of action underlying this treatment.

40|$|Introduction: Attentional bias, the {{tendency}} {{that a person}} has to drive or maintain attention to a specific class of stimuli, may {{play an important role}} in the etiology and persistence of mental disorders. Attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> has been studied as a form of additional treatment related to automatic processing. Objectives: This systematic literature review compared and discussed methods, evidence of success and potential clinical applications of studies about attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> (ABM) using a visual probe task. Methods: The Web of Knowledge, PubMed and PsycInfo were searched using the keywords attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification,</b> attentional <b>bias</b> manipulation and attentional bias training. We selected empirical studies about ABM training using a visual probe task written in English and published between 2002 and 2014. Results: Fifty-seven studies met inclusion criteria. Most (78 %) succeeded in training attention in the predicted direction, and in 71 % results were generalized to other measures correlated with the symptoms. Conclusions: ABM has potential clinical utility, but to standardize methods and maximize applicability, future studies should include clinical samples and be based on findings of studies about its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> (ABM) {{represents}} {{one of a number}} of cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> techniques which are beginning to show promise as therapeutic interventions for emotional pathology. Numerous studies with both clinical and non-clinical populations have now demonstrated that ABM can reduce emotional vulnerability. However, some recent studies have failed to achieve change in either selective attention or emotional vulnerability using ABM methodologies, including a recent randomised controlled trial by Carlbring et al. Some have sought to represent such absence of evidence as a sound basis not to further pursue ABM as an online intervention. While these findings obviously raise questions about the specific conditions under which ABM procedures will produce therapeutic benefits, we suggest that the failure of some studies to modify selective attention does not challenge the theoretical and empirical basis of ABM. The present paper seeks to put these ABM failure s in perspective within the broader context of attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> research. In doing so it is apparent that the current findings and future prospects of ABM are in fact very promising, suggesting that more research in this area is warranted, not less...|$|R

The effect of computerised imagery-based cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> on positive affect, vividness of positive prospective imagery and interpretation biases in older adults was measured. 77 older adults received 4 weeks (12 sessions) of imagery cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> or a control condition.

Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no difference between the training groups in negative interpretation bias.

Attentional retraining as cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> is predicated on the observed attentional bias evident in psychopathology. The most common task used to retrain attention in anxiety is the dot-probe task developed originally by Macleod et al. (1986). In this task two stimuli are briefly presented on screen. One of the stimuli is emotionally salient (a drug cue or threat cue) and the other is neutral. Stimuli (usually words or images) are presented for about 500 milliseconds and then one of the stimuli is replaced by a probe to which the participant must respond. Required responses are usually to indicate what side of the screen the probe is on or to indicate which direction the probe (an arrow in this case) is pointing. The attentional bias is indicated by the difference in reaction time to the probe after it replaces a salient cue versus the reaction time to respond to a cue that replaces the neutral cue. Usually, the anxious participant will be faster in responding to probes replacing salient stimuli than those replacing neutral stimuli. This suggests their attention was drawn preferentially by the previously presented salient stimuli.|$|R

40|$|Adolescence is a {{vulnerable}} {{time for the}} onset of depression. Recent evidence from adult studies suggests not only that negative attention biases are correlated with symptoms of depression, but that reducing negative attention biases through training can in turn reduce symptomology. The role and plasticity of attention biases in adolescent depression, however, remains unclear. This study examines the association between symptoms of depression and attention biases, and whether such biases are modifiable, in a community sample of adolescents. We report data from 105 adolescents aged 13 – 17 who completed a dot-probe measure of attention bias before and after a single session of visual search-based cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training. This is the first study to find a significant association between negative attention biases and increased symptoms of depression in a community sample of adolescents. Contrary to expectations, {{we were unable to}} manipulate attention biases using a previously successful cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> task. There were no significant effects of the training on positive affect and only modest effects of the training, identified in post-hoc analyses, were observed on negative affect. Our data replicate those from the adult literature, which suggest that adolescent depression is a disorder associated with negative attention biases, although we were unable to modify attention biases in our study. We identify numerous parameters of our methodology which may explain these null training effects, and which could be addressed in future cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> studies of adolescent depression...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Negative attentional biases {{are thought}} to {{increase}} the risk of recurrence in depression, suggesting that reduction of such biases may be a plausible strategy in the secondary prevention of the illness. However, no previous study has tested whether reducing negative attentional bias causally affects risk factors for depressive recurrence. The current experimental medicine study reports the effects of a computerized attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> (ABM) procedure on intermediate measures of the risk of depressive recurrence (residual depressive symptoms and the cortisol awakening response) in patients with recurrent depression. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with at least two previous episodes of depression who were currently in remission were randomized to receive either an active (positive) or placebo computer-based ABM regime. The ABM regime presented either pictures of faces or words. Residual depressive symptoms, measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the cortisol awakening response were measured immediately before and after completion of the <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> and then again after 4 weeks' follow-up. RESULTS: Positive, face-based ABM reduced both measures of recurrence risk (Beck Depression Inventory and cortisol awakening response).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{pattern of}} attentional bias for {{threatening}} information {{is thought to}} be involved in the etiology of anxiety. Consistent with this idea, cognitive training techniques directly targeting such patterns of biased attention have been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety. Research seeking to establish the neurologic underpinnings of change in the attentional bias for threat have implicated, but not confirmed, the role of lateral prefrontal regions. METHODS: The current study sought to confirm experimentally the causal role of lateral prefrontal areas in the <b>modification</b> of attentional <b>bias</b> by delivering targeted cortical stimulation during attention <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training to assess the consequent effects on attentional bias change. While completing either an "attend threat" or "avoid threat" attention <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> task, 77 volunteers (17 - 22 per group) received either active transcranial direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or a sham stimulation control condition. RESULTS: Participants receiving active stimulation showed greater evidence of attentional bias acquisition in the targeted direction (toward or away from threat) compared with participants in the sham stimulation condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that increasing activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex leads to greater evidence of attention <b>bias</b> <b>modification.</b> This evidence confirms the role of these areas in facilitating change in the allocation of attention to threat. We believe this study provides a critical step in the translation of neuroimaging findings to novel neuromodulatory interventions capable of enhancing the treatment of emotional pathology...|$|R

In other words, over the three experiments, negative emotional response due to failure in an apparently easy (but actually difficult) cognitive test was modified as expected only when training involved both content related to achievement threat and benign appraisals for failure.

40|$|Background: Attentional {{bias toward}} sleep-related {{information}} {{is believed to}} {{play a key role}} in insomnia. If attentional bias is indeed of importance, changing this bias should then in turn have effects on insomnia complaints. In this double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial we investigated the efficacy of attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training in the treatment of insomnia. Method: We administered baseline, post-test, and one-week follow-up measurements of insomnia severity, sleep-related worry, depression, and anxiety. Participants meeting DSM- 5 criteria for insomnia were randomized into an attentional bias training group (n = 67) or a placebo training group (n = 70). Both groups received eight training sessions over the course of two weeks. All participants kept a sleep diary for four consecutive weeks (one week before until one week after the training sessions). Results: There was no additional benefit for the attentional bias training over the placebo training on sleep-related indices/outcome measures. Conclusions: The absence of the effect may be explained by the fact that there was neither attentional bias at baseline nor any reduction in the bias after the training. Either way, this study gives no support for attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training as a stand-alone intervention for ameliorating insomnia complaints...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{information}} processing models {{of anxiety and}} depression, we investigated the efficacy of multiple sessions of online attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training to reduce attentional bias and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and to increase emotional resilience in youth. Unselected adolescents (N =  340, age: 11 – 18 years) were randomly allocated to eight sessions of a dot-probe, or a visual search-based attentional training, or one of two corresponding placebo control conditions. Cognitive and emotional measures were assessed pre- and post-training; emotional outcome measures also at three, six and twelve months follow-up. Only visual search training enhanced attention for positive information, and this effect was stronger for participants who completed more training sessions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression reduced, whereas emotional resilience improved. However, these effects were not especially pronounced in the active conditions. Thus, this large-scale randomized controlled study provided no support for {{the efficacy of the}} current online attentional <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> training as a preventive intervention to reduce symptoms of anxiety or depression or to increase emotional resilience in unselected adolescents. However, the absence of biased attention related to symptomatology at baseline, and the large drop-out rates at follow-up preclude strong conclusions...|$|R

Individuals assigned to the AAT training condition evidenced significantly greater reductions in approach bias relative to those in the sham condition (p[*] [*] 0. 41); however, higher levels of approach bias at baseline were associated with greater approach bias reduction over time irrespective of condition (p[*]<[*]. 001). Consistent with hypothesis, the reduction in approach bias during the intervention period was significantly related to the number of days abstinent following the quit attempt (p[*]=[*]. 033).

40|$|Two {{interpretation}} <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> experiments {{found that}} mental imagery vs. verbal processing of positive material have differential emotional effects. In Experiment 1, participants {{were instructed to}} imagine positively resolved auditory descriptions or {{to listen to the}} same events while thinking about their verbal meaning.

An emotional vulnerability test showed that imagery (relative to the verbal condition) protected against a later negative mood induction. Experiment 2 created 2 new verbal conditions aimed to increase or reduce verbal comparisons. Results suggest making unfavorable comparisons with the highly positive material might be partially responsible for the inferiority of the verbal condition in Experiment 1. The findings demonstrate that imagery can {{play a key role in}} cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> procedures and thus that task instructions are crucial.

[...] Studies have thus far shown a greater effect of CBMT on anxiety when trials are conducted in a clinic than when conducted at home. According to a recent meta-analysis focusing on the clinical impact of Attention <b>bias</b> <b>Modification</b> (ABM) for alleviating Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), ABM produces a small but significant reduction in SAD symptoms (g = 0.27), reactivity to speech challenge (g = 0.46), and attentional bias for threat (g = 0.30). These effects were moderated by characteristics of the ABM procedure, the design of the study, and trait anxiety at baseline. However, effects on secondary symptoms (g = 0.09) and SAD symptoms at 4-month follow-up (g = 0.09) were not significant. Although there was no indication of significant publication bias, the authors identified that quality of the studies was substandard and wedged the effect sizes. From a clinical point of view, these findings imply that ABM is not yet ready for wide-scale dissemination as a treatment for SAD in routine care.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} found that {{attention}} training works through an improvement in the ability to disengage attention from threatening cues. Moreover, it has also been evidenced that attention <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> is related to changes in activation of the prefrontal cortex to emotional stimuli. Accordingly, a recent study demonstrated that attentional bias for threat among individuals with anxiety disorders may be reduced via the application of neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct-current stimulation over the dorsolateral part of the left prefrontal cortex.|$|R

She is also working with Tom McAdams using the “Children of Twins” approach to investigate the transmission of anxiety and depression from parents to children. Her molecular work currently focuses on two projects exploring the role of specific genetic markers in response to psychological therapies, including cognitive-behaviour therapy for child anxiety and exposure therapy for adult phobias. Regarding cognitive biases, she {{is currently working on}} attention <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> in child anxiety.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Computerized {{cognitive}} <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> {{for social}} anxiety disorder has in several well conducted trials shown great promise {{with as many as}} 72 % no longer fulfilling diagnostic criteria after a 4 [*]week training program. To test if the same program can be transferred from a clinical setting to an internet delivered home based treatment the authors conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Methods After a diagnostic interview 79 participants were randomized to one of two attention training programs using a probe detection task. In the active condition the participant was trained to direct attention away from threat, whereas in the placebo condition the probe appeared with equal frequency in the position of the threatening and neutral faces. Results Results were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, including all randomized participants. Immediate and 4 -month follow-up results revealed a significant time effect on all measured dimensions (social anxiety scales, general anxiety and depression levels, quality of life). However, there were no time x group interactions. The lack of differences in the two groups was also mirrored by the infinitesimal between group effect size both at post test and at 4 -month follow-up. Conclusion We conclude that computerized attention <b>bias</b> <b>modification</b> may need to be altered before dissemination for the Internet. Trial registration ISRCTN 01715124 </p...|$|R
