5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions <b>consume</b> more electricity during summer while cold regions <b>consume</b> more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that <b>consume</b> organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that <b>consume</b> hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to <b>consume</b> the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
