These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>specifications.</b> During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of the}} tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E

Complex changes to a specification are achieved by applying several basic transformations in sequence. The result is a transformed specification and proofs, where necessary revisions of a proof are represented by new open goals...|$|E
