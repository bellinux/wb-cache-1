A total of 1875 participants were included from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, also known as the British 1946 birth cohort. The results indicated that higher childhood cognitive ability was associated with reporting fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression GHQ- 28 scores in women, and increased risk of potential alcohol abuse in both men and women. Results were adjusted for educational attainment, early socioeconomic status (SES) and adverse circumstances, and adult SES, adverse circumstances, and negative health behaviours. After adjusting for childhood cognitive ability, greater educational attainment was associated with reporting greater symptoms of anxiety and depression on the GHQ- 28. Although undoubtedly interrelated, our evidence on the diverging effects of childhood cognitive ability and educational attainment on anxiety and depression in mid-adulthood highlights the need for the two to be considered independently. While higher childhood cognitive ability is associated with fewer internalising symptoms of anxiety and depression in women, it places both men and women at higher risk for potential alcohol abuse. Further research is needed to examine possible psychosocial mechanisms that may be associated with both higher childhood cognitive ability and greater risk for alcohol abuse.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess quality of life and mental health of parents of referred children waiting for service at the only child psychiatric service in Iceland, with reassessment at least 3 months after first attendance to the service. In order to do so, 208 parents of 123 children waiting for psychiatric care were sent the Icelandic Quality of Life (IQL), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 30) and the <b>CAGE</b> <b>screen</b> for alcoholism. For reassessment, responders in the first phase were assessed again with the IQL and GHQ- 30, at least 3 months after initiation of child psychiatric interventions. A total of 120 of the 208 parents (58 %) responded in the first phase of the study, 49 fathers and 71 mothers. The mean (+/- s, standard deviation) standardized IQL T-score was for the fathers 51 +/- 7. 5 but significantly lower for the mothers or 45 +/- 11. 5 (P = 0. 001) compared to normal sample of same-age women (T-scores of 50 are normal). Nearly 55 % of women compared with 26 % of men were psychiatric cases, scoring 5 or higher on the GHQ. According to a CAGE score of 2 and above 16 % of fathers and 14 % of mother abused alcohol. No significant change occurred in parents GHQ- 30 or IQL before and after initiation of treatment. We conclude that mothers of children with mental disorders have poor quality of life, and high prevalence of mental disorders; hence child psychiatry clinics need to ensure that mothers receive appropriate care along with the child...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to assess whether substances associated with the greatest alteration in consciousness are associated with increased risk behavior, and to explore any relationship between internalized homonegativity and alcohol and other drug use. Participants in the study were 422 Midwestern MSM who volunteered to evaluate a seminar on sexuality and intimacy between men. Alcohol, chemical use, and dependency during the last 2 weeks were assessed using standardized questions and <b>CAGE</b> <b>screening</b> questions. Internalized homonegativity was assessed using the 26 -item Reactions to Homosexuality scale. Components of unsafe sexual behavior during the preceding 3 months was assessed using dichotomous variables and collapsed into an overall measure of contextualized risk. Consistent and strong associations (ORs between 2. 32 and 4. 57) were found between unsafe sexual behavior and alcohol and other drug use. The greater the alcohol problem and the harder the drugs and the more they may impact consciousness or disinhibition, the greater the apparent association with unsafe sex. Degree of alteration of consciousness and disinhibition appear to be the common underlying dimensions of risk, although dose-level data were not available.

Echinacea products currently constitute {{a significant portion of}} the rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar natural products market. This popularity has led to the expansion of commercial cultivation of Echinacea and the need to find alternative methods to meet the increasing demands of the phytopharmaceutical market. Two methods of producing biochemical constituents in commercial use include extraction from field-grown plants and in vitro hairy root production;Echinacea seeds in the wild typically show a high degree of dormancy. In order to enhance Echinacea seed germination for field production, alternative methods to break seed dormancy were evaluated for the three most important medicinal species of Echinacea, E. angustifolia DC., E. purpurea (L.) Moench, and E. pallida (Nutt.) Nutt. The effects of seed source and production system on growth, yield and biochemical content were evaluated. Cold-moist stratification for 4 wk under 16 - 24 hr light conditions was determined to be the most effective non-chemical method to break Echinacea seed dormancy and increase germination rates;In the field production studies, where <b>screened</b> <b>cages</b> were evaluated against open field conditions, <b>screened</b> <b>cages</b> were associated with enhanced post-transplant establishment during the first year of growth. Because of the requirement for organic seeds in certified organic production, we evaluated an organic Echinacea seed source and found sufficient yield from this stock. Uniform recommendations, across the three Echinacea species, could not be determined because of numerous significant interactions between production system and seed source, however. Echinacea pallida root yields were equivalent to E. purpurea yields after three growing seasons, and yields were enhanced under <b>screened</b> <b>cages.</b> Echinacea plants in the open field were more affected by aster yellows disease than were those under <b>screened</b> <b>cages.</b> Thus, in areas of aster yellows incidence, satisfactory Echinacea root yields can be obtained under <b>screened</b> <b>cages</b> using organic seeds;Because of difficulties in biosynthesis and in planta variation in levels of bioactive compounds found in Echinacea, application of in vitro techniques in the production of medicinal plants can provide an alternate source of plant material for extraction of active ingredients. Hairy roots of Echinacea may represent an alternative to the production of secondary metabolites, such as alkamides, the most important bioactive compounds produced by Echinacea roots. Hairy roots were induced in the three species of Echinacea by transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes and A. tumefaciens containing the rol ABC genes. Plant growth regulators, such as indole butyric acid (IBA), and chemical elicitors, such as jasmonic acid (JA), were evaluated for their effects on growth and production of alkamides in hairy root cultures. Hairy roots induced by the A. tumefaciens strain were more amenable to culturing in liquid medium. Production of alkamides 3, 4, 8, and 9 was increased with the A. tumefaciens (pPZPROL) strain.

Methods A total of 1, 563 individuals aged 60 years or older, of both genders of three districts of different socioeconomic classes (high, medium and low) in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil) were interviewed. The <b>CAGE</b> <b>screening</b> test for alcoholism was applied and a structured interview was used to assess associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. The tests Mini Mental State Examination, Fuld Object Memory Evaluation, The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly and Bayer-Activities of Daily Living Scale were used for cognitive and functional assessment. Results Prevalence of alcoholism was 9. 1 %. Multivariate regression analysis showed that alcoholism was associated with male gender, `mulatto` ethnicity, smoking, and cognitive and functional impairment. In addition, the younger the individual and the lower the schooling level, the higher the risk for alcoholism. Conclusions The results obtained in this study show that alcoholism is highly frequent in the community-dwelling elderly living in Sao Paulo, and that it is associated with socio-demographic and clinical risk factors similar to those reported in the literature. This suggests that alcoholism in the elderly of a developing country shares the same basic characteristics seen in developed countries. These findings suggest that it is essential for health services and professional to be prepared to meet this demand that will significantly grow in the next years, especially in developing countries, where the rates of population aging are higher than those of developed countries.

Data from the present report is drawn from all females in a large, randomly selected cohort of firefighters in an epidemiological study designed to assess health outcomes and health risk behaviors identified as most important to the fire service. Methods Data reported for the present study were collected as baseline data for the Firefighter Injury and Risk Evaluation (FIRE) Study, a longitudinal cohort study examining risk factors for injury in both career and volunteer firefighters in the IAFC Missouri Valley Region. Of the departments assessed, only 8 career and 6 volunteer departments had any women firefighters. All the women solicited for participation chose to enroll in the study. The number of women ranged from 1 to 7 in career departments and 1 to 6 in volunteer departments. Results Where possible, comparisons are made between female firefighters and published data on male firefighters as well as comparisons between female firefighters and military members. Compared to male firefighters, females had more favorable body composition among both career and volunteer firefighters. Tobacco use rates were generally higher among females than males and rates among female firefighters were similar to the rates of female military members. While rates of alcohol use were higher than the general population, only one of the participants evidenced responses in the range of concern on the <b>CAGE</b> <b>screening.</b> Conclusions In general, the findings offer an interesting glimpse of the health of women in the fire service as a generally healthy occupational workforce with some unique health risk behavior challenges. They also highlight some of the similarities and differences between male and female firefighters and bolster the argument for studying female firefighters as a unique occupational sub-population. </p...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol {{abuse and}} {{dependence}} commonly go undetected in hospital inpatients, despite a high prevalence of alcohol-related disabilities {{and the availability}} of cost-effective interventions. In a university teaching hospital, three well validated screening methods for sensitivity and specificity were compared; the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT, with various cut-off scores), <b>CAGE</b> (a four-question <b>screening</b> tool), and a 10 -question version of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (BMAST). A subset of patients also completed the DSM IV structured clinical interview for diagnosis. 1133 adult patients were randomly selected from all hospital admissions, excluding day cases and patients too ill to be interviewed. Two-thirds of the patients were interviewed, the remainder were unavailable at the time. 30...|$|R
40|$|WHILE {{studying}} {{nutritional anemia}} in 1929, workers in this laboratory found that chicks {{did not survive}} when fed milk alone. When whole milk powder, fortified with iron and copper, was fed with the liquid whole milk, the chicks grew poorly (Elvehjem and Hart, 1929). Intermittently, since then, experiments {{have been set up}} to try to obtain normal growth of chicks on a milk diet. Two recent experiments are reported here.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{perform a}} {{meta-analysis}} to assess diagnostic {{characteristics of the}} <b>CAGE</b> in <b>screening</b> for alcohol abuse or dependence in a general clinical population and to test a new method for pooling of ROC curves. METHODS: Medline search performed over the period 1 / 1 / 1974 to 31 / 12 / 2001. MEASUREMENT: Calculation of diagnostic values. RESULTS: We identified 35 articles using the DSM criteria as the gold standard to test the diagnostic value of the CAGE. Only 10 studies could be included for the meta-analysis. With a cutoff point > or = 2, the pooled sensitivity is far better in inpatients (0. 87) than in primary care patients (0. 71) or ambulatory patients (0. 60). The pooled specificity also differs for each group. The likelihood ratios seem to be relatively constant over the populations (overall LR+: 3. 44;LR-: 0. 18). We calculated a pooled AUC of 0. 87 (95 % CI 0. 85 - 0. 89). At low specificity values, the sensitivity was homogeneous over the studies, and at a low sensitivity, the specificity was heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of the CAGE is of limited value using this test for screening purposes at his recommended cutpoint of > or = 2. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{very high}} {{brightness}} and photo-stability of silica nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating organic fluorophores {{have been demonstrated}} recently and have opened up new exciting opportunities {{for a number of}} biotechnological and information technological applications. However, a systematic theoretical study of fluorescent core-shell NPs remains a challenge, and as a result, the understanding of the fundamental interaction and microscopic dynamics of the dye/NPs assembly is still lacking. In the present work, different computational methods, as classical molecular dynamics simulations based on purposely tailored force-fields and TDDFT quantum mechanical calculations, are combined in an integrated strategy to elucidate the mechanisms behind the brightness enhancement of realistic models of rhodamine (TRITC) based C-dots (Cornell dots) for the first time. TD-B 3 LYP/MM calculations on the S 1 excited state dynamics of the dye show that crossing between the low lying (bright) ππ* and (dark) nπ* states occurs both in solution and in silica NPs albeit in the latter case it is reduced by the <b>caging</b> and <b>screening</b> effect played by the silica matrix. Moreover, our calculations show that the negligible solvatochromic shift between free-TRITC in solution and TRITC-based C-dots observed experimentally is due to seizure and incorporation of water molecules during the synthetic process that mediate the dye-silica interaction...|$|R
