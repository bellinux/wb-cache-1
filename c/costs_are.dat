Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks.

5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power.

The categories {{vary in their}} division of premiums and out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans have the lowest monthly premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs, while platinum plans are the reverse. The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket <b>costs)</b> <b>are,</b> on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).|$|E

Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E

The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works {{to protect the rights of}} refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> paid for by the UN's primary budget.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the tollhouse was proving {{inadequate}} as {{the seat}} of local government and between 1407 and 1413 it was demolished, along with an adjoining site which had housed a vegetable market, {{and was replaced by}} a new Guildhall. In keeping with Norwich's status, {{it was one of the}} largest civic buildings in England outside London and housed all aspects of local government and justice for the new council. The Guildhall cost between £400–£500 to build. (As it was built primarily using pressed labour, modern equivalents of the building <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> virtually meaningless. The annual income of the city council at the time the Guildhall was built was around £120.) The eastern face of the Guildhall was built in a distinctive black and white checked design, representing the exchequer. The undercroft of the tollhouse was retained for use as a dungeon, while a new basement served as a lock-up from the opening of the Guildhall until the 1980s.|$|E

This method can be used in service industry where the major input is the skilled or unskilled labour. For the proper calculation labour rates need to be constant and the skill and efficiency of the labourer need to be identical.|$|R

5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|External costs, also {{referred}} to as hidden <b>costs,</b> <b>are</b> quantifications of the environmental and climate impacts of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion per annum by 2030. The impact of noise was costed at around £25million per annum in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million per annum. Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E
5|$|If {{opportunity}} <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced.

Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant opportunity costs. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E
