40|$|The {{ability to}} {{differentiate}} stimuli predicting positive or negative outcomes is critical for survival, and perturbations of emotional processing underlie many psychiatric disease states. Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and negative. Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations, but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation {{of positive and negative}} associations within the amygdala. National Institute of Mental Health (U. S.)

The regulation of DMT 1 is therefore critical to the management of iron uptake in the disease setting. We previously identified post-translational control of DMT 1 levels through a ubiquitin-mediated pathway led by Ndfip 1, an adaptor for Nedd 4 family of E 3 ligases.

Although much is known about the molecular events leading to the formation of plaques and tangles as well as their relevance in neuronal cell loss associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease, the link between these two pathologies is presently unknown. The exact mechanism of neuronal cell death in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> disease <b>brain</b> has been a debated issue with both the necrosis and apoptosis pathways having been implicated. The activation of apoptosis in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> disease <b>brain</b> has recently gained momentum, namely because of the development of specific markers for caspase activation. These markers consist of antibodies, termed caspase-cleavage site-directed antibodies that are designed to detect either the active enzymatic fragments of caspases following their activation or protein products targeted for caspase cleavage. The use of these markers has demonstrated the widespread activation of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> disease <b>brain.</b> In addition, many of these markers have been co-localized with markers for neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting that caspases {{may play a role in}} the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and, thus, do not simply represent end-stage events associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease.
