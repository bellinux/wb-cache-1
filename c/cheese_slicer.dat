5000|$|Ostehøvel, {{a modern}} <b>cheese</b> <b>slicer</b> or cheese plane, {{was invented by}} Thor Bjørklund in 1925 in Norway. Mass {{production}} of the Ostehøvel <b>cheese</b> <b>slicer</b> started during 1927 in Lillehammer, Norway. The design {{was based on the}} carpenter's plane. This style of slicer is very common in the Nordic countries, and in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Thor Bjørklund (October 30, 1889 - December 8, 1975) was a Norwegian {{inventor}} and businessman. He is {{best known}} as the inventor of Ostehøvel, a popular <b>cheese</b> <b>slicer</b> which developed into an important Norwegian export product.|$|E
50|$|Various non-knife {{devices are}} used for cutting cheese, such as a wire cheese cutter, which {{completely}} avoids adhesion, a <b>cheese</b> <b>slicer,</b> used primarily for thin slices of medium-hard cheeses, used especially in Scandinavia for cutting cheese for sandwiches, and the girolle, used to cut the hard Tête de Moine cheese by scraping.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential use of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma system to improve microbial safety of <b>sliced</b> <b>cheese.</b> The atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) effect on visual appearance and a sensory evaluation were also carried out. The number of Escherichia coli inoculated on <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> decreased by 0. 09, 0. 47, 1. 16 and 1. 47 log cycles with helium (4 liters/min [lpm]) and 0. 05, 0. 87, 1. 89 and 1. 98 log cycles with He/O 2 mixture (4 lpm/ 15 standard cubic centimeters per minute), after being treated with plasma for 1, 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively. Significant reductions were also observed in Staphylococcus aureus inoculated onto <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 45 log cycles with He and from 0. 08 to 0. 91 log cycles with He/O 2 -treated samples, respectively. Adding oxygen resulted in a significant increase in inactivation of both pathogens. No visible change in the plasma-treated <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> was observed even though the instrumental analysis showed a significant decrease in the L*-value and an increase in the b*-value. The <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> were damaged after 10 and 15 min of plasma treatment. In addition, significant reductions in sensory quality including flavor, odor, and acceptability of plasma-treated <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> were observed. The results indicate that the DBD plasma system has potential for use in sanitizing food products, although the effect was limited. Further development of the APP system is necessary for industrial use...|$|R

50|$|The board-style <b>cheese</b> <b>slicer</b> {{has been}} {{expanded}} to include marble, stainless steel, and plastic cutting boards. Several other designs of handles and wire holders have also been invented to hold the cutting wires of cheese slicing boards. Many of these wires have loops on the ends like the Prodyne models; others have small rings or knots that fit into a slot on the handle and cutting arm.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Prodyne Gourmet <b>Cheese</b> <b>Slicer</b> had {{a wooden}} board with a slot cut {{into it and}} a hole through which {{one end of a}} U-shaped steel cutting arm was inserted. In the patented design, a stainless steel wire extends between the two ends of the cutting arm fit into the slot, and cuts the cheese. The wire has loops at each end; one loop is around the steel cutting arm in the slot, while the other passes around a metal pin though a plastic handle {{on the other end of}} the cutting arm. The plastic handle rotates upward to tighten the wire, and is secured to the cutting arm with a screw.|$|E

40|$|Sliceability is a cheese’s {{ability to}} cut cleanly into thin slices, resist {{breakage}} or fracture at slices edges, and undergo {{a high level}} of bending before breaking. Intuitively, sliceability depends on the chemistry, microstructural, and rheological properties of the casein network. Currently there is no reported scientific research investigating evaluation methods of <b>cheese</b> <b>slice</b> quality, as well as properties that influence a <b>cheese’s</b> ability to <b>slice.</b> In this study, a method for slice quality evaluation was developed on purchased cheese and performed on commercial cheeses and experimental cheeses manufactured at three different moisture contents (40. 6 %, 37. 0 %, and 33. 9 %). In addition, tack force, tack energy, flexibility force, G’, G”, and G* were examined {{to determine whether or not}} moisture content influences <b>cheese</b> sliceability. Overall, <b>slice</b> quality at all three moisture contents improved as storage time increased, and the high moisture cheeses produced the worst quality slices and the low moisture cheeses produced the best. Both tack energy and tack force increased with increasing moisture content, and G’, G”, and G* decreased with increasing moisture and did not change over time. Tack energy and G” were found to be slightly correlated with <b>cheese</b> <b>slice</b> quality. Flexibility force was not correlated with <b>cheese</b> <b>slice</b> quality. Moisture and storage time, as well their interaction, had significant effects on dependent variables, potentially indicating that a higher moisture cheese texture changes differently compared to medium and low moisture cheeses during storage. Correlation tests did not express a strong connection between moisture content, age, and <b>cheese</b> <b>slice</b> quality, overall. This research lays the foundation for future slice quality evaluation, and is a starting point upon which other companies and scientists can build...|$|R

5000|$|Kraft Singles is a {{processed}} cheese (American cheese) product manufactured and sold by Kraft Foods, introduced in 1949.

The campaign was lambasted for its implications that each slice contained {{the same amount of}} calcium as a five-ounce glass of milk and also more calcium than imitation <b>cheese</b> <b>slices,</b> which eventually led to a ruling by the Federal Trade Commission in 1992 that ordered Kraft to stop making false claims in its advertising.|$|R

5000|$|The {{processed}} {{variety of}} American cheese {{is sold in}} three basic packaging varieties: individually-wrapped <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> (which are not sliced from a block of cheese, but rather slabs of processed cheese which are formed from a viscous processed cheese which only solidifies between the wrapping medium); small, pre-sliced blocks of 8 to 36 slices; and large blocks meant for use behind deli counters. The individually-wrapped <b>cheese</b> <b>slices</b> are, typically, the least like traditional cheese. Small blocks of pre-sliced (e.g., 8-36 <b>slices),</b> unwrapped American <b>cheese</b> are also marketed, often with the branding [...] "deluxe" [...] or [...] "old-fashioned"; this variety of American cheese is similar in ingredients and texture to that of modern block American cheese.
