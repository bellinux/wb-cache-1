Mojo used in order to reach the Break Even Point, {{to find out the}} correlation between the change of production input cost product selling price, and product number, and the <b>land</b> <b>width</b> used in reaching BEP. The method used in this study is a descriptive method, with the case study as the implementation technique. The location and sample of research were chosen purposively, namely, the Mojo Sugar Factory in Sragen Regency. Method of analyzing data used were 1) the calculation of Break Even Point in unit and Rupiahs, 2) <b>land</b> <b>width</b> estimation approach, and 3) sensitivity analysis. From the result of research it can be found that: 1) totally, the PG Mojo’s revenue and production during 2004 - 2008 period reaches BEP, it {{can be seen from the}} mean sugar revenue and production higher than the mean sugar BEP (RP) and sugar BEP (Kw), that is, Rp. 28, 839, 346, 000 and 64, 776. 48 Kw higher than Rp. 17, 253, 318, 122. 06 and 39, 716. 12 Kw. 2) Totally the <b>land</b> <b>width</b> of PG. Mojo during 2004 - 2008 period has reached BEP, it can be seen from the mean <b>land</b> <b>width</b> of PG Mojo of 4273, 284 Ha larger than the average BEP of <b>land</b> <b>width</b> of 941. 53 Ha. 3) the <b>land</b> <b>width</b> the PG Mojo has exceeds the <b>land</b> <b>width</b> BEP, although it encounters the variable chan ge that is the sugar price increase and decrease of 1. 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to describe land tenure dynamic which have been occurred since the Dutch settlement period, until now, in the Sub-watershed of Minraleng and to identify the influencing factors of the dynamic. The data were analyzed by using qualitative and descriptive method in identifying agroforestry, and applying multivariate discriminant to identify the influencing factors regarding land tenure dynamic. For the first step (Dutch settlement – 1970), the characteristics of tenure was traditional communal that {{was influenced by the}} economic system on the local level. Traditional agricultural system based on the local resources and the people demography were low with limited land used for agriculture. The influencing factor to land tenure dynamic were demography, technology, bio-physical land characteristics, access for infrastructure, and the institutions. Demography factor such as the variable of urbanization/transmigration, <b>land</b> <b>width,</b> rice field <b>land</b> <b>width,</b> and “sakap” (benefit sharing <b>land)</b> <b>width,</b> and <b>land</b> ownership.
