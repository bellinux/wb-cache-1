40|$|Nanofibres {{prepared}} by electrospinning typically have randomly oriented fibrous structure. They have large surface-to-volume (or weight) ratio and excellent porous characteristic, which have shown enormous potential in diverse applications. However, electrospun nanofibres are often prepared {{in the form}} of randomly orientated fibrous web, which are fragile and difficult to be tailored in fibrous structures. Herein, we demonstrate a novel yarn electrospinning method which uses a rotating <b>ring</b> <b>collector</b> to convert newly electrospun nanofibres directly into a continuous yarn. The use of <b>ring</b> <b>collector</b> separates the yarn formation from the electrospinning zone. The deposition of later-spun nanofibres to the inner surface of fibrous cone eliminates hooked or curled nanofibres in the final yarn. The effects of polymer concentration and operating parameters on nanofibre and yarn morphology, diameter and the <b>ring</b> <b>collector</b> on yarn twist feature were examined. The nanofibre yarns had a surface twist angle up to 54. 4 °, and tensile strength as high as 93. 6  MPa (elongation at break 242. 6 %).

50|$|In {{unidirectional}} path-switched rings (UPSRs), two redundant (path-level) {{copies of}} protected traffic are sent {{in either direction}} around a ring. A selector at the egress node determines which copy has the highest quality, and uses that copy, thus coping if one copy deteriorates due to a broken fiber or other failure. UPSRs tend to sit nearer {{to the edge of}} a network, and as such are sometimes called <b>collector</b> <b>rings.</b> Because the same data is sent around the ring in both directions, the total capacity of a UPSR is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring. For example, in an OC-3 ring with 3 STS-1s used to transport 3 DS-3s from ingress node A to the egress node D, 100 percent of the ring bandwidth (N=3) would be consumed by nodes A and D. Any other nodes on the ring could only act as pass-through nodes. The SDH equivalent of UPSR is subnetwork connection protection (SNCP); SNCP does not impose a ring topology, but may also be used in mesh topologies.|$|R

50|$|The <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> is {{also used}} to collect {{electrons}} being released from the granules in the photoemission process. If the gun is scanning a dark area few electrons would be released directly from the scanned granules, {{but the rest of the}} mosaic will also be releasing electrons that will be collected during that time. As a result, the black level of the image will float depending on the average brightness of the image, which caused the iconoscope to have a distinctive patchy visual style. This was normally combatted by keeping the image continually and very brightly lit. This also led to clear visually differences between scenes shot indoors and those shot outdoors in good lighting conditions.|$|E

40|$|Thesis for {{the degree}} of Bachelor of Science in {{electrical}} engineering. "Manuscript copy. Nearly every possible loss of power about a dynamo has been investigated more or less thoroughly and efforts made to eliminate such loss by careful design of the part in which the loss occurs. The losses at the brushes due to friction, electrical resistance, etc. have been investigated several times but {{the results of these}} tests do no always agree with each other and in so far as they do agree are not generally known. It is usual, in finding the losses of a machine, either experimentally or by calculation, to include the brush losses with the load losses. The actual value of the losses at the brushes is seldom known. Consideration of the lack of certain knowledge of this subject, led us to attempt this investigation. It was our original intention to investigate the voltage drop and contact resistance of several kinds of brushes at different current densities, different brush pressures, different speeds of rotation of the commutator or <b>collector</b> <b>rings,</b> different frequencies of alternating current, etc. Digitized at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia MU Libraries Digitization Lab in 2011...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the development of the induction machine as a generator for wind turbines {{from the middle of the}} 20 th centu-ry up to now. After a short history chapter the different energy conversion concepts are presented. At first a squirrel cage machine is direct coupled to the grid (Danish concept). To adjust the machine speed the second step is a wound rotor machine with <b>collector</b> <b>rings</b> to change rotor resistance. This concept allows the first adaption of the operating point of the wind turbine and the induction machine. Another concept is to connect the stator of a squirrel cage machine with a full inline voltage source converter to the grid to get the flexibility in rotational speed and to control the reactive power. The doubly fed induction machine is the latest development. This concept uses a bidirectional voltage source converter in the rotor circuit with a ra-ted power of only 30 % of the rated generator power. Now it is possible to change the rotational speed and the reactive power independently and in a wide range. A generalized control scheme of a modern doubly fed inducti-on machine (DFIG) is shown in the last part to explain the variability and the range of application. Today over 70 % of the wind turbines are build up with DFIG...|$|R
50|$|BLSRs {{can operate}} within a {{metropolitan}} region or, often, will move traffic between municipalities. Because a BLSR does not send redundant copies from ingress to egress, the total bandwidth that a BLSR can support {{is not limited}} to the line rate N of the OC-N ring, and can actually be larger than N depending upon the traffic pattern on the ring. In the best case, all traffic is between adjacent nodes. The worst case is when all traffic on the ring egresses from a single node, i.e., the BLSR is serving as a <b>collector</b> <b>ring.</b> In this case, the bandwidth that the ring can support is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring. This is why BLSRs are seldom, if ever, deployed in collector rings, but often deployed in inter-office rings. The SDH equivalent of BLSR is called Multiplex Section-Shared Protection Ring (MS-SPRING).|$|E
50|$|Two {{immiscible}} liquids {{of different}} densities are fed to the separate inlets and are rapidly mixed in the annular {{space between the}} spinning rotor and stationary housing. The mixed phases are directed {{toward the center of}} the rotor by radial vanes in the housing base. As the liquids enter the central opening of the rotor, they are accelerated toward the wall. The mixed phases are rapidly accelerated to rotor speed and separation begins as the liquids are displaced upward. A system of weirs at the top of the rotor allow each phase to exit the rotor where it lands in a <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> and exits the stage. Flow from between stages is by gravity with no need for inter-stage pumps. The centrifugal contactors thus acts as a mixer, centrifuge and pump. Centrifugal contactors are typical referred to by the diameter of their rotor. Thus, a 5-inch centrifugal contactor is one having a 5-inch diameter rotor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A Faraday probe {{with three}} {{concentric}} rings {{was designed and}} fabricated to assess the effects of gap width and probe geometry in a systematic study of the Hall thruster plume. The nested Faraday probe consisted of two concentric <b>collector</b> <b>rings</b> and an outer guard ring, which enabled simultaneous current density measurements on {{the inner and outer}} collector. Two versions of the outer collector were fabricated to create 0. 5 mm or 1. 5 mm gaps between the rings. Current density distribution of a Hall thruster ion source were studied at 8, 12, 16, and 20 thruster diameters downstream of the exit plane with four probe configurations at background pressures of 3 x 10 - 6, 1 x 10 - 5, and 3 x 10 - 5 torr. Several correction factors are proposed to account for the effective probe collection area and systematic measurement error associated with measuring an annular device as a point source. These corrections enable the investigation of beam expansion and ion migration from the central core, and result in a highly accurate estimate of divergence in the Hall thruster plume. Application of the correction factors and characterization of facility effects are shown to decrease the calculated beam current by 10 - 20 % compared to conventional analysis and reduce measurement uncertainty to ± 3 %...|$|R
40|$|With the {{widespread}} use of electric machines, there is a growing need to extract information from the machines to improve their control systems and maintenance management. The present work shows the development of an embedded system to perform the monitoring of the rotor physical variables of a squirrel cage induction motor. The system is comprised of: a circuit to acquire desirable rotor variable(s) and value(s) that send it to the computer; a rectifier and power storage circuit that converts an alternating current in a continuous current but also stores energy for {{a certain amount of time}} to wait for the motor’s shutdown; and a magnetic generator that harvests energy from the rotating field to power the circuits mentioned above. The embedded system is set on the rotor of a 5 HP squirrel cage induction motor, making it difficult to power the system because it is rotating. This problem can be solved with the construction of a magnetic generator device to avoid the need of using batteries or <b>collector</b> <b>rings</b> and will send data to the computer using a wireless NRF 24 L 01 module. For the proposed system, initial validation tests were made using a temperature sensor (DS 18 b 20), as this variable is known as the most important when identifying the need for maintenance and control systems.

40|$|A common {{method to}} {{increase}} beam stability is {{to enlarge the}} longitudinal momentum spread.

These were pressed into service with the 2do Escuadron de Caza Fighter Squadron, part of Primer Escuadrón de Aviación Aviation Squadron based in the newly created [...] "Teniente Coronel Pedro Ruiz Gallo" [...] in Chiclayo.

40|$|Nanofibres {{prepared}} by electrospinning have shown enormous potential for various applications. They are obtained predominantly {{in the form}} of nonwoven fibre webs. The 2 -dimensional nonwoven feature and fragility have considerably confined their further processing into fabrics through knitting or weaving. Nanofibre yarns, which are nanofibre bundles with continuous length and a twist feature, show improved tensile strength, offering opportunities for making 3 -dimensional fibrous materials with precisely controlled fibrous architecture, porous features and fabric dimensions. Despite a few techniques having been developed for electrospinning nanofibre yarns, they are chiefly based on the needle electrospinning technique, which often has low nanofibre productivity. In this study, we for the first time report a nanofibre yarn electrospinning technique which combines both needle and needleless electrospinning. A rotating intermediate <b>ring</b> <b>collector</b> was employed to directly collect freshly-electrospun nanofibres into a fibrous cone, which was further drawn and twisted into a nanofibre yarn. This novel system was able to produce high tenacity yarn (tensile strength 128. 9 MPa and max strain 222. 1 %) at a production rate of 240 m h - 1, with a twist level up to 4700 twists per metre.
