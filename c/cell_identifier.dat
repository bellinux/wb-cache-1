In this case, as the “Signal assessment” section has concluded, the selected parameter to complete the calibration phase is the CellID, i.e., the <b>cell</b> <b>identifier.</b> Therefore, CellID information was recorded during 5  min at each point, which implies that around 37, 800 samples in the whole scenario from {{the cellular}} system (18, 900 samples per technology GSM or UMTS) were stored.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a software development on Android Platform which applies <b>cell</b> <b>identifier</b> method {{for improving the}} accuracy of indoor localization. The objective {{of this research is}} to provide a detectable system, “Mobile Detective”, for tracking and finding clues of lost mobiles. In general, the location-based service, a software application which retrieves information about where a mobile device is located, uses GPS (Global Positioning System) to indicate the geographical position of the mobile device. Though GPS provides efficient outdoor localization, it does not work well indoor and not all mobile devices have built-in GPS receiver. Therefore, GPS may not be suitable for tracking lost mobiles. In order to solve this problem, <b>cell</b> <b>identifier</b> which indicates mobile device position by using station base information is introduced in this research. The location tracking process is run as background process by using Android service and it automatically repeats sending this information in an interval of time. The results from this process composed of position and mobileˆˆe 2 ˆˆ 80 ˆˆ 99 s particular information: SIM code and IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity), are sent from the lost mobile to the recipient.

30|$|Wideband {{technologies}} such as WiMAX, WCDMA, and LTE use a predefined set of codes for the identification of cells at the air interface. For example, 114 pseudonoise sequences are used in WiMAX [25], while 504 physical <b>cell</b> <b>identifiers</b> are used in LTE [26]. When the mobile knows the identification code of a cell, it can synchronize over the air interface and then measure the pilot signal quality of the cell. Therefore, by using a predefined set of codes, these wideband technologies can have more autonomous cell measurement conducted by the mobile. In this paper, this identification code {{is referred to as}} <b>cell</b> synchronization <b>identifier</b> (CSID).|$|R

It {{is reasonable to assume}} that much fewer bits might be necessary for the system to operate as each base station can build a look-up table where the identities of the interfering neighbours are stored and each user simply feeds back the relative entries in the table. This additional overhead is not considered in this analysis as it {{is beyond the scope of}} this work to develop a compression scheme for the cell identifying information.|$|E

30|$|The exact {{estimation}} of cell coverage is applicable to cellular network management. Combined with demographics and foot traffic {{of a particular}} area, decisions of cell split, addition, or re-configuration are performed. In this article, we propose a novel cell coverage estimation method using radio fingerprint data. A radio fingerprint map {{is built based on}} the measured radio fingerprint data. A grid segmentation of the fingerprint map provides an efficient frame in which to store a large amount of fingerprint data. Each grid contains a reference <b>cell</b> <b>identifier</b> {{in the form of a}} reference Pilot Number (reference PN for 3 G WCDMA) or Physical Cell ID (PCI for 4 G LTE) and its signal strength measurement value. A customized data analysis method that consists of cleansing and compensation is applied to the fingerprint map. From understanding the cell shapes, outlier fingerprint data are eliminated by the iterative data cleansing method. In addition, the data compensation method can keep fingerprint data integrity and confirm the proper cell borderline for effective cell coverage estimation. This effective coverage estimation creates powerful advantages for network planning and operation. For instance, economic planning for subscriber penetration is a good example. The scheduled subscriber penetration plan has a critical impact on radio resource planning for commercial service providers.|$|E

Based on this proposed iterative fingerprint data analysis method, we detect the proper cell borderline for each cell site. By the proposed method, we can efficiently estimate the cell coverage of each cell site without difficult manual field measurements. Moreover, mobile service providers can economically plan network configuration and manage subscribers using these advances in cell coverage estimation.|$|R

This makes it a huge warehouse for customer’s data. That is, every action taken by the customer (short message service (SMS), Call or Internet session) gets recorded within the telecom operator, in the so called (CDRs). There are many types of CDRs used mainly by telecom billing systems. CDR contains a lot of information, (type of event, who is involved in this event, datetime, <b>cell</b> <b>identifier</b> where this event has taken place).

40|$|Mobile workers {{employed}} by a utility company, for instance electricians or plumbers, {{are becoming increasingly}} autonomous. Instead of signing in at the company everyday to receive their assignments, they are now often {{on the road for}} several days, receiving their instructions on a mobile device equipped with 3 G technology. Much more than regular users of cellular networks, mobile workers require a reliable connection while traveling between locations. Unfortunately, 3 G technology is not very reliable. Signal strength can fluctuate widely between locations. Furthermore, commercial claims of network quality, and existing theoretical coverage maps are often inconsistent with reality. We aim to compute a practical connectivity strength map for Flanders {{that can be used to}} predict network connectivity for mobile workers. To our knowledge such a map does not currently exist. Based on this map and a predicted future location, a modem would be able to automatically choose the optimal 3 G technology and bandwidth in order to maintain a stable network connection while traveling. Additionally, the map provides users with a visualization of the network connectivity in an area. The computation of the coverage map is based on anonymous real-time measurements collected from mobile workers. Each measurement consists of a unique network <b>cell</b> <b>identifier,</b> GPS coordinates, a received signal strength indication (RSSI), and download rate. We distinguish two phases in the computation. First, we apply a constraint programming approach to match cell identifiers with their physical location. The constraints are based on knowledge about the practical limitations of cellular network technology, such as he maximum broadcasting angle of an antenna. Second, we predict the network strength at a given location by using the geostatistical interpolation technique Kriging, also known as Gaussian Process regression. In the future, we plan to adapt Kriging so that the coverage map is updated incrementally with real-time measurements. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{evidence}} of rare CD 133 expression in somatic stem cells of the prostate, {{it was hypothesized that}} these CD 133 pos CSC populations resulted from mutated normal stem cells and thus were derived from basal cells. Several studies supported this theory early on by showing that the CD 133 pos cell populations exhibited other basal <b>cell</b> <b>identifiers</b> such as negative androgen receptor expression (ARneg) as shown in Fig.  2. In these studies, the CD 133 pos cells had the ability to proliferate and differentiate into ARpos cell populations, reflecting the relevance of CD 133 to a hierarchically organized phenotype. However, a study by Vander Griend et al. demonstrated that CD 133 pos sorted prostate cancer cell lines were ARpos and exhibited significant growth inhibition when exposed to high-dose androgens, suggesting that these CD 133 pos CSCs may be derived from a malignantly transformed intermediate cell rather than a normal basal stem cell [93].|$|R

40|$|Self-organization is {{discussed}} in terms of distributed computational methods and algorithms for resource allocation in cellular networks. In order to develop algorithms for different self-organization problems pertinent to small cell networks (SCN), a number of concepts from discrete and continuous optimization theory are employed. Self-organized resource allocation problems such as physical <b>cell</b> <b>identifier</b> (PCI) assignment and primary component carrier selection are formulated as discrete optimization problems. Distributed graph coloring and constraint satisfaction algorithms are used to solve these problems. The PCI assignment is also discussed for multi-operator heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, different variants of simulated annealing are proposed for solving a graph coloring formulation of the orthogonal resource allocation problem. In the continuous optimization domain, a network utility maximization approach is considered for solving different resource allocation problems. Network synchronization is addressed using greedy and gradient search algorithms. Primal and dual decomposition are discussed for transmit power and scheduling weight optimizations, under a network-wide power constraint. Joint optimization over transmit powers and multi-user scheduling weights is considered in a multi-carrier SCN, for both maximum rate and proportional-fair rate utilities. This formulation is extended for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SCNs, where apart from transmit powers and multi-user scheduling weights, the transmit precoders are also optimized, for a generic alpha-fair utility function. Optimization of network resources over multiple degrees of freedom is particularly effective in reducing mutual interference, leading to significant gains in network utility. Finally, an alternate formulation of transmit power allocation is considered, in which the network transmit power is minimized subject to the data rate constraints of users. Thus, network resource allocation algorithms inspired by optimization theory constitute an effective approach for self-organization in contemporary as well as future cellular networks...|$|E

A grid-based spatial index has the advantage that the structure of the index can be created first, and data added on an ongoing basis without requiring any change to the index structure; indeed, if a common grid is used by disparate data collecting and indexing activities, such indices can easily be merged from a variety of sources. On the other hand, data driven structures such as R-trees can be more efficient for data storage and speed at search execution time, though they are generally tied to the internal structure of a given data storage system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Existing {{context-aware}} mobile applications often rely {{on location}} information. However, raw location data such as GPS coordinates or GSM <b>cell</b> <b>identifiers</b> are usually meaningless {{to the user}} and, as a consequence, researchers have proposed different methods for inferring so-called places from raw data. The places are locations that carry some meaning to user and to which the user can potentially attach some (meaningful) semantics. Examples of places include home, work and airport. A lack in existing work is that the labeling {{has been done in}} an ad hoc fashion and no motivation has been given for why places would be interesting to the user. As our first contribution we use social identity theory to motivate why some locations really are significant to the user. We also discuss what potential uses for location information social identity theory implies. Another flaw in the existing work {{is that most of the}} proposed methods are not suited to realistic mobile settings as they rely on the availability of GPS information. As our second contribution we consider a more realistic setting where the information consists of GSM cell transitions that are enriched with GPS information whenever a GPS device is available.

Based on this fingerprint map, we can estimate the cell coverage. The fingerprint data cleansing and compensation for borderline detection {{is an essential part}} of cell coverage estimation. Given our understanding of circular sector cell configurations, we developed an iterative data cleansing and compensation method. As a result of an appropriate cleansing and compensation method, we can detect a tight cell borderline. We presented the entire estimation procedure and a coverage estimation program that consists of a large amount of radio fingerprint data and a proposed procedure. The usefulness of the developed algorithmic procedure and coverage estimation program is proven by actual fingerprint data collected from a commercial wireless service provided by SK Telecom, Korea. A field engineer can now estimate cell coverage without manual operations using this simple coverage estimation program. Note that, the fine grid granularity guarantee higher performance. But it also generates higher cost for fingerprint data collection. Thus, we select single-sized grids in building a radio fingerprint map (e.g. 50 [*]×[*] 50). To enhance the accuracy on estimation, we can adopt variable granularity: fine granularity for cell border area and coarse granularity for cell inner area.|$|R

40|$|A multi-agent software/hardware architecture, {{inspired}} by the multicellular nature of living organisms, has been proposed {{as the basis of}} design of a robust, reliable, persistent computing system. Just as a multicellular organism can adapt to changing environmental conditions and can survive despite the failure of individual cells, a multi-agent computing system, as envisioned, could adapt to changing hardware, software, and environmental conditions. In particular, the computing system could continue to function (perhaps at a reduced but still reasonable level of performance) if one or more component(s) of the system were to fail. One of the defining characteristics of a multicellular organism is unity of purpose. In biology, the purpose is survival of the organism. The purpose of the proposed multi-agent architecture is to provide a persistent computing environment in harsh conditions in which repair is difficult or impossible. A multi-agent, organism-like computing system would be a single entity built from agents or cells. Each agent or cell would be a discrete hardware processing unit that would include a data processor with local memory, an internal clock, and a suite of communication equipment capable of both local line-of-sight communications and global broadcast communications.

We tested three commonly used affinity-based enrichment techniques; (i) antibody, (ii) chemical capture and (iii) protein affinity enrichment and assessed their ability to accurately and reproducibly report 5 hmC profiles in mouse tissues containing high (brain) and lower (liver) levels of 5 hmC. The protein-affinity technique is a poor reporter of 5 hmC profiles, delivering 5 hmC patterns that are incompatible with other methods. Both antibody and chemical capture-based techniques generate highly similar genome-wide patterns for 5 hmC, which are independently validated by standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) and glucosyl-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion (gRES-qPCR). Both antibody and chemical capture generated profiles reproducibly link to unique chromatin modification profiles associated with 5 hmC.

Further novel algorithms need to be designed to improve the mobile reception quality. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the handover algorithms in DVB-H. A systematic evaluation and categorization approach is proposed based on the problems the algorithms solve and the handover stages being focused on. Criteria are proposed and analyzed to facilitate designing better handover algorithms for DVB-H that have been identified from the research conducted by the author...|$|R
40|$|T cells, as well {{as other}} cell types, are {{composed}} of phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets. However, for many of these populations it is unclear whether they develop from common or separate progenitors. To address such issues, we developed a novel approach, termed cellular barcoding, that allows the dissection of lineage relationships. We demonstrate that the labeling of <b>cells</b> with unique <b>identifiers</b> coupled to a microarray-based detection system can be used to analyze family relationships between the progeny of such cells. To exemplify the potential of this technique, we studied migration patterns of families of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells in vivo. We demonstrate that progeny of individual T cells rapidly seed independent lymph nodes and that antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells present at different effector sites are largely derived from a common pool of precursors. These data show how locally primed T cells disperse and provide a technology for kinship analysis with wider utility...|$|R
