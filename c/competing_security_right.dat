40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{functioning}} of the Estonian commercial pledge regulation in light of recent court practice and international trends. It is argued that the true meaning and place of the commercial pledge in the Estonian <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> system needs revisiting. General business security, such as the Estonian commercial pledge, is a means to pledge movables in bulk. This raises issues of the priority of a general <b>security</b> <b>right</b> to a movable and a specific <b>security</b> <b>right</b> in the same asset. Therefore, the article also deals with the various connections between the general business pledge and a notice-filing system for <b>security</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to real <b>security,</b> personal <b>security</b> <b>right</b> gives the creditor a personal right {{to settle the}} principal debt if the debtor fails to do so, whereas a real <b>security</b> <b>right</b> gives the creditor a limited real right in property belonging to the debtor. In terms of the limited real right, the debtor (or third party) agrees that the creditor may use the property to settle the principal debt if the debtor fails to do so. Personal <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> are regulated by the law of obligations (contract and delict), whereas real <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> are governed by the law of property.|$|R

40|$|In an East and West {{debate on}} human rights, {{scholars}} from different cultures disagree on whether all {{civil and political}} rights are human rights. While they generally agree that basic civil rights such as rights against torture and slavery (i. e., physical <b>security</b> <b>rights)</b> are human rights, some of them argue that traditional political rights in the West such as freedom of speech and political participation (i. e., liberal rights) are not human rights. Some scholars, such as Daniel A. Bell, argue that liberal rights are not human rights because liberal rights conflict with some East Asian cultures. In this dissertation, I argue that both physical <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> and liberal rights are human rights, and explain the relationship between these rights and East Asian cultures. First, I argue that if liberal rights are not human rights because they conflict with some East Asian cultures, then physical <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> are also not human <b>rights</b> because physical <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> also conflict with some East Asian cultures. Next, I discuss the idea from Daniel Bell and Michael Walzer that physical <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> are human rights because they are minimal values. Based on their idea, I explain what minimal values are, and why it is possible to develop some maximal theories of physical <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> in East Asian cultures. I argue that since physical <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> are minimal values, they are still human rights even they conflict with some East Asian cultures. I then argue that liberal rights, similar to physical <b>security</b> <b>rights,</b> are also minimal values, and it is possible to develop some maximal theories of them in East Asian cultures. Therefore, similar to physical <b>security</b> <b>rights,</b> liberal rights are also human rights even they also conflict with some East Asian cultures. I also discuss other human rights debates, especially the debates between Daniel Bell and other philosophers. Charles Taylor argues for an overlapping consensus approach on human rights; Jack Donnelly argues for a Western liberalist approach on human rights. I explain the relationship between these approaches and my arguments, and how my arguments can help them to reply to the challenges from Daniel Bell...|$|R
50|$|For {{a pledge}} to come into {{existence}} as a real <b>security</b> <b>right,</b> {{it is essential that}} delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive, but the pledgee must retain possession of the pledged object. The transfer of possession is intended to publicise the fact that a real <b>security</b> <b>right,</b> {{in the form of a}} pledge, has been established over the pledged object. The transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real <b>security</b> <b>right</b> by preventing the pledgor from alienating the pledged object or pledging it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted.|$|R

40|$|If someone lends {{money to}} another person, he trusts {{that he will}} get his money back. Particularly {{in the context of}} {{commercial}} relationships, {{there is a need for}} more security. Such security can be achieved by a so-called <b>security</b> <b>right</b> on someone’s property. If the debtor does not pay back the borrowed money, the secured creditor can use his <b>security</b> <b>right</b> to sell the property. From the proceeds, he may recover his claim. The most common example of such a <b>security</b> <b>right</b> is the mortgage on a house. Another <b>security</b> <b>right</b> is the right of pledge. Movable goods and claims can be pledged. In former days, a good could only be pledged if the good was actually handed over to the creditor. If the debtor did pay his loan, he got his property back. One could think of the pawnshop. Since 1992, the Dutch Civil Code offers the possibility to pledge a good, while the debtor stays in possession. This means that the debtor can then continue to use the good, for example if the pledged good is a machine that is necessary for the business operations of the debtor. This PhD thesis analyzes the consequences such invisible <b>security</b> <b>right</b> leads to. Imagine the situation that a third person buys the pledged good from the debtor. Or that a third party gives a loan to the debtor because he thinks that there are enough means of recovery against the debtor’s property. Should there be stricter requirements for invisible <b>security</b> <b>rights?</b> Is the insolvency administrator obliged to give the pledged machine, which is necessary for the business operations, back to the creditor? These and other questions are answered in the PhD thesis. Additionally, solutions are developed to address the arising problems...|$|R
40|$|Theories in the {{international}} political economy literature, economic liberalism and dependency, are explored {{in order to test}} the effect of U. S. aid, trade, and investment on human rights conditions in recipient states. Two measures of human rights conditions serve as dependent variables: <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> and subsistence rights. The data cover approximately 140 countries from 1976 - 1996. Pooled cross-sectional time series analysis, utilizing ordinary least squares (OLS) with panel corrected standard errors, is employed due to the temporal and spatial characteristics of the data. The results indicate that foreign assistance and economic policy {{may not be the best}} approaches to altering poor human rights practices in the area of <b>security</b> <b>rights.</b> Economic and military aid is negatively associated with levels of <b>security</b> <b>rights,</b> supporting the traditional dependency perspective. While the results from trade and investment are generally in the positive direction, the lack of consistent statistical evidence suggests that increased trade and investment relationships do not dramatically improve <b>security</b> <b>rights.</b> We can conclude, however, that trade and investment fail to have the negative effect on <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> in less developed countries which critics of globalization suggest. Economic aid has a statistically significant negative effect on subsistence rights, while military aid seems to benefit the human condition in recipient states. However, extreme negative effects on <b>security</b> <b>rights</b> accompany any benefit realized in the area of subsistence rights from military aid. Trade and investment have a positive and statistically significant effect on basic human needs providing support for the liberal perspective. It appears that American businesses and politicians can forge ahead with seemingly self-interested motivations and economic policies as American economic gain ironically serves to benefit the well being of citizens in other states. However, in spite of political rhetoric and even sincere intentions regarding foreign assistance policy, it appears that the road to human rights hell is paved with good intentions...|$|R
