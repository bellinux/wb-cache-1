25|$|Korsakoff's {{syndrome}} is often characterized by <b>confabulation,</b> disorientation, and profound amnesia.

40|$|Introduction. A working {{definition}} of <b>confabulations</b> {{would be to}} describe them as false memories that {{are the result of}} some problem in the process of retrieval, while the patient is unaware of their inaccuracy and genuinely believes them to be true. Several different types of <b>confabulations</b> have been reported, {{on the basis of a}} wide range of criteria. <b>Confabulations</b> may be seen in a wide assortment of neurological disorders and a great deal of controversy surrounds the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying them. Aims. To conduct an updated review in Spanish on the definition and different types of <b>confabulations,</b> as well as the neuropsychological correlates and the regions of the brain involved. Development. After reviewing the concept and different types of <b>confabulations,</b> the article moves on to describe the damaged regions of the brain in two pathologies in which <b>confabulations</b> may occur, namely Korsakoff’s syndrome and patients with ruptured aneurysms in the anterior communicating artery. The neuropsychological correlates associated with them are then reviewed. Conclusions. <b>Confabulations</b> are a complex phenomenon that is difficult to define. Probably the most widely accepted classification is the one based on the way they appear. Thus, a distinction is made between spontaneous and provoked <b>confabulations,</b> although it is not altogether clear just how valid such a differentiation is. As regards the crucial brain regions involved in <b>confabulations,</b> it seems that damage to the prefrontal cortex, and more specifically in the ventromedial and orbitofrontal areas, is necessary for the phenomenon to appear. Neuropsychological evidence suggests the presence, in most cases, of executive dysfunction and at least a certain degree of memory dysfunction as underlying mechanisms. The specific features of these neuropsychological dysfunctions, however, are still not well understood...|$|R

25|$|An honest lie (or <b>confabulation)</b> can be {{identified}} by verbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe history, background, and present situations. There is generally no intent to misinform and the individual is unaware that their information is false. Because of this, it is not technically a lie at all since by definition, {{there must be an}} intent to deceive for the statement to be considered a lie.|$|E
500|$|Since its release, Memento {{has been}} a widely noted topic of film discussion, both for its unique {{narrative}} structure and themes. Those searching for explanations of the film's plot have either resorted to online forums, message boards or scholarly material, or have ignored the film's official website and forums {{in order to maintain}} their own personal hypotheses. In an article for The Dissolve analyzing Nolan's work, Mike D'Angelo cites Memento as [...] "a masterful study in deliberate self-delusion," [...] alluding to Leonard's own actions {{towards the end of the}} film and his role as an unreliable narrator. On the same topic of self-deception, James Mooney of filmandphilosophy.com notes that the film suggests how [...] "our memories deceive us, or rather, sometimes we deceive ourselves by ‘choosing’ to forget or by manipulating our memories of past events." [...] This is much in line with a psychological analysis of the film, specifically the act of <b>confabulation.</b> Leonard's use of <b>confabulation</b> poses the dilemma, as explained by SUNY Downstate Medical Center Professor John Kubie for BrainFacts.org: [...] "In Memento we are faced with the question of how much of Leonard's memory of the past is real and how much constructed from beliefs and wishes." ...|$|E

Methods and resultsWe report two female patients with right FLE who exhibited fantastic <b>confabulations.</b> One of the patients had a 14 -year history of hypermotor seizures, and the other had a 10 -year history of dyscognitive seizures with automatism. Their fantastic <b>confabulations</b> arose {{in the context of}} moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment and of a variety of behavioral abnormalities, including emotional withdrawal and compulsive behaviors. ConclusionFantastic <b>confabulations</b> are rare but may be a relatively specific behavioral marker for FLE-associated psychosis...|$|R

2500|$|The usual {{process of}} sense {{cognition}} is entangled {{with what the}} Buddha terms [...] "papañca" [...] (conceptual proliferation), a distortion and elaboration in the cognitive process of the raw sensation or feeling (vedana). This process of <b>confabulation</b> feeds back into the perceptual process itself. Therefore, perception for the Buddhists is not just based on the senses, but also on our desires, interests and concepts and hence {{it is in a}} way unrealistic and misleading. The goal of Buddhist practice is then to remove these distractions and gain knowledge of things as they are (yatha-bhuta nadassanam).|$|E
2500|$|Korsakoff's {{syndrome}} {{can result}} from long-term alcoholism or malnutrition. It is caused by brain damage due to a vitamin B1 deficiency and will be progressive if alcohol intake and nutrition pattern are not modified. [...] Other neurological problems {{are likely to be}} present in combination with this type of Amnesia. Korsakoff's syndrome is also known to be connected with <b>confabulation.</b> It {{should be noted that the}} person's short-term memory may appear to be normal, but the person may have a difficult time attempting to recall a past story, or with unrelated words, as well as complicated patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Wilson {{argued that}} a large number of Stevenson’s cases {{consisted}} of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a higher caste. He speculated that such cases may represent a scheme to obtain money from the family of the alleged former incarnation. The philosopher Keith Augustine has written [...] "the vast majority of Stevenson's cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories." [...] According to the research of Robert Baker many of the alleged past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists can be explained in terms of known psychological factors. Baker has written that recalling past lives is a mixture of cryptomnesia and <b>confabulation.</b> The philosopher Paul Edwards noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions and is inconsistent with modern science.|$|E
50|$|In {{the regular}} process of reconstruction, several sources are used accrue {{information}} and add detail to a memory. For patients producing <b>confabulations,</b> some key {{sources of information}} are missing and so other sources are used to produce a cohesive, internally consistent and often believable false memory. The source and type of <b>confabulations</b> differ {{for each type of}} disease or area of traumatic damage.|$|R

50|$|<b>Confabulations</b> {{can also}} be {{detected}} using a free recall task, such as a self-narrative task. Participants are asked to recall stories (semantic or autobiographical) that are highly familiar to them. The stories recalled are encoded for errors that {{could be classified as}} distortions in memory. Distortions could include falsifying true story elements or including details from a completely different story. Errors such as these would be indicative of <b>confabulations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|That {{same year}} the {{rebuilding}} was already well underway. In {{a letter from}} the amateur architect Sir Thomas Robinson of Rokeby to his father-in-law Lord Carlisle of 6 June 1734, Sir Thomas reports that he found the garden front [...] "finished" [...] and that a start had been made on the main front: [...] "when finished 'twill be a stupendous fabric, infinitely superior to anything we have now in England," [...] and he adds [...] "The whole finishing will be entirely submitted to Lord Burlington, and I know of no subject's house in Europe will have 7 such magnificent rooms so finely proportioned as these will be." [...] In the 20thcentury, Nikolaus Pevsner would agree, but the mention of the architect-earl Burlington, arbiter of architectural taste, boded ill for the provincial surveyor-builder, Tunnicliffe. It is doubtless to Burlington's intervention that about this time, before the West Front was finished, the Earl of Malton, as he had now become, commissioned Henry Flitcroft to revise Tunnicliffe's plan there and build the East Front range. Flitcroft was Burlington's professional architectural amanuensis— [...] "Burlington Harry" [...] as he was called; he had prepared for the engravers the designs of Inigo Jones published by Burlington and William Kent in 1727, and in fact Kent was also called in for <b>confabulation</b> over Wentworth Woodhouse, mediated by Sir Thomas Robinson, though in the event the pedestrian Flitcroft was not unseated and continued to provide designs for the house over the following decade: he revised and enlarged Tunnicliffe's provincial Baroque West Front and added wings, as well as temples and other structures in the park. Contemporary engravings of the grand public East Front give Flitcroft as architect. [...] Flitcroft, right-hand man of the architectural dilettanti and fully occupied as well at the Royal Board of Works, could not constantly be on-site, however: Francis Bickerton, surveyor and builder of York, paid bills in 1738 and 1743.|$|E

40|$|<b>Confabulations</b> {{observed}} during head injury recovery were of two types; momentary and fantastic. Both occurred {{in relation to}} either the dysmnestic phase of early recovery or the post traumatic amnesic syndrome. In a follow-up of 174 head injured patients, all 12 patients evincing <b>confabulations</b> had suffered from acceleration injuries. In comparison to controls, they had a longer post traumatic amnesia period. Clinical and psychometric lateralization of the deficits pointed to left sided impairment. Their memory scores were not qualitatively or quantitatively {{different from those of}} equivalent controls. Patients differed from the controls in certain personality dimensions. Relative contribution of clinical deficits, memory impairment and personality dimensions to the occurrence of <b>confabulations</b> and its dynamic significance in maintaining the personal identity system of the patient are discussed...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study is reported of the retrieval by mock eyewitnesses of a scripted video crime event, comparing free recall against Change Temporal Order (CTO) recall, in which event retrieval is prompted in reverse order. Contrary to {{proponents of the}} technique who suggest that CTO allows greater discovery of script incidental information and increases {{the amount of information}} recalled, CTO was found to impair retrieval, leading to fewer script consistent events, reduced recall of correct information, increased <b>confabulations,</b> and lowered accuracy proportional to items retrieved. The disruptive effects of CTO are interpreted as providing further evidence for the role of temporal clustering highlighted in the CMR model of memory. Impairment induced by the CTO technique continued to influence retrieval negatively even during a secondary free recall phase. We suggest that CTO prevents the blocking of <b>confabulations,</b> and that these <b>confabulations</b> may subsequently contribute to forgetting by population dilution...|$|R

They found that contaminations were associated with schizophrenia and that <b>confabulations</b> and fabulized combinations were associated with severe mood disturbances and with borderline states. Much later, Blatt, Besser, and Ford [...] found that therapeutic gain in anaclitic and introjective inpatients was expressed in changes in different types of thought disorder. Therapeutic gain in anaclitic (relationally oriented) inpatients was expressed primarily in reductions in contaminations and <b>confabulations</b> (thought disorder with greater boundary disturbance) while therapeutic gain in introjective (self-oriented) inpatients was expressed primarily by reduction in the less seriously disturbed thought disorder responses, the fabulized combinations.|$|R
