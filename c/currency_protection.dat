They were variants of the “brokered loan confidence game”. The Arab connection was said to be a former Kuwaiti finance minister, plus other rogues like a retired Air Force general who was a “playboy and drunk”, someone hinting of links to the CIA, a fashionable interior decorator and other “convicted fraudsters, bankrupts and promoters of collapsed companies”.|$|E

40|$|Through policy {{decision}} of governments and through other unofficial means, many countries have {{moved away from}} their local <b>currency</b> to seek <b>protection</b> against inflation provided by a hard currency, the dollar. Among the promises of dollarization is the reduction of sovereign risk associated with developing country debts and subsequently {{an increase in the}} rate of economic growth as the cost of financing economic growth declines. This however may not occur as the loss of the policy tool could lead to inflexibility as the economy is not able to respond to shocks, resulting in an increase in sovereign risk. This paper explores the effect of dollarization on sovereign risk in Ecuador and concludes that dollarization does not decrease sovereign risk...|$|R

He operated in the Pacific; in July 1986 in the Cooks as a “Californian philanthropist with an interest in low-cost housing", then in Vanuatu offering to raise funds from Middle East sources for a new airport, then a fiasco in Tonga over an unbuilt [...] "Crown Prince Hotel", and talk of setting up an “International Bank of the South Pacific”.Lange suggested in Parliament that Raepple was the same man as one Werner Rohrich, who did have a police record.|$|R
40|$|This book {{constitutes}} the refereed {{proceedings of the}} three international workshops PAISI 2008, PACCF 2008, and SOCO 2008, held as satellite events of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics, ISI 2008, in Taipei, Taiwan, in June 2008. The 55 revised full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from the presentations at the workshops. The 21 papers of the Pacific Asia Workshop on Intelligence and Security Informatics (PAISI 2008) cover topics such as information retrieval and event detection, internet security and cybercrime, <b>currency</b> and data <b>protection,</b> cryptography, image and video analysis, privacy issues, social networks, modeling and visualization, and network intrusion detection. The Pacific Asia Workshop on Cybercrime and Computer Forensics (PACCF 2008) furnishes 10 papers about forensic information management, forensic technologies, and forensic principles and tools. The 24 papers of the Workshop on Social Computing (SOCO 2008) are organized in topical sections on social web and social information management, social networks and agent-based modeling, {{as well as social}} opinions, e-commerce, security and privacy considerations...|$|R
40|$|Credit Default Swaps (CDS) on a {{reference}} entity may be traded in multiple <b>currencies,</b> in that <b>protection</b> upon default may be offered {{either in the}} domestic currency where the entity resides, or in a more liquid and global foreign currency. In this situation currency fluctuations clearly introduce a source of risk on CDS spreads. For emerging markets, {{but in some cases}} even in well developed markets, the risk of dramatic Foreign Exchange (FX) rate devaluation in conjunction with default events is relevant. We address this issue by proposing and implementing a model that considers the risk of foreign currency devaluation that is synchronous with default of the reference entity. Preliminary results indicate that perceived risks of devaluation can induce a significant basis across domestic and foreign CDS quotes. For the Republic of Italy, a USD CDS spread quote of 440 bps can translate into a EUR quote of 350 bps {{in the middle of the}} Euro-debt crisis in the first week of May 2012. More recently, from June 2013, the basis spreads between the EUR quotes and the USD quotes are in the range around 40 bps. We explain in detail the sources for such discrepancies. Our modeling approach is based on the reduced form framework for credit risk, where the default time is modeled in a Cox process setting with explicit diffusion dynamics for default intensity/hazard rate and exponential jump to default. For the FX part, we include an explicit default-driven jump in the FX dynamics. As our results show, such a mechanism provides a further and more effective way to model credit / FX dependency than the instantaneous correlation that can be imposed among the driving Brownian motions of default intensity and FX rates, as it is not possible to explain the observed basis spreads during the Euro-debt crisis by using the latter mechanism alone...|$|R
