40|$|Fibre Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) is {{the next}} common-use {{instrument}} of Subaru Telescope. FMOS consists of three subsystems; the Prime focus unit for Infrared (PIR), the fibre positioning system/connector units, and the two infrared spectrographs. The PIR {{was transferred to the}} Subaru Observatory in the spring of 2005 to check the optical performance on the telescope. As a result of the test observation, we found that the adjustment of the optical axis between PIR and the primary mirror was difficult with the initial design of the corrector alignment stage. Furthermore, the optical axis of the telescope moved over a little owing to an earthquake in Hawaii Island in Oct. 2006. Therefore we decided to modify mechanical structure of PIR, the corrector alignment stage as well as the <b>cable</b> <b>wrapping</b> system. This modification was completed in the summer of 2007. In this proceeding, we report the mechanical structure of the new PIR and the results of the engineering observations...|$|E

40|$|Some seven {{different}} configurations of the NSI and other cables {{were tested in}} the NASA-MSFC Hot Gas Facility (HGF). The tests were conducted to study {{what happens to the}} cables when they are exposed to hot flow {{as was the case in}} the first two Shuttle flights, the STS- 1 and STS- 2. Protection of these components is vital for various functions especially to attain proper nozzle separation. The tests in the HGF demonstrated the severity of the aerodynamic forces combined with aero heating environment on the test cables and helped, in general, to evaluate the <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> materials and <b>cable</b> mounting hardware and technique. Blastape 2 <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> which is adequate for thermal protection of the cables must be properly clamped at its ends. The nylon clamps (or ties) used to secure cables to metal components inside the skirt could not withstand the heating.

50|$|The final {{commercial}} {{developments of}} <b>wrapped</b> <b>cable</b> systems {{took place in}} France in about 2005 when RTE, the national electricity transmission utility began to install substantial quantities of optical fibre cables including OPGW and <b>wrapped</b> <b>cables.</b> Two French contractors, Transel (part of the Bouygues group) and Omexom (a Vinci SA company), independently developed their own <b>wrapped</b> <b>cable</b> systems (known as câble optique enroulé (COE) in French) {{to participate in this}} program. Neither system had a product name other than COE or was marketed outside France. Both systems were withdrawn in about 2010 after a total of about 1000 km of <b>wrapped</b> <b>cable</b> installations for RTE.|$|R
50|$|ETFE is {{commonly}} used in the nuclear industry for tie or <b>cable</b> <b>wraps</b> and in the aviation and aerospace industries for wire coatings. This is because ETFE has better mechanical toughness than PTFE. In addition, ETFE exhibits a high-energy radiation resistance and can withstand moderately high temperatures {{for a long period}} of time. Commercially deployed brand names of ETFE include Tefzel by DuPont, Fluon by Asahi Glass Company, Neoflon ETFE by Daikin, and Texlon by Vector Foiltec.|$|R

5000|$|Pressure Vessels {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from concrete (PCV) or other materials which are weak in tension. <b>Cabling,</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the vessel or within the wall or the vessel itself, provides the necessary tension to resist the internal pressure. A [...] "leakproof steel thin membrane" [...] lines the internal wall of the vessel. Such vessels can be assembled from modular pieces and so have [...] "no inherent size limitations". There is also a high order of redundancy thanks to {{the large number of}} individual cables resisting the internal pressure.|$|R

50|$|Early {{tractors}} used belts or <b>cables</b> <b>wrapped</b> {{around the}} flywheel or a separate belt pulley to power stationary equipment, {{such as a}} threshing machine, buzz saw, silage blower, or stationary baler. In most cases, it was not practical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations).|$|R
50|$|Cyclic {{stress is}} the {{distribution}} of forces (aka stresses) that change over time in a repetitive fashion. As an example, consider {{one of the large}} wheels used to drive an aerial lift such as a ski lift. The wire <b>cable</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the wheel exerts a downward force on the wheel and the drive shaft supporting the wheel. Although the shaft, wheel, and cable move, the force remains nearly vertical relative to the ground. Thus a point {{on the surface of the}} drive shaft will undergo tension when it is pointing towards the ground and compression when it is pointing to the sky.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{minutes before}} 23:00 on 24 December, {{observers}} aboard Rapuhia felt the ship jerk, {{and noticed that}} the navigational lights on Titan were no longer visible; further inspection found that the tow-line had snapped, and the barge was found nearby, having rolled over. The official report states that Rapuhia towed the barge south to a suitable area for scuttling, but several {{people involved in the}} salvage and scuttling operation claim that the towing <b>cable</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the propeller shafts, and both Rapuhia and Titan drifted without control until divers cut the cable free. The crane arm fell off while the pontoon was inverted.|$|R
25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel <b>cable,</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|R

Before the jail was constructed, the constable of Gleeson chained his prisoners up to the [...] "jail tree", a large oak located in a nearby wash with a metal <b>cable</b> <b>wrapped</b> around it. The prisoner's right hand would be attached to the cable and he would remain there for however long, rain or shine.

Its construction was featured in a NOVA documentary entitled Super Bridge, which highlighted the challenges of building the bridge, especially during the Great Flood of 1993. Designed by Hanson Engineers under contract to Illinois Department of Transportation (DOT), the Clark Bridge was the first in the United States in which [...] "such a light steel-framed cable-stayed design was combined with a cable saddle type of pylon." [...] The bridge used 8,100 tons of structural steel; 44,100 cubic yards of concrete; and more than 160 miles of <b>cable</b> <b>wrapped</b> with four acres of yellow plastic piping.|$|R
40|$|Precise {{positioning}} {{and movement}} of heavy loads {{are two basic}} jobs for all-mechanical power amplifier. A capstan is simply a cylinder with a flexible body such as a string or <b>cable</b> <b>wrapped</b> around it. Capstans are generally used {{to assist in the}} lifting or pulling of heavy objects. By controlling the input tension on the cord, a capstan can dynamically amplify the input. It is hypothesized that a single capstan with multiple cords wrapped about it can act as numerous mechanical amplifiers. Present invention offers a new type of power amplifier which is structurally much simpler than previous amplifier. By using capstan friction principle mechanical power amplifier is designed for position and force controlling application...|$|R
50|$|The Seilbombe {{device was}} a box-like frame {{attached}} to the belly of plane with a roll of strong, detachable 70- to 80-foot long cables connected in series and attached {{to a set of}} pulleys, each cable having a small weight attached to one end. The fighter pilot would fly his craft low over sections of the electrical grid while trailing the cable beneath and behind it. When one <b>cable</b> <b>wrapped</b> around an electricity cable, it broke off, short-circuiting that cable. The Bordfunker ("radio operator") of the plane would then use a control box to reel out the next length of cable, and the Bf 110 would continue to the next section of the grid.|$|R

50|$|One of Grousset's most {{interesting}} science fiction novels was Les Exilés de la Terre — Selene-Company Limited (1887), {{probably one of}} the most fanciful cosmic tales of all times. In it, a consortium which intends to exploit the Moon’s mineral resources decides that, since our satellite is too far to be reached, it must be brought closer to the Earth. A Sudanese mountain composed of pure iron ore becomes the headquarters of the newly established Selene Company. Solar reflectors are used to provide the energy required to convert the mountain into a huge electro-magnet, with miles of <b>cables</b> <b>wrapped</b> around it. A spaceship-cum-observatory is then built on top of the mountain. When the experiment begins, the mountain is ripped away from the Earth and catapulted to the Moon. There, the protagonists have various adventures and eventually return to Earth by re-energizing the mountain.|$|R
25|$|A {{band brake}} {{consists}} of a band, strap, or <b>cable</b> that <b>wraps</b> around a drum that rotates with a wheel and is pulled tight to generate braking friction. Band brakes appeared as early as 1884 on tricycles. Star Cycles introduced a band brake in 1902 on its bicycles with freewheels. Band brakes are still manufactured for bicycles today.|$|R
40|$|A {{clear and}} {{rigorous}} definition of muscle moment-arms {{in the context}} of musculoskeletal systems modelling is presented, using classical mechanics and screw theory. The definition provides an alternative to the tendon excursion method, which can lead to incorrect moment-arms if used inappropriately due to its dependency on the choice of joint coordinates. The definition of moment-arms, and the presented construction method, apply to musculoskeletal models in which the bones are modelled as rigid bodies, the joints are modelled as ideal mechanical joints and the muscles are modelled as massless, frictionless <b>cables</b> <b>wrapping</b> over the bony protrusions, approximated using geometric surfaces. In this context, the definition is independent of any coordinate choice. It is then used to solve a muscle-force estimation problem for a simple 2 D conceptual model and compared with an incorrect application of the tendon excursion method. The relative errors between the two solutions vary between 0 % and 100 %...|$|R
50|$|The C-H band is a dual {{polarisation}} channel that covers from 3.22 - 3.39 GHzThe receiver {{consists of a}} choke ring axial corrugated horn that was designed by the Antenna Group at the Technical University of Madrid.

The two linear polarisations are then fed directly to two low noise cryogenically cooled amplifiers. Following 2nd stage amplification, conditioning and filtering the astronomical signal is mixed with a Local Oscillator signal at 2.555 GHz to give a 170 MHz IF bandwidth centred at 750 MHz. This IF is then re-routed to the backends {{in the control room}} some 5 metres below via a <b>cable</b> <b>wrap.</b> A phasecal signal is also injected to the IF module to remove phase errors.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the design and}} manufacture of an electromechanical device which implements an artificial version of the biological design known as a "Hydrostatic Skeleton". The possible {{benefits of the device}} include improved flexibility and versatility over traditional robot designs. Potential applications may include medical devices and underground or pipeline examination or repair robots. The device uses hydrostatic pressure to achieve rigidity and strength, while using an elastic, flexible design to gain flexibility and variety of motion. It consists primarily of a water-filled latex cylinder. Since the water is essentially incompressible, decreases in length are translated to corresponding increases in diameter and vice versa. Cables pulling longitudinally {{on the sides of the}} cylinder will provide force for longitudinal compression, and <b>cables</b> <b>wrapping</b> around the cylinder will provide circumferential stress.

40|$|The PS 2 {{telescope}} {{is the second}} {{in an array of}} wide-field telescopes that is being built for the Panoramic-Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) on Haleakala. The PS 2 design has evolved incrementally based on lessons learned from PS 1, but these changes should result in significant improvements in image quality, tracking performance in windy conditions, and reductions in scattered light. The optics for this telescope are finished save for their coatings and the fabrication for the telescope structure itself is well on the way towards completion and installation on-site late this year (2012). The most {{significant differences between the two}} telescopes include the following: secondary mirror support changes, improvements in the optical polishing, changes in the optical coatings to improve throughput and decrease ghosting, removal of heat sources inside the mirror cell, expansion of the primary mirror figure control system, changes in the baffle designs, and an improved <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> design.

40|$|The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) {{spacecraft}} was jointly {{developed by}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft launched on February 27, 2014.

50|$|The {{installation}} {{process for}} <b>wrapped</b> <b>cables</b> involves passing a drum of cable {{around and around}} the host conductor as the carrying device moves across the span. For installation on hosts within 10 m of the ground (medium or low voltage overhead lines), {{it is possible to}} pull the wrapping machine by hand from the ground below the line. However, a radio controlled power unit using batteries or a petrol engine is normally required when the host conductor is on a high voltage transmission line. <b>Wrapped</b> <b>cables</b> can be applied to earth wires (ground wires, shield wires) on power transmission lines and to phase conductors on transmission, sub-transmission or distribution lines.|$|R
40|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) {{project had}} a rapid {{development}} schedule starting with project conception in spring of 2004, instrument and launch vehicle selection late in 2005 and then launch in early 2009. The lunar thermal environment {{is one of}} the harshest in our solar system with the heavy infrared loading of the moon due to low albedo, lack of lunar atmosphere, and low effective regolith conduction. This set of constraints required a thermal design which maximized performance (minimized radiator area and cold control heater power) and minimized thermal hardware build at the orbiter level (blanketing, and heater service). The orbiter design located most of the avionics on an isothermalized heat pipe panel called the IsoThermal Panel (ITP). The ITP was coupled by dual bore heat pipes to an Optical Solar Reflector (OSR) covered heat pipe radiator. By coupling all of the avionics to one system, the hardware was simplified. The seven instruments were mainly heritage instruments which resulted in their desired radiators being located by their heritage design. This minimized instrument redesigns and therefore allowed them to be delivered earlier, though it resulted in a more complex orbiter level blanket and heater service design. Three of the instruments were mounted on a tight pointing M 55 J optical bench that needed to be covered in heaters to maintain pointing. Two were mounted to spacecraft controlled radiators. One was mounted to the ITP Dual Bores. The last was mounted directly to the bus structure on the moon facing panel. The propulsion system utilized four- 20 pound insertion thrusters and eight- 5 pound attitude control thrusters (ACS) in addition to 1000 kg of fuel in two large tanks. The propulsion system had a heater cylinder and a heated mounting deck for the insertion thrusters which coupled most of the propulsion design together simplifying the heater design. The High Gain Antenna System (HGAS) and Solar Array System (SAS) used dual axis actuator gimbal systems. HGAS required additional boom heaters to cool the approximately 10 W of RF losses thru the rotary joints and wave guides from the 40 W Ka system. By design this module needed a fair amount of heater, blanketing, and radiator complexity. The SAS system required a separate <b>cable</b> <b>wrap</b> radiator to help cool the Solar Array harness which dissipated 30 W thru the actuators and <b>cable</b> <b>wraps.</b> This module also was complex...|$|R
