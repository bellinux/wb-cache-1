Belleisle had passed through Breslau while Hyndford was there:--"am unable to inform your Lordship what success he has had."

[...] She had, in her <b>compressed</b> <b>state,</b> another pause, and {{it made her feel}} as if she were immensely resisting. Strange enough was this sense for her, and {{altogether}} new, the sense of possessing, by miraculous help, some advantage that, absolutely then and there, in the carriage, as they rolled, she might either give up or keep. Strange, inexpressibly strange--so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever. And what her husband's grasp really meant, as her very bones registered, was that she SHOULD give it up: it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic. He KNEW HOW to resort to it--he could be, on occasion, as she had lately more than ever learned, so munificent a lover: all of which was, precisely, a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely, a part of his large and beautiful ease, his genius for charm, for intercourse, for expression, for life. She should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didn't resist. To this, as they went, every throb of her consciousness prompted her--every throb, that is, but one, the throb of her deeper need to know where she [...] "really" [...] was. By the time she had uttered the rest of her idea, therefore, she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it; though she was also staring out of the carriage-window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen, indistinguishable, perhaps, happily, in the dusk. She was making an effort that horribly hurt her, and, as she couldn't cry out, her eyes swam in her silence. With them, all the same, through the square opening beside her, through the grey panorama of the London night, she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted; and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay.

50|$|If a plasma is cooled {{and under}} {{increasing}} pressure, {{it will eventually}} {{not be possible to}} compress the plasma any further. This is by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two fermions cannot share the same quantum state. When in this highly <b>compressed</b> <b>state,</b> since there is no extra space for any particles, a particle's location is extremely defined. Since the locations of the particles of a highly compressed plasma have very low uncertainty, their momentum is extremely uncertain. This is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔpΔx ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in the particle's momentum and Δx is the uncertainty in position. Therefore, even though the plasma is cold, such particles must on average be moving very fast. This leads to the conclusion that, in order to compress an object into a very small space, tremendous force is required to control its particles' momentum.|$|E
5000|$|Development {{of facial}} {{wrinkles}} {{is a kind}} of fibrosis of the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that wrinkles develop from incorrect repairs of injured elastic fibers and collagen fibers. Repeated extensions and compressions of the skin cause repeated injuries of extracellular fibers in derma. During the repairing process, some of the broken elastic fibers and collagen fibers are not regenerated and restored but replaced by altered fibers. When an elastic fiber is broken in an extended state, it may be replaced by a “long” collagen fiber. Accumulation of “long” collagen fibers makes part of the skin looser and stiffer, and as a consequence, a big fold of skin appears. When a “long” collagen is broken in a <b>compressed</b> <b>state,</b> it may be replaced by a “short” collagen fiber. The “shorter” collagen fibers will restrict the extension of [...] "longer" [...] fibers, and make the “long” fibers in a folding state permanently.

Fluids can be represented well by an equivalent system with only s ¼ 2 components (bidisperse). As little as s ¼ 3 components (tridisperse) are enough to achieve a maximally equivalent system. Those match macroscopic properties in glassy states, but also the volume fraction of rattlers, suggesting strong microstructural equivalency too. For many soft and granular systems, tridisperse, maximally equivalent systems allow for a closed analytical treatment and wellcontrolled industrial applications, while our proposal waits for experimental validation...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} effects of a uniform electric field on the conformation of single DNA molecules.

We observe two distinct types of expansion modes: a continuous molecular expansion analogous to a compressed spring expanding, and a much slower expansion characterized by two long-lived metastable states. Fluorescence microscopy and stretching experiments reveal that the metastable states are the result of intramolecular self-entanglements induced by the electric field.

In confocal sectioning of chondrocytes, the outlines were compared between the uncompressed and <b>compressed</b> <b>states</b> only in the central plane of each cell [7]. Furthermore, in image-based 3 D modeling of cells [8, 10, 16], the geometric change of an entire cell with the application of force or displacement that was seen in a numerical analysis was not compared with experimental results. By contrast, we obtained a contour map of cells in the unstretched and stretched states, enabling {{an analysis of the}} height-dependent deformation. Then, we compared the outline of cells on the substrate surface between the unstretched and stretched states, considering the deformation of the substrate. We also made finite element models and compared the theoretically predicted profiles with experimentally obtained outlines of cells at different heights. These techniques will lead to more accurate understanding of the three-dimensional deformation of cells subjected to various forces and displacements.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrophobic}} proteins SP-B and SP-C {{are essential}} for pulmonary surfactant function, {{even though they are}} a relatively minor component (< 2 % of surfactant dry mass). Despite countless studies, their specific differential action and their possible concerted role to optimize the surface properties of surfactant films have not been completely elucidated. Under conditions kept as physiologically relevant as possible, we tested the surface activity and mechanical stability of several surfactant films of varying protein composition in vitro using a captive bubble surfactometer and a novel (to our knowledge) stability test. We found that in the naturally derived surfactant lipid mixtures, surfactant protein SP-B promoted film formation and reextension to lower surface tensions than SP-C, and in particular played a vital role in sustaining film stability at the most <b>compressed</b> <b>states,</b> whereas SP-C produced no stabilization. Preparations containing both proteins together revealed a slight combined effect in enhancing film formation.
