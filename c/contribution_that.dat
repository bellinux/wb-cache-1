5|$|The Halo 3 Original Soundtrack was {{released}} in November 2007, and featured a fan <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> was the select winner {{from a pool of}} entries judged by O'Donnell, Rodgers, and others. All of O'Donnell's work on the series was repackaged as Halo Trilogy—The Complete Original Soundtracks in December 2008, alongside preview tracks written by Halo Wars composer Stephen Rippy. The music to ODST {{was released}} as a two-disc set to coincide with the game's release on September 22, 2009. Reachs soundtrack was available in digital formats the same day as the game's release on September 14; the physical two-disc soundtrack was released September 28.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> thrips make to their {{ecosystem}} is the damage {{they can cause}} during feeding. This impact may fall across a broad selection of prey items, as there is considerable breadth in host affinity across the order, and even within a species, varying degrees of fidelity to a described host remain. Family Thripidae in particular is notorious for members with broad host ranges, {{and the majority of}} pest thrips come from this family. For example, Thrips tabaci damages crops of onions, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{of classical music}} in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala. The {{development of}} the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala. Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music. This {{was the result of}} Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century. Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances. Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music: it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda. Panchavadyam is a form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument. Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter. Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E

25|$|Sorensen {{was one of}} the {{consultants}} who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era, before the Cold War made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. Anti-communism had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and anti-capitalism in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.|$|E
25|$|The Speaker {{also called}} on unions to make {{contributions}} {{to help in}} the Detroit settlement. Bolger requested unions to make a material <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> is reflective of other parties involved in the settlement. Bolger's request did not come without opposition, the Detroit Free Press issued an editorial claiming Governor Rick Snyder should convince Speaker Bolger to drop his demand or go around Bolger. The Detroit News editorialized that the union contribution demand was too much, and the likelihood of unions contributing would be slim. Other critics wrote that Bolger's demand would imperil the settlement. Bolger did receive support from conservative columnists and was urged to continue his demand. Bolger held firm to his request, and unions - the first was The Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council - did agree to make material contributions towards health care costs to help with the Detroit bankruptcy settlement. After unions agreed to contribution money towards the settlement, the Michigan House passed legislation with major bipartisan support.|$|E

25|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks. A conventional single hop system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as <b>contribution.</b> <b>That</b> is, cooperative diversity decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative {{diversity is}} an antenna diversity that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity. User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E
25|$|To be acceptable, any {{rule of law}} must {{be capable}} of being applied consistently, thus a {{definition}} of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B {{on the road and}} by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury {{and the extent to which}} B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.|$|E
500|$|According to photo {{historian}} David Burn [...] "there is a {{good case}} to be made for the proposition that the greatest <b>contribution</b> <b>that</b> Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography". In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.|$|E
