40|$|Model {{simulations}} on {{the basis}} of uniform (non-graded) sediment reveal a strong overestimation of the scour hole in the area directly to west of Maasvlakte I when compared to the measured scour hole. Data analysis shows that the scour hole developed in a former complex estuarine system. The analysis strongly suggests that erosion occurred through a number of different old (clay) layers. The presence of <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> can reduce the development of the scour hole considerably. Implementation of <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> in the Delft 3 d model showed that the erosion rate as observed in reality can be simulated with cohesive sediment. Armouring of the bed, erosion of fine sediments and the harder to erode coarser sediment remains, also result in a reduction of the scour hole. The armouring effect can be simulated in a schematized way by distinguishing a number of fractions and bed layers. Simulations show that armouring indeed reduces the development of the depth of the scour hole. However, the computed erosion is still considerably higher compared to the observed erosion rate. Computations for the Maasvlakte 2 indicate that the main flow characteristics are similar. It is expected that the development of the scour shows much resemblance. Therefore similar parameters can be used for the Maasvlakte 2 situation. The above mentioned mechanisms result in a lower erosion rate for the Maasvlakte 2 situation. The <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> are positioned deeper and therefore the armouring effect is also of importance. The development of the scour hole strongly depends on the bed composition while this composition is vaguely known because of inhomogeneity of the bed. Therefore the predictions of the Maasvlakte 2 are expected to be less accurate. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

These mechanical methods are usually superior to other connections, particularly when joining thick composite laminates. Stress distributions, damage modes and ultimate strengths in notched or bolted FRP laminate designs {{are of particular}} interest to the industrial community. To predict the ultimate strengths and the failure processes of notched or bolted composite laminates, nonlinear progressive damage analyses (PDA) based on the finite element method (FEM) at the meso-scale level are performed in this paper. A three-dimensional strength criterion in terms of strains, which can distinguish different damage modes, was developed and adopted in the analysis model to detect damage initiation in the laminates. Different material degradation methods and the influence of <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> were discussed and compared with results of verification experiments. The results showed that the analysis model that used the succinct strength criterion proposed in this paper could properly predict the damage initiation and the ultimate strengths of notched or bolted FRP laminates. The errors between the numerical results and experimental data were small. The material degradation method with continuum damage mechanics (CDM) -based exponential damage factors using the damage index as the independent variable achieved greater accuracy and convergence than the method with CDM-based exponential damage factors using the square index as the independent variable or than the method with constant damage factors. Adding <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> in the model had negligible influence on the final results, largely because the succinct analysis model proposed in this paper is sufficiently accurate in cases of small delamination...|$|R

This unusual element to the high tech array of equipment and processes came about after the exhaustive testing of the refractive index of countless varieties of commercially available oils, and to the surprise of the holographers concerned, none could surpass the efficacy of this product.

As the oil slowly seeped out between the film's surface and the two glass sheets the natural viscosity of the oil maintained an ultra-thin but <b>cohesive</b> <b>layer</b> that had the effect of gradually pulling the two glass sheets together with a level of force sufficient to flatten the film to within the tolerance level that allowed a consistent interference pattern to be recorded on the H1 master.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere is {{currently}} no accepted concept or approach for understanding and controlling discolouration {{risk associated with}} trunk mains. This paper assesses the applicability of <b>cohesive</b> <b>layer</b> theories to manage discolouration and a steady state empirical modelling tool that describes the process of particulate material accumulation. Results are presented from independent field experiments across the UK and internationally that evidence hydraulically induced mobilisation, or effectively cleaning, once imposed system shear stress exceeds normal conditions. Model calibration to measured data validates the <b>cohesive</b> <b>layer</b> concept with transferability in empirically derived parameters demonstrating a viable operational planning tool. The experiments highlight the accumulation of material layers as a continuous and ubiquitous process, such that fully clean pipes can never exist and helping explain how discolouration risk changes over time. A major practical implication of the novel understanding demonstrated in this paper is that discolouration risk in trunk mains can be simply managed by pro-active strategies that regularly vary the hydraulic conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} analysis of thin film delamination {{is based on}} the consideration of the film, which is subjected to residual stresses arising from the thermal mismatch between the film and the sub-strate, {{within the framework of the}} classical fracture me-chanics and the structural buckling theories. Such con-cepts as the energy release rate and the stress intensity factors are crucial in this case. A different approach to analysis of thin film delamination considers the effect of the compliant interface between the film and the substrate. This compliant interface is described by the traction-separation constitutive law. In the present work, a framework for modeling delami-nation of thin films is described in accordance with the latter ’decohesion ’ approach. The film is modeled as a geometrically nonlinear elastic beam attached to a rigid substrate with a <b>cohesive</b> <b>layer</b> of zero thickness. The co-hesive layer is described by normal and tangential trac-tions and corresponding displacement jumps. An expo-nential ’softening ’ constitutive law relates tractions and displacements of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>layer.</b> Such formulation allows for studying nucleation, propagation and arrest of local delaminations – edge cracks and blisters. This is in contrast to the traditional approach of the classical frac-ture mechanics where stress analysis is separated from a description of the actual process of material failure. Finite element analyses are carried out for the qualitative study of the influence of different parameters of the thin film and the <b>cohesive</b> <b>layer</b> as well as different thermal loads on delamination behavior of the film-substrate sys-tem. The results of the analysis show that the stability of the delamination propagation depends mainly on the shape of the thermal load and less on the distribution of the cohesive surface strength along the film. The loca-tion of the nucleation of the film separation is essentially sensitive to the combination of the cohesion propertie...|$|E

40|$|The {{erosion of}} the <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> of {{articulate}} matter that causes discolouration in water distribution system mains has previously been modelled using the Prediction of Discolouration in Distribution Systems (PODDS) model.

The model formulations and a mass transport model have been encoded as software, which has been used to verify the model’s constructs and undertake sensitivity analyses.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} new methodologies {{to improve}} the simulation of the orthogonal cutting of unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced plastic (UD-CFRP) composites. In a meso-scale approach, a new cohesive model was developed to overcome the excessive deformations shown by the generally implemented zero thickness cohesive elements.

Hydrofracturing occurred mainly sub-parallel to bedding in unlithified to semi-lithified sediments.

A third vein system comprises fibrous hydrofractures developed on the limbs of accretion-related folds. Crosscutting vein sets and the peculiar features of each identified vein set suggest that deformation was intricately associated with lithification and diagenetic processes. Dehydration-produced fluids transiently injected the lithifying sediments leading to local stress permutations.

40|$|International audienceIn Iceland, the Late Weichselian {{deglaciation}} led to paraglacial topographic readjustments in {{the form}} of extensivedeep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) and large rockslope failures (landslides and rock-avalanches). Here we provide age estimates for the Stí" uhólar landslide (Tröllaskagi Peninsula, Northern Central Iceland),which indicate that this occurred between the end of the Late Weichselian deglaciation (15 - 13 ka cal. yr. BP) and 8200 ± 1400 cal. yr. BP. Our surface observations also suggest that the Stífluhólar landslide was probably initiatedby propagation and connection of DSGSD failure planes. This observation suggests that the DSGSD can act as aprecursor for landsliding in paraglacial settings. However, further investigations are still required to fully assess therole of DSGSD as a landslide precursor, both at the local and at a regional scale. Comparisons with other examplesof paraglacial rock slope failures in Northern Iceland and in the world suggest that DSGSD is not the main orsuficient precondition for large landslides. The landslide of Stífluhólar occurred due to some combination offavorable preconditioning, predisposing and triggering controls.

Two layers were prepared: an inert layer of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and water and a second one wetted with the self-emulsifying system. Different formulations of both layers were tested, evaluating the effects of formulation variables with an experimental design. The screening amongst formulations was performed preparing rod extrudates and using the extrusion profiles to assess their suitability for extrusion and to anticipate quality of the spheronized extrudates. Tubular extrudates and co-extrudates/spheronized pellets were then produced. Two types of bi-layered pellets were prepared: type I with the self-emulsifying system internally and the inert matrix externally, whereas type II vice versa. The pellets were characterized for sizing and shape, density, hardness, in vitro dissolution and disintegration and released droplets size and in vivo tests. Although both types of pellets demonstrated adequate morphological and technological characteristics, pellets type II revealed an improved drug solubility and in vivo bioavailability.

40|$|Despite current {{management}} practices discoloured water events in both filtered and unfiltered water distribution systems {{continue to be}} a major issue for the water industry worldwide. Limited research has taken place into the formation and prediction of discoloured water events in unfiltered water distribution systems. The most widely adopted measuring techniques currently used by the majority of water companies to identify and measure discoloured water events, namely, discoloured water customer complaints and water quality grab samples, severely underestimate the extent to which discoloured water events occur. Customer complaints and grab samples also give little information as to the cause, time or magnitude of a discoloured water event. It is recommended that water companies not use discoloured water customer complaints or water quality grab samples for the prediction of areas at risk of forming discoloured water in unfiltered water distribution systems with lined or PVC pipes. This study demonstrates that monitoring sites for continuous on-line testing of turbidity and flow rate in series within the water supply network can be used effectively to investigate the operating environment of the system and understand the steady state hydraulics that cause discoloured water events in an unfiltered system. This new understanding can be used in preventative management of discoloured water events. This study investigated discoloured water formation in a 450 mm transfer main in Wantirna water quality zone of South East Water in Melbourne, Australia, as an example of an unfiltered water distribution system with few unlined ferrous pipes. The study found that the majority of discoloured water events could be explained by the erosion of <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> of particles formed on the internal pipe wall when a critical shear stress was exceeded in the pipe. For the system investigated, the critical shear stress was variable and could be estimated from the maximum applied shear stress reached in a particular section of pipe in the preceding 24 hours. It is therefore recommended that operational procedures, particularly isolated flushing procedures, be modified to reduce the occurrence of unplanned incidences of discoloured water when the critical shear stress of a pipe is exceeded. A hydraulic model and the method for estimating the critical shear stress outlined in this thesis could be used to test scenarios of operational procedures to identify pipes with increased likelihood of producing discoloured water. The <b>cohesive</b> <b>layers</b> which contribute to discoloured water events appear to form in less than 1 week. It is therefore also recommended that the mains cleaning techniques using flushing currently employed to remove material causing discoloured water events appear to have no medium or long term benefits for the system investigated and further investigation into the effectiveness of routine flushing programs for the prevention of discoloured water events is required. When the causes of discoloured water are understood, a system can be proactively managed to prevent discoloured water events by managing those causes.
