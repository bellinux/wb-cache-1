30|$|Cardiovascular {{insufficiency}} {{is characterized}} by an inadequate O 2 delivery relative to the metabolic demands. Shock can be, in the early stages, compensated by autonomic mechanisms, such regional vasoconstriction, {{in an attempt to}} maintain central blood pressure and vital organ perfusion above an anaerobic threshold. In this stage of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock,</b> microcirculatory measures, such as arterial pressure or cardiac output often are inside the range of values defined as normal and, therefore, insensitive as early predictors of subsequent decompensation due to the increased risk of tissue ischemia and subsequent development of multiorgan failure and death. However, microcirculation alterations in muscle and skin blood flow already occur during these early stages and measures of tissue cardiovascular reserve should be a sensitive early warning measure of impending cardiovascular collapse. Thus, a valid method to assess the microcirculatory status, such as the noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) when coupled with a functional hemodynamic monitoring test, such as the vascular occlusion test (VOT), may allow early identification of compensated circulatory shock and thus guide initial resuscitation efforts.|$|E

40|$|Mucosal capnometry {{involves}} the monitoring of partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} (PCO 2) in mucous membranes. Different techniques have been developed and applied for this purpose, including sublingual or buccal sensors, or special gastrointestinal tonometric devices. The primary use of these procedures is to detect <b>compensated</b> <b>shock</b> in critically ill patients or patients undergoing major surgery. Compensatory mechanisms, in the early phases of shock, lead to the redistribution of blood flow towards the vital organs, within ostensibly typical macro-haemodynamic parameters. Unfortunately, this may result in microcirculatory disturbances, which can play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of organ failure. In such circumstances mucosal capnometry monitoring, at different gastrointestinal sites, can provide a sensitive method for the early diagnosis of shock. The special PCO 2 monitoring methods assess the severity of ischaemia and help to define the necessary therapeutic interventions and testing of these monitors have justified their prognostic value. Gastrointestinal mucosal capnometry monitoring also helps in determining the severity of ischaemia and is a useful adjunctive in the diagnosis of occlusive splanchnic arterial diseases. The supplementary functional information increases the diagnostic accuracy of radiological techniques, assists in creating individualized treatment plans, and helps in follow-up the results of interventions.

40|$|Acute rat {{experiments}} {{have studied the}} impact of acute blood loss {{on the distribution of}} water fractions (total, free, and bound) in myocardial and hepatic tissues and whether detected impairments can be corrected by laser irradiation. They have provided an insight into the new pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for homeostatic disorders in blood loss and some aspects of the mechanism of action of laser emission on the body’s adaptive processes. The functioning of biopolymers and molecular structures in tissues is largely determined by their content of water. The redistribution of water towards to a blood loss-associated increase in bound water is a compensatory reaction aimed at preserving the biological structure of biopoly-mers. The decrease in hydrant-bound water suggests that there are severe derangements of their structure. The changes in the tissue free/bound water ratio reflect the degree of the body’s dysadaptation to blood loss.

30|$|Recently, {{increased}} interest in a more proactive use of monitoring technologies has emerged, using {{the response to the}} measured variables to a defined stress to unveil the physiological state of the subject. This entire field when applied to the assessment of cardiovascular state is referred to as functional hemodynamic monitoring. Within this context, we can define functional hemodynamic monitoring as the assessment of the dynamic interactions of hemodynamic variables in response to a defined perturbation [1]. Such dynamic responses result in emergent parameters of these commonly reported variables that greatly increase the ability of these measures to define cardiovascular state and predict response to therapy. At the present time, the primary types of functional hemodynamic monitoring for which clinical trials have shown clinical usefulness are related to predicting volume responsiveness and identifying occult cardiovascular insufficiency (<b>compensated</b> <b>shock).</b> The primary form of this approach, predicting volume responsiveness, was reviewed recently in this journal, so will only be briefly described in this article. However, like any form of monitoring parameter, its sensitivity and specificity improves if its pretest probability is higher. Thus, a fundamental concept often ignored by proponents of functional hemodynamic monitoring approaches is the integration of other clinical variables, such as the clinical condition, serum lactate levels, etc., a priori into the decision analysis of cardiovascular instability and its response to therapy. In essence, functional hemodynamic monitoring, though profoundly insightful in its values, is only another parameter that needs to be integrated into the greater view of patient care if its use is to realize its full potential.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{is a method}} for non-invasive continuous monitoring of muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2). In trauma patients normal parameters of macrocirculation does not exclude the possibility of disturbances in regional perfusion. It {{has been suggested that}} StO 2 levels can detect microcirculatory disturbances early and select patients in states of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock.</b> The purpose of this literature review is to sum up the current literature on the use of NIRS as a diagnostic tool during hypovolemia in trauma patients. Material and methods: The following search words “(Near {{infrared spectroscopy}} OR NIRS) AND (hypovolemia OR shock) ” used in the PubMed database generated 221 articles and lead to the inclusion of 25 articles and reviews. In addition textbooks have been used and the references of the selected articles have been reviewed in order to find additional information. Results and discussion: In the reviewed articles, low StO 2 values have been associated with negative outcomes among trauma patients. Likewise, the need of transfusions and other lifesaving interventions have been related to lower StO 2 values. However, the StO 2 values did not manage to differentiate between milder levels of shock. None of the studies used NIRS as a tool to guide treatment. A major obstacle when comparing studies has been the lack of uniformity regarding application of the NIRS device and study protocols. Conclusion: NIRS technology, although promising, does not yet have enough support in literature to be routinely used as a diagnostic tool among hypovolemic trauma patients. Further studies with greater statistical power are required to determine NIRS future role in trauma care...|$|E

30|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the alterations in VOT StO 2 response {{are related to the}} outcome has been proved in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock by Creteur et al. [13]. Furthermore, when comparing hemodynamically stable patients without infection (controls) and healthy volunteers, these differences in the septic patients were striking. Using near-infrared spectroscopy VOT StO 2, they assessed the slope of increase in StO 2 release as well as the difference between the maximum StO 2 and the StO 2 baseline (Δ). Both the slope of ReO 2 and the Δ were significantly lower in septic patients than in control subjects and healthy volunteers. In the sample of septic patients, the slopes also were significantly lower in the ones who had cardiovascular insufficiency. ReO 2 slopes were higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors and also tended to increase during resuscitation in survivors but not in nonsurvivors. Finally, the ReO 2 slope was found to be a good predictor of ICU death, with a cutoff value of 2.55 %/sec (sensitivity 85 %, specificity 73 %). These data confirm that the alterations in VOT StO 2 ReO 2 are related more to the sepsis process itself and its severity than to mean arterial pressure or vasopressor agent's dose. Importantly, the magnitude of this ReO 2 slope alteration {{is directly related to the}} septic disease and their presence in the first 24 hours of septic process and their persistence of delayed ReO 2 slope is related to the patient's outcome. Still, if the StO 2 ReO 2 does reflect inadequate tissue perfusion then it also should be sensitive of an impending cardiovascular insufficiency state (<b>compensated</b> <b>shock)</b> if matched with other static measures of tissue ischemia.|$|E
40|$|Background: Fluid {{resuscitation}} is {{not only}} used to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) but fluid management is also a cornerstone of treatment for patients with established AKI and renal failure. Ultrafiltration removes volume initially from the intravascular compartment inducing a relative degree of hypovolemia. Normal reflex mechanisms attempt to sustain blood pressure constant despite marked changes in blood volume and cardiac output. Thus, <b>compensated</b> <b>shock</b> with a normal blood pressure is {{a major cause of}} AKI or exacerbations of AKI during ultrafiltration. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE, Google Scholar and PubMed searches. We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2 -day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions. In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated clinical practice recommendations and/or directions for future research. Results: We defined three aspects of fluid monitoring: i) normal and pathophysiological cardiovascular mechanisms; ii) measures of volume responsiveness and impending cardiovascular collapse during volume removal, and; iii) measured indices of each using non-invasive and minimally invasive continuous and intermittent monitoring techniques. The evidence documents that AKI can occur in the setting of normotensive hypovolemia and that under-resuscitation represents a major cause of both AKI and mortality ion critically ill patients. Traditional measures of intravascular volume and ventricular filling do not predict volume responsiveness whereas dynamic functional hemodynamic markers, such as pulse pressure or stroke volume variation during positive pressure breathing or mean flow changes with passive leg raising are highly predictive of volume responsiveness. Numerous commercially-available devices exist that can acquire these signals. Conclusions: Prospective clinical trials using functional hemodynamic markers in the diagnosis and management of AKI and volume status during ultrafiltration need to be performed. More traditional measure of preload be abandoned as marked of volume responsiveness though still useful to assess overall volume status...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is a {{major cause}} of soldier death; it must be quickly {{identified}} and appropriately treated. We developed a prototype patient monitor that noninvasively and continuously determines muscle oxygen saturation (SmO(2)), muscle pH (pHm), and a regional assessment of blood volume (HbT) using near-infrared spectroscopy. Previous demonstration in a model of progressive, central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) showed that SmO(2) provided an early indication of impending hemodynamic instability in humans. In this review, we expand the number of subjects and provide an overview {{of the relationship between the}} muscle and sublingual microcirculation in this model of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock.</b> METHODS: Healthy human volunteers (n = 30) underwent progressive LBNP in 5 -minute intervals. Standard vital signs, along with stroke volume (SV), total peripheral resistance, functional capillary density, SmO(2), HbT, and pHm were measured continuously throughout the study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: SmO(2) and SV significantly decreased during the first level of central hypovolemia (- 15 mm Hg LBNP), whereas vital signs were later indicators of impending cardiovascular collapse. SmO(2) declined with SV and inversely with total peripheral resistance throughout LBNP. HbT was correlated with declining functional capillary density, suggesting vasoconstriction as a cause for decreased SmO(2) and subsequently decreased pHm. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The monitor has been miniaturized to a 58 -g solid-state sensor that is currently being evaluated on patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Early results demonstrate significant decreases in SmO(2) similar to those observed with progressive reductions in central blood volume. As such, this technology has the potential to (1) provide a monitoring capability for both nontraumatic and traumatic hemorrhage and (2) help combat medics triage casualties and monitor patients during lengthy transport from combat areas...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{severity}} of the financial market crisis most central banks reached the limits of their traditional monetary policy instruments and relied to a very large extent on instruments of unconventional monetary policy. In our paper we develop a simple theoretical framework for the money supply process which is able to analyze the need for such measures as well as their implications for the banking system. The paper starts with a presentation of a price-theoretic model for the money supply under "normal conditions". It then shows how the different shocks of the financial market crisis have affected the market for bank loans and how a central can <b>compensate</b> such <b>shocks.</b> The need for unconventional measures derives from the size of these shocks and the zero lower bound of the central bank's policy rate. Under such conditions the central bank can only stabilize the loan market by providing direct loans to the non-bank sector. A by-product of this approach is a net creditor position of the banking system vis-à-vis the central bank which can lead to high excess reserves and a "decoupling" of the policy rate and the level of reserves.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The most {{effective}} rate of fluid resuscitation in haemorrhagic shock is unknown. METHODS: We performed a randomized crossover pilot study {{in a healthy}} volunteer model of <b>compensated</b> haemorrhagic <b>shock.</b> Following venesection of 15  mL/kg of blood, participants were randomized to 20  mL/kg of crystalloid over 10 min (FAST treatment) or 30 min (SLOW treatment). The primary end point was oxygen delivery (DO 2). Secondary end points included pressure and flow-based haemodynamic variables, blood volume expansion, and clinical biochemistry. RESULTS: Nine normotensive healthy adult volunteers participated. No significant differences were observed in DO 2 and biochemical variables between the SLOW and FAST groups. Blood volume was reduced by 16 % following venesection, with a corresponding 5 % reduction in cardiac index (CI) (P <  0. 001). Immediately following resuscitation the increase in blood volume corresponded to 54 % of the infused volume under FAST treatment and 69 % of the infused volume under SLOW treatment (P =  0. 03). This blood volume expansion attenuated with time to 24 % and 25 % of the infused volume 30 min postinfusion. During fluid resuscitation, blood pressure was higher under FAST treatment. However, CI paradoxically decreased in most participants during the resuscitation phase; a finding not observed under SLOW treatment. CONCLUSION: FAST or SLOW fluid resuscitation had no significant impact on DO 2 between treatment groups. In both groups, changes in CI and blood pressure did not reflect the magnitude of intravascular blood volume deficit.

40|$|Systemic infection, major surgery, {{trauma and}} many other causes can lead to {{impaired}} organ function. <b>Compensated</b> <b>shock</b> is not detected by global hemodynamic and oxygen measurements, as they take no account for regional variations. Focus has therefore gradually turned from looking at systemic changes to selective investigations of regional blood flow and ischemia. This thesis presents a series of experiments evaluating new application and validation of various monitoring techniques. An experimental porcine model with anesthetized and invasively monitored animals was used. The circulatory interventions included endotoxin infusion (septic shock), aortic constriction and selective clamping of splanchnic arteries. The aim was to compare air with saline tonometry, to validate the intraperitoneal use of tonometry and to reexamine the use of endoluminal reflectance pulse oxymetry. To investigate the relative contributions of regional blood flow and detection of ischemia, measurements of hepatic venous oxygen saturation (ShvO 2), lactate concentrations and PCO 2 gap were used. Our findings {{support the use of}} air instead of saline as the preferred technique for tonometric measurements. With the intraperitoneal application of tonometry we gain more information on regional aspects of the splanchnic circulation, and {{it appears to be a}} reliable monitoring option for early detection of ischemia in the small intestine. Measurements of ShvO 2 will give an overall reflection of the intestinal circulation. The sigmoid colonic pulse oximetry showed a non-linear response in relation to regional blood flow, and will therefore not be able to detect gradual changes in oxygen saturation. Determination of the regional to endtidal PCO 2 gap might prove valuable for monitoring of the intestinal circulation. Because of sophisticated interactions between portal and hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic compensation for regional ischemia, a combination of monitoring techniques might be needed. The results of this study will hopefully encourage clinical evaluation of intraperitoneal tonometry and endtidal PCO 2 gap recordings for non-invasive, semi-continuous, trend monitoring of the splanchnic circulation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine whether}} {{hypovolemia}} {{is an important}} cause of the acidosis in children with severe malaria. DESIGN: Prospective phase 1 study examining the safety of volume expansion using detailed hemodynamic monitoring. SETTING: High-dependency unit of Kilifi District Hospital {{on the coast of}} Kenya. PATIENTS: Kenyan children admitted with clinical features of severe malaria (impaired consciousness or deep breathing) complicated by acidosis (base excess of less than - 8). Three groups were considered: severe malarial anemia plus acidosis if hemoglobin of < 5 mg/dL and base excess less than - 8; moderate malaria acidosis if the base excess was between - 8 and - 15; severe malaria acidosis if the base excess was less than - 15. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received between 10 and 40 mL/kg of either 0. 9 % normal saline or 4. 5 % human albumin solution. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 53 children were recruited, and all had evidence of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock</b> at admission, with tachycardia, tachypnea, and prolonged capillary refill time. Mean central venous pressure (se) at admission was 2. 9 cm H(2) O (0. 5 cm H(2) O); in the severe malaria acidosis group, 44 % had hypotension (systolic blood pressure of < 80 mm Hg). Improvements of hemodynamic indices and a reduction in acidosis followed administration of either saline or albumin. By 8 hrs, mean central venous pressure had increased to 7. 5 cm H(2) O (0. 5 cm H(2) O, F = 34. 4, p <. 001) and was associated with a reduction in mean respiratory rate from 49 to 41 breaths/min (2 to 1 breaths/min, respectively; F = 7. 0; p =. 009), a reduction in tachycardia from 151 to 141 beats/min (5 to 3 beats/min, respectively; F = 3. 4; p =. 06), and a reduction in capillary refill time. No child developed evidence of the life threatening complications of pulmonary edema and increased intracranial pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Volume depletion is present at admission in the majority of children with severe malaria complicated by acidosis. Volume expansion corrects the hemodynamic abnormalities and is associated with improved organ function and reduction in acidosis.

40|$|The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1 - 4) {{cause the}} most {{prevalent}} mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans worldwide. In 2009, Nicaragua experienced the largest dengue epidemic in over a decade, marked by unusual clinical presentation, as observed in two prospective studies of pediatric dengue in Managua. From August 2009 -January 2010, 212 dengue cases were confirmed among 396 study participants at the National Pediatric Reference Hospital. In our parallel community-based cohort study, 170 dengue cases were recorded in 2009 - 10, compared to 13 - 65 cases in 2004 - 9. In both studies, significantly more patients experienced "compensated shock" (poor capillary refill plus cold extremities, tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or weak pulse) in 2009 - 10 than in previous years (42. 5 % [90 / 212] vs. 24. 7 % [82 / 332] in the hospital study (p< 0. 001) and 17 % [29 / 170] vs. 2. 2 % [4 / 181] in the cohort study (p< 0. 001). Signs of poor peripheral perfusion presented significantly earlier (1 - 2 days) in 2009 - 10 than in previous years according to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In the hospital study, 19. 8 % of subjects were transferred to intensive care, compared to 7. 1 % in previous years - similar to the cohort study. DENV- 3 predominated in 2008 - 9, 2009 - 10, and 2010 - 11, and full-length sequencing revealed no major genetic changes from 2008 - 9 to 2010 - 11. In 2008 - 9 and 2010 - 11, typical dengue was observed; only in 2009 - 10 was unusual presentation noted. Multivariate analysis revealed only " 2009 - 10 " as a significant risk factor for Dengue Fever with <b>Compensated</b> <b>Shock.</b> Interestingly, circulation of pandemic influenza A-H 1 N 1 2009 in Managua was shifted such that it overlapped with the dengue epidemic. We hypothesize that prior influenza A H 1 N 1 2009 infection may have modulated subsequent DENV infection, and initial results of an ongoing study suggest increased risk of shock among children with anti-H 1 N 1 - 2009 antibodies. This study demonstrates that parameters other than serotype, viral genomic sequence, immune status, and sequence of serotypes {{can play a role}} in modulating dengue disease outcome...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{disasters}} trigger large inequalities between affected {{households and}} the rest of the community. The extent to which villages <b>compensate</b> for these <b>shocks</b> allegedly depends on the pressure imposed by the group of needy families. I model two major threats to redistribution - (i) the emergence of acoalition of winners willing to shy away from redistributing to their peers and (ii) the initial fractionalization of the community. Matching data on a wave of tropical typhoons with a panel household survey in Vietnam, I find less redistribution in villages where needy families are in the minority. Whereas 17 cents on average are covered through informal transfers for a relative income loss of $ 1, access to liquidity falls below 10 cents when heavily affected households are isolated in the commune. In line with the existing literature, minorities participate less in the resources reallocation. Despite these barriers to full insurance, risk-sharing through informal transfers is still economically significant. This result is related with the findings that communities having suffered important trauma show greater signs of resilience and cohesiveness. natural disasters; informal risk-sharing; social insurance; altruism...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies how {{inflation}} as a macroeconomic indicator affects nominal bond prices. I {{consider an}} economy with a representative agent with Epstein- Zin preferences. Regime switching affects the state-space capturing inflation and consumption growth. Thus, the agent {{is concerned about}} the intertemporal distribution of risk, which is affected by the persistence of the variables and the regimes. Regime switching allows for structural changes in the volatility of unexpected shocks. To the extent that inflationary unexpected shocks indicate lower consumption growth, nominal bond holders need to be <b>compensated</b> for these <b>shocks.</b> It follows that a switch in the regime state affecting the covariance of inflation and consumption growth can be interpreted as a change in the price of risk. I find coefficients of risk aversion from 40 to 90, and subjective discount factors above 0. 99, depending on the exact specification of the model. The model yields have on average a positive slope, a consistent Principal Components decomposition, and predictability as in Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002).

40|$|The {{effect of}} reperfusion {{following}} hemorrhagic shock on splanchnic prostanoid release was studied. Anesthetized male rats were bled to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30 mmHg for 30 minutes and either killed or treated with shed blood for 60 {{minutes and then}} killed. The superior mesenteric arterial bed was cannulated and perfused in vitro with oxygenated Krebs. Collected venous effluent (up to 180 minutes) was analyzed for 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha (PGI 2 metabolite), PGE 2, PGF 2 alpha, and thromboxane B 2 by radioimmunoassay in shock, shock plus reperfusion, and sham groups. The major prostanoid released was 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha and was three times higher in the shock group compared to the sham group (p less than 0. 05). Reperfusion of shed blood abolished the increase in 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha found in the shock group (p less than 0. 05). These data show that the attempt of the rat splanchnic bed to <b>compensate</b> for hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> by increasing release of PGI 2 (potent vasodilator) was abolished during reperfusion of blood...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Children {{with severe}} {{malnutrition}} who develop shock {{have a high}} mortality. Contrary to contemporaneous paediatric practice, current guidelines recommend use of low dose hypotonic fluid resuscitation (half-strength Darrows/ 5 % dextrose (HSD/ 5 D). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of this guideline compared to resuscitation with a standard isotonic solution. Methods A Phase II randomised controlled, safety and efficacy trial in Kenyan children aged over 6 months with severe malnutrition and shock including children with severe dehydration/shock and presumptive septic shock (non-diarrhoeal shock). Eligible children were randomised to HSD/ 5 D or Ringer's Lactate (RL). A maximum of two boluses of 15 ml/kg of HSD/ 5 D were given over two hours (as recommended by guidelines) while those randomised to RL received 10 ml/kg aliquots half hourly (maximum 40 ml/kg). Primary endpoint was resolution of shock at 8 and 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included resolution of acidosis, adverse events and mortality. Results 61 children were enrolled: 41 had shock and severe dehydrating diarrhoea, 20 had presumptive septic shock; 69 % had decompensated shock. By 8 hours response to volume resuscitation was poor with shock persisting in most children:-HSD/ 5 D 15 / 22 (68 %) and RL 14 / 25 (52 %), p = 0. 39. Oliguria was more prevalent at 8 hours in the HSD/ 5 D group, 9 / 22 (41 %), compared to RL- 3 / 25 (12 %), p = 0. 02. Mortality was high, HSD/ 5 D- 15 / 26 (58 %) and RL 13 / 29 (45 %); p = 0. 42. Most deaths occurred within 48 hours of admission. Neither pulmonary oedema nor cardiogenic failure was detected. Conclusions Outcome was universally poor characterised by persistence of shock, oliguria and high case fatality. Isotonic fluid was associated with modest improvement in shock and survival when compared to HSD/ 5 D but inconclusive due to the limitations of design and effectiveness of either resuscitation strategy. Although isotonic fluid resuscitation {{did not result in}} cardiogenic heart failure, as previously feared, we conclude that the modest volumes used and rate of infusion were insufficient to promptly correct shock. The adverse performance of the recommended fluid resuscitation guideline for severe malnutrition should prompt clinical investigation of isotonic fluids for resuscitation of <b>compensated</b> <b>shock,</b> defining rate and volumes required to inform future guidelines.

40|$|In this paper, we draw {{life cycle}} {{inequality}} profiles for cohorts born between 1921 and 1975 and observed from 1974 to 2005 from a pseudo-panel of French households. While cross-sectional inequality {{has not changed}} much over the period, the within cohort inequality has increased substantially with age. Using the interplay between income and consumption, we decompose the change in inequality into a permanent and a transitory component. The former, called income risk, measures shocks affecting income which are transmitted to consumption levels, while the latter affects income but can be smoothed and thus {{does not have an}} impact on the consumption distribution. We find that income risk increases with age, while transitory shocks remain broadly constant over a lifetime. The decomposition sheds light on the diverging trends over time between income and consumption inequality. Consumption inequality has increased since the middle of the nineties because the population has aged, and permanent shocks increase with age, while income inequality has not changed much because of negative transitory <b>shocks</b> that have <b>compensated</b> the permanents <b>shocks.</b> JEL: D 31, D 12. / KEY WORDS: Inequality, Consumption Distribution, Income Risk...|$|R
40|$|This {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the frequency, etiology, type and outcome of shock in hospitalized children in the age group of 1 month to 15 years. There were 98 cases of shock, constituting 4. 3 % out of total admissions. Mean age was 2. 8 ± 3. 4 years. Maximum number of patients (39) was seen in infancy. Hypovolemic shock due to acute diarrheal disease was the commonest type (45. 9 %) followed by septic, cardiogenic and distributive <b>shock.</b> <b>Compensated</b> stage was common in hypovolemic shock (88. 9 %) whereas majority of patients with septic shock (73. 5 %) presented in decompensated stage. Overall survival was 73. 6 %. The survival rate was best in hypovolemic shock (97. 7 %) followed by septic(53. 3 %) and cardiogenic shock(43. 7 %). Inotropes and ventilatory support were required in 46 % and 23 % patients, respectively.

40|$|Adaptive {{variation}} {{tends to}} emerge clinally along environmental gradients or discretely among habitats with limited connectivity. However, in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), a population genetic discontinuity {{appears in the}} absence of obvious barriers to gene flow along parallel salinity clines and coincides with a physiologically stressful salinity. We show that populations resident on either side of this discontinuity differ in their abilities to <b>compensate</b> for osmotic <b>shock</b> and illustrate the physiological and functional genomic basis of population variation in hypoosmotic tolerance. A population native to a freshwater habitat, upstream of the genetic discontinuity, exhibits tolerance to extreme hypoosmotic challenge, whereas populations native to brackish or marine habitats downstream of the discontinuity lose osmotic homeostasis more severely and take longer to recover. Comparative transcriptomics reveals a core transcriptional response associated with acute and acclimatory responses to hypoosmotic shock and posits unique mechanisms that enable extreme osmotic tolerance. Of the genes that vary in expression among populations, those that are putatively involved in physiological acclimation are more likely to exhibit nonneutral patterns of divergence between freshwater and brackish populations. It is not the well-known effectors of osmotic acclimation, but rather the lesser-known immediate-early responses, that appear important in contributing to population differences...|$|R
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of IMF lending in 1947, the staff understood that countries could have difficulty financing their balance of payments for two reasons: either because their economic policies were inadequate or because of circumstances beyond their control. With experience, though, the Fund realized a basic lesson. Even if {{the root cause of}} the problem was an external shock, such as a weak market for the country’s exports, policies would have to be adjusted to <b>compensate</b> unless the <b>shock</b> was temporary and the gap could be covered by a repayable loan. Because few shocks could be judged reliably to be “temporary, ” the Fund increasingly conditioned its lending on policy adjustments. This confidence in and reliance on conditionality reached its zenith in the 1990 s. Of course, to paraphrase Leo Tolstoy, every unhappy country is unhappy in its own way. Every country that asks to borrow from the IMF faces a unique set of circum-stances that requires a tailored response. The policy conditions and the mix of adjust-ment and financing must reflect the context. Throughout this decade, the Fund made a number of changes to its policies on conditionality, and it introduced new specialized lending windows in response to changing world conditions. This chapter reviews the overall pattern of Fund lending, policy advice, and technical assistance in the 1990 s and the various changes that the Fund introduced...|$|R
