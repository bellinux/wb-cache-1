50|$|MIL-DTL-5015 {{circular}} connectors {{are used}} primarily for their ease of engagement and disengagement, ability to house {{different types of}} contacts, {{a wide range of}} allowable contact voltages and currents, and their rugged mechanical performance under a variety of environmental conditions. Their primary disadvantage is loss of panel space when used in arrays when compared to rectangular <b>connector</b> <b>housings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some <b>connector</b> <b>housings</b> are {{designed}} with locking mechanisms to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. Locking mechanism designs include locking levers of various sorts, screw locking, and toggle or bayonet locking. Depending on application requirements, housings with locking mechanisms may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure {{the integrity of the}} electrical connection and housing seals.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid <b>{{connector}}s</b> have <b>housings</b> with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being pneumatic line connectors, and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual cable and connector assemblies.|$|R

IEC 60309-2 specifies a range of mains power <b>connectors</b> with circular <b>housings,</b> and different numbers and arrangements of pins for different applications. IEC 60309-3 dealt with connectors for use in explosive gas environments, but was withdrawn in 1998.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Multi-material components, {{which contain}} metal parts {{surrounded}} by plastic materials, are highly interesting for inspection using industrial 3 D X-ray computed tomography (3 DXCT). Examples of this application scenario are <b>connectors</b> or <b>housings</b> with metal inlays {{in the electronic}} or automotive industry. A major problem {{of this type of}} components is the presence of metal, which causes streaking artifacts and distorts the surrounding media in the reconstructed volume. Streaking artifacts and dark-band artifacts around metal components significantly influence the material characterization (especially for the plastic components). In specific cases these artifacts even prevent a further analysis. Due to the nature and the different characteristics of artifacts, the development of an efficient artifact-reduction technique in reconstruction-space is rather complicated. In this paper we present a projection-space pipeline for metal-artifacts reduction. The proposed technique first segments the metal in the spatial domain of the reconstructed volume in order to separate it from the other materials. Then metal parts are forward-projected on the set of projections in a way that metal-projection regions are treated as voids. Subsequently the voids, which are left by the removed metal, are interpolated in the 2 D projections. Finally, the metal is inserted back into the reconstructed 3 D volume during the fusion stage. We present a visual analysis tool, allowing for interactive parameter estimation of the metal segmentation. The results of the proposed artifact-reduction technique are demonstrated on a test part as well as on real world components. For these specimens we achieve a significant reduction of metal artifacts, allowing an enhanced material characterization.

50|$|The wires {{are first}} {{cut to the}} desired length, usually using a special wire-cutting machine. The wires may also be printed on by a special machine during the cutting process or on a {{separate}} machine. After this, {{the ends of the}} wires are stripped to expose the metal (or core) of the wires, which are fitted with any required terminals or <b>connector</b> <b>housings.</b> The cables are assembled and clamped together on a special workbench, or onto a pin board (assembly board), according to the design specification, to form the cable harness. After fitting any protective sleeves, conduit, or extruded yarn, the harness is either fitted directly in the vehicle or shipped.|$|E
50|$|Some audio {{multicore}} cables are {{fitted with}} hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors {{for ease of}} use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets. The advantage to the user {{is that it does}} not matter which end connects to the stage and which to the audio mixer, facilitating faster set up. Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The <b>connector</b> <b>housings</b> themselves are sexed male and female.|$|E
40|$|Environmental testing under laboratory-controlled {{conditions}} {{has long}} been used to evaluate connector performance prior to practical application.

However, recent research has shown that these tests appear to evaluate the mechanical stability of the <b>connector</b> <b>housings</b> and terminals, rather than their electrical performance. In order to establish more representative tests to evaluate the electrical performance of contacts, the actual environmental conditions at the contact interface, which are generally unknown, must be measured.

40|$|Photovoltaic modules have no {{moving parts}} and last upwards of 25 years with no {{maintenance}} aside from occasional cleaning. The installation of modules in building facades and other structures has necessitated {{the use of}} push fit connectors to enable quick and easy inter-module DC electrical connection. New applications for photovoltaics such as roof shingles (tiles) place further performance demands on connectors. The day-night variation in temperature within a PV roof for example, creates component expansion. This paper details the behaviour of a tin plated copper photovoltaic connector under small amplitude fretting tests (10 - 100 ?m) using a specially developed accelerated lifetime test rig. The mated connector creates a high force, multiple point contact between {{the male and female}} components by the use of a prestressed spring collar. The study shows that a transition amplitude exists (~ 13 ?m) above which gross slip at the connector interface appears to occur. This causes a gradual linear increase in contact resistance, followed by a sudden change to rapid wearing of the tin plating on both the connector surfaces and spring collar, leading to connector failure. Below the transition amplitude, partial slip at the connector interface is observed which creates a stable, low contact resistance. The paper highlights the need to maintain a partial slip/stick condition within a PV connector for long term contact resistance stability. The implication of this requirement for photovoltaic connector design and application is discussed, considering the benefits of flexible <b>connector</b> <b>housings</b> and lubricants in particular...|$|E
40|$|Common {{materials}} {{and the availability of}} RoHS-compliant versions. The EU's RoHS Directive restricts the use of six substances in electrical and electronic equipment: mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium, cadmium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Manufacturers have made significant investments in new processes that will eliminate these substances [...] especially lead. However, in addition to having manufacturing processes in place, they must be assured of a strong supply chain that can provide sufficient replacement materials. Many electronic system elements will need to be RoHS-compliant, including cables, connectors, plastics and enclosure sheet metal. This article highlights some commonly used {{materials and}} the availability of RoHS-compliant versions worldwide. Printed wiring boards. Manufacturers are concerned about the compatibility of printed wiring board (PWB) materials with Pb-free soldering temperatures of 240 to 260 °C. Compatibility is critical for the larger, thicker boards used in high-end computer systems. Some high-temperature PWB materials are becoming available in production quantities, but availability will be constrained through 2006. In general, PWB boards do not contain any proscribed materials such as cadmium or mercury, and the majority of PWBs do not rely on PBBs or PBDEs for flame retardants. Alternative retardants have been developed and are available worldwide. All major PWB manufacturers currently offer some version of a RoHS-compliant board finish. RoHS-compliant OSPs are commonly available, but require a high degree of process control for high-yield soldering. Easy-to-solder immersion tin and silver finishes are readily available.
