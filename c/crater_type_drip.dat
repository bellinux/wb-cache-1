However advantageous this method, there are still some difficulties in projecting the efficiency of such systems. Most especially, determination of the losses because of the emitters is very important in order to set up an efficient irrigation system. This study is focused on determining head losses for agricultural drip irrigation systems with cylindrical in-line <b>type</b> <b>drip</b> emitters using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. In the study, three-dimensional solid models of five in-line <b>type</b> <b>drip</b> emitters, which have a volumetric flow capacity of 4. 0 [l h- 1] and placed in a pipe with 250 [mm] intervals between each other, were considered and CFD analyses were carried out with different inlet pressure values. According to the results of the CFD analyses, hydraulic losses were calculated globally and locally and analysis outputs were presented to determine the head losses due to the inclusion of the emitters. Validations for results of the simulation were also achieved by using empirical equations taken from related literature. As a result, maximum simulation error rate of 8. 824 [%] was observed between simulations and empirical equations taken from related literature results. This accordance between simulation and empirical results can be interpreted that CFD analyses could be used to calculate the critical flow parameters such as total head losses of drip irrigation pipes integrated with in-line emitters...|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} of impact craters provides {{a powerful tool}} to analyze surface processes in the Martian past. Previous studies concluded that large impact craters (20 – 200 km in diameter) were strongly degraded by fluvial erosion during early Martian history. Our goal is to study the progression of crater degradation through time with a particular emphasis on the craters with alluvial fans and on the relative chronology of these craters. The geometric properties of 283 craters of > 20 km in diameter were analyzed in two highlands of Mars, north of Hellas Planitia, and south of Margaritifer Terra, both known to contain craters with alluvial fans. Three classes were defined from morphology: strongly degraded craters with fluvial landforms and without ejecta (type I), gently degraded craters with fluvial landforms and preserved ejecta (type II), and fresh craters with ejecta and no fluvial landforms (type III). Our main {{result is that the}} <b>type</b> II <b>craters</b> that present alluvial fans have characteristics closer to fresh <b>craters</b> (<b>type</b> III) than degraded <b>craters</b> (<b>type</b> I).

Craters appear across the entire surface of Mars, and they are vital to understanding its crustal properties as well as surface ages and modification events.

The experiment was a factorial treatment design consisting of two micro-irrigation <b>types</b> (<b>Drip</b> or Micro-sprinkler), two nitrogen sources (surface applied Compost or fertigated Urea at a rate of 40 kgNha− 1), and two vineyard floor managements (bark Mulch or “Clean”—meaning bare soil). Frequent measurements of N 2 O flux and soil and environmental variables were made over two complete years (2013 and 2014). A considerable portion (37 % in 2013 and 61 % in 2014) of the annual cumulative N 2 O emission (ΣN 2 O) occurred during the pre-growing season particularly within the thaw period. In 2013, the annual area-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions for Drip was ≈ 1. 8 ×Micro-sprinkler, Urea was ≈ 1. 5 ×Compost and Clean was ≈ 1. 7 ×Mulch. In 2014, ΣN 2 O emissions were over 14 % higher, likely due to more freeze–thaw events, higher soil mineral N availability (47 % higher), but treatments differences were not significantly different. Analysed over two years, micro-sprinkler reduced growing season emissions by 29 % and surface application of bark mulch decreased annual area-scaled and yield-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions by 28 % and 23 %, respectively, suggesting bark mulch as a strategy for mitigating N 2 O emission. The observed interannual variability in the total N 2 O emissions suggests that at least a minimum of 2 years of continuous study may be required to estimate representative annual N 2 O emission budgets and to recommend N 2 O mitigation strategies in vineyard systems...|$|R
