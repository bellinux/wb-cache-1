5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of this process}} are that the abrasive action cannot be limited to only {{certain areas of the}} part, <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> are long, and the process is noisy.|$|E

25|$|MVI's {{simplicity}} {{was due to}} two reasons. Firstly, Digital {{had determined}} that the Alpha 21164 was already capable of performing DVD decoding through software, therefore not requiring hardware provisions for the purpose, but was inefficient in MPEG-2 encoding. The second reason was the requirement to retain the fast <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> of implementations. Adding many instructions would have complicated and enlarged the instruction decode logic, reducing an implementation's clock frequency.|$|E
25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not usually}} done in a milling machine for several reasons. Firstly, most milling machines have only one spindle, so changing the tool more than four to six times can increase <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> significantly. Secondly, most workpieces that require this process are made on horizontal machining centers (HMC), which reduces float-ability due to gravity. Thirdly, the lubrication may not be sufficient, {{which can lead to}} material build-up between diamonds, diminishing the tool's effectiveness. Finally, if any chips remain from previous operations they can ruin the tool.|$|E
25|$|Productivity is a {{standard}} efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. <b>Cycle</b> <b>times</b> can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and motion study, predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.|$|E
40|$|A {{key element}} with which {{manufacturing}} industries should concern themselves {{in respect of}} cost and efficiency of operation is the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> for preparing their products. A reduction in operational time can result in dramatic improvements in both cost and efficiency. Unfortunately, <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> problems are sometimes difficult to analyse: there are many factors related to this parameter. This paper presents a <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analysis of a tipping trailer frame in a heavy equipment industry. The <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analysis, based on the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> data collected by a time study, together {{with the use of}} an Arena software simulation, is outlined.

25|$|S. haemorrhoidalis {{is hardly}} ever used in {{forensic}} investigations, {{due to its}} global distribution {{and the fact that}} little is known about them. Usually, other more researched flies and beetles, if present on the body, take precedence. The fly has a pupation time ranging from 93 hours to 153 hours. Development from larvae to adult can range from 252 to 802 hours. Knowing the pupation and life <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> of S. haemorrhoidalis and taking into consideration that this species is ovoviviparous allows investigators to calculate how long the fly has been on the corpse. If time of colonization of the corpse by maggots is known, it can help determine the PMI, or post-mortem interval.|$|E
25|$|Special {{calibrated}} strobe lights, {{capable of}} flashing up {{to hundreds of}} times per second, are used in industry to stop the appearance of motion of rotating and other repetitively operating machinery and to measure, or adjust, the rotation speeds or <b>cycle</b> <b>times.</b> Since this stop is only apparent, a marked point on the rotating body will either appear to move backward or forward, or not move, depending on {{the frequency of the}} strobe-flash. If the flash occurs equal to the period of rotation (or evenly multiplied, i.e. 2*π*n/ω, where n is an integer and ω the angular frequency) the marked point will appear to not move. Any non integer flash setting will make the mark appear to move forward or backward, e.g. a slight increase of the flash frequency will make the point appear to move backward.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. <b>Cycle</b> <b>times</b> can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E

25|$|The most-resistant {{organism}} (MRO) to sterilization with NO2 gas is the spore of Geobacillus stearothermophilus, {{which is}} the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of G. stearothermophilus has been well characterized over the years as a biological indicator in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of G. stearothermophilus with NO2 gas proceeds rapidly in a log-linear fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for medical devices at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility. This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residuals through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.|$|E
500|$|Hot-chamber die casting, {{also known}} as {{gooseneck}} machines, rely upon a pool of molten metal to feed the die. At {{the beginning of the}} cycle the piston of the machine is retracted, which allows the molten metal to fill the [...] "gooseneck". The pneumatic- or hydraulic-powered piston then forces this metal out of the gooseneck into the die. The advantages of this system include fast <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> (approximately 15 cycles a minute) and the convenience of melting the metal in the casting machine. The disadvantages of this system are that it is limited to use with low-melting point metals and that aluminium cannot be used because it picks up some of the iron while in the molten pool. Therefore, hot-chamber machines are primarily used with zinc-, tin-, and lead-based alloys.|$|E
500|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. [...] Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the <b>cycle</b> <b>times.</b> These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.|$|E

2500|$|For automobiles, {{ultrasonic}} welding {{tends to be}} used to assemble large plastic and electrical components such as instrument panels, door panels, lamps, air ducts, steering wheels, upholstery and engine components.

[...] Some of the advantages for {{ultrasonic welding}} are low <b>cycle</b> <b>times,</b> automation, low capital costs, and flexibility.

2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} milling cutter if the correct helical toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or taps and dies, are faster <b>cycle</b> <b>times,</b> less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|E

Since <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> reduction has become widely accepted as a key element in managing new-product development, this contribution organizes and integrates the literature on accelerated product development. Specifically, we argue that the antecedents associated with shorter development <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> are well known, but that there are inconsistencies with respect to the contextual applicability of <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> reduction, and contradictory empirical evidence for its alleged merits in achieving lower development costs, better product quality, and greater chance of new-product success.
