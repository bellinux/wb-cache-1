50|$|Prodoxidae are {{a family}} of {{primitive}} monotrysian Lepidoptera. Some of these small-to-medium sized moths are day flying, like Lampronia capitella, known to European gardeners as the <b>currant</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer.</b> Others occur in Africa and Asia. The other common genera are generally confined to dry areas of the United States. Tetragma gei feeds on mountain avens (Geum triflorum) in the US. Greya politella lay eggs in the flowers of Saxifragaceae there. Prodoxoides asymmetra occurs in Chile and Argentina (Nielsen and Davis, 1985), but all other prodoxid moth genera have a northern distribution. The enigmatic genus Tridentaforma is sometimes placed here and assumed {{to be close to}} Lampronia, while other authors consider it incertae sedis among the closely related family Adelidae.|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{effort on}} Hypsipyla <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> {{has failed to}} produce effective methods of control. Deploying pest-resistant planting stock {{as a basis for}} managing these pests has not been considered until recently, however. We review evidence for the existence of resistance to <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> in Meliaceae, with particular emphasis on research in Costa Rica on resistance to Hypsipyla grandelia in big-leaf mahogany and Spanish cedar. This research has shown appreciable genetic variation in resistance to attack by <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> in these tree species. Strategies for future research are discussed, and we conclude that the best option for successful <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> management lies in using resistant planting stock in silvicultural or agroforestry systems to encourage natural biological control or otherwise minimize the abundance and adverse effects of <b>shoot</b> <b>borers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>currant</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer,</b> Lampronia capitella (Lep., Prodoxidae), is an {{important}} pest of currants, Ribes spp., in northern Europe. Oviposition was studied in cage experiments and the flight period was monitored in field studies using pheromone-baited traps. Blackcurrant, Ribes nigrum, was the host species in both studies. The total egg supply of females was on average 107 eggs and oviposition started 2 - 5 days after emergence. About 60 % of the eggs were laid during {{the first day of}} the oviposition period. Eggs were laid in currant fruitlets, in batches comprising several, usually four to seven eggs. The flight period started shortly after the end of the flowering period of blackcurrant, and lasted for about 3 weeks...|$|E
40|$|Background: Moths {{have evolved}} highly {{successful}} mating systems, relying on species-specific mixtures of sex pheromone components for long-distance mate communication. Acyl-CoA desaturases are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of these compounds {{and to a}} large extent they account for the great diversity of pheromone structures in Lepidoptera. A novel desaturase gene subfamily that displays Delta 11 catalytic activities has been highlighted to account for most of the unique pheromone signatures of the taxonomically advanced ditrysian species. To assess the mechanisms driving pheromone evolution, information is needed about the signalling machinery of primitive moths. The <b>currant</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer,</b> Lampronia capitella, is the sole reported primitive non-ditrysian moth known to use unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives as sex-pheromone. By combining biochemical and molecular approaches we elucidated the biosynthesis paths of its main pheromone component, the (Z,Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadien- 1 -ol and bring new insights into the time point of the recruitment of the key Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily in moth pheromone biosynthesis. Results: The reconstructed evolutionary tree of desaturases evidenced two ditrysian-specific lineages (the Delta 11 and Delta 9 (18 C> 16 C)) to have orthologs in the primitive moth L. capitella despite being absent in Diptera and other insect genomes. Four acyl-CoA desaturase cDNAs were isolated from the pheromone gland, three of which are related to Delta 9 -desaturases whereas the fourth cDNA clusters with Delta 11 -desaturases. We demonstrated that this transcript (Lca-KPVQ) exclusively accounts for both steps of desaturation involved in pheromone biosynthesis. This enzyme possesses a Z 11 -desaturase activity that allows transforming the palmitate precursor (C 16 : 0) into (Z) - 11 -hexadecenoic acid and the (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoic acid into the conjugated intermediate (Z, Z) - 9, 11 -tetradecadienoic acid. Conclusion: The involvement of a single Z 11 -desaturase in pheromone biosynthesis of a non-ditrysian moth species, supports that the duplication event leading to the origin of the Lepidoptera-specific Delta 11 -desaturase gene subfamily took place before radiation of ditrysian moths and their divergence from other heteroneuran lineages. Our findings uncover that this novel class of enzymes affords complex combinations of unique unsaturated fatty acyl-moieties of variable chain-lengths, regio- and stereo-specificities since early in moth history and contributes a notable innovation in the early evolution of moth-pheromones...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Infestations of {{the western}} pine <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> (Eucosma sonomana Kearfott) in young stands of ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Lawson), were {{surveyed}} on the Deschutes National Forest. Elevation, slope, aspect, tree height, tree diameter, number of shoots in the terminal whorl, stand density, stand age and plant association for each stand were used in general multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to predict the percentage of infested terminal shoots. Using general multiple regression, taking the arcsin(square root(proportion of infested trees)), the models that were selected as the best predictors included (1) diameter, trees/hectare and elevation (R 2 = 0. 62) and (2) number of shoots in the terminal whorl and stand age (R 2 = 0. 62). Using logistic regression, the best model included number of shoots in the terminal whorl and stand age. Values for these stand characteristics {{can be used with}} the appropriate equation to estimate the percentage of terminal whorls damaged by <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> in a given stand.

This pest can attack the plants during the year and one larva per plant is enough to cause significant damage. In infested areas, the attack can reach up to 100 % of the trees. The Australian cedar and African mahogany have been cultivated in Brazil for timber production, because they are considered resistant to H. grandella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) attack. However, in this work we report {{for the first time the}} H. grandella attack to African mahogany Khaya ivorensis...|$|R

40|$|Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) {{is a very}} {{important}} source of income for more than 200, 000 farmer households in Vietnam. The present cashew productivity in Vietnam is low and unstable, and pest damage is partly responsible for this. Cashew farmers rely on pesticides to minimize the damage, resulting in adverse impacts on farm environment and farmers’ health. Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp) are effective biocontrol agents of a range of cashew insect pests in several cashew-growing countries, and these ants are widely distributed in Vietnam. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential of weaver ants in cashew orchards in Vietnam. Field surveys and field experiment were conducted in five cashew orchards from July 2006 to January 2008 in Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces, Vietnam. Based on the field surveys, the most important pests that damage flushing foliar and floral shoots and young cashew fruits and nuts were mosquito bugs, brown <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> and fruit-nut borers. The damage caused by each of these pests was significantly lower on trees with weaver ants compared with trees without the ants, showing that the ants were able to keep these pest damages under the control threshold. Regular monitoring of the field experiment showed that weaver ants were similar to insecticides for controlling mosquito bugs, blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> fruit-nut borers, leaf rollers, and leaf miners. Aphids did not become major pests in plot with weaver ants.

Trade in Swietenia grown and harvested in these non-native locations is not restricted. Species of this genus are only occasionally plantation-grown in Central America, in spite of the good growing conditions and high price of the wood, due to the ubiquitous presence of the mahogany <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> moth (also known as the cedar tip moth), Hypsipyla grandella, which damages the form of the tree by killing the terminal shoot, causing excessive branching.

The mahogany <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> Hypsipyla robusta Moore (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important pest of S. macrophylla throughout Asia, Africa and the Pacific. No viable method of controlling this pest is known. Previous observations have suggested that the presence of overhead shade may reduce attack by H. robusta, but this has not been investigated experimentally. This research was therefore designed to assess the influence of light availability on shoot-borer attack on S. macrophylla, by establishing seedlings under three different artificial shade regimes, then using these seedlings to test oviposition preference of adult moths, neonate larval survival and growth and development of <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> larvae. Oviposition preference of <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> moths was tested on leaves from seedlings grown under artificial shade for 63 weeks. A significant difference in choice was recorded between treatments, with 27. 4 ± 1. 5 eggs laid under high shade and 87. 1 ± 1. 8 under low shade. Neonate larval survival on early flushing leaflets of S. macrophylla did not differ significantly between shade treatments. Larval growth rate, estimated by measuring daily frass width, was significantly higher for those larvae fed on seedlings from the high and medium shade treatments (0. 1 mm/day), than the low shade treatment (0. 06 mm/day). In laboratory-reared larvae, the total mass of frass produced was significantly higher in the high shade treatment (0. 4 g) than under the low shade treatment (0. 2 g).
