5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions,</b> including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Alien hand {{syndrome}} (AHS) is {{a condition}} in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without control over the actions. The term is used for a variety of <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> and most commonly affects the left hand. There are many similar names used to describe the various forms of the condition but they are often used inappropriately.|$|E
40|$|Selected {{physiological}} {{parameters of}} 31 classic and rough Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from respiratory tract cultures {{of patients with}} cystic fibrosis were examined. An association of a patient's <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> (good or poor) with strain physiology was made. Rough strains from patients in poor <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> demonstrated severe alterations in motility when compared with M- 2, a highly motile and chemotactic burn strain. Of the 10 rough strains from patients in poor <b>clinical</b> <b>condition,</b> 70 % lacked flagella, as determined by electron microscopy. The remaining few flagellated strains from this group exhibited weak motility both in soft agar and by the capillary assay. Their chemotactic response to three amino acids, when {{compared with that of}} strain M- 2, was reduced approximately 30 to 90 %. Classic strains from patients in poor <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> were less chemotactic than those from patients in good <b>clinical</b> <b>condition.</b> A majority of classic and rough strains from patients in good <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> were comparable to M- 2 in both chemotaxis and motility. Changes in other physiological characteristics indicated by reduced growth rates, or auxotrophy, were seldom observed in the cystic fibrosis strains studied. The data suggest that host-selective pressures, associated primarily with patients with cystic fibrosis that are in poor <b>clinical</b> <b>condition,</b> result in the loss of factors related to invasiveness such as motility and chemotaxis. We propose that these results may reflect that there is a more general alteration in the cell envelope of cystic fibrosis strains...|$|R
30|$|Although MAHA is a <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> {{associated}} with a very poor prognosis, we consider it controllable {{for a long period}} by rapid introduction of chemotherapy in many cases.

30|$|The {{severity}} of the SAH was assessed with the Hunt–Hess (H&H) score. H&H extends from 1; minimal symptoms, to 5; deep coma. H&H 3 – 5 is considered as a severe <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> and H&H 1 – 2 as a less severe <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> (Hunt and Hess 1968). The H&H scores {{were obtained from the}} first clinical examination made by a physician.|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to understanding the}} neuroscientific underpinnings {{of the sense of}} agency is to examine <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> in which purposeful limb movement occurs without an associated sense of agency. The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is alien hand syndrome. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing a sense of ownership of the affected body part.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged {{exercise}} such as marathons {{can increase}} cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and ischemia-modified (aka MI) albumin. This can be misinterpreted by medical personnel {{as signs of}} myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysfunction. In these <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions,</b> such cardiac biomarkers are produced by irreversible injury of muscles. In contrast, the processes that create them after strenuous exertion in endurance sports are reversible, with their levels returning to normal within 24-hours (further research, however, is still needed).|$|E
25|$|Therapeutic dose {{dependence}} is {{the largest}} category of people dependent on benzodiazepines. These individuals typically do not escalate their doses to high levels or abuse their medication. Smaller groups include patients escalating their dosage to higher levels and drug misusers as well. It is unclear exactly how many people illicitly abuse benzodiazepines. Tolerance develops within days or weeks to the anticonvulsant, hypnotic muscle relaxant and after 4 months {{there is little evidence}} that benzodiazepines retain their anxiolytic properties. Some authors, however, disagree and feel that benzodiazepines retain their anxiolytic properties. Long-term benzodiazepine treatment may remain necessary in certain <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although honey is {{generally}} safe when taken in typical food amounts, there are various, potential adverse effects or interactions {{it may have}} in combination with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions or drugs. Included among these are mild reactions to high intake, such as anxiety, insomnia, or hyperactivity in about 10% of children, according to one study. No symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, or hyperactivity were detected with honey consumption compared to placebo, according to another study. Honey consumption may interact adversely with existing allergies, high blood sugar levels (as in diabetes), or anticoagulants used to control bleeding, among other <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Benton Test {{has been}} criticized by test's {{requirement}} of the examinee's IQ or estimated IQ, which {{can be difficult to}} obtain if the examinee is in a poor condition. In addition, data from studies that look at the viability of retesting a patient have shown conflicting results; some studies show no difference in scores after time has passed between two tests, while other studies show a difference. Despite these reports, the Benton Test has several advantages over other tests of visual memory. These include: a more explicit scoring system than other tests, parallel-forms reliability due to the presence of multiple form sets, and short administration time. Because of this, the BVRT is still widely used today for a large number of <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Coxarthosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} reasons for disability of people at the age of 50 and more. The chronic and progressive nature of this disease makes it a common reason for impairment of the patient’s functional and <b>clinical</b> <b>condition.</b> The aim of the study is to assess the impact of the rehabilitation procedure on functional and <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> of patients with coxarthrosis measured with the WOMAC and Lequesne Indexes. Material and methods: The study included 85 patients, among whom 50 patients were treated non-invasively (35 women and 15 men) and 35 were treated surgically (21 women and 14 men). All patients were provided with the physiotherapeutic treatments (point laser therapy power 100 mW dose 8 J, time 12 minutes), kinesitherapy (the patients did non-weight bearing exercises hip joint exercises, isometric exercises for muscles of the hip), and classical massage. All patients were provided with physiotherapeutic treatments for 10 days, excluding Saturdays and Sundays. The assessment of functional and <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> of patients with coxarthrosis was conducted using the WOMAC Questionnaire and the Lequesne Pain Index for the hip joint. The assessment of functional and <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> was carried out on the first and the last treatment day. Results: The rehabilitation procedure significantly improved functional and <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> of all patients. The greatest improvements were observed with surgically treated male patients who had been ill for less than 10 years. Conclusions: The proposed rehabilitation procedure significantly improves functional and <b>clinical</b> <b>condition</b> of patients with coxarthrosis. Disease duration, female sex and non-invasive treatment are factors influencing on the efficiency of rehabilitation for patients with coxarthrosis. The results suggest the necessity of using rehabilitation procedures in patients with coxarthrosis...|$|R

2500|$|Initially, thrombelastography {{was simply}} {{performed}} with whole blood without adding reagents (except calcium when citrate anticoagulated blood was used). This provides a global overview about {{all phases of}} clot formation, stabilization and degradation. In the case of monocausal haemostasis disorders, the resulting reaction curves may be quite typical; however, under most <b>clinical</b> <b>conditions</b> this approach has severe limitations. In reality various effects overlap, including haemodilution or application of high doses of parenteral anticoagulants. High doses of heparin often prevent clot formation at all. Absence of a controlled activation step leads to inferior reproducibility and very long test times which are not acceptable for POC applications.|$|E
