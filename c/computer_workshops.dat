40|$|Introduction: The {{implementation}} of strategies of digital inclusion and physical, cognitive and social activities {{has a positive}} effect on the preservation of the physical and cognitive abilities and quality of life of the elderly. Objective: To report the experience of establishing and developing a university extension project called “OT Clicking”, describing its characteristics, goals, and academic and community contributions. Method: The “OT Clicking” project was created in 2011 to promote social and digital inclusion of the elderly by means of <b>computer</b> <b>workshops,</b> cognitive stimulation workshops, hands-on activities, and socialization activities. The activities were developed in a long-term care facility. The elderly were evaluated every six months. Workshops and assessments were performed by students of the occupational therapy course at the University of Brasilia under the guidance of teachers of the physiotherapy and occupational therapy departments. Results: Two hundred and fifty four senior citizens actively attended 11 <b>computer</b> <b>workshops,</b> eight cognitive stimulation workshops, five hands-on activities, and two socialization activities. Teachers, fellow students, and volunteers participated, enabling the development of a research project and conference presentations. The project’s attendance and production suggest that the activities serve the interests of the elderly, bring new perspectives of social participation, and open a field for practice and research. Conclusion: “OT Clicking” is a viable example of extension project which includes teachers, students and the community, configuring a space for learning, socialization, and social and digital inclusion of the elderly, allowing connection between university teaching, research and extension...|$|E
