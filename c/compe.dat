Its main use is to present a numerical picture of the relationship between assessments, examinations, modules, and overall performance that highlights factors requiring a more in-depth, qualitative approach. Part 2 of the report will build upon this information and will also involve an analysis of the different approaches to assessment setting between the CS Part I modules and the desired learning outcomes. Part 3 of the report will draw together the evidence from parts 1 and 2 and will also involve a closer examination of individual students performances tracing their progress both between modules and across different types of assessment.

40|$|AbstractTeachers’ {{teaching}} methods change {{because of the}} new organizations in the school curricula in 2005 - 2006 academic year. For this reason, teachers and pre-service teachers should use the {{teaching methods}} which are based on constructivism. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate pre-service teachers’ opinions about constructivism and to determine the different ideas among the pre-service teachers in different departments. This research was conducted on 312 pre-service teachers who are in Turkish Language Education (TurkEd), Foreign Language Education (ForEd), Elementary Mathematics Education (MathEd), Early Childhood Education (EarlyEd), Primary Education (PrimEd) and Computer Education and Instructional Technology (<b>CompEd)</b> departments in a university in Ankara. Data were collected by “Teachers’ Sufficiency Scale” to evaluate the opinion of the pre-service teachers. The scale contains five factors about students, setting the stage, dimension about teaching and teaching organization. Results were investigated according to the variability of sub dimensions and pre-service teacher departments. Data were analyzed with percentage. Analysis of the scale revealed that pre-service teachers think that a constructivist teacher should be aware of the students’ needs and interests, social, emotional and socio-economical differences. S/he always responds the needs of the students in her/his lesson plans and teaching style. S/he knows how to take the attention of the students, how to adopt them into their environment. S/he also considers being objective, asking thought provoking questions, giving feedback and to stick to the aim in the assessment process...|$|R

40|$|O estudo investiga o processo de institucionaliza????o de beb??s e crian??as bem pequenas nas d??cadas de 1980 e 1990, em Francisco Beltr??o, munic??pio do sudoeste do Paran??. Tendo como foco pr??ticas e representa????es envolvendo beb??s e crian??as bem pequenas na creche, articula hist??ria da educa????o infantil e hist??ria da inf??ncia, refor??ando a escrita de uma hist??ria da inf??ncia nas creches. Recorrendo a aportes te??rico-metodol??gicos da hist??rica {{cultural}}, faz tamb??m uso de recursos te??ricos advindos da sociologia da inf??ncia. Tais referenciais oferecem uma matriz anal??tica que permite n??o s?? focalizar a dimens??o cultural das pr??ticas, como encarar crian??as e inf??ncia como objeto de pesquisa, considerando a presen??a ativa desse grupo geracional na sociedade. A pesquisa implicou na recolha de mem??rias de sujeitos que viveram situa????es relacionadas ao contexto investigado (profissionais das creches e dos setores da assist??ncia social ??? DAS/SAS, Associa????o de Prote????o ?? Maternidade e ?? inf??ncia e Superintend??ncia Regional da LBA), incluindo documentos escritos e iconogr??ficos. Como procedimento metodol??gico destacam-se a hist??ria oral e a an??lise documental, delas derivando basicamente todo o conjunto de dados emp??ricos. Para o processo anal??tico, os mesmos foram subdivididos em quatro eixos interrelacionados: pol??ticas, pr??ticas, culturas e concep????es. A pesquisa elucida as especificidades do projeto municipal de creches de Francisco Beltr??o e identifica tra??os de uma cultura da creche naquele contexto. A an??lise confirma a concep????o assistencial/compensat??ria da d??cada de 1980 na conforma????o de pr??ticas institucionais, incluindo a influ??ncia da Legi??o Brasileira de Assist??ncia. Constata igualmente o papel desempenhado pela Associa????o de Prote????o a Maternidade e ?? Inf??ncia de Francisco Beltr??o. Identifica elementos que <b>comp??es</b> uma cultura da creche: imagens de inf??ncia ??? a crian??a pobre, a crian??a carente, a crian??a submissa, o beb?? biol??gico, o beb?? brincante e o beb?? membro do grupo social. Na mesma perspectiva, o estudo analisa: a presen??a de um grupo profissional marcado pela maternagem; a organiza????o de tempos que se estruturam em rotinas, valorizando os cuidados corporais, diferenciados para cada subgrupo et??rio. Constata igualmente a estrutura????o de espa??os assinalados pela aus??ncia e pelo improviso, a presen??a de brincadeira e intera????es que se revelam como modos caracter??sticos de organiza????o de crian??as e adultos. Em seu conjunto, a investiga????o permite depreender que a creche ?? um lugar heterog??neo, que expressa uma pol??tica conformadora de corpos ??? sinalizada por uma representa????o de crian??a pobre e, ao mesmo tempo, revela a express??o de uma cultura do encontro ??? onde crian??as e adultos estruturam formas pr??prias de brincadeiras e ocupa????o dos espa??os. Nas considera????es finais, a argumenta????o re??ne assertivas que acentuam a potencialidade de investiga????es que tenham como foco culturas de creche. The study researches {{the process}} of babies and small children institutionalization, in the 80 ties and 90 ties {{in the city of}} Francisco Beltr??o State of Parana. It focuses practices and representations involving babies and small children at nurseries schools. It discusses the history of childhood education and infancy history, reinforcing the history of children an day care centers. It pursues theoretical and methodological contributions of cultural history, it also uses theoretical resources from the sociology of childhood. Such references offer an analytical sample which allows, not only to focus a cultural dimension of the practices, but also how to face little children and childhood as an object of research, considering the active presence of this generational group in the society. The research implied in the collection of memories of people who have lived such experiences (professionals of nurseries schools and social assistance ??? DAS/SAS, Association of Protection to Maternity and childhood and LBA Regional Superintendence) it also includes written and ichnographic documents. A content analysis was used oral history and documental analysis which has been taken all empirical data. For the analytical process they have been divided into four inter related axes: policies, practices, cultures and conceptions. The research elucidates the particularities of the ???municipal project of the nurseries schools??? of Francisco Beltr??o and identifies some features of a culture of nurseries in such context. The analysis confirms the attendance /compensatory conception of conformation of the institutional practices of the 80 ties, including the influence of Brazilian Legion of Assistance. It also notes the role performed by the Association of Maternity and Childhood Protection of Francisco Beltr??o. It identifies the images of infancy ??? the poor child, the careless child, the submissive one, the biological baby, the participating and the baby member of social group. It analyses the presence of a professional group stamped by the maternal care. It identifies the organization from times that are structured in routines, valuing body care, different for every age and, the structuring of areas marked by the absence and improvisation. Finally, it identifies the presence of games and interactions which are characteristic ways of children and adult organization. In a whole, the investigation allows to conclude that the nursery school is a heterogeneous place, it expresses a conformating policy ??? designated by a representation of poor children ??? and, at the same time, it reveals the expression of the encounter culture, where the children and adults structure their own way of games and spaces occupation. In the final considerations, the discussion gather some conclusions that stands out the potential of investigations focusing the nursery schools culture...|$|R

40|$|Drought and low soil {{nitrogen}} {{are major}} factors limiting maize production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of maize testcross hybrids developed from four biparental populations: CML 441 x CML 444, CML 440 x <b>COMPE,</b> CML 444 x K 64 R and CML 312 x NAW was conducted. The objectives were (a) {{to evaluate the}} performance of F 2 : 3 line testcrosses across stressed and non-stress conditions, (b) to estimate heritabilities for grain yield and secondary traits, (c) to assess the relationship between testing environments, (d) to estimate genetic correlations among relevant traits, (e) to estimate direct and indirect genetic gain from selection, and (e) to have a preliminary assessment of the efficiency of marker-assisted selection. Studies were conducted under no nitrogen fertilization, low nitrogen, drought, well- watered and high nitrogen in Malawi and Zimbabwe. About 100 entries from each population were tested using an alpha lattice design with two replications at all locations. Traits measured were grain yield, plant height, anthesis date, anthesis-silking interval, ears per plant, grain moisture at harvest and leaf senescence. Highest grain yield across environments was obtained from population CML 444 x K 64 R (3. 82 Mg ha- 1) and the lowest from CML 440 x <b>COMPE</b> (3. 64 Mg ha- 1). Testcrosses from CML 441 x CML 444 and CML 444 x K 64 R had higher heritability estimates compared to CML 440 x <b>COMPE</b> and CML 312 x NAW. Drought and high nitrogen environments had higher heritability estimates than low nitrogen and well-watered conditions. Drought and well-watered environments discriminated testcrosses {{in a similar manner}} as well as high and low nitrogen environments. All populations had negative correlations between grain yield and anthesis silking interval, while positive correlations were observed between grain yield and ears per plant. No consistent differences were observed between overall means of best and worst marker based selected line testcrosses across populations and environments. Highest direct expected genetic gains were observed from high nitrogen environments. Direct selection under specific environments (e. g. drought) was estimated to be more beneficial than indirect selection in other environments...|$|E
