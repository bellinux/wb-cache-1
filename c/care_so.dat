After an {{unsuccessful}} first show in which none of her work sold, Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her {{and was unable to}} recoup. Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City. She explained, [...] "I wouldn't ordinarily have gone. I didn't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> much about the idea of prints at that time but I desperately needed {{to get out of town}} and all of my expenses were paid." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1937, the Spiegelmans had {{one other}} son, Rysio (spelled [...] "Richieu" [...] in Maus), who died before Art {{was born at}} the age of five or six. During the Holocaust, Spiegelman's parents sent Rysio to stay with an aunt with whom they {{believed}} he would be safe. In 1943, the aunt poisoned herself, along with Rysio and two other young family members in her <b>care,</b> <b>so</b> that the Nazis would not take them to the extermination camps. After the war, the Spiegelmans, unable to accept that Rysio was dead, searched orphanages all over Europe in the hope of finding him. Spiegelman talked of having a sort of sibling rivalry with his [...] "ghost brother"—he felt unable to compete with an [...] "ideal" [...] brother who [...] "never threw tantrums or got in any kind of trouble". Of 85 Spiegelman relatives alive at the beginning of World WarII, only 13 are known to have survived the Holocaust.|$|E

500|$|Deveau {{returned}} to report these findings to Morehouse, {{who decided to}} bring the derelict into Gibraltar, [...] away. Under maritime law, a salvor could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo, the exact award depending {{on the degree of}} danger inherent in the salvaging. Morehouse divided Dei Gratias crew of eight between the two vessels, sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to Mary Celeste, while he and four others remained on Dei Gratia. The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar, but with each ship seriously undermanned, progress was slow. Dei Gratia reached Gibraltar on December 12, 1872, and Mary Celeste, which had encountered fog, arrived on the following morning. She was immediately impounded by the vice admiralty court, preparatory to salvage hearings. Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that [...] "I can hardly tell what I am made of, but I do not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> long as I got in safe. I shall be well paid for the Mary Celeste." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the United States Forest Service {{started a}} program to set aside [...] "primitive areas" [...] in the {{national}} forests to protect wilderness while opening it to use. [...] Yard, who preferred to give the land that did not meet his standards to the Forest Service rather than the NPS, began {{to work closely with}} the USFS. [...] Beginning in 1925, he served as secretary of the Joint Committee on the Recreational Survey of Federal Lands, a position he held until 1930. [...] Composed of members of both the NPA and the USFS, the committee sought a separate national recreation policy that would distinguish between recreational and preservation areas. [...] The NPA and Yard were both criticized by activists who feared that the association would be eclipsed by the Forest Service's own program goals. [...] Yard at times felt isolated and under-appreciated by his peers. [...] He wrote in 1926, [...] "I wonder whether I'm justified in forcing this work upon people who seem to <b>care</b> <b>so</b> little about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> much for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it {{was really nice}} to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us <b>care</b> <b>so</b> much and believe so fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".|$|E

Sinrod explained, [...] "To me, the essence of the book is the toilet paper question ...

[...] Poretz observed, [...] "The toilet-paper question galvanizes people almost like the Miller Lite tastes-great/less-filling commercial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Health {{regulations}} mandate vaccinations {{and blood}} testing of animals crossing state lines, so rodeo stock receives routine care.
