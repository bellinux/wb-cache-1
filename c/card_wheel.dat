60|$|Jerry <b>Card</b> <b>wheeled</b> once more. Venters {{distinctly}} saw the red {{flash of}} his red face. This time he looked long. Venters laughed. He knew what passed in Card's mind. The rider {{was trying to}} make out what horse it happened to be that thus gained on Jane Withersteen's peerless racers. Wrangle had so long been away from the village that not improbably Jerry had forgotten. Besides, whatever Jerry's qualifications for his fame as the greatest rider of the sage, certain it was that his best point was not far-sightedness. He had not recognized Wrangle. After what must have been a searching gaze he got his comrade to face about. This action gave Venters amusement. It spoke so surely of the facts that neither Card nor the rustler actually knew their danger. Yet if they kept to the trail--and the last thing such men would do would be to leave it--they were both doomed.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a self-balancing {{controller}} (SBC) for one-wheeled vehicles (OWVs). The composition of the OWV system includes: a DSP motion <b>card,</b> a <b>wheel</b> motor, and its driver. In addition, a tilt and a gyro, for sensing the angle and angular velocity of the body slope, are used to realize self-balancing controls. OWV, a kind of unicycle robot, can be dealt with as a mobile-inverted-pendulum system for its instability. However, for its possible applications in mobile carriers or robots, it is worth being further developed. In this study, first, the OWV system model will be derived. Next, through the simulations based on the mathematical model, the analysis of system stability and controllability can be evaluated. Last, a concise and realizable method, through system pole-placement and linear quadratic regulator (LQR), will be proposed to design the SBC. The effectiveness, reliability, and feasibility of the proposal will be con- firmed through simulation studies and experimenting on a physical OWV...|$|R

50|$|The basic device {{consists}} of a ratchet-wheel {{with a large number}} of uniformly spaced teeth. When the wheel is turned slowly while the edge of a card is held against the teeth a succession of distinct clicks can be heard. When the wheel is spun rapidly it produces a shrill tone, whereas if the wheel is allowed to turn more slowly the tone progressively decreases in pitch. Since the frequency of the tone is directly proportional to {{the rate at which the}} teeth strike the <b>card,</b> a Savart <b>wheel</b> can be calibrated to provide an absolute measure of pitch. Multiple wheels of different sizes, carrying different numbers of teeth, can also be attached so as to allow several pitches (or chords) to be produced while the axle is being turned at a constant rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacture}} of textiles in Crompton {{can be traced back}} to 1474, when a lease dated from that year outlines that the occupant of Crompton Park had spinning <b>wheels,</b> <b>cards</b> and looms, all of which suggest that cloth was being produced in large quantities. The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing, and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector had been closely linked with that of Rochdale and Saddleworth in the north and east; it was a woollen manufacturing district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth.|$|R
50|$|What {{happened}} with Hot Ones in the 1980s for Hot Wheels sent {{them in the}} path of what they are today. In 1981, Hot Ones wheels were introduced, which had gold-painted hubs, thinner axels for speed, and additional suspension that most production Hot Wheels lacked. Ultra Hot wheels, which looked like the wheels found on a Renault Fuego or a Mazda 626, were introduced in 1984 and had other speed improvements. Hot Wheels started offering models based on 1980s sports and economy cars, like the Pontiac Fiero or Dodge Omni 024. In 1983, a new style of wheel called Real Riders were introduced, which had real rubber tires. Despite {{the fact that they were}} very popular, the Real Riders line was short-lived, because of high production costs. In the late 1980s, the Blue Card blister pack was introduced, which would become the basis of Hot <b>Wheels</b> <b>cards</b> still used today.|$|R
5000|$|Rust bluing was {{developed}} between {{hot and cold}} bluing processes. It was originally used by gunsmiths in the 19th century to blue firearms prior {{to the development of}} hot bluing processes. The process was to coat the gun parts in an acid solution, let the parts rust uniformly, then immerse the parts in boiling water to stabilize the rusting process by removing any remaining residue from the applied acid solution (often nitric acid and hydrochloric acid diluted in water). Then the rust was carded (scrubbed) off, using a <b>carding</b> brush or <b>wheel.</b> A <b>carding</b> brush is a wire brush with very soft, thin (usually about [...]002 thick) wires. This process is repeated until the desired depth of color is achieved or the metal simply will not color any further. This {{is one of the reasons}} rust and fume bluing tend to be more rust resistant than any other method. The parts are then oiled and allowed to stand overnight. This process leaves a deep blue/black finish.|$|R

The upland geography of the area constrained the output of crop growing, and so prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade. Wills and inventories from the 15th and 16th centuries suggest most families were involved with small scale pasture, but supplemented their incomes by weaving woollens in the domestic system, [...] and selling cloth, linen and fustians to travelling chapmen for the markets in Manchester and Rochdale. Despite its remoteness by the Pennines, by the Early Modern period the domestic system in Crompton had produced relatively wealthy inhabitants. The most affluent were those involved in cloth and linen, and their wealth was comparable to that of the merchants of Manchester and Salford.|$|R

Like Treasure Hunts of the past, a Super Treasure Hunt features premium wheels and Spectraflame paint.Before 2013, all 12 Treasure Hunt cars of a year were released in both regular and super versions. In 2012, Supers came with special paint and wheels, but with series designation on the card. However, the regular T-hunts retained a special series card. Mattel stopped using special cards for all Treasure Hunts in 2013.

By 1868, she had taken up residence with an aunt and uncle, Jehiel and Hannah Towner, in Erie, Pennsylvania. Lovisa opened a small art studio in the family home before opening the Erie Art School in the 1870s. Located {{on the second floor of}} the Erie Dime Saving and Loan Building, the school was the first of its kind in the city and came to include nearly one hundred students. In her classes Lovisa stressed realism, teaching students to use their tools in order to enhance their own innate abilities. Her students included Ruth E. Newton, Ruth Halleck, Gretchen Newberger, Charles A. Hulbert, Elizabeth Spalding, and Inez Wagner. During this time, she also studied at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming a life member.After the death of her mother and aunt, it is likely Lovisa took a break from teaching and the Erie Dime Saving and Loan Building was closed. By 1893, Lovisa married the widower Henry Catlin, a noted abolitionist and man of culture who was previously married to her cousin, Ellen Towner. The couple relocated and Lovisa returned to teaching, opening the Catlin School of Art in her home studio.|$|R
