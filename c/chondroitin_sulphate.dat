25|$|The head {{structure}} {{is followed by}} a variable combination of diverse DBL and CIDR proteins, and in many cases along with C2. This variation gives rise to different types of PfEMP1. The DBL-CIDR combination in a particular type of PfEMP1 protein is never random, but organized into specific sequences known as domain cassettes. In some domain cassettes, there are only two or few DBL domains and CIDR domains, but in others they cover {{the entire length of the}} PfEMP1. These differences are responsible for different binding capacity among different PfEMP1s. For instance, among the most well-known types, VAR3 (earlier called type 3 PfEMP1) is the smallest, consisting of only NTS with DBL1α and DBL2ε domains in the ECD. Its molecular size is approximately 150 kDa. In domain cassette (DC) 4 type, the ECD is made up of three domains DBLα1.1/1.4, CIDRα1.6 and DBLβ3. The DBLβ3 domain contains a binding site for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). This is particularly implicated with the development of brain infection. VAR2CSA is atypical in having a single domain cassette that consists of three N terminal DBLPAM domains followed by three DBLε domains and one CIDRPAM. The seven domains always occur together. The usual NTS is absent. The protein specifically binds to <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> A (CSA); hence the name VAR2CSA.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of collagen in enameloid distinguishes it clearly from true enamel, but {{little is known}} about the phylogenetic relationship between these 2 tissues. It has previously been reported that amelogenins are the principal proteins of the enamel matrix, that type I collagen and <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> are the predominant matrices in dentine, and that amphibian and reptilian aprismatic enamels contain no sulphated glycoconjugates, although certain sulphated substances are secreted into mammalian prismatic enamel during matrix formation. The larval urodele (Triturus pyrrhogaster) teeth are known to be composed of enameloid, dentine, and enamel-like tissue. To characterise the tooth matrices, the localisation of amelogenin-like proteins, type I collagen, and sulphated glycoconjugates was investigated. <b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> and fine fibrils immunoreactive for type I collagen were elaborated as the enameloid matrix inside the dental basement membrane. After the matrix had been deposited in full thickness, coarse collagen fibrils also immunoreactive for type I collagen and <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> were deposited below as the first dentine matrix. Further, enamel-like matrix with no collagen fibrils or sulphated glycoconjugates but strongly immunoreactive for amelogenins was deposited on the dentine. Although no immunolabelling for amelogenins was found over the enameloid matrix, at least at the formation stage, the zone of coarse collagen fibrils of dentine was partially immunoreactive as observed in mammalian mantle dentine. From the ontogeny and matrix constituents of larval urodele teeth, it is suggested that enameloid is originally a dentine-like tissue...|$|R

50|$|The primary outcome {{measure was}} a 20% {{decrease}} in the WOMAC pain subscale from baseline to week 24. The analysis of the primary outcome data for all patients showed the percentage of responders in each group to be: glucosamine: 64.0%; chondroitin sulphate: 65.4%; glucosamine + chondroitin sulphate: 66.6%; and celecoxib: 70.1% (p=0.008). Thus, despite the considerable effect elicited by all the products, only the celecoxib group reached statistical significance. This has been discussed by the authors and attributed mainly to the unprecedented high response {{in the placebo group}} (60.1%) and the relatively mild degree of pain among participants, which may have limited the ability to detect treatment benefits. Indeed, treatment effects were more substantial in patients with moderate-to-severe pain. Analysis of the results for the primary outcome, based on higher baseline pain, showed the percentage of responders in each treatment group to be 54.3% for placebo; 61.4% for chondroitin sulphate; 65.7% for glucosamine hydrochloride; 69.4% for celecoxib; and 79.2% for combined glucosamine and <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Thus, in the higher WOMAC pain stratum, only the combination glucosamine + chondroitin group presented significant efficacy (p=0.002).|$|E

Keratan sulphate lengths were similarly somewhat longer. The data support the idea that Cupromeronic blue acts as a scaffold that helps maintain polyanion shape against distortion on staining. Stained filaments in tissues were sometimes over twice the length of isolated stained proteoglycans, suggesting that 2 glycan chains were aligned end-to-end. Thicknesses of proteoglycan filaments suggested that at least 2 glycan chains were aligned side-by-side, both in models and in tissues.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the application of periodate oxidation to the histochemical identification of the acidic polysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans) of connective tissues, especially cartilage. When fresh frozen sections of bovine nasal septal cartilage are given prolonged exposure to sodium periodate solution a great deal of basophilic sulphated material is lost. This was characterised by staining with Alcian blue in 0. 40 M MgC 12 to be mainly <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates.</b> The loss was shown to be due specifically to the periodate ion and most occurs during the first hour of exposure of sections. Two main sites of action of periodate in cartilage were considered. These are the network of collagen fibrils and the interfibrillar proteoglycans. Periodate was shown to cause great decreases in viscosity for proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycuronan solutions. Propan- 1 -ol, a presumed free-radical scavenger, was found to diminish loss of stainable material from cartilage sections and the rate of decrease of viscosity of glycos-aminoglycuronans in periodate solution. It is proposed that free-radicals are present in periodate solution and that they cause depolymerization of glycosaminoglycuronans, thus facilitating their loss by diffusion. In addition, periodate causes a general loosening-up of the matrix of collagen fibres. Methods of preventing the loss from cartilage sections were investigated. Formaldehyde fixation had a little effect. Cetylpyridinium, a precipitant for acidic polymers such as <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates,</b> was much more effective. Treating sections with solutions of low pH produced a fixation which could not be reversed. The use of free-radical scavengers was considered. It was not possible to determine the effect of cetyl-pyridinium complex formation upon the rate of periodate oxidation of glycosaminoglycuronans by performance of model experiments, with these substances spotted on stripe of 'paper'.

The results indicated that neutral glycoconjugates with 1, 2 -glycol groups and sialic acids {{were present in the}} luminal border and apical cytoplasm of the glandular cells, basement membrane and connective tissue in the lamina propria of the lateral prostate. Similar patterns were demonstrated in the seminal vesicle except that there were relatively fewer or no neutral carbohydrates in the apical cytoplasm of the vesicular epithelial cells. The epithelial basement membrane and connective tissue at the epithelial-stromal interface of both glands were rich in acidic and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. Partial characterization by bovine testicular hyaluronidase indicated the presence of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> in the lamina propria of the glands. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to develop and {{characterize}} biohybrid hydrogels containing combinations of gelatin and <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Two approaches have been compared. First, physisorption of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> to gelatin hydrogels was investigated using surface plasmon resonance measurements. Due to the limited interaction between both biopolymers, we developed in a second approach methacrylate-modified <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> hydrogels as such or in combination with methacrylamide-modified gelatin. Rheology measurements indicated that following this approach, mechanically stable hydrogel films could be obtained after UV irradiation {{in the presence of}} Irgacure 2959 as UV photo-initiator. When keeping the gelatin concentration and the modification degree constant, an increase in derivatization of the <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> component resulted in a high increase of the storage modulus...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (CS) {{is widely}} {{consumed}} orally by humans, and non-humans {{as it is}} believed to be beneficial for those with joint-related pathologies. Data concerning the functions of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> in this, and other, biological systems are being actively extended. However, it is important to appreciate that <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> molecules represent a heterogeneous population the structure of which varies with source. As commercially available <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> is derived from a range of sources, and the molecular functions of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> depend upon the structure, there are a range of structures available with differing potential for therapeutic impacts on a range of pathologies. While the safety of CS is not presently in doubt, poor quality finished products have the potential to compromise clinical and lab-based studies and will fail to give consumers all of the benefits available. Major parameters including bioavailability and uptake have been studied {{but it is clear that}} significant challenges remain in the identification of composition, sequence and size impacts on function, understanding how the consumed material is altered during uptake and travels to a site of action and how it exerts an influence on biological processes. If we understand these factors it may be possible to predict impacts upon biological processes and identify specific <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> structures which may target specific pathologies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{synthesis}} on proteoglycans was {{decreased in}} rat chondrosarcoma cell {{cultures in the}} presence of cycloheximide (0. 1 - 1. 0 muM) or p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside (50 microM). In the presence of cycloheximide the proteoglycan monomer was of larger size, the <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were increased in length, but a similar number of chains was attached to each proteoglycan {{and the size of the}} core protein was unaltered. In the presence of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside (50 microM), <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis was increased (by 60 - 80 %), but the incorporation into proteoglycans was decreased (by 70 %). The <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> chains were of shorter length than in control cultured and the number of chains attached to each proteoglycan was decreased. In cultures with cycloheximide or actinomycin D the synthesis of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> was less inhibited on beta-xyloside than on endogenous proteoglycan. When the rate of <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphate</b> synthesis was decreased by lowering the temperature of cultures, the chains synthesized at 22 and 4 degrees C were much longer than at 37 degrees C, but {{in the presence of}} p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside the chains were of the same length at all three temperatures. A model of chain elongation is thus proposed in which the rate of chain synthesis is determined by the concentration of xylosyl acceptor and the length of the chains is determined by the ratio of elongation activity to xylosyl-acceptor concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of whole urine of stone-formers and normal controls to precipitate crystals of calcium oxalate dihydrate from ions endogenous in urine was {{investigated by the}} method of rapid evaporation to 1250 mOsm/kg and subsequent freezing. Over 90 % incidence in crystallization was achieved in the two groups. When the population density and size of these crystals were compared, {{it was found that}} 50 % of urine samples from stone formers (30 - 50 years of age) were rich in crystal-nucleating and growth-inhibiting factors and the other 50 % were not different from normal controls. These effects were observed when polyanionic macromolecules recovered from pooled urine samples of stone-formers or normal controls were dissolved in urine ultrafiltrate and similarly tested. That the urinary polyanions were the active modifiers in the test system was further corroborated by the reversal of crystallization activity of urine samples and the urinary polyanions after they had been through an acidification-reneutralization procedure. The urinary polyanionic macromolecules were found, after enzymatic and/or chemical treatment, to contain <b>chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates,</b> dermatan sulphates, heparan sulphates and glycoproteins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Effects of four mucopolysaccharides and dextran {{sulphate}} on penicillin-induced lysis of Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209 P were studied. Heparin and dextran sulphate inhibited lysis, whereas {{hyaluronic acid}} enhanced it. <b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> A and C had no effect. Incubation of S. aureus suspended in 0 - 03 M phosphate buffer (PH 7 - 0) with dextran sulphate inhibited autolysis of the bacteria, whereas incubation with hyaluronic acid enhanced autolysis. Both extracellular and cell-associated autolysin activities of S. aureus were suppressed by dextran sulphate and {{high concentrations of}} heparin. The addition of hyaluronic acid enhanced autolysin activity. The release of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a modulator of autolysin activity, from penicillin-treated bacteria was inhibited by heparin and dextran sulphate. However, hyaluronic acid {{had no effect on}} release of LTA. These results suggest that inhibition of penicillin-induced lysis of S. aureus by heparin results mainly from inhibition of LTA release while dextran sulphate inhibits both autolysin activity and LTA release. Hyaluronic acid appears to enhance penicillin-induced lysis through activation of the autolysins...|$|R
40|$|Human {{articular}} cartilage was obtained post mortem from the lateral femoral condyles of 30 subjects aged from under 1 to 70 years. Cryostat sections taken 0 [...] 100 micrometers and 900 [...] 100 micrometers deep to the cartilage surface were exhaustively extracted {{to recover the}} glycosaminoglycans (GAG). After fractionation by cellulose acetate electrophoresis and enzyme depolymerisation individual GAG were determined by alcian blue - 0. 05 M MgCl 2 and disaccharide microassay procedures. Changes with age were observed in GAG concentration and {{in the proportion of}} individual GAG. Large alterations occurred during the period of skeletal growth (0 [...] 16 y). At birth GAG formed about 50 % of the dry weight of cartilage, a value that decreased to about 15 % in adult cartilage. <b>Chondroitin</b> <b>sulphates</b> (ChS) formed the principal GAG of {{articular cartilage}} and accounted for almost all of the GAG of the infant material. The ChS decreased with age and were partially replaced by keratan sulphate (KS), so the KS eventually comprised 12 % of the GAG. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was identified and was found to increase linearly with age to form 6 % by weight of the cartilage GAG by 60 y...|$|R
