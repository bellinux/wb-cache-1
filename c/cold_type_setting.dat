2500|$|For {{a number}} of years after its introduction, the Selectric Composer was {{considered}} to be a highly desirable, powerful desk-sized <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> <b>setting</b> system, affordable by small businesses and organizations. It was usually leased, including a service contract for the skilled labor required to fix and adjust it. [...] The Selectric Composer was accorded respect and affection among small publishers, unrivaled until the appearance of the Apple Macintosh, laser printer, and desktop publishing software. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine and compare hot metal and <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> production of display advertising for newspapers. The classical hot metal system uses a lead alloy as its basic building material while modern <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> production uses photographic means. Some advantages of using <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> are the improved quality of the final product, increased versatility in ad composition, possibilities for major labor savings, the lower skills required for the compositor and less production space required for the machinery. Some disadvantages of <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> production are the major investment required for new equipment, higher materials costs, difficulty in producing proofs, labor relations and retraining difficulties, and the durability of the press plates. The data for the hot metal method consisted of a sample of 195 ads. The eight major operations studied were Markup Time, Type Slips Time, Stereotype Time, Typesetting Time, Composing Time, Proof Pulling Time, and Correction Time. Thirty-seven factors, such as {{the size of the}} ad and the number of lines of type, were hypothesized to effect the operation times. These operation times and factors were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis to formulate a mathematical model of the hot metal system. For this <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> system, circumstances prevented making a complete model but data for a sample of 15 ads was collected. The data for the sample of <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> ads was used in the hot metal regression model to determine comparable times for production of the ads by both systems. Experimental results showed that it would take three times as long to compose the ads by hot metal. When combined labor and materials costs are considered, hot metal costs 1. 6 to 2. 8 times as much as <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> depending on the wage rates considered and the relative productive efficiency of both plants. Administrative and most overhead costs were considered to remain constant no matter what production system was used. The depreciation rate for the <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> operations is 3. 06 times that of the hot metal system studied. Recommendations for further study include: 1. Reevaluate hot metal regression model using transformations in order to reduce non-linearities. 2. Reformulate the <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> system so that equivalent production work can be measured to produce a <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> regression model. 3. Extend the study of <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> and hot metal into news and classified production. 4, Use the complex regression models to determine major variables so that simplified models could easily be prepared by any interested newspaper. 5, Determine realistic cost comparisons including the effects of unequal depreciation rates, taxes, and interest. 6. Produce a companion study of the social effects of a transition from hot metal to <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> {{in order to be able}} to project actual benefits derived from the transition...|$|R

40|$|Black liquor as a {{waste of}} (yielded by) pulp {{factories}} in Indonesia was estimated to reach more than 2. 3 million tonnes/year. The use of this liquid has long been explored for wood adhesive, particularlyfor glue <b>cold</b> <b>setting</b> <b>type.</b> In this research, black liquor was isolated to get lignin isolate by re-precipitation method. The lignin isolate was then added with resorcinol and formaldehyde at molar ratio of Lignin (L) : Resorcinol (R) : Formaldehyde (F) = 1 : 0. 5 : 2. Physical. mechanical, and chemical properties of the glue were tested and evaluated using procedures described in Indonesian standard (SN/) and Japanese standard (JAS). Results indicated that the isolate lignin obtained from black liquor contained typical functional groups, namely hydroxyphenolic and metoxyl. Under FTIR spectrophotometer. the co-polymer lignin resorcinol formaldehyde showed similar infrared wave number to those of phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin. The adhesive yielded from co-polymerization lignin had a red-brown colored dilution, typical phenol smell, with 48. 95 % of solid content, 3. 71 % of free formaldehyde, and 227. 5 minute of gelatinous time. The Lignin resorcinol formaldehyde glue is applicable for laminated wood products...|$|R

50|$|Johnston was {{originally}} printed using wood type for large signs and metal type for print. (London Transport often {{did not use}} Johnston for general small printing, with many documents such as bus timetables using other typefaces such as Gill Sans). By the 1970s, as <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> was becoming the norm for printing, Johnston had become difficult for printers to use. Signs and posters of the period started to use other, more easily sourced typefaces such as Helvetica, Univers and News Gothic. To maintain London Transport's old corporate identity, Johnston was rendered into <b>cold</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> paralleled {{the development of}} web offset presses, particularly for newspapers, {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century. The combination of <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> and offset presses dramatically reduced the expense of publishing a newspaper, especially labor costs. Harris and Goss were two companies that led in the development of web offset presses. The Goss Community press, which is still in production as of 2014, was an affordable solution for small and mid-size newspapers, and they frequently bought Compugraphic typesetting equipment at the same time.|$|R

50|$|The {{causes of}} AIHA are poorly understood. The disease may be primary, or {{secondary}} to another underlying illness. The primary illness is idiopathic (the two terms used synonymously). Idiopathic AIHA accounts for approximately 50% of cases. Secondary AIHA {{can result from}} many other illnesses. Warm and <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> AIHA each have their own more common secondary causes. The most common causes of secondary warm-type AIHA include lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma) and other autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Less common causes of warm-type AIHA include neoplasms other than lymphoid, and infection. Secondary <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> AIHA is also caused primarily by lymphoproliferative disorders, but is also commonly caused by infection, especially by mycoplasma, viral pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, and other respiratory infections. Less commonly, it {{can be caused by}} concomitant autoimmune disorders.|$|R

5000|$|In retrospect, <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> {{paved the}} way for the vast range of modern digital fonts, with the lighter weight of {{equipment}} allowing far larger families than had been possible with metal type. However, modern designers have noted that compromises of <b>cold</b> <b>type,</b> such as altered designs, made the transition to digital when a better path might have been to return to the traditions of metal type. Adrian Frutiger, who in his early career redesigned many fonts for phototype, noted that [...] "the fonts redrew don’t have any historical worth...to think of the sort of aberrations I had to produce in order to see a good result on Lumitype! V and W needed huge crotches in order to stay open. I nearly had to introduce serifs in order to prevent rounded-off corners - instead of a sans-serif the drafts were a bunch of misshapen sausages!" ...|$|R
