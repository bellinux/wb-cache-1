Higher levels of DNA lesions were observed in <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues</b> than in cancer-free surrounding tissues.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry S-P method and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were used to detect the expression of survivin and apoptotic cell in situ in colorectal <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues,</b> para-cancerous tissues and normal tissues of 48 cases of colorectal carcinoma.

40|$|The present {{work has}} {{endeavored}} {{to survey the}} occurence of adenosine deaminase {{as well as its}} multiple forms in normal and some <b>cancerous</b> human <b>tissues.</b> A recent report by Akedo, Nishihara, Shinkai and Komatsu concerning the appearance of the C form adenosine deaminase in <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues</b> is investigated.

Our experiments on 646 brain biopsy samples of 60 different patients demonstrate that by using spectral features defined on the normalized Laplacian of the graph, we achieve 100 % accuracy in the classification of <b>cancerous</b> and healthy <b>tissues.</b> In the classification of <b>cancerous</b> and benign <b>tissues,</b> our experiments yield 92 % and 89 % accuracy on the testing set for the <b>cancerous</b> and benign <b>tissues.</b> We also analyze graph spectra to identify the distinctive spectral features of the <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues</b> to conclude that (i) the features representing the cellular density are the most distinctive features to distinguish the <b>cancerous</b> and healthy <b>tissues,</b> (ii) and the number of the eigenvalues in the normalized Laplacian spectrum that have a value of 0 is the most distinctive feature to distinguish the <b>cancerous</b> and benign <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
25|$|Chávez was {{diagnosed}} with cancer following the discovery of a mass in his pelvic region in June 2011. He traveled to Havana, Cuba where he underwent a surgical operation to remove a malignant <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissue</b> mass 'about the size of a baseball' from his waist. He underwent a second surgical operation in Venezuela one month later. Over the next 12 months, he followed a cycle of chemotherapy. The type of cancer Chávez {{was diagnosed}} with was never made public which fueled speculation over his condition (with speculations from being prostate cancer to colon cancer among others). Following the presidential election in October 2012 (where he was re-elected to a fourth term), he went to Cuba for more treatment and then returned to Venezuela and stayed at a Caracas army hospital for one week until his death. Successive announcements of his return and updates of his health were criticised by the country's opposition that the population were unaware of his health and location. The fact that the cancer had metastasised was not made public during the campaign, and strongly denied by Government officers. After the first lung infection (pneumonia) in the last stages of his life, Chávez was intubated nearing the end of December. His breathing worsened until his death was announced at 16:25 VET (20:55 UTC) on 5 March 2013, almost two years after he was first diagnosed.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives-Differences in the {{activities}} or concentration of certain enzymes in cancerous cells and their normal counterparts have been well documented. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine and compare {{the activities}} of arginase and rhodanese in selected normal and <b>cancerous</b> human <b>tissues.</b> Methods-Cancerous tissue specimens were obtained from surgically resected organs and normal tissues were obtained from fresh frozen corpses in the Forensic Medicine Center, Shiraz, Iran. Rhodanese was assayed by the modified method of Sorbo and arginase activity was based on urea determination. Results-In most cases, the activity of arginase in the <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues</b> was higher than the normal tissues, but in the stomach cancer, the increase was significant (p< 0. 05). The comparison between the activity of rhodanese in the normal and <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues</b> revealed variable results; the activity was higher in the breast cancer group while it showed significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced activity in the lung cancer. Conclusion-The results presented in this study indicated that arginase activity was higher in the <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissues</b> than their normal counterparts and this might be consistent with the role of arginase in ornithine biosynthesis. Different patterns of rhodanese activity in the malignant tissues and its reduced activity especially in the lung cancer has no satisfactory explanation in the medical literature...|$|R
2500|$|Some of the {{biological}} effects of radium were apparent from the start. The first case of so-called [...] "radium-dermatitis" [...] was reported in 1900, only 2 years after the element's discovery. The French physicist Antoine Becquerel carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for 6 hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated. Pierre and Marie Curie were so intrigued by radiation that they sacrificed their own health {{to learn more about}} it. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissue</b> as it had attacked healthy tissue. Handling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curie's death due to aplastic anemia. A significant amount of radium's danger comes from its daughter radon: being a gas, it can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium.|$|E
2500|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{commonly}} {{applied to the}} cancerous tumor because {{of its ability to}} control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of <b>cancerous</b> <b>tissue</b> leading to cellular death. [...] To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.|$|E

This study aimed to measure the distribution of intrahepatic cccDNA levels and evaluate the association between levels of cccDNA and APOBEC 3 in HCC patients.
