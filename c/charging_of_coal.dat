40|$|The {{electronic}} charging of mine dust {{can cause}} coal-dust explosion {{and increase the}} risk of pneumoconiosis, so it is necessary to take more attention to the study of its electronic charging properties. The mechanism of electronic <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> mine dust was investigated in this paper. It was found that the formation and polarity of dust are determined by the energy band structure and of the two contacting sides; then a mathematical model of work function is established in mesoscopic level. The experiments conclude that the work function decreases with the particle size for the dust with same properties, moreover large particles are positively charged and small particles are negatively charged. Finally, the experimental verification of the main particles charged model drive unipolar and bipolar charged modes and confirm the correctness of microstructure and mesoscopic analyses, which furthermore lay the foundation for further research. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{flotation}} <b>of</b> naturally hydrophobic <b>coal</b> {{particles in}} salt solutions with different cations (Na+, Ca 2 +, and Al 3 +) was investigated {{to clarify the}} flotation enhancement mechanism. The surface chemistry aspects were examined using the zeta potential measurements and bubble-particle attachment time experiments. The results of the flotation experiments showed {{that the presence of}} electrolytes in the flotation system clearly enhanced the flotation performance in a manner dependent on the type and concentration of the electrolytes. In the experiments, the AlCl 3 and NaCl solutions showed the highest and the lowest flotation performance improvements, respectively. The zeta potential measurements showed that AlCl 3 had a stronger influence on the surface <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> particles than CaCl 2 or NaCl did. The induction time measurements indicated that the attachment decreased with increasing salt concentration and ionic valency state. In addition, abundant fine bubbles were generated in higher concentration salt solutions, particularly for the AlCl 3 solutions, which prevented from the bubble coalescence and increased froth stability. It is concluded that the addition of salt solutions to a flotation system enhances the coal flotation performance, particularly for high-valence electrolyte solutions, which is attributed to the abundance of finer bubbles in the froth phase, depending on the type and concentration of the electrolyte...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a video image analyzer for measuring the size and <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> airborne particles.

Analysis of the particle tracks allows the size and <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the particles to be determined.

Appendix I shows size and <b>charge</b> distributions <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and flyash particles measured with the image analyzer. A second instrument, an Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectrometer (UPS) for measuring effective work functions of insulator and semiconductor surfaces in air is under development. Work function data for individual macerals and minerals in a coal matrix will be related to triboelectric charging properties. In this instrumental method, originally developed by Kirhata, the surface of a test sample is bombarded by monochromatic ultraviolet light of known wavelength. At atmospheric pressure, the photo-ejected electrons attach to air molecules forming negative ions. The ions are attracted by an applied electric field into a detector where they are accelerated to sufficient energy that they cause momentary dielectric breakdown or discharge in the air inside the detector. The rate at which these discharges occur is proportional to the rate at which photoelectrons are generated at the sample surface. From a plot of the discharge rate as a function of photon energy the minimum energy needed to remove an electron can be determined. The mechanical components of our instrument have been completed. A number of electronic circuit difficulties remain to be solved. The counting circuits are able to produce a count rate proportional to the ion concentration generated using a corona gun. However, when the high voltage accelerating potential is applied the circuit oscillates preventing proper operation. Our current focus on this instrument is to attain stability of operation...|$|R

The feed and processed powders were analyzed by a variety of methods including moisture, ash, total sulfur, and pyritic sulfur content. Mass distribution and cumulative <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the processed powders were also measured. Fresh ground coal performed the best in electrostatic beneficiation. Results are compared with those of similar studies conducted on Pittsburgh # 8 powders last year (April 1, 1997 to September 30, 1997). Polystyrene latex spheres were charged and deposited onto coal particles that had been passed through the electrostatic separator and collected onto insulating filters. The observations suggest bipolar <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> individual particles and patches <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> on the particles which may be associated with particular maceral types or with mineral inclusions. A preliminary investigation was performed on eletrostatic separation of unburned carbon particles from flyash. Approximately 25 % of the flyash acquired positive charge in the copper tribocharger.
