5000|$|Politifact {{noted that}} some people {{saw it as a}} joke about {{assassination}} or a reference to political action, while others took it as a threat. Politifact also noted that the premise behind Trump's remark—that <b>Clinton</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> [...] "abolish the Second Amendment"—was factually false. The Trump campaign responded with a statement that attributed the comment to the great political power that Second Amendment people have. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Trump should clarify what seemed to him a joke gone wrong. Hillary Clinton responded to Trump's comments by saying, [...] "words matter", and that Trump's comments were part of a long line of casual comments from Trump that had [...] "crossed a line." ...|$|E
5000|$|At a {{campaign}} stop in Wilmington, North Carolina, on August 9, Donald Trump said that Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> [...] "essentially abolish the Second Amendment" [...] {{because of her}} support for gun control.

50|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} Israeli-Palestinian peace process a major {{priority}} in his foreign policy, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> ensure Iraq and Iran {{would not be}} in a position to interfere with that agenda. Iraq was already under containment by the U.S. and its allies in the form of the Iraqi no-fly zones. Iran had been cut off from the U.S. ever since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Although Clinton held out hope for eventual changes in regime policy from these countries, containment seemed like the only viable option in the near term.|$|R

50|$|About the album, Mothership Connection, Clinton said “We had put {{black people}} in {{situations}} nobody ever {{thought they would be}} in, like the White House. I figured another place you wouldn't think black people would be was in outer space. I was a big fan of Star Trek, so we did a thing with a pimp sitting in a spaceship shaped like a Cadillac, and we did all these James Brown-type grooves, but with street talk and ghetto slang.” Like Sun Ra, <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see {{black people in}} space.|$|R
5000|$|After her January 2009 {{appointment}} as Secretary of State, Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hire Blumenthal. However, Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, blocked his selection due to lingering anger among President Barack Obama's aides over Blumenthal's {{role in promoting}} negative stories about Obama during the Democratic primary. According {{to a report in}} the New York Times, [...] "Emanuel talked with Mrs. Clinton ... and explained that bringing Mr. Blumenthal on board was a no-go. The bad blood among his colleagues was too deep, and the last thing the administration needed, he concluded, was dissension and drama in the ranks. In short, Mr. Blumenthal was out." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2000, President <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> visit Pyongyang. However, the {{intended}} visit never happened, {{due to the}} controversy surrounding {{the results of the}} 2000 U.S. Presidential Election. Around April or May 2001, Kim Dae-jung was expecting to welcome Kim Jong-il to Seoul. Returning from his meeting in Washington with newly elected President Bush, Kim Dae-jung described his meeting as embarrassing while privately cursing President Bush and his hardliner approach. This meeting negated any chance of a North Korean visit to South Korea. With the Bush administration labeling North Korea as being part of the [...] "axis of evil", North Korea renounced the nonproliferation treaty, kicked out UN inspectors, and restarted its nuclear program. In early 2005, the North Korean government confirmed that the country had successfully become a nuclear armed state.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to 1780, {{much of the}} Revolutionary War {{was fought}} in the Northern states. After an {{unsuccessful}} Northern campaign, British General Clinton decided to turn {{his attention to the}} south, where he believed that he and his troops would join up with loyalist militias and easily take the area. [...] The campaign began with a swift move to capture Charleston, which was taken over after two months of fighting. After the capture of Charleston, <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> capitalize on his victory, and sent British detachments in all directions, to subdue as much resistance as possible. After placing Cornwallis in charge of the Southern Campaign, Clinton returned to New York, where much of the British high command was. Clinton's instructions were to first finish off South Carolina, and then move north, to North Carolina, followed by Virginia.|$|R

5000|$|Game Change {{included}} several new assertions about the 2008 campaign {{that had not}} previously been reported. Among them were that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senator Chuck Schumer privately had urged Barack Obama {{to run for president}} in the fall of 2006, in hopes that it would energize the Democratic base and improve the party's chances of winning the presidency. The book also detailed an hour-long meeting between Hillary Clinton and pollster Mark Penn, during which Clinton accused Obama of [...] "playing the race card" [...] and importing people into Iowa to improve his chances at the caucus. The book also alleges that Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a bigger issue out of Obama's drug use, but was dissuaded by certain members of her staff. Also during this meeting, she allegedly said, [...] "I hate the choice that the country's faced with. I think it is a terrible choice for our nation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Having called Wikileaks [...] "disgraceful" [...] in 2010, Trump praised Wikileaks in October 2016, saying, [...] "I love Wikileaks." [...] In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Assange only exposed {{material}} {{damaging to}} the Democratic National Committee and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Wikileaks popularized conspiracies about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting an article which suggested Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals, which was later revealed to be false implying that the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed, suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews, claiming that Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> drone strike Assange, promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health, and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump-related internet community tying the Clinton campaign to child kidnapper Laura Silsby. According to Harvard political scientist Matthew Baum and College of the Canyons political scientist Phil Gussin, Wikileaks strategically released e-mails related to the Clinton campaign whenever Clinton's lead expanded in the polls.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the report}} dealt with Donaldson's assertions of a conspired {{cover-up}} by the FBI and NTSB, in co-operation with the Justice Department. Donaldson believed that the <b>Clinton</b> Administration <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hide the actual cause of the crash for political reasons, specifically the upcoming presidential elections. Donaldson concluded his report with the request that Congress hold Congressional hearings into the crash and/or request that the Justice Department appoint an Independent Counsel to investigate (neither of which happened).|$|R
50|$|McCall was the {{favorite}} of the Democratic establishment, but he faced a tough challenge from Cuomo which almost split the party. Cuomo {{proved to be a}} better fundraiser, and McCall's own campaign war chest was heavily depleted in the primary battle. Although McCall himself did not make any negative attacks, his close supporter, US Congressman Charles B. Rangel, stated that the McCall camp would not necessarily endorse Cuomo in the general election should the latter win. This backfired as some Italian-Americans interpreted that as racism, and many of Cuomo's supporters refused to unite behind McCall after McCall won the nomination. McCall was endorsed by Senator Chuck Schumer. While Senator Hillary Clinton did not officially take sides during the primary, she loaned a staffer and a fundraiser to McCall's campaign and she marched by McCall's side at the West Indian American Day parade in New York City, as the <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> retain strong African-American support in case she made a president run in the future. Cuomo withdrew from the primary race after McCall moved to a double-digit lead in polls.|$|R
5000|$|Nothing {{positive}} {{happened to}} Sodom and Gomorrahand nothing positive {{is likely to}} happen to America if our people succumb to the drumbeats of support for the homosexual lifestyle. Jesse Helms Helms had a negative view of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and LGBT rights in the United States. [...] Helms called homosexuals [...] "weak, morally sick wretches" [...] and tried to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts for supporting the [...] "gay-oriented artwork of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe". In 1993, when then-president Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> appoint 'out' lesbian Roberta Achtenberg to assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Helms held up the confirmation [...] "because she's a damn lesbian", adding [...] "she's not your garden-variety lesbian. She's a militant-activist-mean lesbian". [...] Helms also stated [...] "I'm not going to put a lesbian in a position like that. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call me a bigot, fine." [...] When Clinton urged that gays be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces, Helms said the president [...] "better have a bodyguard" [...] if he visited North Carolina. His views on gay and lesbian citizens were depicted in the 1998 documentary film Dear Jesse.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the {{documentary}}'s intention, filmmaker Ziegler stated, [...] "... {{the point}} of my documentary is not to 'blame' 9/11 on Bill <b>Clinton.</b> We just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> expose the real history {{that led to the}} attacks and correct the historical record about what happened to this film so that we can help prevent this from happening again in the future." ...|$|R
50|$|BNP {{staged a}} walkout from {{parliament}} in August 1997. The BNP returned to Parliament under another agreement in March 1998. In June 1999, the BNP and other opposition parties again began {{to abstain from}} attending Parliament. Opposition parties have staged {{an increasing number of}} nationwide general strikes, rising from 6 days of general strikes in 1997 to 27 days in 1999. A four-party opposition alliance formed at the beginning of 1999 announced that it would boycott parliamentary by-elections and local government elections unless the government took steps demanded by the opposition to ensure electoral fairness. The government did not take these steps, and the opposition has subsequently boycotted all elections, including municipal council elections in February 1999, several parliamentary by-elections, and the Chittagong city corporation elections in January 2000. The opposition demands that the Awami League government step down immediately {{to make way for a}} caretaker government to preside over parliamentary and local government. In March 2000, US President Bill Clinton became the first US President to visit Bangladesh. Hasina later stated that during the visit <b>Clinton</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> import gas from the Country, but she had to decline due to fear of scarcity of gas and for the welfare of the people as they were heavily dependent on gas.|$|R
5000|$|During his tenure, Carlson was a {{frequent}} critic of U.S. Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD), who held certain positions contrary to Catholic teachings. In 1997, before a Senate vote on partial-birth abortion legislation, Carlson denounced a compromise proposed by Daschle that would ban the procedure but allow exemptions for women claiming mental or physical health reasons, calling the proposition a [...] "smokescreen" [...] designed to [...] "provide cover for pro-abortion senators and President <b>Clinton,</b> who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid a veto confrontation."

5000|$|In July 2016 the Great America PAC {{released}} its third ad entitled [...] "Leadership" [...] featuring former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In the ad Mayor Giuliani says [...] "The world must {{come together and}} America needs to lead, yet President Barack Obama and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stay the course. The incompetence Hillary Clinton displayed during the Benghazi attack and her singular focus on protecting her own reputation proves she {{is not ready to}} be commander-in-chief. We face many challenges as a nation, but nothing is more critical than America displaying strong leadership and an unwavering resolve to defeat terrorism. America's leadership can and must be better and with Donald Trump as president, it will be." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{narrowly}} {{losing the}} Senate race, Abrams failed to realize his {{hopes for a}} cabinet post {{in the administration of}} President Bill <b>Clinton.</b> Abrams also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> run for Governor of New York, however fellow Democrat and incumbent Mario Cuomo decided to seek a fourth term.
