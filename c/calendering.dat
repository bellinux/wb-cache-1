25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} <b>calendering</b> paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calendering</b> is a {{finishing}} process used on cloth, paper, or plastic film. A calender is employed, usually to smooth, coat, or thin a material. With textiles, fabric is passed under rollers at high temperatures and pressures. <b>Calendering</b> {{is used on}} fabrics such as moire to produce its watered effect and also on cambric and some types of sateens.|$|E
50|$|The <b>calender</b> {{is a set}} of {{multiple}} large-diameter rolls that squeeze rubber compound into a thin sheet, usually of the order of 2 metres wide. Fabric <b>calenders</b> produce an upper and lower rubber sheet with a layer of fabric in between. Steel <b>calenders</b> do so with steel cords. <b>Calenders</b> are used to produce body plies and belts. A creel room is a facility that houses hundreds of fabric or wire spools that are fed into the <b>calender.</b> <b>Calenders</b> utilize downstream equipment for shearing and splicing <b>calendered</b> components.|$|R

50|$|Within Ireland, {{beetling}} {{was first}} introduced by Hamilton Maxwell in 1725. Beetling {{is part of the}} finishing of the linen cloth. The hammering tightens the weave and give the cloth a smooth feel. The process was gradually phased out, in lieu of <b>Calendering.</b> A similarity is the compression; however, with <b>Calendering,</b> the finish does not remain {{for the life of the}} cloth. This distinguishes it from Beetling.|$|E

He was a {{prisoner}} of war in Stalag 344 Germany during which time he painted the <b>calender</b> for a Canadian prisoner of war. During his sojourn with her parents, the Canadian presented this <b>calender</b> to the mother of Mrs Erica Balland and the latter has returned it to South Africa after 41 years, to be preserved for posterity. The widow of Peter Ogilvie was traced in Somerset-West and the <b>calender</b> shown to her. She, in turn revealed, that a friend of Peter Ogilvies, Newman Robinson had written a diary dealing with his and Ogilvie's experiences during the Second World War. Ogilvie was responsible for the drawings in the diary.

50|$|In {{preparation}} for <b>calendering,</b> the fabric is folded lengthwise {{with the front}} side, or face, inside, and stitched together along the edges. The fabric can be folded together at full width, however this is not done as often as it is more difficult. The fabric is then run through rollers that polish the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous. High temperatures and pressure are used as well. Fabrics that go through the <b>calendering</b> process feel thin, glossy and papery.|$|E

50|$|A <b>calender</b> is {{a series}} of hard {{pressure}} rollers used to form or smooth a sheet of material such as paper or plastic film. In a principal paper application, the <b>calender</b> is located {{at the end of a}} papermaking process (on-line). Those that are used separately from the process (off-line) are also called supercalenders. The purpose of a <b>calender</b> is to make the paper smooth and glossy for printing and writing, as well as of a consistent thickness for capacitors that use paper as their dielectric membrane.|$|R
50|$|A <b>calender</b> {{consists}} {{of two or more}} rolls, where pressure is applied to the passing paper. <b>Calenders</b> are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy.

50|$|Moire {{fabric is}} more {{delicate}} than {{fabric of the}} same type that has not gone through the <b>calendering</b> process. Also, contact with water removes the watermark and causes staining. Moire feels thin, glossy and papery due to the <b>calendering</b> process. Generally moire {{is made out of}} fabrics with a good body and defined ribs, such as grosgrain. Fabrics with defined ribs show the watered effect better than smooth fabrics like satin. Taffeta also works well. Fabrics with defined enough ribs can be calendered with smooth rollers and produce a moire finish; however generally the rollers have ribs that correspond to the grain of the fabric. The moire effect may be obtained on silk, worsted, or cotton fabrics, though it is impossible to develop it on anything other than a grained or fine corded weave.|$|E
