5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E

25|$|Reactions {{that take}} place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an {{important}} role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, which is why the sudden Antarctic ozone hole was such a surprise to many scientists.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to regasification, many valuable industrial byproducts {{can be produced}} using <b>cold</b> energy <b>of</b> LNG. <b>Cold</b> energy <b>of</b> LNG utilisation for extracting liquid oxygen and nitrogen gas from air, makes LNG-regasification plants more viable when they are located near integrated steel plants and/or urea plants. <b>Cold</b> energy <b>of</b> LNG usage in lieu of massive and energy intensive cryogenic refrigeration units in natural-gas processing plants is also more viable economically. The natural gas processed with <b>cold</b> energy <b>of</b> LNG and the imported LNG can be readily injected into a conventional natural gas distribution system to reach the ultimate consumers.|$|R

25|$|Jericho has {{evidence}} of settlement {{dating back to}} 10,000 BC. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BC, the droughts and <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> the Younger Dryas stadial {{had come to an}} end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.|$|E

I suppose that in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, we may find some echo of the Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E

25|$|Demographically, early {{settlers}} of {{the island}} included not only African Americans, but also (largely) English and British Isles settlers, including Irish and Scottish, as well as aboriginal and Hawaiian. The method of land purchase helped {{to ensure that the}} land was used for agricultural purposes and that the settlers were mostly families. Ruth Wells Sandwell in Beyond the City Limit indicates that few {{of the island}}'s early residents were commercial farmers, with most families maintaining subsistence plots and supplementing through other activities, including fishing, logging and working for the colony's government. Some families later abandoned their land as a result of lack of civic services on the island or other factors, such as the livestock-killing <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> the winter of 1862.|$|E
25|$|In {{this last}} and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret {{resisted}} {{the heat of}} thirty summers, and the <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> as many winters. Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his outstretched arms in {{the figure of a}} cross, but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account. The progress of an ulcer in his thigh might shorten, but it could not disturb, this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.|$|E
25|$|For the repair, the CAIB {{determined}} that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium, or other metal, scavenged from the crew cabin. These metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> space. The ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry, preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing. The CAIB could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry, {{and concluded that the}} rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing Columbias crew back alive.|$|E
