500|$|Reducing {{the amount}} of food waste has been deemed {{critical}} if the UK is to meet international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill. Equally great emphasis has been placed on the reduction of food waste, across all developed countries, as a means of ending the global food crisis that leaves millions worldwide starving and impoverished. In the context of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, food waste was discussed at the 34th G8 summit in Hokkaidō, Japan. UK prime minister Gordon Brown said of the issue [...] "We must do more to deal with unnecessary demand, such as by all of us doing more to <b>cut</b> <b>our</b> food waste".|$|E
500|$|According to Poe, Janeway Lambda one was {{an example}} of an idea that [...] "sounded good in theory, ... didn't work out in practice", and was {{abandoned}} since everyone disliked it. Taylor reported that fans' lack of interest, and the criticism of Janeway being portrayed in the role of a servant or subordinate, resulted in the holonovel being discontinued. Seymour attributed the storyline's removal to the decision to avoid excessive use of the holodeck. Taylor wrote a conclusion for the novel, which was never developed into an episode, and she expressed disappointment that the narrative was left incomplete. Despite feeling attached to the project, she allowed that she was [...] "never afraid to <b>cut</b> <b>our</b> losses if something wasn't working". The holonovel was replaced with Janeway seeking counsel from a holographic version of Leonardo da Vinci. In her book Star Trek, Ina Rae Hark wrote that this decision was taken to make the series more appealing to a male audience.|$|E

Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid." [...] For a time Dylan thought the Beatles were singing [...] "I get high" [...] instead of [...] "I can't hide". He was surprised when he met them and found out that none of them had actually smoked marijuana. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson said the song [...] "wasn't even that great a record, but they [...] just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio.

2500|$|By {{the morning}} of September 15, Jackson had {{positioned}} nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and {{at the base of}} Loudoun Heights, prepared to enfilade the rear of the Federal line on Bolivar Heights. Jackson began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault for 8 a.m. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He had no expectation that relief would arrive from McClellan in time and his artillery ammunition was in short supply. At a council of war with his brigade commanders, he agreed to raise the white flag of surrender. But he would not be personally present at any ceremony. He was confronted by a captain of the 126th New York Infantry, who said, [...] "For 's sake, Colonel, don't surrender us. Don't you hear the signal guns? Our forces are near us. Let us <b>cut</b> <b>our</b> way out and join them." [...] But Miles replied, [...] "Impossible. They will blow us out of this place in half an hour." [...] As the captain turned away in disdain, a shell exploded, shattering Miles's left leg. So disgusted were the men of the garrison with Miles's behavior, which some claimed involved being drunk again, it was difficult to find a man who would take him to the hospital. He was mortally wounded and died the next day. Some historians have speculated that Miles was struck deliberately by fire from his own men.|$|E

This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave {{men and women in uniform}} make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to <b>cut</b> <b>our</b> soldiers' hazard pay. I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E

The user can dynamically modify the lighting, viewpoint, BRDF and per-pixel shading parameters. We present an efficient computational algorithm for functions rep-resented by a nonlinear piecewise constant approximation called <b>cuts.</b> <b>Our</b> main contribution {{is a single}} traversal algorithm for merg-ing cuts that allows for arbitrary pointwise computation, such as addition, multiplication, linear interpolation, and multi-product in-tegration. A theoretical error bound of this approach can be proved using a statistical interpretation of <b>cuts.</b> <b>Our</b> algorithm extends naturally to computation with many cuts and maps easily to mod-ern GPUs, leading to significant advantages over existing methods based on wavelet approximation. We apply this technique {{to the problem of}} realistic lighting and material design under complex il-lumination with arbitrary BRDFs. Our system smoothly integrates all-frequency relighting of shadows and reflections with dynamic per-pixel shading effects, such as bump mapping and spatially vary-ing BRDFs. This combination of capabilities is typically missing in current systems. We represent illumination and precomputed visi-bility as nonlinear sparse vectors; we then use <b>our</b> <b>cut</b> merging algo-rithm to simultaneously interpolate visibility cuts at each pixel, and compute the triple product integral of the illumination, interpolated visibility, and dynamic BRDF samples. Finally, we present a two-pass, data-driven approach that exploits pilot visibility samples to optimize the construction of the light tree, leading to more efficient cuts and reduced datasets. ...|$|R
