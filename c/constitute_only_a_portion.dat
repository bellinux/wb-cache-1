40|$|Abstract. — Manipulating {{forage fish}} populations to enhance sport {{fisheries}} {{is a common}} man-agement practice. Here we review the literature dealing with manipulations of gizzard shad Doroso-ma cepedianum and threadfin shad D. petenense to assess {{whether or not this}} practice has been successful. Shad introduction has tended to enhance predators, such as white crappie Pomoxis annularis, black crappie P. nigromaculatus, and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, and neg-atively affect presumed competitors, such as bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. However, responses have not been consistent within a species: some studies document negative responses of predators or positive responses of competitors to shad introduction. Depending on the study, target species have experienced negative, neutral, and positive effects due to shad removal, making generalizations impossible. Inadequate statistical analyses coupled with problems with study design further com-plicated interpretation of these studies. In addition, because resident predators feeding on intro-duced prey <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> of the complex of interactions that occur in a lake, factors such as multiple trophic levels, ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat, and spatial heterogeneity must be considered when attempts are made to predict the outcome of forage-fish manipulations.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{isolation}} and quan-titative estimation of urinary ketosteroids follow-ing the administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisone acetate to two normal young men, with appropriate control studies of their endogenous steroid excretion. The study was undertaken to obtain information on several aspects of endocrine physiology. The first of these was to provide an acceptable com-parison for {{an investigation of the}} influence of stress upon the young male subject as measured by the output of steroid hormone metabolites. The second was to secure basic information re-lating {{to the nature of the}} adrenal response and the metabolic pathways utilized when the adrenal gland was stimulated by its trophic hormone as well as when the pituitary secretion was sup-pressed by the administration of large doses of exogenous steroid.

Policy considerations, of course, are also advanced. These subjects, it is realized, <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion,</b> and that a comparatively small one, of the broad area of the extent of the citizen 2 ̆ 7 s duty to cooperate with police officers, but, it is hoped, a sufficiently important one to merit separate treatment. Certainly there is need for such treatment if the extent of law student misunderstanding of these subjects is any criterion. The difficulty, however, has not primarily been with the students but rather with the confused, intertwining, and to a considerable extent overlapping way the law has evolved in these areas. Common law misprision of felony, modern misprision of felony statutes, duty to assist and to obey police officers statutes, two fundamentally different varieties of accessory after the fact statutes and obstruction of justice and lying to police statutes must all be considered together with accompanying case law and questions of policy and constitutionality in order to get a complete picture. Previous writings in these areas largely tend to concentrate only on one crime area, ignoring or virtually ignoring the others and a particular effort has been made here to avert at least this one difficulty.

40|$|As {{a result}} of Francisco Franco overthrowing the young republican {{government}} during the Spanish Civil War (1936 – 39), countless citizens fled their home country in search of personal security and economic prosperity. Significantly, many of these expatriates were artists and musicians who eventually {{made their way to}} the United States, where they achieved celebrity status as dancers, singers, instrumentalists, and composers. This dissertation examines the lives and works of two such composers. In the 1950 s, Carlos Surinach (1915 – 97) and Leonardo Balada (b. 1933) came to the United States by way of New York City. Although both men were from Barcelona, their music and careers followed different trajectories. Surinach is often best remembered for his collaborations with choreographers of modern dance, such as Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Pearl Lang, and Alvin Ailey; however, his contributions to dance <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> of his creative output and were often adapted from his concert works, as choreographers found the rhythm and drama of his music appealing. Surinach’s style often exhibits a deliberate use of flamenco idioms and is examined in three of his most important flamenco-inspired works: Ritmo Jondo (1952), Sinfonietta Flamenca (1954), and Flamenco Cyclothymia (1966). This dissertation also presents new biographical details regarding Surinach’s education and conducting career in Europe, the impact of his lover Ramón Puigcerve Bel on his career, and his work in the film and television industries. Whereas Surinach maintained a consistent style throughout his career, Balada recognized the advantages of experimenting with new techniques, which he has done with great success. This dissertation examines three of Balada’s works from his self-described second period, which began in the mid- 1960 s. For ten years, Balada moved away from tonality in order to explore new timbres, textures, rhythms, and avant-garde techniques that led to three of his most important works: Sinfonía en negro: Homenaje a Martin Luther King (1968), María Sabina (1969), and Steel Symphony (1972).

Interception is typically considered to <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small <b>portion</b> of the total evaporation and in some models is disregarded. Interception is a threshold process, as a certain amount of water is required before successive processes can take place. Therefore an error introduced in modelling interception, especially disregarding it, will automatically introduce errors in the calibration of subsequent models/processes. Field experiments to assess these processes, viz. canopy and litter interception were established for the three main commercial forestry genera in South Africa, namely, Pinus, Acacia and Eucalyptus. Drawing on both field and laboratory data, the "variable storage Gash" model for canopy interception and an idealised drying curve litter interception model were developed to represent these processes. It was found that canopy and litter interception can account for as much as 26. 6 % and 13. 4 % of gross precipitation, respectively, and are therefore important hydrological processes.

40|$|M. Sc. The {{efficiency}} of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells is currently 12 % and 15 % {{in the case}} of single crystalline cells. It is possible to lose about half of the open circuit voltage due to inferior contacts on the cell. It is thus clear that inferior contacts can seriously impede the relative low efficiency and care should be taken to make good ohmic contacts. Experiments were done to evaluate the influence of several factors on the quality and stability of the contacts. 1 C 2 •cm p-type polycrystalline silicon and 3 52. cm n-type single crystalline silicon were primarily used for these experiments. Results of molybdenum contacts on n-type silicon are also presented and the problems with silver epoxy contacts are discussed. It was found that aluminium contacts on p-type polycrystaline silicon improve with temperature and time, while those on single crystaline n-type degrade with temperature and time. These changes are already present at room temperature and are attributed to solid state diffusion of the aluminium into the silicon. This results in a p + layer. In the case of contacts on p-type, the behaviour is that of a Schottky diode. After the solid state diffusion, it becomes possible for the charges to quantum mechanically tunnel through the p+ layer. This results in an improvement of the contact. The contacts on n-type however, are ohmic just after evaporation. Similar to the p-material, the p+ layer causes a p+-n-junction with the depletion layer primarily in the n-type material. This causes a degradation in the contact quality. It is possible to achieve good quality contacts on polycrystaline p-type material, by annealing the contacts above 500 °C for one minute. These contacts however, are non-ideal. SEM photographs show that the silicon surface is crated by pits due to solid state diffusion. It is only at these pits that conduction through the Schottkybarrier is possible. Since the area of the pits <b>constitutes</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> of the total area, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> of the surface will partake in conduction.

The estimation of carbon balance and of soil organic matter assessed the fate of residual hydrocarbons.

In contrast, solid-phase MMHg showed considerable vertical, temporal, and spatial variability (0. 4 – 66 pmol g 21), with the highest values occurring at a peat-rich environment in May 2001, suggesting that MMHg production was largely controlled by temporal factors and habitat type.

5000|$|The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, {{signed by}} the United States and Mexico to end the war, did not {{explicitly}} define the rights of Mexicans in the newly acquired territories of the U.S. However, it guaranteed them {{the same rights as}} U.S. citizens, but this guarantee was not upheld.Lynching in the United States of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans was common {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. [...] In California, Mexicans <b>only</b> <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> small <b>portion</b> of the population at this time which was not more than 15%. However, Latinos make up over one third of lynch mob victims between 1850 and 1895. Lynching was common since Mexicans were constantly accused of stealing gold or horses, and of killing or raping Anglo women. The last recorded instance of lynching in California is the 1892 murder of Francisco Torres, but lynching continued in Texas ...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{binding site}} residues, {{especially}} catalytic residues, {{play a central}} role in protein function. Because more than 99 % of the ∼ 12 million protein sequences in the nonredundant protein database have no structural information, it is desirable to develop methods to predict the binding site residues of a protein from its primary sequence. This task is highly challenging, because the binding site residues <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small <b>portion</b> of <b>a</b> protein. However, the binding site residues of a protein are clustered in its functional pocket(s), and their spatial patterns tend to be conserved in evolution. To take advantage of these evolutionary and structural principles, we constructed a database of ∼ 50, 000 templates (called the pocket-containing segment database), each of which includes not <b>only</b> <b>a</b> sequence segment that contains a functional pocket but also the structural attributes of the pocket. To use this database, we designed a template-matching technique, termed residue-matching profiling, and established a criterion for selecting templates for a query sequence. Finally, we developed a probabilistic model for assigning spatial scores to matched residues between the template and query sequence in local alignments using a set of selected scoring matrices and for computing the binding likelihood of each matched residue in the query sequence. From the likelihoods, one can predict the binding site residues in the query sequence. An automated computational pipeline was developed for our method. A performance evaluation shows that our method achieves a 70 % precision in predicting binding site residues at 60 % sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Skype {{is beyond}} any doubt the VoIP {{application}} {{in the current}} Internet. Its amazing success drawn the attention of telecom operators and the research community, both interested in knowing its internal mechanisms, characterizing its traffic, understanding its users' behavior. One of the most peculiar characteristics of Skype is that it relies on a P 2 P infrastructure for the exchange of signaling information that is distributed between active peers. Leveraging {{on the use of}} an accurate Skype classification engine that we recently proposed, we carry on an experimental study of Skype signaling based on extensive passive measurements collected from our campus LAN. In particular, we focus on the signaling traffic in the attempt of inferring some interesting properties of the overlay maintenance and, possibly, some hints about its structure. Our results show that, despite the signaling bandwidth used by normal peers is exiguous, it may however constitute <b>a</b> very significant <b>portion</b> of the total traffic generated by a Skype client - since, in order to guarantee reachability, Skype application is running most of the time even if no active call is in progress. Skype performs peer discovery and refresh by using a large number of single packets probes - which may be as effective for the purpose of the overlay maintenance as costly from the viewpoint of statefull layer- 4 network devices. At the same time, single packet probes <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> minor <b>portion</b> of the signaling traffic: therefore, we dig into further details the traffic exchanged among more stable peers in the attempt of learning how the peer selection mechanism work...|$|R
25|$|Soon after Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Indian Prime Minister, he {{authorised}} {{nuclear weapons}} testing at Pokhran. The United States strongly condemned this testing, promised sanctions, and voted {{in favour of}} a United Nations Security Council Resolution condemning the tests. President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on India, including cutting off all military and economic aid, freezing loans by American banks to state-owned Indian companies, prohibiting loans to the Indian government for all except food purchases, prohibiting American aerospace technology and uranium exports to India, and requiring the US to oppose all loan requests by India to international lending agencies. However, these sanctions proved ineffective - India was experiencing a strong economic rise, and its trade with the US <b>only</b> <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> small <b>portion</b> of its GDP. Only Japan joined the US in imposing direct sanctions, while most other nations continued to trade with India. The sanctions were soon lifted. Afterward, the Clinton administration and Prime Minister Vajpayee exchanged representatives to help rebuild relations.|$|R
40|$|Electricity grids {{require the}} {{ancillary}} services frequency control, grid operation, re-establishment {{of supply and}} voltage stability for a proper operation. Historically, conventional power plants in the transmission grid were the main source providing these services. An increasing share of decentralized renewable energy in the electricity mix causes decreasing dispatch times for conventional power plants and may consequently lead to a partial replacement of these technologies. Decentralized energy sources are technically capable of providing ancillary services. This work focuses on the provision of reactive power for voltage stability from decentralized sources. The aim is {{to answer the question}} of how voltage stability and reactive power management can be achieved in a future electricity system with increasing shares of decentralized renewable energy sources in an economical and efficient way. A methodology that takes reactive power and voltage stability in an electricity system into account is developed. It allows for the evaluation of the economic benefits of different reactive power supply options. A non-linear and a linearized techno-economic grid model are formulated for this purpose. The analysis reveals an increasing importance of reactive power from the distribution grid in future development scenarios, in particular if delays in grid extension are taken into account. The bottom-up assessment indicates a savings potential of up to 40 mio. EUR per year if reactive power sources in the distribution grid provide reactive power in a controlled manner. Although these savings <b>constitute</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small <b>portion</b> of the total cost of the electricity system, reactive power from decentralized energy sources contributes to the change towards a system based on renewable energy sources. A comparison of different reactive power remuneration mechanisms shows that a variety of approaches exist that could replace the inflexible mechanisms of obligatory provision and penalized consumption of reactive power that are mostly in place nowadays...|$|R
