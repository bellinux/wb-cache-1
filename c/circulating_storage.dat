40|$|Introduction: Ferritin (with {{molecular}} weight: 450 kDa, 24 subunits) {{is composed}} of light and heavy chains and has {{a major role in}} <b>circulating</b> iron <b>storage,</b> so that up to 4500 ferric iron ions (Fe 3 +) can be stored within its structure. The aim of this study was purification of ferritin from liver (the tissue that contains large amounts of ferritin) with high yield/purity, and evalu-ation of its possible peroxidase activity. Materials & Methods: For successful purification of ferritin, we employed the obvious characteristic of ferritin (high ther-mal resistance against temperatures over 80 °C) in two steps accompanying with ammonium sulfate precipitation and anionic exchange chromatography (DEAE-cellul-ose). Findings: Ferritin was successfully purified and its purity (~ 95 %) was confirmed using SDS-PAGE. Also at the present study, the peroxidase activity of heme-ferritin com-plex for the first time is documented.

40|$|Beam {{dynamics}} calculations {{that are}} based on the Vlasov equation do not permit the treatment of stochastic phenomena such as intra-beam scattering. If the nature of the stochastic process can be regarded as a Markov process, we are allowed to use the Fokker-Planck equation to describe the change of the phase space volume the beam occupies. From the Fokker-Planck equation we derive equations of motion for the beam envelopes and for the rms-emittances. Compared to previous approaches based on Liouville's theorem, these equations contain additional terms that describe the temperature balancing within the beam. Our formalism is applied to the effect of intra-beam scattering relevant for beams <b>circulating</b> in <b>storage</b> rings near thermodynamical equilibrium. In this case, the Fokker-Planck coefficients can be treated as adiabatic constants of motion. Due to the simplified analysis based on 'beam moments', we obtain fairly simple equations that allow us to estimate the growth rate of the beam emittance. (orig.)
