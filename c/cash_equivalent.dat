5|$|The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating {{land in the}} Belton {{area from}} {{approximately}} 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near {{the church in the}} garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £ in present-day terms) and £20,000 in <b>cash</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to about £ now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.|$|E

This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to the 1990 U.S. revival; two rounds are played, with all six celebrities {{participating}} in both rounds, and each match is worth 50 points (100 points starting in season 2). The third round is called Match-Up!, with each contestant given 45 seconds to match/his her chosen celebrity partner, and successful matches are again worth 50 points (100 starting in season 2). The contestant with more points {{at the end of this}} round wins the game and receives the <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent</b> of their score (for example, if the champion's final score was 450 points, the payoff would be $450).|$|E

25|$|Soon coffee {{became the}} primary {{commodity}} export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices {{as a result}} of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya, requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent.</b> These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and another rebellion broke out in 1848. A devastating leaf disease, Hemileia vastatrix, struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years. The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.|$|E

500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of <b>cash</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E
5000|$|One of the company's crucial health {{indicators}} {{is its ability}} to generate <b>cash</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Company with a pp relatively higher net assets than <b>cash</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents</b> is mostly an indication of non-liquidity. For investors and companies <b>cash</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents</b> are generally counted to be [...] "low risk and low return" [...] investments and sometimes analysts can estimate company's ability to pay its bills {{in a short period of}} time by comparing CCE and current liabilities. Nevertheless, this can happen only if there are receivables that can be converted into cash immediately.|$|R

2500|$|Malaitan shell-money, {{manufactured}} in the Langalanga lagoon, is the traditional currency, and was used throughout the Solomon Islands, as far as Bougainville. The money consists of small polished shell disks which are drilled and placed on strings. It {{can be used as}} payment for brideprice, funeral feasts and compensation, as well ordinary purposes as a <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent.</b> It is also worn as an adornment and status symbol. The standard unit, known as the tafuliae, is several strands 1.5 m in length. Previously the money was also manufactured on Makira and Guadalcanal. It is still produced on Malaita, but much is inherited, from father to son, and the old traditional strings are now rare. [...] Porpoise teeth are also used as money, often woven into belts.|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Act is that solicitors, accountants, tax advisers, and insolvency practitioners who suspect (as a {{consequence of}} information received {{in the course of}} their work) that their clients (or others) have engaged in tax evasion or other criminal conduct that produced a benefit, now must report their suspicions to the authorities (since these entail suspicions of money laundering). In most circumstances it would be an offence, [...] "tipping-off", for the reporter to inform the subject of his report that a report has been made. These provisions do not however require disclosure to the authorities of information received by certain professionals in privileged circumstances or where the information is subject to legal professional privilege. Others that are subject to these regulations include financial institutions, credit institutions, estate agents (which includes chartered surveyors), trust and company service providers, high value dealers (who accept <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent</b> to €15,000 or more for goods sold), and casinos.|$|E

50|$|To use the {{doctrine}} of cash equivalence, a taxpayer must have either actually received an item, or constructively received an item. If either of these situations exist, a taxpayer must determine whether the item received is cash equivalence, using the six factors described in Cowden v. Commissioner. If the item is deemed <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent,</b> then the taxpayer has income. If it is not <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent,</b> the taxpayer does not have income.|$|E

See also Treasury Regulations [...] Certain payment {{transactions}} involve <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents,</b> such as receipts of checks and credit card payments. The cash equivalence doctrine arose out of a need to determine whether certain items that were either actually or constructively received must be accrued as income. A dispute over timing of income recognition for tax purposes may arise when the thing received is really {{not much more than}} a promise of payment, such as a promissory note or a bond. If mere promises to pay were considered <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents,</b> then there would be little difference between the cash and accrual methods for tax purposes.|$|R
