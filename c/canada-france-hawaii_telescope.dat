Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile, the 8.2-meter Subaru Observatory in Hawaii, and the <b>Canada–France–Hawaii</b> <b>Telescope</b> were used to search for potential targets. Through the citizen-science project, the public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates by participating in the Ice Hunters project. The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest, {{but none of these}} were close enough to the flight path of New Horizons. Only the Hubble Space Telescope was deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful KBO mission. On June 16, 2014, time on Hubble was granted.

40|$|We have {{observed}} {{the most distant}} (= 0. 829) cluster of galaxies in the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS), with the ASCA and ROSAT satellites. We find an X-ray temperature of 12. 3 + 3. 1 − 2. 2 keV for this cluster, and the ROSAT map reveals significant substructure. The high temperature of MS 1054 - 0321 is consistent with both its approximate velocity dispersion, based on the redshifts of 12 cluster members we have obtained at the Keck and the <b>Canada-France-Hawaii</b> <b>telescopes,</b> and with its weak lensing signature. The X-ray temperature of this cluster implies a virial mass ∼ 7. 4 × 1014 h− 1 M⊙, if the mean matter density in the universe equals the critical value (Ω 0 = 1), or larger if Ω 0 < 1. Finding such a hot, massive cluster in the EMSS is extremely improbable if clusters grew from Gaussian perturbations in an Ω 0 = 1 universe.

40|$|We present {{observations}} {{using the}} Baade Magellan and <b>Canada-France-Hawaii</b> <b>telescopes</b> showing that main-belt comet 324 P/La Sagra, {{formerly known as}} P/ 2010 R 2, has become active again {{for the first time}} since originally observed to be active in 2010 - 2011. The object appears point-source-like in March and April 2015 as it approached perihelion (true anomaly of ~ 300 deg), but was ~ 1 mag brighter than expected if inactive, suggesting the presence of unresolved dust emission. Activity was confirmed by observations of a cometary dust tail in May and June 2015. We find an apparent net dust production rate of < 0. 1 kg/s during these observations. 324 P is now the fourth main-belt comet confirmed to be recurrently active, a strong indication that its activity is driven by sublimation. It now has the largest confirmed active range of all likely main-belt comets, and also the most distant confirmed inbound activation point at R~ 2. 8 AU. Further observations during the current active period will allow direct comparisons of activity strength with 324 P's 2010 activity.

40|$|The stellar {{content of}} the nearby SB(s) m galaxy NGC 55 is {{investigated}} using images obtained with the Gemini South and <b>Canada-France-Hawaii</b> <b>telescopes.</b> The (K, H −K) and (K, J −K) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of stars near {{the plane of the}} disk reveal signatures of large scale star formation during recent and intermediate epochs in the form of red supergiants (RSGs) with MK ∼ − 11. 5, and an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that peaks near MK = − 10. Comparisons with stellar evolution models suggest that the brightest RSGs have an age near 8 Myr. A well-defined plume, which stellar evolution models suggest contains stars with masses near the RSG – AGB transition, is detected in CMDs constructed both from infrared and visible wavelength observations. It is concluded that star formation in the thin disk of NGC 55 has ocurred at a significant rate for at least the past 0. 1 – 0. 2 Gyr, and this is consistent with other indicators.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in the Astrophysical Journal We report the first results of a program to study the internal kinematics of globular clusters in the outer halo of the Milky Way. Using the Keck telescope and High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, we have measured precise radial velocities for 30 candidate red giants {{in the direction of}} Palomar 13, an object traditionally cataloged as a compact, low-luminosity globular cluster. We have combined these radial velocities with published proper motion membership probabilities and new CCD photometry from the Keck and <b>Canada-France-Hawaii</b> <b>telescopes,</b> to isolate a sample of 21 probable members. We find a systemic velocity of 〈vr〉s = 24. 1 ± 0. 5 km s − 1 and a projected, intrinsic velocity dispersion of σp = 2. 2 ± 0. 4 km s − 1. Although small, this dispersion is nevertheless several times larger than that expected for a globular cluster of this luminosity and central concentration. Taken at face value, this dispersion implies a mass-to-light ratio of ΥV = 40 + 24 − 17 based on the best-fit King-Michie model. The surface density profile of Palomar 13 also appears to be anomalous among Galactic globular clusters — depending upon the details of background subtraction and model-fitting, Palomar 13 either contains a substantial populatio...|$|R
40|$|The Z Cam-type dwarf nova AT Cancri (AT Cnc) {{displays}} a classical nova (CN) shell, demonstrating that mass transfer in cataclysmic binaries decreases substantially after a CN eruption. The hibernation scenario of cataclysmic binaries predicts such a decrease, on a time-scale {{of a few}} centuries. In order to measure the time since AT Cnc's last CN eruption, we have measured the radial velocities of a hundred clumps in its ejecta with SITELLE, <b>Canada–France–Hawaii</b> <b>Telescope's</b> recently commissioned imaging Fourier transform spectrometer. These range from − 455 to + 490 km s− 1. Coupled with the known distance to AT Cnc of 460 pc, the size of AT Cnc's shell, and a simple model of nova ejecta deceleration, we determine that the last CN eruption of this system occurred 330 + 135 − 90 330 − 90 + 135 yr ago. This is the most rapid transition from a high mass-transfer rate, nova-like variable to a low mass-transfer rate, dwarf nova yet measured, and {{in accord with the}} hibernation scenario of cataclysmic binaries. We conclude by noting the similarity in the deduced outburst date (within a century of 1686 CE) of AT Cnc to a ‘guest star’ reported in the constellation Cancer by Korean observers in 1645 CE...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the kinematics of NGC 6720 is performed on the commissioning data obtained with SITELLE, the <b>Canada-France-Hawaii</b> <b>Telescope's</b> new imaging Fourier transform spectrometer. In order to measure carefully the small broadening effect of a shell expansion on an unresolved emission line, we have determined a computationally robust implementation of the convolution of a Gaussian with a sinc instrumental line shape which avoids arithmetic overflows. This model {{can be used to}} measure line broadening of typically a few km/s even at low spectral resolution (R less than 5000). We have also designed the corresponding set of Gaussian apodizing functions that are now used by ORBS, the SITELLE's reduction pipeline. We have implemented this model in ORCS, a fitting engine for SITELLE's data, and used it to derive the [SII] density map of {{the central part of the}} nebula. The study of the broadening of the [NII] lines shows that the Main Ring and the Central Lobe are two different shells with different expansion velocities. We have also derived deep and spatially resolved velocity maps of the Halo in [NII] and Halpha and found that the brightest bubbles are originating from two bipolar structures with a velocity difference of more than 35 km/s lying at the poles of a possibly unique Halo shell expanding at a velocity of more than 15 km/s...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{near-infrared}} images {{obtained with}} adaptive optics (AO) systems on the Gemini North and <b>Canada-France-Hawaii</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{are used to}} investigate the bright stellar content and central regions of the nearby elliptical galaxy Maffei 1. Stars evolving on the upper asymptotic giant branch (AGB) are resolved in a field 3 arcmin {{from the center of}} the galaxy. The locus of bright giants on the (K, H − K) color-magnitude diagram is consistent with a population of stars like those in Baade’s Window reddened by E(H − K) = 0. 28 ± 0. 05 mag. This corresponds to AV = 4. 5 ± 0. 8 mag, and is consistent with previous estimates of the line of sight extinction computed from the integrated properties of Maffei 1. The AGB-tip occurs at K = 20. 0, which correponds to MK = − 8. 7; hence, the AGB-tip brightness in Maffei 1 is comparable to that in M 32, NGC 5128, and the bulges of M 31 and the Milky-Way. The near-infrared luminosity functions (LFs) of bright AGB stars in Maffei 1, M 32, and NGC 5128 are also in excellent agreement, both in terms of overall shape and the relative density of infrared-bright stars with respect to the fainter stars that dominate the light at visible and red wavelengths.
