Nominal approach routes for each class of aircraft are determined by an optimization procedure. In this fashion, the nominal approach routes are dependent upon and, hence, determined by the near terminal area operating capabilities of each class of aircraft. The landing order and spacing of aircraft on the <b>common</b> <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> are determined so that a measure of total system deviation from the nominal landing times is minimized and safety standards are met. Delay maneuvers required to satisfy sequencing needs are then carried out in a manner dependent upon the particular class of aircraft being maneuvered. Finally, results are presented to illustrate the effects of the rate of arrivals upon a one-runway system serving three different classes of aircraft employing several different sequencing strategies and measures of total system deviation...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{approach}} {{procedures are}} currently under investigation {{to evaluate their}} ground noise reduction potential. One such procedure involves approaching the airport at a considerably higher altitude compared with standard landing trajectories, followed by a spiraling descent (helix flight path) shortly before the runway threshold. In this way, high ground noise levels by approaching aircraft are dislocated away from the <b>common</b> <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> and concentrated in the area near the helix path, that is, in direct vicinity of the airport. Ground noise levels along the entire flight path before the helix are significantly reduced. The effectiveness of this procedure, referred to as Ã¢ÂÂhelical noise abatement procedure,Ã¢ÂÂ has been quantified by means of computational simulation analyses. These analyses also focused on aspects such as increased fuel burn and the occurrence of multiple noise events below the helix. In June 2009, a new autopilot by the DLR, German Aerospace Center, especially capable of tracking curved flight-path trajectories, was flight tested. Three helical noise abatement procedures {{were included in the}} flight plan, as well as standard and steep landing approaches. In addition, dedicated flyover noise measurements were organized. Twelve ground microphones were placed along the <b>common</b> <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> and the helical flight segment. The measured data confirm the predicted noise dislocation effects. High noise levels were found to be limited to observer locations around the helix. Results from computational noise prediction have been compared with the experimental data. Predicted trends and noise dislocation effects are in good agreement with the measurements, whereas the absolute numerical values show discrepancies. The flight test was closely accompanied by a research and development member of the German air navigation service provider DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH to study the impact of spiraling procedures on air traffic management integration aspects and air traffic controller workload, for example, increased interaction with the pilots. Obviously, a spiraling approach procedure would not be implemented into the existing air traffic scenario with its common approach paths and more frequented airports. The operational and economic environment still need more detailed investigation. Helical approaches become more feasible for implementation at small, less-frequented regional airports or during night hours to avoid possible noise related curfews...|$|E

Efficient generation of collision-free motion is a fundamental capability necessary for autonomous robots;In this dissertation, a fast and practical algorithm for moving a convex polygonal robot among a set of polygonal obstacles with translations and rotations is presented. The running time is O(c((n + k) N + nlogn)), where c is a parameter controlling the precision of the results, n is {{the total number of}} obstacle vertices, k is the number of intersections of configuration space obstacles, and N is the number of obstacles, decomposed into convex objects. This dissertation exploits a simple 3 D passage-network to incorporate robot rotations as an alternative to complex cell decomposition techniques or building passage networks on approximated 3 D C-space obstacles;A <b>common</b> <b>approach</b> in <b>path</b> {{planning is}} to compute the Minkowski difference of a polygonal robot model with the polygonal obstacle environment. However such a configuration space is valid only for a single robot orientation. In this research, multiple configuration spaces are computed between the obstacle environment and the robot at successive angular orientations spanning [pi]. Although the obstacles do not intersect, each configuration space may contain intersecting configuration space obstacles (C-space obstacles). For each configuration space, the algorithm finds the contour of the intersected C-space obstacles and the associated passage network by slabbing the collision-free space. The individual configuration spaces are then related to one another by a heuristic called 2 ̆ 2 proper links 2 ̆ 2 that exploit spatial coherence. Thus, each level is connected to the adjacent levels by proper links to construct a 3 D network. Dijkstra 2 ̆ 7 s algorithm is used to search for the shortest path in the 3 D network. Finally, the path is projected onto the plane to show the final locus of the path...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the current}} {{best-effort}} Internet cannot readily provide the service guarantees that real-time applications often require, path switching can potentially {{address this problem}} without resorting to the more complex network QoS mechanisms. The idea is to allow the application to dynamically select the path that carries its traffic, leveraging the robustness to performance variations provided by multiple connectivity options (e. g., multihoming or overlay networks). In this dissertation, we design and evaluate path switching mechanisms that embody this idea. In particular, we take an application perspective and devise a path switching scheme that is aimed at delivering improved quality to real-time applications. ^ We first study the feasibility and performance benefits of path switching. Specifically, we investigate two <b>common</b> <b>approaches</b> offering <b>path</b> diversity [...] -multihoming and overlay networks [...] -and investigate their characteristics {{in the context of}} a representative wide area testbed. We explore the end-to-end delay and loss characteristics of different paths, and find that substantial improvements can potentially be achieved by path switching, especially in lowering end-to-end losses. Based on this assessment, we develop a simple path switching mechanism capable of realizing those performance improvements. ^ Next, we investigate how to construct diverse paths with uncorrelated performance. A promising <b>approach</b> for acquiring <b>path</b> diversity is to leverage the capability of peer-to-peer systems, in which many nodes can act as relays for others, therefore offering a large number of candidate paths to select from. However, due to the sheer number of alternate path choices and the fact that not all choices are equally good, we need mechanisms to identify the relay nodes that yield good alternate paths. In this dissertation, we formulate and evaluate such mechanisms {{in the context of a}} large peer-to-peer system. We develop several heuristics that allow the selection of good alternate paths, relying only on the routing information available to the source. We validate the resulting solution by comparing it to a number of benchmarks, using both real network topology data and measurements on the PlanetLab testbed. ^ Last, we assume the availability of sufficient path diversity and design path switching mechanisms to improve the quality of specific applications. As a first step, we present an online probing-based approach to estimate the loss performance of a network path, and extend this estimate to infer the performance that an application using the path would see.

The latter method seems to hold promise of being less expensive and easier to implement. One operational technique which might reduce the noise beneath the landing <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> is the decelerating approach.
