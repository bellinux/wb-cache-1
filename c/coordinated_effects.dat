50|$|There are {{two types}} of anticompetitive effects {{associated}} with horizontal mergers: unilateral effects and <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Coordinated</b> <b>effects</b> arise where, {{under certain}} market {{conditions}} (e.g., market transparency, product homogeneity etc.), the merger increases the probability that, post merger, merging parties and their competitors will successfully {{be able to}} coordinate their behaviour in an anti-competitive way, for example, by raising prices. As {{in the case of}} unilateral effects, {{the most common form of}} <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects</b> is in the case of horizontal mergers, i.e. mergers between firms active on the same market.|$|E

50|$|The main {{question}} in analysing <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects</b> should be whether the merger materially {{increases the likelihood}} that firms in the market will successfully coordinate their behaviour or strengthen existing coordination. The task is to identify what factors are likely to lead to coordination taking place between firms post-merger. This was a controversial area with which competition authorities and courts have struggled to come to terms over the years, but experience has led to the emergence of some agreement on what conditions are most likely to give rise to <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Unlike many games, Rez {{contains}} {{almost no}} sound effects or spoken dialogue. Instead, {{the game is}} set to electronic music, which plays {{in the background and}} gradually evolves as the player moves among sections. The music is enhanced by musical effects (such as trills and drums) generated by the player's actions, enemies and surroundings. Player actions are usually locked to the rhythm of the music, such that shots and hits against enemies occur exactly on each beat (as opposed to occurring in real time). Graphical elements such as the polygons that make up the player's avatar, as well as background elements, also [...] "beat" [...] in time with the music.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether or not the cosmological constant affects the bending of light around a concentrated mass has been the subject of some recent papers. We present here a simple, specific and transparent example where Λ bending clearly takes place, and where it is clearly neither a <b>coordinate</b> <b>effect</b> nor an aberration effect. We then show that in some recent works using perturbation theory the Λ contribution was missed because of initial too-stringent smallness assumptions. Namely: Our method has been to insert a Kottler (Schwarzschild with Λ) vacuole into a Friedmann universe, and to calculate the total bending within the vacuole. We assume that no more bending occurs outside. It is important to observe that while the mass contribution to the bending takes place mainly quite near the lens, the Λ bending continues throughout the vacuole. Thus if one deliberately restricts one's search for Λ bending to the immediate neighborhood of the lens, one will not find it. Lastly, we show that the Λ bending also follows from standard Weyl focusing, and so again, it cannot be a <b>coordinate</b> <b>effect.</b> Comment: 5 pages, matches MNRAS accepted versio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} industries where a firm {{or group}} of firms acts as price leader. It shows that entry in such industries can lead to higher prices through a crowding effect. Further, efficiency gains can lead to higher prices by making it too costly to fight. Mergers that bring the merged firms' efficiency close {{to that of the}} price leader(s) lead to higher prices if the merged firm does not belong to the group of price leaders. This is a formalization of joint dominance or <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects.</b> Finally, the model is extended to endogenize the identity of the price leader.

5000|$|In the {{excision}} technique, {{which was}} first {{proposed in the}} late 1990s, {{a portion of a}} spacetime inside of the event horizon surrounding the singularity of a black hole is simply not evolved. In theory this should not affect the solution to the equations outside of the event horizon because of the principle of causality and properties of the event horizon (i.e. nothing physical inside the black hole can influence any of the physics outside the horizon). Thus if one simply does not solve the equations inside the horizon one should still be able to obtain valid solutions outside. One [...] "excises" [...] the interior by imposing ingoing boundary conditions on a boundary surrounding the singularity but inside the horizon.While the implementation of excision has been very successful, the technique has two minor problems. The first is that one has to be careful about the coordinate conditions. While physical effects cannot propagate from inside to outside, <b>coordinate</b> <b>effects</b> could. For example, if the coordinate conditions were elliptical, coordinate changes inside could instantly propagate out through the horizon. This then means that one needs hyperbolic type coordinate conditions with characteristic velocities less than that of light for the propagation of <b>coordinate</b> <b>effects</b> (e.g., using harmonic coordinates coordinate conditions). The second problem is that as the black holes move, one must continually adjust the location of the excision region to move with the black hole.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{an index}} for scoring {{coordination}} incentives, {{which we call}} the “coordination GUPPI” or cGUPPI. While the cGUPPI {{can be applied to}} a wide range of <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects</b> concerns, it is particularly relevant for gauging concerns of parallel accommodating conduct (PAC), a concept that received due prominence in the 2010 U. S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines. PAC is a type of coordinated conduct whereby a firm raises price with the expectation—but without any prior agreement—that one or more other firms will follow and match the price increase. The cGUPPI is the highest uniform price increase that all the would-be coordinating firms would be willing to implement without side payments. A larger cGUPPI implies a more pronounced incentive and ability for firms to engage in coordinated price increases. The difference between the post- and pre-merger cGUPPI (i. e. the Delta cGUPPI) is a practical way to score the effect of a merger on <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects</b> concerns...|$|E
40|$|This article, {{assesses the}} {{unilateral}} and <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects</b> on the Portuguese mortgage loans and short term corporate credit markets {{of the merger}} between the banks BCP and BPI. We use a rich cross-section of micro level data and a discrete choice model to estimate the price elasticities of demand and the marginal costs of mortgage loans and short term corporate credit. Based on these estimates, we simulate {{the impact of the}} merger on prices and welfare. Regarding unilateral effects, our results indicate that the merger would lead to an average increase in the prices of mortgage loans of 3. 1 %, and to an average increase in the spread of 9. 9 %. Additionally, the merger would lead to an average increase in the prices of short term corporate credit of 7. 4 %. Regarding <b>coordinated</b> <b>effects,</b> our results indicate that the merger would significantly increase the profitability of collusion between the three largest banks. We also simulate the effects of one of the remedies proposed by BCP: selling-off 10 % of the branches of BPI...|$|E
