25|$|Natural rubber is an {{elastomer}} (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) {{that originally}} {{was derived from}} latex, a milky <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (vulcanization), improving elasticity and durability.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, a colloid is {{a mixture}} in which one {{substance}} of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower {{sense of the word}} suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be one that does not settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably.|$|E

25|$|In physics, colloids are an {{interesting}} model system for atoms. Micrometre-scale colloidal particles are {{large enough to be}} observed by optical techniques such as confocal microscopy. Many of the forces that govern the structure and behavior of matter, such as excluded volume interactions or electrostatic forces, govern the structure and behavior of colloidal suspensions. For example, the same techniques used to model ideal gases can be applied to model the behavior of a hard sphere <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension.</b> In addition, phase transitions in colloidal suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques, and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids. In many interesting cases optical fluidity is used to control colloid suspensions.|$|E
25|$|The depth, {{texture and}} {{composition}} of soils can influence its water retaining and draining ability. Soils containing large amounts of organic material tend to have the highest water retention abilities. These types of soils include deep loams, silty soils like what is typically found on the fertile valley floors {{such as in the}} California's Napa Valley. Clay particles have the potential to remain in <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> {{for long periods of time}} when it is dissolved in water. This gives clay-based soils the potential to retain significant amount of water such as the clay soils of the Right bank Bordeaux region of Pomerol. Many regions with these types of water retaining soils have little need for irrigation, or if they do it is usually supplemental during periods of drought. Soils with poor water retention include sand and alluvial gravel based soils such as those found in the Barolo and Barbaresco zones of Italy or in many areas of South Australia. Depending on the climate and amount of natural rainfall, areas with poor water retention may need irrigation.|$|E
2500|$|Polyelectrolytes {{have many}} applications, mostly related to modifying flow and {{stability}} properties of aqueous solutions and gels.

They {{can also be used to}} impart a surface charge to neutral particles, enabling them to be dispersed in aqueous solution. They are thus often used as thickeners, emulsifiers, conditioners, clarifying agents, and even drag reducers. They are used in water treatment and for oil recovery. Many soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics incorporate polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, they are added to many foods and to concrete mixtures (superplasticizer). Some of the polyelectrolytes that appear on food labels are pectin, carrageenan, alginates, and carboxymethyl cellulose. All but the last [...] are of natural origin. Finally, they are used in a variety of materials, including cement.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{structures}} in the fluid portion of the milk are [...] "casein micelles": aggregates of several thousand protein molecules with superficial resemblance to a surfactant micelle, bonded {{with the help of}} nanometer-scale particles of calcium phosphate. Each casein micelle is roughly spherical and about a tenth of a micrometer across. There are four different types of casein proteins: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-caseins. Collectively, they make up around 76–86% of the protein in milk, by weight. Most of the casein proteins are bound into the micelles. There are several competing theories regarding the precise structure of the micelles, but they share one important feature: the outermost layer consists of strands of one type of protein, k-casein, reaching out from the body of the micelle into the surrounding fluid. These kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated under normal conditions and in a stable <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> in the water-based surrounding fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Silica aerogels are {{typically}} synthesized {{by using a}} sol-gel process. The first step {{is the creation of}} a <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> of solid particles known as a [...] "sol". The precursors are a liquid alcohol such as ethanol which is mixed with a silicon alkoxide, such as tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) (earlier work used sodium silicates). The solution of silica is mixed with a catalyst and allowed to gel during a hydrolysis reaction which forms particles of silicon dioxide. The oxide suspension begins to undergo condensation reactions which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either M–O–M, [...] "oxo" [...] bridges or M–OH–M, [...] "ol" [...] bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles. [...] These reactions generally have moderately slow reaction rates, and as a result either acidic or basic catalysts are used to improve the processing speed. Basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels and minimize the shrinkage during the drying process and also strengthen it to prevent pore collapse during drying.|$|E
50|$|In the nanoprecipitation method, also termed solvent {{displacement}} method, nanocapsules {{are formed}} {{by creating a}} <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> between two separate phases. The organic phase consists of a solution and a mixture of organic solvents. The aqueous phase consists of a mixture of non-solvents that forms a surface film. The organic phase is slowly injected in the aqueous phase which then is agitated to form the <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension.</b> Once the <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspension</b> is formed it will be agitated until nanocapsules begin to form.

40|$|Interfacial {{undercooling}} is {{of significant}} importance on microscopic pattern {{formation in the}} solidification of <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Two kinds of interfacial undercooling {{are supposed to be}} involved in freezing <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions,</b> i. e. solute constitutional supercooling (SCS) caused by additives in the solvent and particulate constitutional supercooling (PCS) caused by particles. However, quantitatively identification of the interfacial undercooling of freezing <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions</b> is still absent and it is still unknown which undercooling is dominant. The revealing of interfacial undercooling is closely related to the design of ice-templating porous materials. Based on quantitative experimental measurements, we show that the interfacial undercooling mainly comes from SCS caused by the additives in the solvent, while the PCS can be ignored. This finding implies that the PCS theory is not the fundamental physical mechanism for patterning in the solidification of <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Instead, the patterns in ice-templating method can be controlled effectively by adjusting the additives.

40|$|Monosized (∼ 4 nm) diamond {{nanoparticles}} {{arranged on}} substrate surfaces are exciting candidates for single-photon sources and nucleation sites for ultrathin nanocrystalline diamond film growth. The {{most commonly used}} technique to obtain substrate-supported diamond nanoparticles is electrostatic self-assembly seeding using nanodiamond <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Currently, monodisperse nanodiamond colloids, which have a narrow distribution of particle sizes centering on the core particle size (∼ 4 nm), are available for the seeding technique on different substrate materials such as Si, SiO 2, Cu, and AlN. However, the self-assembled nanoparticles tend to form small (typically a few tens of nanometers or even larger) aggregates on all of those substrate materials. In this study, this major weakness of self-assembled diamond nanoparticles was solved by modifying the salt concentration of nanodiamond <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Several salt concentrations of <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions</b> were prepared using potassium chloride as an inserted electrolyte and were examined with respect to seeding on SiO 2 surfaces.

40|$|This book {{addresses}} {{the properties of}} particles in <b>colloidal</b> <b>suspensions.</b> It has a focus on particle aggregates and the dependency of their physical behaviour on morphological parameters.
