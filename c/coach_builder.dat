The men created a strong {{personal}} bond, which helped link the companies closely throughout the 1950s.

2500|$|Javelins {{were built}} in Europe, {{primarily}} because they had {{the largest and most}} usable rear seat of the American pony cars. The German <b>coach</b> <b>builder,</b> Wilhelm Karmann GmbH assembled 280 complete knock down (CKD) Javelins between 1968 and 1970 that were marketed in Europe. This was a significant business relationship because the Javelin was a completely American-designed car that was made in Germany. Karmann’s [...] "Javelin 79-K" [...] could be ordered with the [...] six, the [...] 2-barrel or [...] 4-barrel V8 engines. About 90% of the parts and components came in crates from the United States. At Karmann’s facility in Rheine the cars were assembled, painted, and test-driven prior to shipment to customers.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the company {{realized}} {{they needed a}} grand tourer model that could appeal to wealthy customers. AC contacted the famed Italian <b>coach</b> <b>builder</b> Pietro Frua to design an appealing GT body that could be fitted on a MKIII Cobra chassis stretched by [...] The new car was shown at the 1965 Turin show. A few early models were fitted with the famed 427 Ford FE motors. In 1967 the long-stroked 428 motor became available and the car {{was known as the}} AC Frua. Built out of steel rather than AC's usual aluminum, the Frua is heavier than a Cobra at slightly under [...] That said, it is still a light and very fast automobile built on a racing chassis. The car was never fully developed and the cost of sending chassis from England to Italy and back for final assembly made it so expensive that only a few were produced. Production ended in 1973 after only 80 cars (29 convertibles and 51 coupes) were finished.|$|E
2500|$|By 1966, sectarian {{violence}} in Rathcoole (along {{with the rest}} of Belfast) had considerably worsened, and the minority Catholic population there found itself under siege; Sands and his sisters were forced to run a gauntlet of bottle- and rock-throwing Protestant youths on the way to school every morning, and the formerly integrated Rathcoole youth football club banned Catholic members and renamed itself [...] "The Kai", which stood for [...] "Kill All Irish". Despite always having had Protestant friends, Sands suddenly found that none of them would even speak to him, and he quickly learned to associate only with Catholics. He left school in 1969 at age 15, and enrolled in Newtownabbey Technical College, beginning an apprenticeship as a <b>coach</b> <b>builder</b> at Alexander's Coach Works in 1970. He worked there for less than a year, enduring constant harassment from his Protestant co-workers, which according to several co-workers he ignored completely, as he wished to learn a meaningful trade. He was eventually confronted after leaving his shift in January 1971 by a number of his coworkers wearing the armbands of the local Ulster loyalist tartan gang. He was held at gunpoint and told that Alexander's was off-limits to [...] "Fenian scum" [...] and to never come back if he valued his life. This event, by Sands's admission, proved to be the point at which he decided that militancy was the only solution.|$|E
2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool. [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold, please see the DVD), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a [...] "Mini de Ville" [...] by Harold Radford <b>Coach</b> <b>Builder</b> LTD. He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in [...] "More Deadly Than the Sword". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: [...] "So clever, but oh so vulnerable." [...] This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian naïveté.|$|E

60|$|Yuba Bill was on {{the road}} in an instant with his lantern. Then {{followed}} an outbreak of profanity which I regret, for artistic purposes, exceeds that generous limit which a sympathizing public has already extended to me in the explication of character. Let me state, therefore, that in a very few moments he succeeded in disparaging the characters of his employers, their male and female relatives, the <b>coach</b> <b>builder,</b> the station keeper, the road on which he travelled, and the travellers themselves, with occasional broad expletives addressed to himself and his own relatives. For the spirit of this and a more cultivated poetry of expression, I beg to refer the temperate reader to the 3d chapter of Job.|$|E
