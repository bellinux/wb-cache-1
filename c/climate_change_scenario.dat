Whereas it is widely recognized that the uncertainty in future climatic conditions {{must be taken into}} account in impact studies, many assessments of species range shifts still rely on just a few <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenarios,</b> often selected arbitrarily. We describe a method to select objectively a subset of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenarios</b> among a large ensemble of available ones. Our k-means clustering approach reduces the number of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenarios</b> needed to project species distributions, while retaining the coverage of uncertainty in future climate conditions. We first show, for three biologically-relevant climatic variables, that a reduced number of six <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenarios</b> generates average climatic conditions very close to those obtained from a set of 27 scenarios available before reduction. A case study on potential gains and losses of habitat by three northeastern American tree species shows that potential future species distributions projected from the selected six <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenarios</b> are very similar to those obtained from the full set of 27, although with some spatial discrepancies at the edges of species distributions. In contrast, projections based on just a few climate models vary strongly according to the initial choice of climate models.

The main objective of our study was an analysis of three different regional <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenarios</b> for a catchment with an area of 2415 km 2 located in the Northeastern German lowlands. These data sets consist of the STAR-scenario with a time period 1951 – 2055, the WettReg-scenario covering the period 1961 – 2100 and the grid based REMO-scenario for the time span 1950 – 2100.

50|$|Mark Urban {{has contributed}} to our {{understanding}} of climate change effects on species and communities. He described the biotic multipliers of climate change, which are species both sensitive to climate change and with disproportionate effects on communities and ecosystems. These species are often top predators, and should be the ones to study first because they might have the greatest effects on other species. He also helped develop the boxcar effect, whereby species in cooler regions prevent species in warmer regions from tracking their preferred thermal environment through competition. Urban also showed that only evolution might be able to protect all diversity from climate change effects. He recently found that the extinction risk from global warming not only increases with warmer temperatures, but actually accelerates. His work suggests that if we follow a business-as-usual emissions <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenario,</b> then 1 in 6 species could become threatened with extinction from climate change.

In this study we assessed the sensitivity of four different types of smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems in Burkina Faso, to the potential impacts of climate change, based on the changes in household income and kilocalorie production. The four systems with different levels of resource endowment were simulated over 99 years using a whole farm model (APSFarm-LivSim), under current and future climate. The climate data for current climate variability and the <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>scenario</b> were generated using the MarkSim™ tool. For future scenarios, we used the ensemble means of 17 global circulation models (CMIP 5 data) for 2050, and IPCC scenario RCP 8. 5. Under the projected climate scenario, average annual rainfall is expected to increase from 607 mm to 674 mm (+ 11 %). Additionally, average temperature is likely to increase by 2. 6 °C. Overall, these changes in climate showed to negatively affect crop yields, particularly cowpea (- 25 %), millet (- 15 %) and groundnuts (- 5 %); while sorghum and maize did not show significant changes in yields. At the household level, income and kilocalorie production were reduced by up to 17 % and 13 %, respectively, in a market-oriented household with a relatively smaller area per capita. Furthermore, we introduced two levels of fertilization in the simulation (+ 30 + 60 Kg/N/Ha).
