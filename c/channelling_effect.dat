50|$|At low {{energies}} the channelling {{effects in}} crystals are not present because small-angle scattering at low energies requires large impact parameters, which become bigger than interplanar distances.

Conventional signal-to-interference (SIR) prediction-based power control schemes may incur prediction mistakes caused by the adjustment of transmission power. The proposed power control scheme purely tracks the vari-ation of <b>channel</b> <b>effect</b> and, thus, can be immune to any power adjustment. Furthermore, it adopts the PRNN with ERLS for predicting the <b>channel</b> <b>effect.</b> Simulation results show that the <b>channel</b> <b>effect</b> prediction-based power control scheme using PRNN/ERLS achieves a 40 % higher system ca-pacity and a lower outage probability than the conventional SIR prediction-based power control scheme using grey prediction method (IEEE Trans.

50|$|The reef, much {{of which}} is exposed even at high tide, is located {{to the west of}} the two-kilometre-wide channel that links Cook Strait with Wellington Harbour, close to the shore of the Miramar Peninsula. Due to the <b>channelling</b> <b>effect</b> of Cook Strait, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman Sea, the {{currents}} are strong and fickle and gales are common. Add to this the volume of traffic which uses the channel (including several crossings daily of the inter-island ferries to Picton), and it is not surprising that the reef has a lengthy roll-call of shipwrecks.|$|E
5000|$|From a simple, {{classical}} standpoint, one may qualitatively {{understand the}} <b>channelling</b> <b>effect</b> as follows: If {{the direction of}} a charged particle incident upon the surface of a monocrystal lies close to a major crystal direction (Fig. 1), the particle with high probability will only do small-angle scattering as it passes through the several layers of atoms in the crystal and hence remain in the same crystal 'channel'. If it is not in a major crystal direction or plane ("random direction", Fig. 2), it is much more likely to undergo large-angle scattering and hence its final mean penetration depth is likely to be shorter. If the direction of the particle's momentum is close to the crystalline plane, but it is not close to major crystalline axes, this phenomenon is called [...] "planar channelling". Channelling usually leads to deeper penetration of the ions in the material, an effect that has been observed experimentally and in computer simulations, see Figures 3-5.|$|E

30|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>channel</b> <b>effect</b> in the line spectrum frequency (LSF) domain. LSF parameters are the popular speech features encoded in the bit stream for low bit-rate speech transmission. A method of <b>channel</b> <b>effect</b> compensation in LSF domain is of interest for robust speech recognition on mobile communication and Internet systems. If the bit error rate in the transmission of digital encoded speech is negligibly low, the channel distortion comes mainly from the microphone or the handset. When the speech signal is represented {{in terms of the}} phase of inverse filter derived from LP analysis, this channel distortion can be expressed in terms of the channel phase. Further derivation shows that the mean subtraction performed on the phase of inverse filter can minimize the <b>channel</b> <b>effect.</b> Based on this finding, an iterative algorithm is proposed to remove the bias on LSFs due to <b>channel</b> <b>effect.</b> The experiments on the simulated channel distorted speech and the real telephone speech are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of cepstral mean normalization (CMN) in using cepstral coefficients.|$|R

40|$|The {{glittering}} {{progress and}} usage of Wireless Communication {{in the past}} few years upraise some core challenges and problems which need to be conquered. Providing the higher data rates to confront the user demands, forced the researchers to develop new methods and techniques to fulfill the demand of high capacity wireless system. In this regard the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) promises a much improved and higher data rates (up to 100 Mbps). It also have a strong capability of taking over other technologies for the enhancements in mobile and wireless technology for the 4 th generation (4 G) systems.

30|$|For {{the faces}} C, D, E, F and G the {{magnitude}} of pressure coefficient increases when the distance S 2 increases from 0.4 h to 0.6 h {{which is due to}} the decrease of <b>channelling</b> <b>effect</b> caused by the upstream interfering buildings.
