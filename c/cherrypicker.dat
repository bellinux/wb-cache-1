Despite being innocent, she confesses and claims Bob knew nothing of her crimes. She is sentenced {{to three years in}} prison and Bob is devastated, even more so when she refuses to allow him to visit her and returns photos of the children. Bob tries to run the cafe and post office as well as work shifts in The Woolpack and raise the twins on his own. Jamie is concerned that Bob was going to run away again and Bob is hurt by his son's lack of trust. Even more distress is caused when John McNally (Steven Farebrother), a local reporter for the Hotten Courier, writes a story implicating Bob for fraud. Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) leads the villagers in threatening to sue Bob for the charity money. Bob finally snaps and demands to see the editor of the Courier, and when his permission is refused, he hijacks a <b>cherrypicker</b> outside the building and manoeuvres it as close {{to the top of the}} building as possible, in order to warn people of the evils of the Courier. He begin to suffer an anxiety attack and is brought to safety by the police and arrested but the charges against him are dropped. The villagers also drop their lawsuit plans.|$|E

40|$|Command shaping creates {{reference}} commands {{that reduce}} residual vibrations in a flexible system. This thesis examines {{the use of}} command shaping for flexible system control in three industrial applications: cam-follower systems, sloshing liquids, and cherrypickers. One common type of command shaping is command smoothing which creates a smooth transition between setpoints. A specific type of command smoothing used in cam-follower systems is the polynomial profile. An alternative technique to reduce vibration in flexible systems is input shaping. In this thesis, input-shaped commands are compared to polynomial profiles for applications requiring both vibration suppression and fast motion. Simulation and experimental results show that input shaping is faster than polynomial profiles and provides a simple approach to suppressing residual vibration. Secondly, significant experimental contributions {{have been made in}} the area of slosh control. The oscillation of liquids in a container can cause liquid spillage or can cause stability issues, especially in space vehicles. In the past, a number of control techniques have been proposed, but only a few recommend the use of input shaping. This thesis describes the use of command shaping to limit slosh. Results are supported by numerical and experimental testing. Input-shaped commands reduce residual slosh amplitude compared to unshaped commands and polynomial profiles. Input-shaped commands can also accommodate uncertainties and changes in the sloshing frequencies. Lastly, a small-scale <b>cherrypicker</b> was constructed to study the use of input-shaping control on these types of aerial lifts. Cherrypickers have flexible dynamic effects that can cause dangerous and life-threatening situations. To study this class of machines and to provide future students an experimental testbed, several design criteria were established before construction began. The resulting machine achieved most design objectives, including a simple-to-use graphical user interface and accurate state measurements. Robust input-shaping controllers were implemented to limit endpoint vibration. The design of the <b>cherrypicker</b> is discussed and experimental results are reported. M. S.

40|$|Several {{approaches}} are currently {{established in the}} German Plant Phenotyping Network (DPPN) to measure shoot properties of barley, sugar beet and rapeseed plants in the field under natural conditions. The portfolio of methods aims at covering plant geometries and developmental stages characterized by different architectures (branching, leaf orientation, level of occlusions). Imaging methods will be integrated into three field platforms: a <b>cherrypicker</b> (FieldLift), an in/outdoor XYZ-positioning system (miniplot-facility at Campus Klein-Altendorf), and an automated vehicle with XZ-positioning system (FieldCop). Platforms are featured by different payloads, measurement heights, flexibility {{in the field and}} sensor movement capabilities and are primarily designed for a nadir positioning of the sensor above the canopy. The portfolio of field methods has been set up to cover various measurement areas and includes a high-precision methods (light sectioning with a depth resolution < 0. 2 mm), mid-scale methods (RGB-cameras) and large-scale methods (3 -d laser scanner up to a range of 130 m). There is a variety of shoot traits, which can be estimated from the resulting 3 -d point clouds and surface reconstructions. Traits of interest are plant height, leaf area, leaf angles, leaf surface properties and the respective distribution of these parameters across the field. So far, photogrammetric approaches have been used to analyze the leaf angle distribution of sugar beet plants in the stand. For this purpose an image processing pipeline has been implemented to calculate the leaf angle distribution from segmented leaves and the resulting leaf-specific 3 -d point clouds...|$|E
