5|$|Arboreal <b>carton</b> nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a <b>carton</b> building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (<b>carton)</b> and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The <b>carton</b> case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|To {{build their}} nests, {{termites}} primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in <b>carton</b> nests (arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are {{good examples of}} subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, {{as well as providing}} a fortification against predators. Nests made out of <b>carton</b> are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.|$|E

5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, {{but he was also}} an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk <b>carton</b> for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry <b>carton.</b> The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over a <b>carton</b> of Kool-Aid mix on {{the kitchen}} floor of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E

Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E
25|$|A <b>carton</b> is {{the name}} of certain types of {{containers}} typically made from paperboard or cardboard. Many types of cartons are used in food packaging. Sometimes a <b>carton</b> is also called a box. The history of the <b>carton</b> goes as far back as 1879 when it was invented in a Brooklyn, New York factory. The inventor of the folded <b>carton</b> was Robert Gair. He cast a die-ruled, cut, and scored paperboard into a single impression of a folded <b>carton.</b> By 1896, the National Biscuit Company was the first to use cartons to package crackers.|$|E
