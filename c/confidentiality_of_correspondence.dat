Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653).|$|E

50|$|The latest {{report was}} {{published}} by the Committee in late 2011. The majority of recommendations contained in it, were not taken into account by Ukraine, and specifically, by the SPSU. The negative impact of this inaction is enhanced {{by the fact that}} the Committee has already provided these recommendations in its earlier reports based on the earlier monitoring. E.g. the issues of short-term and long-term visits, <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence,</b> conditions and restrictions imposed in the disciplinary cells etc. have not been resolved. And all these problems are within the competence of SPSU, as the majority of the criticized norms are the norms of SPSU sublegal acts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study {{confidential}} safety, {{a notion}} of secrecy that arises naturally in adversarial systems. We provide a formal definition {{in the context of}} a concurrent while-language. We provide techniques for establishing confidential safety, building on three ingredients: (1) We develop a novel view <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> assertions that focuses on their confidentiality (in contrast to the traditional view <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> assertions that uses their integrity to derive secrecy and authentication properties of protocols). (2) We establish the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> a <b>correspondence</b> assertion using techniques reminiscent of information flow, and incorporating cryptography using confounders. (3) We prove protocols are confidentially safe using techniques based on frame-bisimulation that exploit the noninterference properties of well-typed programs...|$|R

In a US Embassy report {{classified}} as [...] "Secret", Lee gave his assessment {{of a number of}} Asian leaders and views on political developments in North Asia, including implications for nuclear proliferation.

5000|$|The {{constitution}} contains elaborate provisions guaranteeing {{basic rights}} and liberties. Examples of these rights are: {{the right to}} equality, {{the right to life}} and corporal integrity, the right to liberty and security of a person, the right of access to the court and the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by independent and impartial courts, and rights of convicted persons. Other articles contain a number of economic and social rights. Torture is prohibited. The right to privacy of life, inviolability of the dwelling house, <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence,</b> the right to free movement and residence, freedom of science and art, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly and association are also secured by provisions which reflect the democratic characteristics of the State.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We study {{a notion}} of secrecy that arises {{naturally}} in adversarial systems. Let all agents agree on a space of possible values. An honest agent chooses one of these values, and aims {{to make sure that}} this particular choice cannot be reliably guessed by an adversary, even in the context of a distributed protocol. An example is an agent that uses an honest mail server to send a message, wishing to keep the identity of the eventual recipient hidden from an adversary. We refer to this property as confidential safety. We provide a formal definition in the context of a concurrent whilelanguage. We provide techniques for establishing confidential safety, building on three ingredients: • We develop a novel view <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> assertions that focuses on their confidentiality (in contrast to the traditional view <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> assertions that uses their integrity to derive secrecy and authentication properties of protocols). • We establish the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> a <b>correspondence</b> assertion using techniques reminiscent of information flow, and incorporating cryptography using confounders. • We prove protocols (such as instances of the mail server above) are confidentially safe using techniques based on frame-bisimulation that exploit the non-interference properties of well-typed programs.
