5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
25|$|Reid {{finally took}} his own chance to escape {{on the night of}} 14/15 October 1942, along with Major Ronald Littledale, Lieutenant Commander William L. Stephens RNVR, and Flight Lieutenant Howard Wardle RAF. They cut through the bars on a window in the prisoner's kitchen, and climbed out onto the flat roof of the German kitchen. They then crossed the brightly lit outer yard, and avoided being seen by a guard. They entered a storage cellar under the Kommandantur (Commandant's HQ), <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> through a narrow air shaft leading to the dry moat, and exited through the park. They split into pairs, with Reid and Wardle {{disguised}} as Flemish workmen travelling by train to Tuttlingen, near the Swiss border, via Zwickau and Munich. They crossed the border near Ramsen on the evening of 18 October. Stephens and Littledale also travelled to Tuttlingen by train, via Chemnitz, Nuremberg and Stuttgart, then followed Reid and Wardle across the border {{in the early hours of}} 20 October.|$|E
25|$|At zero {{hour the}} {{creeping}} bombardment began and infantry <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of their trenches, the first men pulling the following troops over the parapet. The British began {{to follow the}} creeping barrage, a moderate German counter-barrage fell short of Snag Trench and massed machine-gun fire began from the flanks, causing many casualties as the British troops struggled through the mud at walking-pace. The remaining men of the 1/8th DLI got close to Butte Trench, where they were also hit by British artillery and Stokes mortar fire and then retired to Snag Trench, leaving wounded and stragglers in shell-holes. On the right flank, a supporting Australian attack failed when the Australian artillery barrage fell behind the front line and a machine-gun barrage was so inaccurate that bullets hit the DLI trenches. In the centre the 1/6th DLI was held up {{on the right and}} on the left managed to overrun Gird Trench and form a strong point. The attack of the 1/9th DLI on the left flank, took the quarry, overran the butte and established a machine-gun position, advanced to Gird Trench and dug in on the Albert–Bapaume road. By noon, the 1/6th DLI were held up in Maxwell Trench and the 1/9th DLI had consolidated at the quarry, Gird Trench, Gird Support Trench and Butte Alley.|$|E

500|$|The men hid {{for three}} nights and {{throughout}} the fourth day. They knew from escape attempts by others that the guards would keep searching for three days. Wetzler wrote in his memoir that they tied strips of flannel across their mouths and tightened them whenever they felt a tickle in their throats. At 9pm on 10 April, they <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of the wood pile and headed south toward Slovakia [...] away, walking parallel to the Soła river.|$|E
500|$|Several books {{featuring}} spiders {{have been}} adapted to film, including [...] featuring Shelob and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets with Aragog the Acromantula. [...] Charlotte's positive {{portrayal of a}} spider character {{can be seen in}} two full-length feature versions of Charlotte's Web. The first Charlotte's Web was a Hanna-Barbera musical animation released in 1973, followed by a live-action 2006 film version of the original story. [...] Furthermore, spider characters have <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of the pages of comic books and onto the big screen, most notably the Spider-Man film adaptations.|$|E
500|$|Olga left Gatchina for {{the first}} time in the early fall of 1888 when the {{imperial}} family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with [...] "a Herculean effort" [...] so that the others could escape. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident, but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{references}} to Illuminatus! and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty's tradition, this was also in part {{intended to be a}} self-parodying dredge of The KLF's [...] "myth". [...] Drummond's opinions of the [...] "rock 'n' roll comeback" [...] were recorded by him at the time and aired in 2000: [...] "The history of rock 'n' roll has been littered with pathetic comebacks.... No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and {{will never be the same}} as when the group or artist first <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of their sub-cult.... If there was fresh original talent, it is now tired and tested, only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch." [...] Designing 2K's parody of the comeback, Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were [...] "getting totally into the institution of The Comeback, drawing on the sad, pathetic nature of the whole thing, the desperation of all concerned to exploit whatever they can from the myth...".|$|E
500|$|In January 1944, Murphy was {{promoted}} to staff sergeant. He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January {{and was unable to}} participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead. He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna, and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle. He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio, where they remained for months. Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March, Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank. He then <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades, for which he received the Bronze Star with [...] "V" [...] Device. Murphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria. Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B, 15th Infantry, including Murphy, were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May.|$|E

2500|$|Col. Manning Force, the {{commander}} of the 20th Ohio Infantry Regiment, heard the rebel yell, followed by the sounds of musketry, and panicked. He ordered his regiment to charge, running through the nearly impassable tangle and then leaping into the creek bed. There his men must have been stricken with horror at their mistake—the rest of the division was holding its ground to the rear, and the walls of the creek were too steep to either move forwards or retreat. [...] Luckily the creek made a turn here, and the soldiers utilized it as a bunker as they traded blows with the right battalion of the 7th Texas Infantry, the ends of the Texans' rifles discharging just inches away as the Confederates utilized {{the other side of the}} creek bed in the same manner. Force <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of the creek bed with difficulty and sought help from the rest of the division, begging Colonel Richards of the 20th Illinois Volunteer Infantry regiment to move forward and connect the Federal line.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} also some {{negative}} reception of the character, described by Matt Slagle of Associated Press as [...] "outrageously proportioned". In a review of Emergence, Computer Gaming World criticized the [...] "cringe-inducing scenes [...] villainous sexpot Elexis Sinclaire's digitized boobs practically slapping you in the face." [...] Phaedra Boinodiris from WomenGamers.com, talking to GamesRadar in 2007, used Elexis {{as an example of}} game characters [...] "sexualized to the point of deformity" [...] as she looked [...] "like she <b>crawled</b> <b>out</b> of an S club." [...] In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked Elexis from the original SiN as the sixth [...] "most unrealistic and sexist depiction of women in games". In 2012, Shelby Reiches of Cheat Code Central included [...] "Elexis' Hidden Button" [...] scene among the four worst cinematic scenes in games, commenting that [...] "the player's final confrontation with villain Elexis Sinclaire, already dolled up to look like a stereotypical sex worker, involves her 'out-smarting' the player by evoking Basic Instincts Sharon Stone. Elexis, however, lacks her inspiration's sophistication," [...] and calling it not as much as provocative but rather [...] "awkward and nonsensical".|$|E
