5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> of {{a companion to}} the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

40|$|Modeling {{in general}} {{can be viewed}} as a two-step process, the first being concept {{visualization}} followed by the final design. Most designers who work with CAD systems go through the concept visualization stage and follow the same steps required in the final design stage. A standard approach to concept visualization is traditionally performed using <b>clay</b> <b>modeling,</b> yet there is a lack of computer aided design tools that can faithfully mimic the process of traditional <b>clay</b> <b>modeling</b> both in terms of representation of virtual clay as well as an immersive user interface capable of capturing the user’s intent in an intuitive sense. In this paper we describe a voxel based representation of virtual clay and introduce a hierarchical gestural interface using Kinect which together brings the intuitiveness of traditional <b>clay</b> <b>modeling</b> to a CAD environment. The framework was validated using a 3 D <b>clay</b> <b>modeling</b> software (n= 13). Results showed that most of the participants were able to adapt to the new interface quickly...|$|R

25|$|Makeup artists Tom Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman {{and actor}} Jeffrey Jones {{discussed}} {{the appearance of}} the Dark Overlord character with Huyck and Katz, and developed the character's progressing looks. When Katz's daughter visited the set during the shoot, she was terrified by Jones' appearance in makeup. The diner sequence combines practical effects, including squibs and air cannons, with visual effects created by ILM. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the voice of the Dark Overlord by altering Jeffrey Jones' voice as his character transformed. Stop motion effects during the climax were designed by Phil Tippett, who began with a <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> before upgrading to more sophisticated pieces.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{promptly}} telephoned Ford's HQ in Dearborn {{and told}} designer Frank Hershey about {{the conversation with}} Crusoe. Hershey took the idea and began working on the vehicle. The concept was for a two-passenger open car, with a target weight of 2525lb (1145kg), an Interceptor V8 engine based on the forthcoming overhead-valve Ford V8 slated for 1954 model year introduction, and {{a top speed of}} over 100mph (160km/h). Crusoe saw a painted <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> on May 18, 1953, which corresponded closely to the final car; he gave the car the go-ahead in September after comparing it with current European trends. After Henry Ford II returned from the Los Angeles Auto Show (Autorama) in 1953 he approved the final design concept to compete with the then new Corvette.|$|E

Lucas was not considered to be credible, as he was known to be in Florida when Cole was killed and has since been eliminated as a suspect for the murders of Alexander and Orange Socks. Because of the decomposition of the body, the victim was reconstructed, at first with a three-dimensional <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> and later with a digital method by the Louisiana State University FACES Lab. Once possible, DNA was eventually extracted from the victim's teeth that would be used to compare against missing persons.|$|E

Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> {{of the car}} {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E
500|$|Marochetti's {{creation}} of the <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> of the statue involved not only the sculptor himself but also the painter Victor Mottez, King Louis Philippe's personal physician Henri Gueneau de Mussy and the singers Mario and Garcia, all of whom contributed manual input. A <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> of the statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside the western entrance of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after {{the opening of the}} exhibition on 1 May 1851, the horse's tail fell off. It was repaired and the statue eventually attracted critical acclaim. The art critic John Ruskin said of the model, [...] "it will tend more to educate the public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries". It came to be {{regarded as one of the}} more popular items in the exhibition and Prince Albert personally took King Leopold to see it and the statue by Simonis, which now stands in the Grand Place of Brussels. The Art Journal was later to describe it as [...] "unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of the bravura class of sculpture." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1864, Rodin {{submitted}} {{his first}} sculpture for exhibition, The Man with the Broken Nose, to the Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece {{was not a}} traditional bust, but instead the head was [...] "broken off" [...] at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, {{and the back of}} the head was absent, having fallen off the <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the [...] "unfinishedness" [...] that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.|$|E

The crew was dissatisfied with the original four-foot <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> created by the Abel group, which looked like a modernized Nemo's Nautilus submarine. Industrial designer Syd Mead was hired to visualize {{a new version of}} the mammoth craft. Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise, Roddenberry, and the effects leads. The final model was [...] long, built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated. The model was built out of a plethora of materials—wood, foam, macramé, Styrofoam cups, incandescent, neon and strobe lights.|$|E
500|$|Gibbs {{published}} his first work in 1873. His {{papers on the}} geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy. These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, {{such as the ones}} that Maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena. [...] Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge. [...] Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> illustrating Gibbs's construct. [...] He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. [...] That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the Second Italian War in 1499, the invading French troops used the life-size <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> for the Gran Cavallo for target practice. With Ludovico Sforza overthrown, Leonardo, with his {{assistant}} Salai and friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli, fled Milan for Venice, where he was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack. On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of Santissima Annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist, a work that won such admiration that [...] "men and women, young and old" [...] flocked to see it [...] "as if they were attending a great festival".|$|E

500|$|... "The Final Hours" [...] {{ends with}} a facial {{reconstruction}} suggesting what Jesus may have looked like. Using one of three first-century Jewish skulls from a forensic science department in Israel, a <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> is created through forensic anthropology by Richard Neave, a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at Manchester University. The face that Neave constructs suggests that Jesus {{would have had a}} broad face and large nose, and differs significantly from his traditional depictions in renaissance art. Additional information about Jesus's skin colour and hair is provided by Goodacre. Using third-century images from the Dura-Europos synagogue—the earliest pictures of Jewish people—Goodacre proposes that Jesus's skin would have been [...] "olive-coloured" [...] and [...] "swarthy", and much darker than his traditional Western image. He also suggests that Jesus would have had short, curly hair and a short cropped beard.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo was {{employed}} on many different projects for Ludovico, including {{the preparation of}} floats and pageants for special occasions, designs for a dome for Milan Cathedral and {{a model for a}} huge equestrian monument to Francesco Sforza, Ludovico's predecessor. Seventy tons of bronze were set aside for casting it. The monument remained unfinished for several years, which was not unusual for Leonardo. In 1492, the <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> of the horse was completed. It surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's Gattamelata in Padua and Verrocchio's Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, and became known as the [...] "Gran Cavallo". Leonardo began making detailed plans for its casting; however, Michelangelo insulted Leonardo by implying that he was unable to cast it. In November 1494, Ludovico gave the bronze to be used for cannon to defend the city from invasion by Charles VIII.|$|E
500|$|Finding that {{he needed}} advice in regard to accouterments and the {{attitude}} of Australian soldiers, Jones made inquiries about consulting with an Australian. George Henry Goodall, a South Australian veteran of the Second Boer War, {{was at the time}} serving as Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant with the Australian Corps engaged in London at the coronation ceremonies for King Edward VII. Goodall was [...] "volunteered" [...] to attend Jones in order to model and to provide advice. Goodall later described how Jones had requested that he pose while the sculptor created a <b>clay</b> <b>model</b> of his head, but Simon Cameron observed that Jones's memoirs [...] "do not mention any sittings." [...] Nevertheless, a 1940 memorandum, based on a conversation with Goodall, noted that [...] "a comparison of a photograph of Mr Goodall, taken in 1902 with the statue itself certainly indicates a strong facial likeness". In the same memorandum it was noted that Goodall only posed for the head, and that he insisted that his selection to model for the statue was not based on any outstanding merit as a soldier.|$|E
