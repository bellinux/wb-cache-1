5000|$|Because the {{plaintiff}} in Russell {{won in the}} Ninth Circuit, and because all Ninth Circuit decisions must be reversed by the High Court, Justice Stevens' dicta said that [...] "remedying <b>consequential</b> <b>injury</b> even under the authorization for 'appropriate equitable relief' in section 502(a)(3) would entail {{the creation of an}} implied cause of action, contrary to the Court's established constraints on the implication of causes of action under federal statutes." [...] Langbein at 1341. Stevens then suggested that ERISA was only concerned with protecting employee benefit plans not employees. This error in construing that Section 502(a)(2) limit to plans into a limit to all of ERISA remedy led to the High Court in denying an effective remedy to employees under ERISA Section 502(a)(3) in Mertens.|$|E
40|$|If {{organizations}} {{would be}} able to learn more effectively from incidents that occurred in the past, future incidents and <b>consequential</b> <b>injury</b> or damage can be prevented. To improve learning from incidents, this study aimed to identify limiting factors, i. e. the causes of the failure to effectively learn. In seven organizations focus groups were held to discuss factors that according to employees contributed to the failure to learn. By use of a model of the learning from incidents process, the steps, where difficulties for learning arose, became visible, and the causes for these difficulties could be studied. Difficulties were identified in multiple steps of the learning process, but most difficulties became visible when planning actions, which is the phase that bridges the gap from incident investigation to actions for improvement. The main causes for learning difficulties, which were identified by the participants in this study, were tightly related to the learning process, but some indirect causes – or conditions – such as lack of ownership and limitations in expertise were also mentioned. The results illustrate that {{there are two types of}} causes for the failure to effectively learn: direct causes and indirect causes, here called conditions. By actively and systematically studying learning, more conditions might be identified and indicators for a successful learning process may be determined. Studying the learning process does, however, require a shift from learning from incidents to learning to learn...|$|E
40|$|The Child Maltreatment Log (CML) is a {{computer-based}} {{program designed}} to record information about children’s maltreatment experiences and associated life events. Address-ing concerns posed by scientific panels and grant review pan-els, the CML was designed to improve upon existing instruments to facilitate collaboration among researchers in-terested in maltreatment. The CML encourages researchers to collect information from multiple sources and informants concerning children’s maltreatment experiences. Rather than classifying types of maltreatment a priori, the CML allows re-searchers to describe children’s experiences using objective descriptors pertaining to potential acts of abuse, potential perpetrators, frequency, onset, <b>consequential</b> <b>injuries,</b> and treatment. The CML can be downloaded by interested agen-cies and groups without charge...|$|R

30|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) and stroke {{are the two}} main types of central nervous system injury which usually results in motor {{disorder}} such as paralysis and hemiparesis, cognitive dysfunction, as well as psychological problems. SCI is mainly caused by various kinds of accidents, while stroke is caused by an interruption of {{blood flow to the}} brain or an obstruction within a blood vessel in supplying blood to the brain [1],[2]. Rehabilitation is one of the prime treatments for SCI and stroke patients, aiming to provoke the motor plasticity and to actuate these patients to relearn the use of their limbs. According to the rehabilitation theory, the resulting sensory feedback of the patient is associated with the cortical changes that can bring recovery of functional movement during the rehabilitation process so that the functional deficits and the risk of <b>consequential</b> <b>injuries</b> can be minimized [3]-[6].|$|R
40|$|In a pair {{of cases}} decided by 5 - 4 {{majorities}} (Mertens, 1993; Great- West, 2002) interpreting the scope of remedy for wrongdoing under ERISA, the Supreme Court construed the statute 2 ̆ 7 s grant of 2 ̆ 2 appropriate equitable relief 2 ̆ 7 to prevent the victims of ERISA-prohibited conduct from being compensated for <b>consequential</b> <b>injury.</b> The Court read ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s authorization of 2 ̆ 2 appropriate equitable relief 2 ̆ 7 to have disinterred the law/equity division from the era before the two systems were fused in the 1930 s, and the Court treated equity as not having awarded monetary relief As a consequence, lower courts have held ERISA to preclude remedy {{in a host of}} situations in which wrongful plan administration (almost always in violation of ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s fiduciary rules) has caused expense, physical harm, or other suffering. This Article explains why and how the Court 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of ERISA remedy law went wrong, beginning with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s earlier encounter with the field in Russell (1985). The main theme is that the reach of trust-law principles in ERISA is far deeper and more controlling than the opinions in Mertens and Great-West allow. When federalizing the administration of pension and employee benefit plans in ERISA, Congress made a deliberate choice to subject these plans to the pre-existing regime of trust law rather than to invent a new regulatory structure. In this dimension, ERISA is federal trust law. Congress intended ERISA remedy law to replicate the core principles of trust remedy law in the regulation of pension and benefit plans, including the long-familiar make-whole standard of trust remedy law...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, {{a former}} student {{successfully}} sued the State of Victoria for the failure by a government school principal and deputy principal to report what was found should have amounted to a reasonable suspicion that the child had been and was being sexually abused (AB v Victoria, 2000; 1 Briggs & Potter, 2004). The action was in negligence, with the failure to report occurring in 1991 - 92, before the introduction of legislation in Victoria in 1993 which compelled teachers to report suspected child sexual abuse. The student was awarded 494, 000 in damages for {{the contribution of the}} failure to report to her subsequent suffering of abuse by her stepfather and <b>consequential</b> <b>injury.</b> In 2001, the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in Sullivan v Moody; Thompson v Connon, 2 two cases heard together, with each involving an inaccurate report made by a mandated reporter of child sexual abuse. The court upheld the principle that a person who possesses a statutory duty to report a reasonable suspicion of child sexual abuse and who makes an inaccurate report in fulfilling that duty, owes no tortious duty of care to persons who may be wrongly suspected of being the source of the incorrectly alleged harm, and therefore cannot be liable in negligence. These two cases illustrate parts of the legal context surrounding the detection and reporting of suspected child sexual abuse. Common law principles and statutory reporting obligations requiring members of certain professional groups to report knowledge and 'reasonable suspicion' of child sexual abuse are predicated on fulfilling a duty of care to avoid damage, and the desire for accurate reports of child sexual abuse by professionals who are well-placed and legally compelled to report it, with this desire being motivated by goals of crime prevention, health enhancement, and the saving of future economic cost to the individual, society and the state. However, the factual postscripts of the reports made in Sullivan and Thompson evince one of the main tensions in mandatory reporting laws. In Sullivan, the suspicion of child sexual abuse was formed by a doctor and a psychiatric social worker. The social worker made the report, and the child’s father came under suspicion as the perpetrator. The report was later found to be inaccurate and criminal charges against the father were dropped. The allegation, pursued in Family Court proceedings against the father, was also resolved in his favour. As a result of the report and events surrounding it, the child’s father suffered severe consequences: his marriage broke down, and he allegedly suffered shock, distress, psychiatric injury and personal and financial loss. In Thompson, the initial report of child sexual abuse was made by a medical practitioner and was concurred with by government community welfare investigators. Police charged Mr Thompson with sexual Ben Mathews & Kerryann WalshQueensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia 1327 - 7634 Vol 9, No 2, 2004, pp. 3 - 17 Australia & New Zealand Journal of Law & Education Ben Mathews & Kerryann Walsh 4 offences but these charges were later dropped. As a consequence of this series of events, Mr Thompson suffered shock, distress, psychiatric injury and personal and financial loss. The tension is therefore between mandated reporters’ failure to report deserving cases (underreporting), and their inaccurate reporting of undeserving cases (overreporting). With the exceptions of Western Australia and Queensland, laws in all Australian jurisdictions compel members of multiple professional groups to report all forms of child abuse. In these jurisdictions, members of the teaching profession form one of these professional groups, and their obligation to report extends to cases of reasonably suspected child sexual abuse. The question that arises here is: how does this fundamental tension play out in the context of teachers' reporting of child sexual abuse? While there is ongoing debate about the justifiability of mandatory reporting legislation (Ainsworth, 2002; Harries & Clare, 2002; Mathews & Walsh, 2004), it is not {{the purpose of this article}} to add directly to that debate. Rather, this article proceeds from the basis that, while there are three different statutory models in Australia, legal frameworks do exist for the reporting by teachers of child sexual abuse in all jurisdictions, yet there remain crucial questions about whether these laws work in practice, which legal provisions are effective or ineffective, and why. The main function of this article is therefore to identify existing gaps in the empirical research that need to be filled to provide a thorough assessment of the different Australian legislative provisions and to provide assessments of teacher preparation and practice throughout Australia. This article will first describe the relevant context by synthesising the major rationales for mandatory reporting legislation, drawing together recent evidence confirming the incidence and multiple adverse effects of child sexual abuse, and summarising the main reasons mandatory teacher reporting obligations are opposed. The article will then contribute to the knowledge base by articulating the statutory legal obligations of teachers in every Australian jurisdiction, before identifying some of the most important gaps in the research literature in this field. It will be seen that these gaps impede the evidence-based design of both the most effective legislative technique for mandatory reporting by teachers of child sexual abuse, and of the most efficient methods of teacher training and preparation to meet legal reporting obligations. Arguably, these gaps in the evidence base are not only producing significant costs to children enduring sexual abuse which could be interrupted, but are also contributing to individuals being wrongly accused of abuse, and the significant waste of state resources...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) following full myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in two patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donors, unrelated to active or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Both recipients had elevated urinary levels of galactose-deficient IgA 1, and one donor–recipient pair had elevated serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA 1. We propose that IgAN developed after bone marrow transplantation due to a non-graft-versus-host-disease-related multi-hit process associated with glomerular deposition of galactose-deficient IgA 1. These two cases provide unique insight into the kinetics of overproduction of galactose-deficient IgA 1 and its glomerular deposition and <b>consequential</b> renal <b>injury</b> in IgAN...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the physical factors influencing the transportation of emergency patients in ambulance cars. Recently, there is no documented evidence for direct <b>consequential</b> <b>injuries</b> caused by transportation induced secondary injuries. In contrast, experience {{from the field of}} occupational medicine referring the adverse influences of vibration, noise and heat on the healthy people suggest negative influences. Measurements conducted for this dissertation revealed considerable levels of physical stress. Certain manoeuvres during transport and even the loading process cause short-term peak levels of stress due to acceleration. Extreme vibrations are trans-mitted via the floating stretcher to the patient resulting in hard impacts. Furthermore, noise has been identified as another relevant factor for stress in an ambulance car. Amazing high levels of noise around 100 dB caused by rattling, radio transmissions and the siren can occur in the ambulance car. In summertime additionally, high temperatures negatively influence the patients and emergency personnel comfort. Thus technical improvements made in recent years absent regulations, inadequate technical rules and none existent design standards of ambulance cars lead to inconsistent equipment of the ambulance cars. Simple feasible measures optimising chassis, floating stretcher table, air condition, noise control, correct and adapted driving manner, can significantly reduce the stress on patients during transportation. Concluding, the above-mentioned items should be added to the standards for ambulance cars. Additionally, driving trainings and adapted driving promise should be introduced to reduce transportation stress for patients. Furthermore, the results of this dissertation should be taken into account when constructing ambulance cars...|$|R

40|$|Among {{diabetes}} patients, ophthalmological complications {{are very}} frequent. High blood glucose and (<b>consequential)</b> ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) <b>injury</b> {{contribute significantly to}} the severity of retinopathies. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of blindness. Our study demonstrates the effect of sour cherry seed extract (SCSE) on blood glucose and function of the retina with electroretinography (ERG) in a diabetic setting with or without ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. Our results prove that the SCSE has a retinoprotective effect in diabetic rats: according to ERG measurements, SCSE treatment mitigated the retinal function-damaging effect of diabetes, and proved to be protective in the diabetic eye against ischemia-reperfusion injuries of the retina. Outcomes suggest that the protective effects of SCSE may occur through several pathways, including HO- 1 dependent mechanisms. The observation that SCSE treatment decreases blood glucose is also novel. These findings offer the possibility for development of novel therapeutic strategies utilizing this emerging functional food, in particular {{in the prevention of}} conditions resulting from high blood glucose or I/R injury, such as deterioration of retinal microcirculation...|$|R
40|$|With today's {{advancement}} {{of knowledge in}} the field of sports medicine, exercise is on the rise. Americans are attempting to become healthier, leaner, and in all-around better shape. Due to this increasing phenomenon, almost everyone considers themselves an "athlete" of sorts. It is no longer only those on varsity teams who exhaust their bodies in a pursuit of physical fitness, improved health, and well-being. Because of this newfound rise in amateur work-outs, there is a <b>consequential</b> rise in <b>injuries</b> as well. Extreme stresses are placed on the body {{as a direct result of}} exercise, ranging anywhere from over-use to direct trauma. Regardless of the stress, the body needs the correct rehabilitation in order to heal properly, allowing the individual to return to their full performance. Physical therapy is an important way to allow the body to heal properly. It is crucial for each individual to understand his/her body and how to regain any lost movement or strength due to injury. This guide focuses on the upper body, mainly because it is not as widely talked about due to the immense number of injuries incurred by the lower body as a result of running activities. Explanations of basic anatomy of the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments that make up each upper body joint are included, as well as common injuries and rehabilitative techniques, including stretching and strengthening exercises.
