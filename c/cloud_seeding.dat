50|$|Ship {{tracks are}} clouds that form around the exhaust {{released}} by ships into the still ocean air.

50|$|In 1945, Vonnegut {{went to work}} at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. It was there, on November 14, 1946, that he {{discovered}} that silver iodide {{could be used as a}} nucleating agent to <b>seed</b> <b>clouds.</b> <b>Seeding</b> <b>clouds</b> involves inserting large quantities of a nucleating agent into clouds to facilitate the formation of ice crystals. The intent of this process is to cause the clouds to produce rain or snow. Rain- and snow-making companies still use silver iodide as a nucleating agent in <b>seeding</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using <b>cloud</b> <b>seeding</b> to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal {{was to try to}} weaken hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As <b>cloud</b> <b>seeding</b> needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for <b>cloud</b> <b>seeding</b> to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{detection}} {{is always}} an arduous problem in satellite imagery processing, especially the thin cloud which has the similar spectral characteristics as ground surfacehas long been the obstacle of the production of imagery product. In this paper, an automatic cloud detection method for Chinese high resolution remote sensing satellite imagery is introduced to overcome this problem. Firstly, the image is transformed from RGB to HIS color space by an improved color transformation model. The basic cloud coverage figure is obtained by using the information of intensity and saturation,followed by getting the modified figure with the information of near-infrared band and hue. Methods of histogram equalization and bilateral filtering, combined with conditioned Otsu thresholding are adopted to generate texture information. Then the <b>cloud</b> <b>seed</b> figureis obtained by using texture information to eliminate the existed errors in the modified figure. Finally, cloud covered areas are accurately extracted by integration of intensity information from the HIS color space and <b>cloud</b> <b>seed</b> figure. Compared to the detection results of other automatic and interactive methods, the overall accuracy of our proposed method achieves nearly 10 % improvement, and {{it is capable of}} improving the efficiency of cloud detection significantly...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{collinearity}} {{is excellent}} to detect remnants of relatively recent duplications and homologous regions between closely related species, more ancient homologous regions may remain undetected (9). Synteny is a valid, albeit less stringent, alternative than collinearity to detect ancient homology between regions that experienced severe rearrangements, such as, for example, paralogous regions that originated from the whole-genome duplication (WGD) {{in the common}} ancestor of all vertebrates 350 - 450 Mya (20). i-ADHoRe 3. 0 features an additional clustering algorithm to detect genomic homology based on shared gene content, coined the synteny mode. The input and initial steps were identical to the collinearity search mode. Only after the pairwise GHMs had been built, a different clustering algorithm was used (Supplementary Figure 1). Clouds of dots contained by a bounding box were detected. Initially, the method started by considering all the dots of the GHM as potential <b>cloud</b> <b>seeds.</b> Subsequently the seeding algorithm searched a rectangular area, defined by the cloud_gap, for additional dots, and all dots in this window formed the <b>seed</b> <b>cloud.</b> Next, all <b>seed</b> <b>clouds</b> would grow by adding all dots present in a frame with a thickness equal to the cloud_gap to the curren...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{have significant}} implications {{for human health}} and climate. For instance, aerosols impact climate directly by scattering and absorbing solar and terrestrial radiation and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN), which facilitate cloud droplet and ice crystal formation, respectively. Changes in chemistry, size, and number concentrations between different locations and over time alter how aerosols impact air quality and cloud formation, and can have broader implications on precipitation efficiency and phase. Further, aerosol composition largely depends on meteorology, which influences sources and chemical transformation in the atmosphere. Aerosol-cloud- precipitation interactions represent {{one of the largest}} sources of uncertainty in climate science; therefore, {{a better understanding of the}} aerosols that contribute to these effects is needed. To address this source of uncertainty, the chemical composition of individual ambient aerosols and aerosols as insoluble residues in precipitation samples was determined using aerosol time-of -flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) and provided insight into their potential to serve as <b>cloud</b> <b>seeds</b> at three different locations over time. A three-year summer study (2005 - 2007) in Riverside, CA afforded information on the inter-annual variability of the urban aerosol due to changes in aerosol transport and meteorological conditions. In the summer of 2008 in Atlanta, GA, tropical cyclones shifted the representative aged urban aerosol to a less-aged, less-CCN active aerosol population, having implications on regional cloud formation after extreme weather events. At a remote site in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the winter of 2009, observations of newly- formed aerosols presented a new source of CCN. Inter- annual trends in precipitation at the same remote site showed how IN transported from the Sahara and Asia potentially influenced precipitation processes during three winter seasons (2009 - 2011). Investigating changes in <b>cloud</b> <b>seeds</b> represents a longer-term goal to reduce uncertainties associated with modeling aerosol-cloud- precipitation interactions. Larger spatial and temporal coverage is needed to better understand trends in cloud formation and precipitation and to provide more detail for regional and global model parameterization. The results presented herein represent a noteworthy advancement towards understanding variation in composition and sources of <b>cloud</b> <b>seeds</b> in different regions and in most cases long time period...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture of iodine), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, <b>cloud</b> <b>seeding,</b> and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, No. 78 Squadron moved to Deniliquin in New South Wales on 17 December {{and most of}} its personnel were sent on leave until 16 January. The squadron was rapidly reduced to a cadre, and comprised only 17 personnel in July 1946. The unit was located at RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney from May to August 1946, and then moved to RAAF Station Williamtown outside of Newcastle. On 4 August 1946 it received four P-51D Mustang fighters and a single CAC Wirraway trainer. No. 78 Squadron undertook training during 1947, including exercises with Australian and British warships in March and July. During April 1947 two of the squadron's Mustangs took part in a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation <b>cloud</b> <b>seeding</b> experiment; in this role the aircraft sprayed silver iodide onto clouds from tanks beneath their wings with the goal of generating rain.

2500|$|Cloud {{condensation}} nuclei or CCNs (also {{known as}} <b>cloud</b> <b>seeds)</b> are small particles typically 0.2 µm, or 1/100th {{the size of}} a cloud droplet [...] on which water vapor condenses. Water requires a non-gaseous surface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid; this process is called condensation. In the atmosphere, this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs. When no CCNs are present, water vapour can be supercooled at about −13°C (8°F) for 5–6 hours before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the cloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles). In above freezing temperatures the air would have to be supersaturated to around 400% before the droplets could form.|$|R

From an English-speaking outfit it was transformed into a Hebrew speaking unit.

The IAF itself was undergoing major changes, and in early May 1949 69 Squadron relocated to Tel Nof. In October 1951 the squadron moved once more, this time to Hatzor. In December 1952 the three B-17 was joined by three PBY Catalinas, acquired to guarantee supply to the town of Eilat at Israel's southern extremity. Utilization of these aircraft, however, was low and they were soon withdrawn from service with the squadron. Spares, meanwhile, were also hampering B-17 operations and in March 1954 69 Squadron was deactivated and its assests handed over to 103 Squadron, which soon retired the Catalinas but continued to operate the three B-17s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Clear-air seeding is the {{artificial}} creation or enhancement of cloud cover in clear air which is between saturation {{with respect to}} ice and saturation with respect to liquid water. Previous work has demonstrated that clear-air seeding is possible, and may be economically worthwhile through its effects on the radiation balance near the ground. Order-of-magnitude arguments, contrail observations and direct measurements are {{used to assess the}} frequency and horizontal extent of opportunities for clear-air seeding in the upper troposphere. Clear, ice-supersaturated air is a cor~rnon occurrence in the mid-latitude upper troposphere at all times of year, t~,p~cally appearing over 100 km-wide regions downstream of cyclonic or convective storm systems. The frequency of opportunities was also estimated for a particular applicat. ion of clear-air <b>seeding</b> [...] <b>cloud</b> cover enhancement during x~inter nights to reduce space heating costs. Opportunities were studied for the middle and lower troposphere through a careful analysis of radiosonde humidity data, and for the upper troposphere through observalions of natural cirrus. Under suitable cloud cover and wind conditions, five to ten opportunities each season are estimated for locations in the northeastern United States, a frequency sufficient for economic advanlage based on a previous analysis. Two methods are discussed for seeding clear, ice-superssLurated air to create <b>clouds.</b> <b>Seeding</b> with ice crystals is studied using a numerical simulation of ice crystal cloud growth, which includes both ice physics and radiative transfer. Ice crystal seeding is most effective when the seeding rate is greatest and the moist layer seeded is deepest.

The Sarawak state government had declared that schools would close if the API breaches the 300 mark. The worst affected area in Peninsular Malaysia is Johor Bahru which recorded an API of 150 on 7 and 8 October.

40|$|Environmental context.

40|$|Protecting {{the living}} {{environment}} {{has become one}} of the greatest human concerns; sudden increase of population, industry and technology development, unrestrained over consumption of the citizens and climate changes, have all caused many problems for mankind. Shores are special zones that are in contact with three Atmosphere, Hydrosphere and Lithosphere environments of earth. Shore lines are of the most important linear features of the earth’s surface which have an animated and alive nature. In this regard, optimized management of the shores and environmental protection for stable development require observing the shorelines and their variations. Protection of shorelines within appropriate time periods is of high importance for the purpose of optimized management of the shores. The twenty first century has been called the era of information explosion. A time that, through benefits of new technologies, information experts attempt to generate more and up to date information in various fields and to provide them for managers and decision makers in order to be considered for future planning and also to assist the planners to arrange and set a comprehensive plan. Aerial images and remote sensing technology are economic methods to acquire the required data. Such methods are free from common time and place limitations in survey based methods. Among remote sensing data, the ones acquired from optical images have several benefits which include low cost, interpretation simplicity and ease of access. That is why most of the researches concerning extraction of shorelines are practiced using optical images. On the other hand, wide range coverage of satellite images along with rapid access to them caused these images to be used extensively for extracting the shorelines. The attempt in this research is to use satellite images and their application in order to study variations of the shorelines. Thus, for this purpose, Landsat satellite images from TM and ETM+ sensors in the 35 time period has been used. In order to reach better results, images from MODIS satellite has been used as auxiliary data for the images that are with an error margin. Initial classification on the images was conducted to distinguish water and non water applications. Neural network classification was applied with specific scales on the images and the two major applications were thereby extracted. Then, in order to authenticate the proceedings, Error matrix and Kappa coefficient has been applied on the classified images. Base pixel method of neural network was used for the purpose of information extraction while authenticity of that was evaluated too. The outcomes display the trend of Urmia shoreline has been approximately constant between the years of 1976 to 1995 and has experienced very low variations. In 1998 the lake experienced increase of water and therefore advancement of the shoreline of the lake due to increase of precipitation and the volume of inflowing water to the basin. During 2000 to 20125, however, the lake’s shoreline has experienced a downward trend, which was intensified in 2007 and reached to its most critical level ever since, that is decreasing to about one third. Further, temporal and spatial potentiality evaluation of <b>clouds</b> <b>seeding</b> in Urmia lake zone has been studied as a solution for improvement and recovery of the current status of the lake, and an algorithm was proposed for optimized temporal- spatial study on could seeding. Ecological, meteorological and synoptic data were used for timing study of the <b>cloud’s</b> <b>seeding</b> plan, which upon study; it is easy to evaluate precipitation potential and quality of the system. At the next step, the rate of humidity and also stability of the precipitating system can be analyzed using radar acquired data. Whereas extracted date from MODIS images are expressing the spatial position, therefore in order to study the location of the <b>cloud’s</b> <b>seeding,</b> MODIS images of the selected time intervals along with applying MCM algorithm were used to conclude thick clouds. Also, with interpolation of the TRMM data, it is possible to deduce maximum precipitation in the form of spatial arena.
