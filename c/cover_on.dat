5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later. Evasive maneuvers, squall weather, and poor fighter <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> the part of the Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{revealed}} {{the title of}} Half-Blood Prince on her website on 29 June 2004. This was the title she had once considered for the second book, Chamber of Secrets, though she decided that the information disclosed belonged better in book six.

5|$|The back <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> early {{prints of}} the CD {{featured}} a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints {{for fear of}} litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on the back cover. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day {{was spent in}} launching airstrikes and a heavy artillery bombardment against the hilltop, totally denuding it of <b>cover.</b> <b>On</b> 23 November, 2-503 and 4-503 were ordered to renew their assault while the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south.

5|$|Aguilera {{announced}} via Twitter on September 12, 2012 {{that the}} album would be titled Lotus. The album artwork {{was shot by}} fashion photographer Enrique Badulescu. Aguilera unveiled the <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> October 5, where she is shown nude with her long, blonde hair covering her nipples, while her vulva is shaded by a white light; she extends her arms emerging from a lotus flower. It received a generally positive response from critics; Tiffany Lee from Yahoo! Music complimented Aguilera's figure, while Sam Lansky from Idolator drew comparisons to the cover of her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002). Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E

5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|At the {{designated}} time of 05:25, the British opened {{up with an}} artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man's land for the attack. Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops from all directions as they bunched together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud. Serious resistance was encountered at Hilside Farm, a strong point {{to the east of}} Augustus Wood in the centre of the highest part of the Passchendaele ridge. The position consisted of two pillboxes, supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns. The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Kaiserin and {{the rest}} of the {{operational}} III Squadron units conducted divisional training in the Baltic. On 18 August, Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers— and —supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Kaiser, would trail behind and provide <b>cover.</b> <b>On</b> the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton topped the {{timesheets}} once again, setting {{a time of}} 1:44.352, {{a quarter of a}} second clear of teammate Rosberg. Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the floor of his car when he ran over a drain <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1916, Admiral Scheer {{attempted}} {{a repeat of}} the 31 May operation. The two serviceable German battlecruisers, Moltke and Von der Tann, supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Ostfriesland, would trail behind and provide <b>cover.</b> <b>On</b> the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.|$|E
5|$|The Ecstatic was {{released}} by Downtown on June 9, 2009. In its first week, the album sold 39,000 copies and debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200, becoming the second record of Mos Def's career {{to reach the top}} ten on the chart. The following week, he became the first recording artist to endorse the Original Music Tee, a T-shirt featuring the album <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> the front, the track listing on the back, and a tag with a code to download an MP3 copy of the record. The marketing strategy led to enough sales that Billboard factored the T-shirts as album units on the magazine's music charts. The Ecstatic also benefited from the number of mentions it received on Internet blog posts, which peaked during the week of June 29. The album reached 168,000 copies sold in March 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{composite}} bow {{was adopted}} throughout the Arab world, {{even though some}} Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows. Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and Turkish-type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions. Roughly speaking, Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo-Persian designs. Sometimes the protective <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> the back was painted with Arab calligraphy or geometric patterns. No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests. It was said that the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus, Syria.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match on}} the card was an X Division Six Way match between Amazing Red, Delirious, Elix Skipper, Jerrelle Clark, Shark Boy, and Zach Gowen. The contest lasted 6 minutes and 25 seconds. In the final moments of the bout, {{multiple}} near-falls occurred. The first was by Gowen on Clark, ending in a two count. Then followed one by Skipper on Shark Boy, which was broken up by Amazing Red. Amazing Red then attempted a <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> Skipper, which was broken up by Clark, who then attempted to cover Amazing Red before it was stopped by Delirious. Shark Boy ended up gaining the pinfall on Delirious after using his signature maneuver the Dead Sea Drop.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the console {{features}} an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive which accepts only 12cm Wii Optical Discs and 8cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the <b>cover</b> <b>on</b> the {{front of the}} console.|$|E
