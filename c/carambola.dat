500|$|The word carom, which {{simply means}} any strike and rebound, was {{in use in}} {{reference}} to billiards by at least 1779, sometimes spelled [...] "carrom". Sources differ on the origin.

Some etymologists have suggested that <b>carambola,</b> in turn, was derived from a yellow-to-orange, tropical Asian fruit also known in Portuguese as a <b>carambola</b> (which was a corruption of the original name of the fruit, karambal in the Marathi language of India), also known as star fruit.

The species status of these taxa is unclear and this confounds quarantine, pest management, and general research. Mating studies carried out under uniform experimental conditions are required as part of resolving their species limits. These four taxa were collected from the wild and established as laboratory cultures for which we subsequently determined levels of prezygotic compatibility, assessed by field cage mating trials for all pair-wise combinations. We demonstrate random mating among all pair-wise combinations involving B. dorsalis, B. papayae, and B. philippinensis. B. <b>carambolae</b> was relatively incompatible with each of these species as evidenced by nonrandom mating for all crosses. Reasons for incompatibility involving B. <b>carambolae</b> remain unclear; however, we observed differences in the location of couples in the field cage for some comparisons. Alongside other factors such as pheromone composition or other courtship signals, this may lead to reduced interspecific mating compatibility with B. <b>carambolae.</b> These data add to evidence that B. dorsalis, B. papayae, and B. philippinensis represent the same biological species, while B. <b>carambolae</b> remains sufficiently different to maintain its current taxonomic identity.
