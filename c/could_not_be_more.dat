5|$|These cytotaxonomic {{findings}} {{were supported by}} subsequent chromatographic studies. A.montanum was shown to produce a pattern of seven substances chromatographically distinct from those produced by the other diploid members of the Appalachian Asplenium complex. These substances {{were present in the}} chromatograms of all tested hybrids believed to descend from A.montanum at one or more removes: A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii, A.×kentuckiense, A.pinnatifidum, A.×trudellii, and A.×wherryi. Four of the compounds present in the chromatograms of A.montanum and its descendants, fluorescing gold-orange under ultraviolet light, were subsequently identified as the xanthonoids mangiferin, isomangiferin, and their O-glucosides. The other two were identified as kaempferol derivatives, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> precisely determined due to lack of material; the last was a trace compound which could not be studied.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the balance}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{favorable}} for the Spanish, they had sunk or burned five enemy ships {{and two more}} were captured, while the Spanish, apart from the obvious damage and casualties, did not lose anyone, {{by far the most}} damaged was the combative flagship Santa Teresa, still capable of fighting if the loss of their masts had not condemned it to be an unmanegeable wreck.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from its}} {{physical}} transfer to surroundings that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> different {{from its original}} home, the College made few developments between the wars. The Department of Slavonic Languages (later Slavonic Studies) was established in 1933, the teaching of Russian having been introduced in 1916. In 1933–34, the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Zoology and Geography, which had been combined with other subjects, were made independent; and in 1938 a supplemental Charter provided for a much wider representation on the Governing Body. However, further advances were delayed by the outbreak of war in 1939.|$|E

25|$|An effort {{had begun}} in the 17th century to {{regulate}} the height of Paris buildings, which had grown higher and higher, blocking all light to the narrow streets. An ordinance of 18 August 1667 limited the height of buildings to 15.6 meters, the first such limit in the city. Royal declarations in 1783 and 1784 set a limit on the height of buildings determined by {{the width of the}} street; For a street at least ten meters wide, the buildings along the street <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than twenty meters, or six stories, including the attic. For the narrower streets, less than 7.45 meters wide, the height of buildings was limited to 11.7 meters. The result was to give a uniform appearance and height to the new Paris streets.|$|E
25|$|At a {{press conference}} on 15 March, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak {{confirms}} that satellite communications from Flight 370 continued for several hours after contact with it was lost over the South China Sea and that the last signal—received at 08:11 Malaysian time—might have originated from {{as far north as}} Kazakhstan. Najib explained that the signals <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> precisely located than to one of two possible loci: a northern locus stretching approximately from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, or a southern locus stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. Many of the countries on a possible northerly flight route – China, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and India – denied the aircraft could have entered their country's airspace, because military radar would have detected it. Inmarsat had provided an initial analysis of the signals from Flight 370, which produced the two loci, on 11 March.|$|E
25|$|Little {{was done}} to prepare for air attack. Inter-service rivalries between Kimmel and Short did not improve the situation. Particularly, most {{intelligence}} information was sent to Kimmel, assuming he would relay it to Short, and vice versa; this assumption was honored mostly in the breach. Hawaii {{did not have a}} Purple cipher machine (although, by agreement at the highest levels between U.S. and UK cryptographic establishments, four had been delivered to the British by October 1941), so Hawaii remained dependent on Washington for intelligence from that (militarily limited) source. However, since Short had no liaison with Kimmel's intelligence staff, he was usually left out of the loop. Henry Clausen reported the war warnings <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> precise because Washington could not risk Japan guessing the U.S. was reading important parts of their traffic (most importantly Purple), as well as because neither was cleared to receive Purple.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, critics {{began to}} take note of the growth of new Canadian guitar works {{energized}} by Laucke. In La Presse, a Canadian newspaper, music critic Claude Gingras found in Laucke [...] "an interpreter who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> convincing". Canadian composer Claude Vivier expressed his appreciation to Laucke. In his letters, Vivier states that he had: [...] "hardly ever met a musician as committed and dedicated, of such great quality and, above all, of such great completeness and intense capacity for work".|$|E
500|$|Astronomers {{initially}} calculated {{its mass}} {{based on its}} presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1931, Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of Earth, with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars. In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii calculated Pluto's albedo for the first time, finding that it matched that for methane ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than 1 percent the mass of Earth.

His other nominations include the Golden Nymph Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series in 2012, the Young Hollywood Award for Actor of the Year in 2013, and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016.

500|$|Nathaniel Shaler {{left his}} humanist studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's {{introductory}} essay on classification. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard {{to his first}} assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> explicit than saying [...] "ind out what you can without damaging the specimen". After the first hours, Shaler thought he had [...] "compassed that fish," [...] but despite Agassiz always being [...] "within call" [...] he was not asked to present his conclusions.

500|$|On 18 November 1763 the Mozart family {{arrived in}} Paris, {{one of the}} most {{important}} musical centres of Europe, and also a city of great power, wealth, and intellectual activity. Leopold hoped to be received by the court of Louis XV at nearby Versailles. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: [...] "the most consummate Kapellmeister <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> profound in the science of harmony and modulation". Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: [...] "My little girl, although only 12 years old, is {{one of the most}} skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy knows more in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty".|$|E
