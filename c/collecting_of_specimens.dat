50|$|Trinidadian {{populations are}} {{threatened}} by the collection of bromeliads and <b>collecting</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens.</b> The Northern Range Game Sanctuary (also known as the El Tucuche Reserve) provides some protection {{to one of the}} populations. On Cerro Humo, a part of the habitat falls within the Península de Paria National Park, although enforcement remains limited. Clearance for slash-and-burn plots threatens the potential habitat of the species on the slopes of the mountain. The species appears to be specialized for life in high humidity relatively cool tropical montane forests on isolated mountain crests and peaks. With the threat of global climate change, and specifically warming, temperatures are expected to rise even in mountainous regions. This seems likely to result in the uphill retreat of cool-adapted tropical montane forests and the shrinking of the already small range of this frog.|$|E

In 2004, the Russell E. Train Africana Collection was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, where it is housed in the Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Library of Natural History in Washington, D.C. The collection includes correspondence, drafts of publications, diaries, account books, ephemera, posters, news-clippings, biographies, memoirs, portraits, and the former personal property of selected explorers, big game hunters, missionaries, pioneers, and naturalists in Africa. The Train Collection is particularly strong in archival materials on the following topics: {{the search for the}} source of the Nile and the progress of other exploring expeditions in Africa; the <b>collecting</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> of African animals, plants, and ethnological materials for zoos and museums (including a significant body of correspondence and photographs from the Smithsonian African Expedition in 1909-1910, led by President Theodore Roosevelt); and the growth of the African wildlife conservation movement.

Nelson, James S. Jameson, John Rose Troup, William Bonny, William Grant Stairs, Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, and Arthur J. M.

40|$|From {{the preface}} {{we learn that}} this work {{is the result of}} nearly five years of active study of the floral {{covering}} of Nebraska, carried on by the members of the Botanical Seminar in the Botanical Survey of the State of Nebraska. The systematic study of the vegetation of Nebraska was begun by Dr. Bessey in 1884, and has since been carried on by him and his students, all previous collecting having been more or less desultory and unreliable. The Botanical Survey was organized in 1892, and its work has been directed to the <b>collecting</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> and observations for a series of reports in which the floral covering of the state should be treated from the phytogeographical standpoint and for a series of monographs of the flora of Nebraska. A beginning has been made by the publication of three parts of the flora of the state, and the present work is {{the first part of the}} first series. The authors realize that so much yet remains to be done in many directions that a complete phytogeography of the state will be impossible for many years to come, but the work of the survey has progressed far enough to enable them to present the general facts of its phytogeography in an adequate manner and to deal with details in many of the more important subjects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the 1830 s, geology {{was a young}} {{discipline}} {{in the process of}} acquiring uniform stan-dards. This study considers Charles Darwin’s work in relation to that of other more practically and less academically oriented travellers. It suggests a continuity exists between the more practically and the more academically-minded groups in such projects as exploring, mining, map and chart making, <b>collecting</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens,</b> and travel writing. It also highlights the role played by William Fitton as an academically-minded geologist whose instructions on collecting and observ-ing were intended to raise standards for geologists. It suggests that such disciplinary improvements were not unique to geology but reflected a more general willingness at the time to instruct and be instructed. Permit me to advise the traveller to look into the book of nature, which is always open, and learn what he can (Mawe 1821, p. 55). A small type and a thin paper have been preferred for the advan-tage of the traveller; who, it is presumed, will not fail to find the volume an interesting companion of his travels. 1 Doing and knowing What counts as travel? Although it is possible to do geological research in one’s own garden—consider Darwin and his earthworms—or in one’s neigh-bourhood—consider Darwin and his early exploration of the Llanymynech quarry near Shrews-bury, ‘travel ’ as applied to geology usually means travel at a distance requiring overnight stays away from home (Darwin 1833 – 1838; Roberts 1996). Because such travel is costly, financially, in the risk to personal health and safety, and in separation from family and friends, a general question comes to mind: who is paying? As Hugh Torrens has reminded us in regard to William Smith (1769 – 1839), geologists can be seen as people who do things as well as people who know things (Torrens 2001, p. 61). The ques-tion of the doing strongly correlates with the ques-tion of who is paying and for what. Thus, for example, mining was the impetus for the efforts of much travel to South America, as indicated i...|$|E
