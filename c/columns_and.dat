Both the <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> the books collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new <b>columns,</b> <b>and</b> they ended in 1915, {{except for a}} brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E

After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> two half columns. The <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. The floor is constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.|$|E

5|$|In 1843, {{another group}} of planned Greek Revival townhouses was built at 160-168 Second Street. Unusual for urban houses, they {{featured}} one-and-a-half-story porticos on their front facades, with Ionic <b>columns,</b> <b>and</b> (originally) side yards. Another house was built at 170, several years later, in a similar style. They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to {{the cumulative effect of}} heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased.

The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} steel column base plays a very {{important}} role in steel structure design. Through large-scale analysis software ANSYS, this paper analyzes the steel column base by finite element numerical simulation analysis,and discuss the fracture behavior of steel pipe <b>column</b> <b>and</b> fillet weld in different thickness, axial compression ratio and different sectional area. The results showed that, the section of most likely break focus on the ends {{and in the middle of}} the steel pipe <b>column</b> <b>and</b> fillet weld,and with the increase of thickness, cracking capability of the steel pipe <b>column</b> <b>and</b> fillet weld first increased and then decreased, and axial compression ratio of the specimen has little effect for cracking capability,and with the increase of sectional area, the less prone to fracture of the steel pipe <b>column</b> <b>and</b> fillet weld. ...|$|R

5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the <b>columns,</b> <b>and</b> these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
5|$|Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's {{political}} influence {{was on the}} rise. He had begun associating with an inner faction of the Conservative Party, which had as its leader Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest. Afterward, Bogdan-Pitești became the publisher of Seara, but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the impact of his agenda on the Romanian public. Searas main negative campaign at the time focused on Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democrats, who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives. The paper published gossip <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> lampoons having Ionescu, Alexandru Bădărău and Nicolae Titulescu for their main targets.|$|E

The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with capitals, free-standing <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and mouldings of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque in style and the arches early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.|$|E
