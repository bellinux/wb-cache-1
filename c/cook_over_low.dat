5000|$|For {{the typical}} kuku sabzi recipe (as pictured), {{the eggs and}} herbs are mixed and {{seasoned}} with salt, black pepper, walnuts, sometimes flour, sometime barberries, sometimes baking powder and ground turmeric or adviyeh spice mixture. The mixture is then poured into a preheated oiled pan, covered and <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat until set, sometimes flipped or finished in a hot oven. Some cooks saute the herbs briefly before adding the eggs. The amount of herb ingredient usually greatly exceeds the amount of egg, the egg merely serving to hold the kuku together, making the predominant flavor that of the herbs rather {{than that of a}} typical [...] "egg omelette." [...] Walnuts and zereshk (barberries) are a favorite garnish for on top. It is often sliced and served hot or cold with bread or rice, yogurt, sabzi khordan (platter of fresh herbs) and torshi (pickled vegetables). Kuku can be a main dish or an appetizer.|$|R
50|$|The {{cream is}} made by {{whipping}} egg yolks and sugar together until the yolk is almost white, and then slowly adding hot milk, while whisking. This process is {{commonly referred to as}} tempering. Vanilla beans (seeds) may be added for extra flavour and visual appeal. The sauce is then <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat (excessive heating may cause the yolks to cook, resulting in scrambled eggs) and stirred constantly with a spoon until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and then removed from the heat. It is also possible to set the sauce into custard cups and bake in a bain-marie until the egg yolks set. If the sauce reaches too high a temperature, it will curdle, although it can be salvaged by straining into a container placed in an ice bath. Cooking temperature should be between 70 °C (156 °F) and 85 °C (185 °F); the higher the temperature, the thicker the resulting cream, as long as the yolks are fully incorporated into the mixture.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of pottery {{allowed for the}} creation of fireproof cooking vessels in a variety of shapes and sizes. Coating the earthenware with some type of plant gum, and later glazes, converted the porous container into a waterproof vessel. The earthenware cookware could then be suspended over a fire through use of a tripod or other apparatus, or even be placed directly into a low fire or coal bed {{as in the case of}} the pipkin. Ceramics conduct heat poorly, however, so ceramic pots must <b>cook</b> <b>over</b> relatively <b>low</b> heats and <b>over</b> long periods of time. However, most ceramic pots will crack if used on the stovetop, and are only intended for the oven.|$|R
5000|$|Dum Pukht (دم‌پخت), [...] "Larhmeen" [...] or slow oven {{cooking is}} a cooking {{technique}} {{associated with the}} Khyber Pukhtunkha region in Pakistan in which meat and vegetables are <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> a very <b>low</b> flame, generally in sealed containers with very less spices. The technique may be based on earlier Persian cooking methods introduced in the subcontinent but traditions assigns its origin in pre partition India to the reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah (1748-97). Historically Persian it is now also commonly used in other cuisines like Peshawari, Balochi and Mughlai.|$|R
50|$|The term {{rillette}} perhaps {{refers to}} the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, <b>cooked</b> slowly <b>over</b> <b>low</b> heat until very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In Anjou, rillaud was a speciality, plated {{in the shape of}} a pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.|$|R
