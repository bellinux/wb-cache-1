The up and down movement of the accordion {{could easily have}} been produced by catching the bottom of the accordion in a loop of black thread, or on a hook.|$|E
5|$|Labourers were {{employed}} to salvage the valuable wood that was subsequently washed up on Crosby Beach; among the items washed up were a hat belonging to the captain's wife, and a <b>concertina</b> belonging {{to one of the}} crew. Two bodies were also seen in the water.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of <b>concertina</b> wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches. On many of the more remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented {{the full extent of the}} passive defences.|$|E
5000|$|English-system treble and tenor-treble <b>concertinas</b> usually span 3 1/2 or 4 octaves. Baritones are similar, but {{transpose}} {{down one}} octave. Bass <b>concertinas</b> transpose two octaves down, and piccolo <b>concertinas</b> play one octave up.|$|R
5000|$|By 1890 the Vienna [...] "Harmonika" [...] {{builders}} {{produced a}} very large range of instrument types. In 1900 there were 72 accordion builders in Vienna. They also sold copies of English <b>concertinas,</b> German <b>concertinas</b> and bandoneons.|$|R
50|$|Schlicht {{arrived in}} the United States from Germany around 1900, having worked on German-type <b>concertinas</b> there.

5|$|Other {{researchers}} have suspected that a secret accomplice was involved. The magician Carlos María de Heredia {{claimed to have}} replicated the accordion feat of Home and suggested it was a trick performed by an accomplice playing a hidden accordion. Ruth Brandon considered {{the possibility of an}} accomplice playing a <b>concertina,</b> or Home playing a hidden music box. However, Brandon dismissed the accomplice hypothesis as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April an {{evacuation}} control center manned by U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force (USAF) and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) personnel began operating at the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) compound on 12-hour shifts, increasing to 24-hour shifts the next day. Also on 1 April, Plan Alamo was implemented to utilize {{and defend the}} DAO compound and its annex as an evacuee holding area, intended to care for 1,500 evacuees for five days. By 16 April, Alamo was complete: water, C-rations, petroleum, oil and lubricants had been stockpiled, backup electricity generators had been installed, sanitary facilities were completed, and <b>concertina</b> wire protected the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the <b>concertina</b> – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E

50|$|Tenor, {{baritone}} {{and bass}} <b>concertinas</b> often have an air valve {{in the position}} {{that would otherwise be}} occupied by the instrument's highest note. The air button is an essential feature of many bass <b>concertinas</b> which only have reeds to sound on the push bellows direction, due to the increased size of the reeds.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{the term}} Anglo-German only applied to <b>concertinas</b> {{of this type}} built in England, but as German {{manufacturers}} adopted some of these techniques, the term came to apply to all <b>concertinas</b> that used Uhlig's 20-button system. Use of the [...] "German" [...] part of the title Anglo-German ceased in the UK during World War I.|$|R
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, <b>concertina</b> and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E

5000|$|The German <b>concertinas,</b> {{developed}} within Germany {{itself for}} its local market and diaspora, {{tend to be}} larger than the English or Anglo <b>concertinas.</b> They are generally bisonoric, use a different style of [...] "long plate" [...] reeds, and tend to be square rather than hexagonal. Unlike the English and Anglo, they sometimes {{have more than one}} reed per note, creating a vibrato effect.|$|R
50|$|Barbed wire {{obstacles}} were {{vulnerable to}} being pushed about by artillery shells; in World War I, this frequently {{resulted in a}} mass of randomly entangled wires that could be even more daunting than a carefully constructed obstacle. Learning this lesson, World War I soldiers would deploy barbed wire in so-called <b>concertinas</b> that were relatively loose. Barbed wire <b>concertinas</b> could be pre-prepared in the trenches and then deployed in no-man's-land relatively quickly under cover of darkness.|$|R

25|$|In 1823, his uncle, {{the musical}} {{instrument}} maker, died, and Wheatstone, with his elder brother, William, {{took over the}} business. Charles had no great liking for the commercial part, but his ingenuity found a vent in making improvements on the existing instruments, and in devising philosophical toys. He also invented instruments of his own. One {{of the most famous}} was the Wheatstone <b>concertina.</b> It was a six sided instrument with 64 keys. These keys provided for simple chromatic fingerings. The English <b>Concertina</b> became increasingly famous throughout his lifetime, however it didn't reach its peak of popularity until the early 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{music playing}} {{continues}} {{in many parts}} of the UK in the 21st century, often using English and Anglo-system <b>concertinas.</b> <b>Concertinas</b> are mass-produced in Italy and China, and are produced by individual workshops in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Modern-made instruments are in a spectrum of quality and traditionalism, with the most expensive instruments using traditional concertina-type reeds, while mid-level and inexpensive instruments take advantage of the lower price of mass-produced accordion reeds.|$|R

25|$|Since the 1970s, the <b>concertina</b> has {{returned}} to Zulu-traditional music, while diverse influences from pop music and drum and bass were added. Vusi Ximba's Siyakudamisa (1992) {{was perhaps the most}} memorable Zulu-traditional album of the later twentieth century, and drew controversy for racy, comedic lyrics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Concertinas</b> are {{manufactured}} in several types, {{the most common}} in Irish traditional music being the Anglo system with a few musicians now playing the English system. Each differs from the other in construction and playing technique. The most distinctive characteristic of the Anglo system is that each button sounds a different note, {{depending on whether the}} bellows are compressed or expanded. Anglo <b>concertinas</b> typically have either two or three rows of buttons that sound notes, plus an [...] "air button" [...] located near the right thumb that allows the player to fill or empty the bellows without sounding a note.|$|R
50|$|Carl Foerster & Sons was a Milwaukee {{maker of}} bandoneóns, <b>concertinas,</b> accordions, reed organs, and roller organs. Founded by German migrants, it was active {{from at least}} 1909 through at least the 1920s.|$|R

25|$|Sharp became {{interested}} in traditional English dance {{when he saw a}} group of morris dancers with their <b>concertina</b> player William Kimber at the village of Headington Quarry, just outside Oxford, at Christmas 1899. At this time, morris dancing was almost extinct, and the interest generated by Sharp's notations kept the tradition alive.|$|E
25|$|Jeune's flutina resembles Wheatstone's <b>concertina</b> in {{internal}} construction and tone color, {{but it appears}} to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.|$|E
50|$|Two-row Anglo <b>concertinas</b> {{usually have}} 20 buttons that sound notes. Each row of 10 buttons {{comprises}} notes within a common key. The two primary rows thus contain the notes of two musical keys, such as C and G. Each row is divided in two with five buttons playing lower-pitched {{notes of the}} given key on the left-hand end of the instrument and five buttons playing the higher pitched notes on the right-hand end. The row of buttons in the higher key {{is closer to the}} wrist of each hand. 20 key <b>concertinas</b> have a limited use for Irish traditional music due to the limited range of accidentals available.|$|R
