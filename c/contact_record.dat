40|$|Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) provide {{communication}} in scenarios that challenge traditional mobile network solutions. DTN’s routing differs from previous network paradigms by assuming that connectivity will be unpredictable and poor, so information must be opportunistically routed {{to the final}} destination. If a node drops the packet, it affects the overall network performance. These malicious nodes have to be detected so as to improve the packet delivery ratio and system resources such as power and bandwidth. A distributed scheme is used here, in which a node is required to keep the signed contact records of its previous contacts. From this <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> summary, dropping of the packets can be detected. Since misbehaving node may misreport in the <b>contact</b> <b>record,</b> {{a small part of}} each <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> is disseminated to a certain number of security nodes, which can detect the misbehaving node with the help of certain consistency rules. Once misbehaving nodes are detected, the routing misbehaviour can be reduced by a reputation system. The reputation value of a node, which forwards the packet, gets incremented & that which drops the packet gets decremented. Node which has the highest reputation value will be chosen for routing. To ensure a high performance network scenario, energy model of the network is also considered. Here, an ‘awake’ mode is set for those nodes which participate in the routing and ‘sleep ‘mode for those which are unavailable. The simulation results prove that this increments the overall reliability of the network...|$|E
30|$|The CoAP usage for RELOAD also {{supports}} {{the use of}} the RELOAD overlay as a distributed cache for sensor data. As wireless sensors may typically be asleep for extended periods of time to maximize battery life, caching the most recent value of a sensor in the RELOAD overlay is a useful feature. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to store the value directly in the <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> of the sensor together with a timestamp. Besides the most recent value, the overlay {{can also be used to}} store and retrieve historical values (i.e., time series data) from a given sensor. In this case, the time series can be potentially divided to sub-series (to prevent the size of a single record from becoming too large), which are stored individually as resources in the overlay. Since the time series are stored as resources, they can be accessed using CoAP URIs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{disruption}} tolerant networks (DTNs), selfish or malicious nodes may drop received packets. Such routing misbehavior {{reduces the}} packet delivery ratio and wastes system {{resources such as}} power and bandwidth. Although techniques have been proposed to mitigate routing misbehavior in mobile ad hoc networks, they cannot be directly applied to DTNs because of the intermittent connectivity between nodes. To address the problem, we propose a distributed scheme to detect packet dropping in DTNs. In our scheme, a node is required to keep a few signed contact records of its previous contacts, based on which the next contacted node can detect if the node has dropped any packet. Since misbehaving nodes may misreport their contact records to avoid being detected, {{a small part of}} each <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> is disseminated to a certain number of witness nodes, which can collect appropriate contact records and detect the misbehaving nodes. We also propose a scheme to mitigate routing misbehavior by limiting the number of packets forwarded to the misbehaving nodes. Trace-driven simulations show that our solutions are efficient and can effectively mitigate routing misbehavior.

40|$|Abstract: Mineralogy and {{chemical}} composition are presented for a chert–ironstone bed that overlies the Úrkút Mn deposit. This bed is mottled green–brown in its lower and upper parts, which {{are composed of}} quartz, goethite and celadonite. These parts of the bed are interpreted to be strongly altered tuffs, reflecting oxidic, low-temperature alteration of a hydrated, Fe-rich, Al-poor tuff, and K and Mg uptake from seawater. The middle part of the bed is a mineralized bacterial mat (quartz, goethite). Textures resembling bacterial cells and colonies are common, with wavy, bulbous laminations composed of mounds overlying a mesh-work stromatolite-like texture constructed of micrometre-size Fe oxides. This bed is concordant with the underlying Mn deposit and marks the termination of Mn accumulation.

40|$|Like many large, crustal-scale faults, the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) in SW Japan has a {{long history}} of movement, having been active {{predominantly}} as a strike-slip fault since the mid-Cretaceous. Fault rock exposures in the core of the MTL preserve a history of deformation at a range of mid- to shallow-crustal depths. Ryoke mylonites 1 – 4 km north of the main <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> deeper level, Cretaceous top-to-the-south sinistral movements. The remainder of the fault zone core is surprisingly narrow, exhibiting a wide variety of fault rocks that illustrate both the interaction and effects of syn-tectonic fluid influx over a range of deformation conditions. Exposures within 50 m of the central slip zone display a progressive sequence in fault rock evolution from ultramylonite→cataclasite→foliated cataclasite→phyllonite→breccia/gouge. This sequence occurs because cataclasis in the vicinity of the fault core creates permeable pathways for the ingress of chemically active fluids into the fault zone. This leads to the replacement of load-bearing phases, such as feldspar, by fine-grained, foliated aggregates of intrinsically weaker phyllosilicates such as white mica and chlorite. The grain size reduction associated with both cataclasis and mineral alteration creates conditions ideal for the operation of fluid-assisted, stress-induced diffusive mass transfer mechanisms. Comparison with the findings of recent experimental studies suggest that the fault zone processes observed in the core of the MTL will lead to long-term weakening, provided the network of phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks are able to form an interconnected thin layer of weak material on kilometre- to tens of kilometre-length scales...|$|E
40|$|While {{home health}} {{services}} {{have traditionally been}} an underused component {{of the health care}} system, current trends suggest the desirability of expanding these services. These trends include {{an increase in the number}} of elderly who need the benefits of home care, the recognition that long-term chronic illnesses require appropriate management at home, and concern that patients have access to care at the level most appropriate to their illnesses. In New Hampshire, 41 certified home health agencies offer services. Little systematic research has been conducted on the kinds of services they provide and the patients seen by their staffs. Patient encounter data were collected from a sample of eight agencies for a 4 -week period. Staff of the agencies used the patient <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> developed by the National Functional Task Analysis Cooperative Study to collect data. The data reflected differences among the agencies in the size of the populations they serve, organizational characteristics, reasons for patients' visits, expected sources of the revenue that supported them, and the diagnosis of the patients they cared for. The agencies served areas with populations ranging from 1, 000 to 40, 000. The staffs ranged from 1 to 14 full-time persons. Two were public agencies; the others had voluntary sponsorship. When data on reasons for visits were averaged for the eight agencies, it was shown that 72 % of the visits were made for disease control activities such as care for a chronic or acute condition or for treatment or a laboratory test. Disease prevention activities such as a checkup for adults, children, prenatal or postnatal care, or health education accounted for only 24 % of the visits. This result may indicate that, in areas short of physician manpower, the community health nurse is taking on increasing responsibility for medical care as well as health and education. Reimbursement for the visits came from Medicare, 25 %; Medicaid-welfare, 14 %; the patients, 18 %; and health insurance, 3 %. For 35 % of the visits there was no charge; they were underwritten by community resources...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{project will}} examine the {{introduction}} of forensic mental health carer support workers (CSW) into two partner organisations (Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust). The CSW role will be to work specifically with carers in forensic settings offering advice, support, inform and debriefing sessions for caregivers. They will also act as a liaison between carers, service users and health professionals. A recent study examined the support needs of forensic mental health carers (Reynolds et al, 2009; MacInnes et al, 2010). 63 caregivers were interviewed. The results indicated providing regular support and information {{was the most important}} need identified by this group of carers. Receiving poor information was also significantly associated with being dissatisfied with other aspects of the service and negatively impacted on their day-to-day activities (finances, employment, social activities). Aims To provide training and support for a dedicated carer support worker and evaluate the impact of the role and needs of carers from a variety of perspectives. Method The Carer Support Worker role will be evaluated over a period of twelve months. This includes a one month period for induction and training of the support worker and examination of the role over a nine month period. A discrete part of the project will be taken up with providing support {{for the development of the}} role and specific training. To evaluate outcomes data will be collected from a variety of sources throughout the period of the project. These sources include: •	A Carer Support Worker <b>Contact</b> <b>record.</b> •	Monthly supervision and Monthly project team meetings. •	Carers Evaluation - Carers will be contacted at baseline, six months and twelve months and invited to complete the Carers Well Being and Support Scale and the General Health Questionnaire- 28. This will give information about their needs, their level of service satisfaction and the psychological health. Analysis The Carer Support Worker record data will be examined descriptively to identify the amount of contact with carers and the types of support /information required as well as the skills/knowledge needed by the Carer Support Workers to intervene effectively. The data from the supervision/management meetings will also be analysed descriptively and used to develop the support arrangements and any specific training for the Carer Support Workers. The Carers’ evaluation will be analysed both descriptively and inferentially to assess the amount and level of carer need, satisfaction and psychological health and also to examine the differences between the three time points and in different socio-demographic groups. Findings: In the initial stage, this has included developing publicity leaflets, identifying assessment tools and providing a 2 day training programme looking at the background to the project, the literature examining carers of service users with mental health problem, mental health legislation, diagnosis of mental health conditions, aetiology, treatment approaches with a specific examination of basic counselling approaches and the practical elements of the role...|$|E
40|$|The Median Tectonic Line (MTL) is a major, crustal-scale {{fault in}} Japan that {{separates}} the low-P/high-T Ryoke metamorphic belt of mainly subduction related granitoids from the high-P/low-T Sambagawa Belt of accretionary complex metasedimentary rocks. Like many large, crustal-scale faults, the MTL {{has a long history}} of movement having been active predominantly as a strike-slip fault since the mid-Cretaceous. Fault rock exposures in the core of the MTL preserve a history of deformation at a range of mid- to shallow-crustal depths. Ryoke mylonites 1 - 5 km north of the main <b>contact</b> <b>record</b> deeper level, Cretaceous top-to-the-south sinistral movements. The remainder of the fault zone core is surprisingly narrow (く 50 m) exhibiting a wide variety of fault rocks that illustrate both the passage and interaction of syn-tectonic fluid influx over a range of deformation conditions. Exposures of the fault core at Miyamae, Mie Prefecture display a progressive sequence in fault rock evolution from ultramylonite →cataclasite → foliated cataclasite → phyllonite→breccia/gouge. This sequence occurs because cataclasis in the vicinity of the fault core creates permeable pathways for the ingress of chemically active fluids into the fault zone. This leads to the replacement of load-bearing phases such as feldspar by fine grained, foliated aggregates of intrinsically weaker phyllosilicates and the onset of fluid associated diffusive mass transfer (DMT) in finest grained regions of the cataclastically deformed fault zone. Comparison with the findings of recent experimental studies suggest that the fault zone processes observed in the core of the MTL will lead to long-term weakening. An integrated field, microstructural and geochemical study at Miyamae and Tsukide, Mie Prefecture, has highlighted two distinctive domains: 1) the narrow fine-grained foliated fault core where strain is localised; and 2) a wider damage zone of variably fractured mylonites to the north of the fault core that progressively grade into Ryoke protolith mylonite at distances over - 400 m north of the MTL central slip zone. The fine-grained foliated fault rocks within the core have experienced the most intense deformation, but show the apparently least altered geochemical signature. A model for the presence of a damage zone experiencing pervasive fluid flow and a fault core experiencing high fluid fluxes of channellized fluid flow structurally linked to a Ryoke protolith fluid reservoir is presented. A central slip zone 'seal' IS inferred to retard mixing with Sambagawa-derived fluids. The phyllonitic fault rocks in the core of the MTL posses a strong permeability anisotropy where transverse fluid flow is inhibited and focused fault-parallel fluid flow occurs. Foliated cataclasites are exceptionally well exposed in the MTL fault core at Anko, Nagano Prefecture. Processes of brittle fracture and cataclasis have led to the development of cm- to sub-mm spaced fracture systems defining a crude fabric. This fracture system established an initial architectural hierarchy that influenced the subsequent development of foliated cataclasite and gouge. Fluid influx at the onset of grain-scale brittle deformation led to precipitation of fibrous chlorite within the finest- grained sections of the fault core. This ultimately led to the development of a foliation within the ultra-cataclasite defined by an interconnected network of aligned phyllosilicate aggregates. The brittle reduction of grain-size and the ingress of a chemically active fluid phase promoted the operation of diffusive mass transfer mechanisms ('frictional-viscous creep') and reaction softening. Field and microstructural observations at Anko suggest that the foliated cataclasites are a shallower equivalent to the phyllonites found along the more deeply exhumed parts of the MTL at Miyamae.
