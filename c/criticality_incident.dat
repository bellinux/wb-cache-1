40|$|The present {{work was}} focused on {{maintenance}} hazards related to vegetable oil refining. An incident occurred in an Italian vegetable oil refinery was presented to evidence this safety <b>criticality.</b> The <b>incident</b> took place during a maintenance shut down, and was associated to the ignition of the solid residual in a packed column. No fatalities or injuries were reported, but the column was strongly damaged and removed from the plant. A specific experimental characterization of the solid residues accumulated in the column, sampled both from the damaged and undamaged parts of the column, {{was carried out in}} order to determine the conditions leading to unwanted combustion of the residues. At the same time, samples taken from the damaged column steelwork were subjected to metallurgical analysis aimed at the thermal and mechanical characterization of the steel, obtaining information about the incident duration and temperature reached during the combustion phenomenon.

40|$|To solicit Commission {{direction}} {{regarding the}} alternative to be pursued in regulating the safety of fuel cycle facilities. SUMMARY: In the staff requirements memorandum (SRM) dated January 15, 1993, the Commission directed the staff to upgrade and more clearly define the regulatory base for major fuel cycle licensees. In March 1995 the Commission directed the staff to reconsider the plan to modify 10 CFR Part 70, "Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material, " and to discuss with major fuel cycle licensees the draft proposed rule that was being developed. Workshops were conducted in May and November 1995 to solicit comments and information from interested parties. Based on this input, six alternatives for Commission consideration have been developed. Commission direction on how staff should proceed is requested. BACKGROUND: After the potential <b>criticality</b> <b>incident</b> that occurred at the General Electric (GE) Nuclear Fuel an...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the potential for}} a <b>criticality</b> <b>incident</b> involving plutonium components in the modified-Richmond and steel _rch construction (SAC) magazines was undertaken in two complementary, but separate, steps. The first approach, generally termed deterministic, was to model the pits and containers in their most reactive configuration and then to estimate the effective multiplication factor (k°,) of the array for a number of postulated scenarios. The second approach involved a structured examination of the potential for a <b>criticality</b> <b>incident.</b> This approach examines the conditions required for criticality and the likelihood that those conditions could be met. These two approaches are discussed below. A calculations were made by one analyst and verified by a second analyst as a quality assurance measure. E. 1 Deterministic Model In this approach, the initial step involved developing a conservative physical model of the packages and facility to be studied. This model was then converted to an analytical model and estimates of k., were generated for several scenarios. E. 1. 1 Physical Model The initial model selected represents the most reactive configuration of plutonium pits and containers that could be stored on a interim basis in the magazine. That is, each pit is assumed to have the largest mass and smallest volume that might be anticipated and to reside in the container of smallest volume. The maximum allowable number of containers is assumed to be in the magazine. I The pits are modeled as a spherical shell of plutonium with an assumed mass of 6. 5 kilograms (kg). The pit is assumed to be centered in the container. For modelling purposes, the Rocky Flats AL-R 8 package was selected. The smallest container of this series is the 2030, nominally a container with a 20 -inch diameter and a 30 -inch height. Actually, the 2030 is an 18 -gauge (0. 048 -inch thickness) steel can with a minimum inside diameter of 18. 12 inche...|$|E
40|$|Processing {{extremely}} {{radioactive materials}} {{for nuclear weapons}} is accomplished at Savannah River in chemical separations facilities called “canyons”. These large, remotely operated, heavily shielded facilities were constructed early in the Cold War to provide raw material, initially plutonium- 239, for the U. S. nuclear arsenal. As the chemical separations processes developed and matured, these canyons showed a versatility not in their original scope. They were used to process a variety of materials in ways not envisioned by the original designers. With some renovation or revision, these facilities {{have been used to}} support the needs of the United States for other radioactive materials. Savannah River canyon facilities provided the raw material, neptunium- 237, which was irradiated at the Savannah River Plant (SRP) to produce plutonium- 238 used to power U. S. space probes that go where solar panels are too weak to suffice. Though almost 50 years old, the canyon facilities still function well, a real tribute to the original design-ers, builders, and the subsequent remodelers. Significantly, they have also operated without a nuclear <b>criticality</b> <b>incident...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Handbook is to provide {{guidance}} on how to calculate the characteristics of releases of radioactive materials and/or hazardous chemicals from nonreactor nuclear facilities. In addition, the Handbook provides guidance on how to calculate the consequences of those releases. There are four major chapters: Hazard Evaluation and Scenario Development; Source Term Determination; Transport Within Containment/Confinement; and Atmospheric Dispersion and Consequences Modeling. These chapters are supported by Appendices, including: a summary of chemical and nuclear information that contains descriptions of various fuel cycle facilities; details on how to calculate the characteristics of source terms for releases of hazardous chemicals; a comparison of NRC, EPA, and OSHA programs that address chemical safety; {{a summary of the}} performance of HEPA and other filters; and a discussion of uncertainties. Several sample problems are presented: a free-fall spill of powder, an explosion with radioactive release; a fire with radioactive release; filter failure; hydrogen fluoride release from a tankcar; a uranium hexafluoride cylinder rupture; a liquid spill in a vitrification plant; and a <b>criticality</b> <b>incident.</b> Finally, this Handbook includes a computer model, LPF No. 1 B, that is intended for use in calculating Leak Path Factors. A list of contributors to the Handbook is presented in Chapter 6. 39 figs., 35 tabs...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{criticality}} safety, {{commissioned by the}} U. S. Department of Energy, was conducted by Scientech Inc. at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility. The study concluded that human performance is the driving factor {{in the risk of}} an inadvertent <b>criticality</b> <b>incident</b> at the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP). A study of the infractions which have occurred at this facility bears this point out. A human factors team was established to identify a means of reducing human error in every day operations. The team determined that the posted instructions near each work area are key to operators having a clear understanding of operating requirements. An evaluation of the posted instructions revealed that they were very complex, required operators to monitor multiple parameters, and resulted in the operators ’ attention being divided between operational tasks and the task of monitoring nuclear safety parameters. Alternative graphics, textual, and graphics and textual formats combined with color coding were developed to improve comprehensibility, understandability, controllability, and usability in the Job Performance Aids (JPAs). Results of field tests of the different formats provide clear indication that operators prefer short, concise textual statements summarizing important information over both other formats. Although operators indicated interest in the graphics formats, the magnitude of change in presentation techniques and the generalizability of the icons argued against their immediate use. Issues in the development of candidate JPAs and other usability requirements are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{were performed to}} examine the environmental behavior of hafnium and its utility as a neutron poison for the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium in Yucca Mountain. The hydrolysis of hafnium was investigated by potentiometric titration in solutions of varying ionic strength to determine the stability constants {{for the first four}} monomeric hydrolysis products. The specific ion interaction theory is used to extrapolate these results to infinite dilution. The solubility of hafnium hydroxide and a meta-stable hafnium carbonate solid phase are studied via solubility experiments using ICP-AES. An upper bound for the stability constant of the first carbonate complex is determined. The solubility of hafnium oxide is investigated via solubility experiments using neutron activation analysis, which is also used to investigate the complexation of hafnium by silicates. (cont.) The potential for a near field <b>criticality</b> <b>incident</b> resulting from the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium at Yucca Mountain is examined using two integrated chemistry and transport models, which are then fed into an MCNP model of the near field at the Yucca Mountain repository. These models are used to predict the effective neutron multiplication factor for the system as the waste package degrades over time. Using the integrated degradation and criticality models, the long term criticality behavior of the proposed WGPu host phase ceramic is examined, as well as the utility of hafnium as a criticality control element for the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium. by Gary S.

40|$|The uranium <b>criticality</b> <b>incident</b> at a JCO {{plant in}} 1999 was Japan’s worst-ever nuclear {{accident}} (INES Level 4). Sixty-nine persons {{were exposed to}} radiation, and of those two died. SMM, JCO’s holding company, paid out about 11 million dollars in compensation to people and companies in the affected area. The direct cause of the accident was very clear: use of an illegal new process to improve productivity {{in the manufacture of}} nuclear fuel allowed the uranium concentration to reach criticality. JCO had a license that allowed it to handle uranium solutions up to 20 % in concentration, and all processes and tools used to produce nuclear fuel were prescribed in detail so as to prevent criticality by STA, the competent authority. JCO successfully developed and introduced an easier production process without obtaining permission from the STA. After a yet more efficient process was introduced, following only a very cursory check by a qualified JCO engineer, the accident occurred. The authors analyze this accident from a RM (Risk Management) viewpoint based on a MPM (Mathematical Planning Method) using released data pertaining to the accident. The authors first explain the MPM in brief, propose a matrix method of modeling, and then describe the results of simulating the JCO accident. It becomes clear that, even with imprecise and rather limited data, the proposed risk management method is applicable. The authors conclude that, beyond serious human error, there were many causes of the JCO accident. These could be described as the ‘overall circumstances’, and the important ones were administrative inflexibility, the fear of nuclear reaction, and recession in the Japanese economy. The latter was the most powerful influence...|$|E
