25|$|An {{accident}} {{affecting the}} particular Trident operating as BE 548 had occurred on 3 July 1968. Due to a <b>control</b> <b>failure,</b> an Airspeed Ambassador freight aircraft, G-AMAD, deviated from the runway on landing at Heathrow and struck G-ARPI and its neighbouring sister aircraft, G-ARPT, {{while they were}} parked unoccupied near Terminal 1, resulting in six fatalities from the freighter's eight occupants. G-ARPT was cut in two and was damaged beyond economic repair; G-ARPI lost its tail fin, which was repaired {{at a cost of}} £750,000. G-ARPI performed satisfactorily thereafter; the incident is thought to have had no bearing on its subsequent crash.|$|E

2500|$|The Egyptian report {{suggested}} several <b>control</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios {{as possible}} {{causes of the}} crash, focusing on a possible failure {{of one of the}} right elevator's power control units. While the NTSB's report did not determine a specific reason for the relief first officer's alleged actions, their report stated the impact was [...] "a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs". Supporting its deliberate-act conclusion, the NTSB report determined that no mechanical failure scenario could result in aircraft movements that matched those recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR), and that even had any of the failure scenarios put forward by the Egyptian authorities occurred, the aircraft would still have been recoverable because of the 767's redundant elevator control system.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia was {{destroyed}} at about 09:00 EST on February 1, 2003 while re-entering the atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{determined that a}} hole was punctured in the leading edge on one of Columbia's wings, made of a carbon composite. The hole had formed when a piece of insulating foam from the external fuel tank peeled off during the launch 16 days earlier and struck the shuttle's left wing. During the intense heat of re-entry, hot gases penetrated {{the interior of the}} wing, likely compromising the hydraulic system and leading to <b>control</b> <b>failure</b> of the control surfaces. [...] The resulting loss of control exposed minimally protected areas of the orbiter to full-entry heating and dynamic pressures that eventually led to vehicle break up. [...] The nearly 84,000 pieces of collected debris of the vessel are stored in a 16th floor office suite in the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center. The collection was opened to the media once and has since been open only to researchers. Unlike Challenger, which had a replacement orbiter built, Columbia did not.|$|E
