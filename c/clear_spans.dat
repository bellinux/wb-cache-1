25|$|This {{middle section}} stood on six arches, while both sides had smaller arches (one {{on the right}} and two on the left) which served as spillways in case the river overflowed. At its normal level, the river flowed between the three central arches, {{constrained}} by double-wedge-shaped reinforcements of masonry, placed at the two outer pillars and intended to prevent their undermining by the river. These masonry structures were - according to the archaeological record - markedly higher on the upstream side (8.15m) than on the downstream (4.76m). In addition, wedge-shaped breakwaters were added on the piers, although not all piers feature them on both sides. The <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> of the three central arches have been determined at 23.52m for the central arch and 14.95m for the two flanking arches, while the two piers supporting the central arch were measured at 9.60m.|$|E

An innovative curved screen system is used to enhance security and the appearance of the structure creating a visually appealing experience for pedestrians and bicyclists using the bridge. The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state. The city of Des Moines recently relit the bridges with LED lighting.|$|E
2500|$|The Flushing Meadows Corona Park Natatorium and Ice Rink, {{also known}} as the Flushing Meadows Corona Park Pool and Rink, is a [...] {{facility}} housing an Olympic-sized pool and an NHL-standard rink. Located inside the historic Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, site of the world’s fair in 1939 and 1964, the public facility caters to all New York City residents. [...] Built in 2008, the $66.3 million project is the first indoor public pool to open in New York City in four decades. Initially, the building was intended to serve as the venue for water polo events during the 2012 Summer Olympics, but when NYC's bid was lost to London, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation proceeded to build the pool anyway. [...] The result is an innovative building with 130-foot-high twin masts and a swooping roof form. The masts are an architectural feature extending up into the Queens skyline as well as the structural supports for the cable-stayed roof. [...] This design provides the <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> necessary to house an Olympic swimming pool along with an ice skating rink.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clear</b> <b>span</b> {{refers to}} the {{internal}} construction. <b>Clear</b> <b>span</b> steel buildings utilize large overhead support beams, thus reducing the need for internal supporting columns. <b>Clear</b> <b>span</b> steel buildings {{tend to be less}} cost efficient than structures with interior columns. However, other practical considerations may influence the selection of framing style such as an occupancy where interior structural obstructions are undesirable (e.g. aircraft hangars or sport arenas).|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} 1445.5 ft long between abutments, and {{is made up}} of 14 arches, 11 of which have a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of 90.75 ft and 3 with a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of 85.92 ft ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{common types}} of steel {{buildings}} are [...] "straight-walled" [...] and [...] "arch," [...] or Nissen or Quonset hut. Further, the structural type may be classed as <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> or multiple <b>span.</b> A <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> building does not have structural supports (e.g. columns) in the interior occupied space.|$|R
2500|$|The {{programmatic}} {{requirements of}} this complex shaped decisions about structure and materials. Designing the structural system and cable-stayed roof was a feat for Geiger Engineers. The structural engineers developed this structural envelope {{due to the}} necessity for a clear span- limiting chlorine from damaging building materials. A clear spanned space {{proved to be the}} solution that answered the need for minimal maintenance and avoidance of damage to structural elements. The engineers chose to place the pool and rink end-to–end, so that they would serve, structurally speaking as counterweights of a seesaw. At the midpoint are the “linchpins”: the two 130-foot masts from which the roof is suspended. [...] The masts are composed of 1-¼” plates that are stacked at the junction of the pool and rink. The masts are designed so that as they soar through the roof, the diameter narrows to accommodate lateral movement. [...] In order to support the 120-foot-by-230-foot <b>clear</b> <b>spans,</b> twelve cables were extended from each mast to specific connection points on the roof. The twelve 3-inch diameter A586 strand cables are critical elements in connecting the masts to the roof. To keep the roof from lifting, the roof is decked in concrete planks that counteract windloads. The concrete planks sit on longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the envelope.|$|E

The building was designed to accommodate 40,000 passengers and 1,700 buses a day and included a complex brief of a bus station, with car park over, topped by a three-storey office block (Greyfriars House).

50|$|The {{approach}} to the ramp is 42 m long and 6.55 - 6.80 m wide. The <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> of its two segmental arches are 6.95 m and 7.40 m, which corresponds to a span-to-rise ratio of 4.0 and 3.3 to 1 respectively. The accurately fitting inclined contact surface of the springings clearly proves the Roman origin of these arches. With an extraordinary width of 1.20 m, the voussoirs appear oversized {{in relation to the}} span (arch slenderness of 1:5.8 and 6.2 respectively). In contrast, the two surviving bridge arches no. 1 and 3 are instable substitutions, made of carelessly laid rubble. The date of these arches is unknown, as with all other repairs; possibly they were built in the period of the Knights Templar.|$|E
5000|$|The Swiftwater Covered Bridge is a {{historic}} covered bridge which carries Valley Road over the Wild Ammonoosuc River in Bath, New Hampshire. The bridge, the fourth on the site, was built in 1849, and is a locally distinctive single-span Paddleford truss design, with laminated arches and steel beam reinforcements added in the 20th century. The bridge has an overall length of 173'8" [...] and two <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> of 77'6" [...] and 57'6". The roadbed is 14'6" [...] wide, with a vertical clearance of 12'9". It rests on lightly-mortared split granite abutments topped with concrete footings. The roof is made of corrugated metal, and the sides are sheathed in vertical planking to a height of eight feet.
