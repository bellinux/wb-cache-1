One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> places it {{beyond the reach of}} most residents of Antananarivo.

25|$|One {{reason the}} high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> yields disappointing results is because only 0.05 percent {{of health care}} dollars are spent on {{assessing}} how well new health care technology works.

25|$|The PPACA {{instituted a}} number of {{measures}} to control Medicare fraud and abuse, such as longer oversight periods, provider screenings, stronger standards for certain providers, the creation of databases to share data between federal and state agencies, and stiffer penalties for violators.

25|$|Just {{less than}} 9% of the {{population}} purchases individual health care insurance. Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a deductible), or {{a small part of}} the cost of every procedure (a copayment). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.|$|E

25|$|Medicare {{differs from}} private {{insurance}} available to working Americans {{in that it}} is a social insurance program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, Medicare is a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to guarantee health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the enormous, unpredictable <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.|$|E
25|$|Retirement of the Baby Boom generation—which by 2030 is {{projected}} to increase enrollment to more than 80 million {{as the number of}} workers per enrollee declines from 3.7 to 2.4—and rising overall health care costs pose substantial financial challenges to the program. Medicare spending {{is projected}} to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to just over $1 trillion by 2022. Baby-boomers' health is also an important factor: 20% have five or more chronic conditions, which will add to the future <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> (www.cms.gov, 2012). In response to these financial challenges, Congress made substantial cuts to future payouts to providers as part of PPACA in 2010 and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and policymakers have offered a number of additional competing proposals to reduce Medicare costs further.|$|E
25|$|Two {{distinct}} premium {{support systems}} {{have recently been}} proposed in Congress to control the cost of Medicare. The House Republicans’ 2012 budget would have abolished traditional Medicare and required the eligible population to purchase private insurance with a newly created premium support program. This plan would have cut the cost of Medicare by capping {{the value of the}} voucher and tying its growth to inflation, which is expected to be lower than rising health costs, saving roughly $155 billion over 10 years. Paul Ryan, the plan’s author, claimed that competition would drive down costs, but the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the plan would dramatically raise the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> with all of the additional costs falling on enrollees. The CBO found that under the plan, typical 65-year-olds would go from paying 35 percent of their health care costs to paying 68 percent by 2030.|$|E

25|$|The high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the United States is {{attributed}} variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than {{people in other}} countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from {{the full cost of}} treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private insurers and drug companies. Government plans often pay less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the privately insured through higher prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{pension benefit}} is not {{insignificant}} {{because it is}} estimated to cost 25% of salary over the entire 25-year period to fund a pension benefit of half the salary at age 55 for someone who starts employment at age 30. While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. The key point to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent of salary for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% of salary annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse mortality table, the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut. Citing the rising <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> the MTA wanted new employees to contribute 1% of their salary to pay for health insurance.

40|$|Background: The Dutch {{population}} is ageing. In many older people, {{a decline in}} health is seen within different health domains. This decline can lead to disability, which is associated with high <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs. The general practitioner (GP) {{plays a key role}} in the care for older people, but many problems are often unnoticed. To aim for a more proactive approach of primary care for the older population, the study Integrated Systematic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) was set up. A structural monitoring system was used to detect the deterioration in somatic, functional, mental or social <b>health</b> <b>of</b> individuals aged 75 years and over, followed by the execution of a care plan for those people with a combination of problems. The aim of the present study was to investigate the difference in <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> use from the participants one year before the start of ISCOPE compared to one year after the start of ISCOPE. Furthermore, we investigated within a group of participants with complex problems, whether a care plan influences the use and <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Methods: This economic evaluation was conducted within 10 general practices of the cluster randomized innovation trial ISCOPE. Within the 10 practices there were 2245 candidates of which 66 % was willing to participate. 37 % of the people willing to participate was visited at home (n= 544). After 12 months, 460 participants were visited again whereby the baseline questions were repeated. Out of the 460 participants, 220 were having complex problems. For 59 of the 220 participants, an individual care plan was made (intervention group). To evaluate the use and <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> we included GP care, home care, institutional admissions, day care and day treatment. Mean <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> per person were calculated within the different groups and compared to each other in order to calculate the mean differences per person between the groups, using paired samples and independent samples t-tests. Data were compared one year before the start of ISCOPE to one year after the start of ISCOPE. Results: The mean age of the participants was 81. 4 years and 66. 1 % was female. In the group of all participants, mean <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> increased € 2220 per person over one year (p< 0. 001). Main cost drivers are home care (nursing & household) and care home admissions. In the group of participants with complex problems, the mean <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> increased € 1035 per person in the intervention group (p= 0. 594), while the costs in the usual care group increased € 3604 (p= 0. 013). A mean difference of increase between the two groups of € 2569 (p= 0. 282) was calculated. Conclusion: Mean total <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> increase yearly in the overall study population. However, the results suggest that a care plan can save an amount of € 2500 per person yearly in the group of participants with complex problems. ...|$|R
