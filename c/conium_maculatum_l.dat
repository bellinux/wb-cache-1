40|$|Abstract: The steroid {{content of}} <b>Conium</b> <b>maculatum</b> <b>L.</b> (poison hemlock), Apiaceae, a {{well-known}} weed plant species, was studied herein {{for the first}} time. This was achieved by detailed GC–MS analyses of twenty two samples (dichloromethane extracts of different plant organs of C. maculatum at three or four different stages of phenological development, collected from three locations). In total, twenty four different steroids were identified. Six steroids had an ergostane nucleus while the other ones possessed a stigmastane carbon framework. The identity of these compounds was determined by spectral means (MS fragmentation), GC co-injec-tions with authentic standards and chemical transformation (silylation). Steroid compounds were noted {{to be the main}} chemical constituents of root extracts (up to 70 %) of this plant species in the last phase of development. The predominant ones were stigmasta- 5, 22 -dien- 3 β-ol (stigmasterol) and stigmast- 5 -en- 3 β-ol (β-sitoste-rol). In an attempt to classify the samples, principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) were performed using steroid percen-tages as variables...|$|E
40|$|Coniine, a polyketide-derived alkaloid, is {{poisonous}} {{to humans}} and animals. It is a {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} antagonist, which leads to inhibition of the nervous system, eventually causing death by suffocation in mammals. Coniine’s most famous victim is Socrates who {{was sentenced to death}} by poison chalice containing poison hemlock in 399 BC. In chemistry, coniine holds two historical records: It is the first alkaloid the chemical structure of which was established (in 1881), and that was chemically synthesized (in 1886). In plants, coniine and twelve closely related alkaloids are known from poison hemlock (<b>Conium</b> <b>maculatum</b> <b>L.),</b> and several Sarracenia and Aloe species. Recent work confirmed its biosynthetic polyketide origin. Biosynthesis commences by carbon backbone formation from butyryl-CoA and two malonyl-CoA building blocks catalyzed by polyketide synthase. A transamination reaction incorporates nitrogen from l-alanine and non-enzymatic cyclization leads to γ-coniceine, the first hemlock alkaloid in the pathway. Ultimately, reduction of γ-coniceine to coniine is facilitated by NADPH-dependent γ-coniceine reductase. Although coniine is notorious for its toxicity, there is no consensus on its ecological roles, especially in the carnivorous pitcher plants where it occurs. Lately there has been renewed interest in coniine’s medical uses particularly for pain relief without an addictive side effect...|$|E

40|$|Host plant {{selection}} by ovipositing females is a {{key process}} determining the success of phytophagous insects. In oligophagous lepidopterans, host-specific plant secondary chemicals {{are expected to be}} dominant factors governing oviposition behavior; distinctive compounds can serve as high-contrast signals that clearly differentiate confamilial hosts from non-hosts increasing the accuracy of host quality evaluation. Agonopterix alstroemeriana (Clerk) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae) and <b>Conium</b> <b>maculatum</b> <b>L.</b> (Apiaceae) form an extremely specialized plant-herbivore system, with A. alstroemeriana monophagous on C. maculatum, a plant with few other insect herbivores at least in part due to its virtually unique capacity among plants to produce piperidine alkaloids. Here we have studied the response of A. alstroemeriana oviposition to unique host plant secondary metabolites, piperidine alkaloids, and widespread compounds, mono- and sesquiterpenes, in a concentration-dependent fashion. Rates of oviposition were negatively correlated with Z-ocimene concentrations. To confirm the deterrent properties of this monoterpene for A. alstroemeriana oviposition, we conducted a choice experiment using artificially damaged C. maculatum plants, with higher emission of volatiles, and undamaged control plants. Damaged plants were less preferred as oviposition sites compared to the controls. The lack of association between oviposition and piperidine alkaloids, defenses unique to Conium species, suggests that quantitative changes of these species-specific chemicals do not play a predominant role in host selection by the monophagous A. alstroemeriana...|$|E
40|$|Coniine is an {{optically}} active toxic piperidine alkaloid and nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} (nAChR) agonist found in poison hemlock (<b>Conium</b> <b>maculatum</b> <b>L.).</b> Coniine teratogenicity is hypothesized to be attributable to the binding, activation, and prolonged de-sensitization of fetal muscle-type nAChR, which results in the complete inhibition of fetal movement. However, pharmacological evidence of coniine actions at fetal muscle-type nAChR is lacking. The present study compared (2) -coniine, (1) -coniine, and nicotine for the ability to inhibit fetal movement in a day 40 pregnant goat model and in TE- 671 cells that express fetal muscle-type nAChR. Furthermore, a-conotoxins (CTx) EI and GI were used to antagonize the actions of (1) - and (2) -coniine in TE- 671 cells. (2) -Coniine was more effective at eliciting electrical changes in TE- 671 cells and inhibiting fetal movement than was (1) -coniine, suggesting stereoselectivity by the receptor. The pyridine alkaloid nicotine did not inhibit fetal movement in a day 40 pregnant goat model, suggesting agonist specificity for the inhibition of fetal movement. Low concentrations of both CTxs potentiated the TE- 671 cell response and higher concentrations of CTx EI, and GI antagonized the actions of both coniine enantiomers demon-strating concentration-dependent coagonism and selective an-tagonism. These results provide pharmacological evidence that the piperidine alkaloid coniine is acting at fetal muscle-type nAChR in a concentration-dependent manner...|$|E

Material was collected in the years 2002 and 2003 on two different habitats. The first one was on a field after sugar beet and maize as preceding crops, the second one was an adjacent balk. The mass of seeds was estimated in ten replications (100 achenes each). Thereafter the achenes were weighed on an analytical scales. The germinative capacity was assessed under different conditions of germination. Altogether there were 8 variants of germination conditions in 10 replications (20 achenes each). The first and the last evaluation were performed on the 9 th and 30 th day of the experiment, respectively.

The aim of this thesis was to elaborate survey of poison hemlock occurrence on arable lands and also within plant communities around field margin in the Middle Bohemia. The study was carried on {{with the use of}} GPS navigation (Garmin Etrex 30, Garmin Ltd., USA). Each spot of occurrence was determined by visual recognition in slowly moving car (30 - 40 km/h).

40|$|<b>Conium</b> <b>maculatum</b> <b>L.</b> (Apiaceae), or poison hemlock, is an {{invasive}} plant {{native to}} Europe {{that has become}} extensively naturalized throughout North America. This species contains piperidine alkaloids, including coniine and -coniceine, that are highly toxic to vertebrates. C. maculatum was relatively free from herbivores in North America until the accidental introduction 30 yr ago of its monophagous European associate Agonopterix alstroemeriana (Clerck) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae). At present, A. alstroemeriana is widespread across the United States, and in some areas, such as the Northwest, can inßict substantial damage on its host plant, leading to desiccation and death. A. alstroemeriana {{has been used in}} recent years for the biological control of C. maculatum, although its use has been limited by the availability of larvae, which are Þeld-collected from early to mid-spring, and by the lack of available information about its life history and feeding habits. Here we describe a laboratory-rearing protocol incorporating a simulated winter to induce diapause and a semideÞned artiÞcial diet that allows the production of multiple generations per year and enabled us to determine the number and duration of A. alstroemeriana developmental stages. The development of the artiÞcial diet also permitted studies of preference and performance of A. alstroemeriana in relation to hostplant chemistry. Rearing A. alstroemeriana on artiÞcial diet supplemented with 1. 5 % DW coniine had no adverse impact on ultimate instar growth or performance. In a feeding behavior assay, the presence of coniine in the diet increased A. alstroemeriana consumption three-fold relative to control diet. This behavioral response contrasts dramatically with that of Agonopterix clemensella, a native Apiaceae specialist that does not use C. maculatum as a host; of 30 larvae tested, 29 fed exclusively on diets lacking supplemental coniine. The rearing protocol and artiÞcial diet presented here can facilitate further studies of ecological and evolutionary responses of C. maculatum after its reassociation with a coevolved herbivore in North America...|$|E
