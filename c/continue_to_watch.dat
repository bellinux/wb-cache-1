5|$|Earwigs {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many earwig species display {{maternal}} care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.|$|E

500|$|Producers Pinkner and Wyman {{also were}} {{excited about the}} move to Fridays, {{considering}} the slot as [...] "open territory that can be conquered" [...] and that they [...] "can actually deliver like The X-Files did". Series creator Abrams was less optimistic of the move to Friday nights, aware that the show's likelihood to be renewed for a fourth season would be highly dependent {{on the number of}} niche viewers that <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the show. Abrams did affirm that moving to Friday nights allows them to take more creative freedoms to maintain viewership in the new timeslot, but feels that if the show was not renewed for another season, they would be [...] "hard pressed" [...] to resolve the story {{by the end of the}} third season.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{served as}} an {{executive}} producer on the CW comedy-drama Hellcats based on journalist Kate Torgovnick's book Cheer: Inside the Secret World of College Cheerleaders. [...] The series first aired on The CW beginning {{in the fall of}} 2010, and was cancelled on May 17, 2011. It is currently available to watch for free on CW Seed, CW's digital programming. According to Welling, he states that the reason of cancellation was due to the change of CW president of entertainment from Dawn Ostroff to Mark Pedowitz. He also said that there was a possibility of a reboot of the series with a new cast and cameos from the previous cast if enough fans <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the original series on CW Seed.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{traditional}} beliefs of many Malagasy ethnic groups, one attains the status of [...] "ancestor" [...] after death. [...] It is often believed that ancestors <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over and shape events on Earth and can intervene on behalf of (or interfere with) the living. [...] As a consequence, ancestors are to be revered: prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common, {{as well as the}} observation of the local fady (taboos) the ancestors may have established in life. Gestures of respect, such as throwing the first capful of a new bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to share it with the ancestors, are practiced throughout the island. The most visible emblem of the respect due to ancestors is the construction of the elaborate family tombs that dot the countryside in much of Madagascar.|$|E

500|$|Daran Little wrote Babe's final episode and Badland said he [...] "really relished and {{summed up}} what [...] was about." [...] She added {{that she was}} [...] "so grateful" [...] for the storyline and {{described}} her departure episode as [...] "complex, moving, wretched". She described Babe as [...] "vengeful", [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "a bit of a witch". Badland {{expressed an interest in}} reprising the role and said a potential return had been allowed for, before adding that she believes Babe will return. Badland said she would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the show as her on-screen family [...] "are all part of [...] now" [...] and she [...] "will always be their auntie." [...] She described the Carter family as the highlight during her time on the show. She added, [...] "We all came together and formed this brilliant family which is pretty astounding – we are all very different but that bond that brought us all together was extraordinary." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's main theme {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "universal and timeless, but also specific and personal: growing up and dealing with change." [...] The episode makes it clear that Stan's pre-adolescent battle with cynicism is not necessarily representative of all [...] "tweens"; one reviewer described the character's problem as more common to depression. The episode also mocks how [...] "cynical culture breeds cynical audiences," [...] typified in the [...] "contemptuous trailers" [...] for predictable films during the scene set at the cinema, which often end with the insult [...] "Fuck you!" [...] Sean O'Neal, in the episode's review at The A.V. Club, linked the episode's theme to modern culture: [...] "The Internet has turned nearly everyone into a cynic." [...] Time reviewer James Poniewozik disagreed with his assessment, but did note that [...] "there's definitely an argument that the instant dissection of all experience online encourages a kind of protective dismissiveness." [...] The episode was also interpreted as a satire of immediate online responses from fans, who criticize South Park as stale but <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> regardless.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the raised alarm, the militiamen of Concord and Lincoln had mustered in Concord. They received reports of firing at Lexington, and were not sure whether to wait until they could be reinforced by troops from towns nearby, or to stay and defend the town, or to move east and greet the British Army from superior terrain. [...] A column of militia marched down the road toward Lexington to meet the British, traveling about [...] until they met the approaching column of regulars. [...] As the regulars numbered about 700 and the militia at this time only numbered about 250, the militia column turned around and marched back into Concord, preceding the regulars by {{a distance of about}} [...] [...] The militia retreated to a ridge overlooking the town, and their officers discussed what to do next. Caution prevailed, and Colonel James Barrett withdrew from the town of Concord and led the men across the North Bridge to a hill about a mile north of town, where they could <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the troop movements of the British and the activities in the center of town. [...] This step proved fortuitous, as the ranks of the militia continued to grow as minuteman companies arriving from the western towns joined them there.|$|E

500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E

60|$|The {{chairman}} {{then went}} on to say that the event to which he had referred--the rescue of the crew and passengers of the Wellington on the night of the great storm--had been eclipsed by some of the more recent doings of the same boat; and, after touching upon some of these, said that, although they had met there to do honour to the crews of their own lifeboat, they must not forget other and neighbouring lifeboats, which did their work nobly--the brave crews of which were represented by the coxswains of the Margate and Broadstairs lifeboats, who sat at that board that night as honoured guests (loud cheers, during which several of the men nearest to them shook hands with the coxswains referred to). He could not--the chairman went on to say--sit down without making special reference to the steam-tug, without which, and the courage as well as knowledge of her master, mate, and crew (renewed cheers), the lifeboat could not overtake a tenth part of the noble work which she annually accomplished. He concluded by praying that a kind Providence would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over and bless the Ramsgate lifeboat and her crew.|$|E
60|$|Deronda {{was rather}} {{disappointed}} at this answer; {{he had wanted}} a confirmation of his own judgment, {{and he began to}} put in demurrers. The argument about the mother would not apply to the brother; and Mrs. Meyrick admitted that the brother might be an ugly likeness of the father. Then, as to advertising, if the name was Cohen, you might as well advertise for two undescribed terriers; and here Mrs. Meyrick helped him, for the idea of an advertisement, already mentioned to Mirah, had roused the poor child's terror; she was convinced that her father would see it--he saw everything in the papers. Certainly there were safer means than advertising; men might be set to work whose business it was to find missing persons; but Deronda wished Mrs. Meyrick to feel with him that it would be wiser to wait, before seeking a dubious--perhaps a deplorable result; especially as he was engaged to go abroad the next week for a couple of months. If a search were made, he would like to be at hand, so that Mrs. Meyrick might not be unaided in meeting any consequences--supposing that she would generously <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over Mirah.|$|E
