5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more <b>constituents,</b> <b>and</b> {{the fact that there}} are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reranking approach to combining <b>constituent</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing, {{aimed at improving}} parsing performance on both sides. Most previous combination methods rely on complicated joint decoding to integrate graph- and transition-based dependency models. Instead, our approach makes use of a high-performance probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) model to output k-best candidate <b>constituent</b> trees, <b>and</b> then a dependency parsing model to rerank the trees by their scores from both models, so as {{to get the most}} probable parse. Experimental results show that this reranking approach achieves the highest accuracy of <b>constituent</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing on Chinese treebank (CTB 5. 1) and a comparable performance to {{the state of the art}} on English treebank (WSJ) ...|$|R
