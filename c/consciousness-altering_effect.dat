The latter, written by Poole, [...] "has a skip in its step and a rumbling and forceful bassline that somehow couldn't be poppier if it was covered in glitter," [...] and features a string arrangement written by Tim Smith. [...] "Wireless" [...] was described {{as one of the}} [...] "most beautiful" [...] tracks on the album, is Smith's re-imagining of Faust's song [...] "Psalter", also known as 'Lauft... Heisst Das es Lauft Oder es Kommt Bald... Lauft', but performed primarily on piano and scissor-wielding percussive ensemble that ends with Smith reading a [...] "bizarre aquatic-themed children's story." [...] Jim and Jane Smith added snipping sounds with garden tools to the song. [...] "Dirty Boy", which opens the second disc, is [...] "perhaps the album's crowning achievement" [...] according to Kitching, beginning with a guitar riff and alchemically transmuting that song over the course of its nearly nine minutes duration with [...] "celestially ringing sounds" [...] constructed by [...] "innumerably overlaid strata of acoustic guitar and incredibly drawn out sustained vocals that when performed live had an undeniably <b>consciousness-altering</b> <b>effect</b> on all those present." [...] "Quiet as a Mouse", described as a [...] "weird piece", was described by Tim Smith as the sound of [...] "just somebody who left the tape running when we were doing these orchestral bits." [...] The band came across it [...] "kind of accidentally" [...] and enjoyed it enough to include it on the album. [...] "Odd Even" [...] is [...] "an airy dip into baroque pop incorporating lush string arrangements." ...|$|E
40|$|This article brings {{together}} three findings and ideas relevant for {{the understanding of}} human consciousness: (I) Crick's and Koch's theory that the claustrum is a conductor of consciousness center crucial for subjective conscious experience. (II) Subjective reports of the <b>consciousness-altering</b> <b>effects</b> the plant Salvia divinorum, whose primary active ingredient is salvinorin A, a -opioid receptor agonist. (III) The high density of -opioid receptors in the claustrum. Fact III suggests that the <b>consciousness-altering</b> <b>effects</b> of salvinorin A are due to a κ-opioid receptor mediated inhibition of primarily the claustrum and, additionally, the deep layers of the cortex, mainly in prefrontal areas. Consistent with Crick & Koch’s theory that the claustrum {{plays a key role}} in consciousness, our analysis of the subjective effects of Salvia divinorum finds that salvia disrupts certain facets of consciousness much more than the largely-serotonergic hallucinogen LSD. Based on this data and on the relevant literature, we suggest that the claustrum does indeed serve as a conductor for certain aspects of higher-order integration of brain activity, while integration of auditory and visual signals mostly relies on coordination by other areas including parietal cortex and the pulvinar...|$|R
25|$|Nitrous oxide, also {{sometimes}} known as laughing gas, is a legally available gas used for purposes that include anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, {{as well as}} food preparation and the fueling of rocket and racing engines. Substance abusers {{also sometimes}} use the gas as an inhalant. Like all other inhalants, it's popular because it provides <b>consciousness-altering</b> <b>effects</b> while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit or illegal drugs of abuse. Abuse of nitrous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation called hypoxia, brain damage, and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency {{that can lead to}} nerve damage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{claustrum}} is {{the region}} of the brain in which the KOR is most densely expressed. It has been proposed that this area, based on its structure and connectivity, has [...] "a role in coordinating a set of diverse brain functions", and the claustrum has been elucidated as playing a crucial role in consciousness. As examples, lesions of the claustrum in humans are associated with disruption of consciousness and cognition, and electrical stimulation of the area between the insula and the claustrum has been found to produce an immediate loss of consciousness in humans along with recovery of consciousness upon cessation of the stimulation. On the basis of the preceding knowledge, it has been proposed that inhibition of the claustrum (as well as, [...] "additionally, the deep layers of the cortex, mainly in prefrontal areas") by activation of KORs in these areas is primarily responsible for the profound consciousness-altering/dissociative hallucinogen effects of salvinorin A and other KOR agonists. In addition, it has been stated that [...] "the subjective effects of S. divinorum indicate that salvia disrupts certain facets of consciousness much more than the largely serotonergic hallucinogen LSD", and it has been postulated that inhibition of a brain area that is apparently as fundamentally involved in consciousness and higher cognitive function as the claustrum may explain this. However, these conclusions are merely tentative, as [...] "KORs are not exclusive to the claustrum; there is also a fairly high density of receptors located in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and putamen", and [...] "disruptions to other brain regions could also explain the <b>consciousness-altering</b> <b>effects</b> salvinorin A".|$|R
