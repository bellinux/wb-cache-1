5000|$|A {{motor vehicle}} {{in a public}} place is {{potentially}} a dangerous and lethal instrument. Even when it is without its engine or without petrol, if it is moved down on an incline even un intentionally it can cause considerable damage and human injury. Hence, unlike other properties which may be insured or not at the option of the owner, a motor vehicle is required by law to be insured in respect of the user's liability for death, bodily injury or damage to property of third party.This kind of insurance contract are based on indemnity and only cover the damage and not the whole insurance amount is given everytime. [...] As sometimes the driver of the vehicle is often a person of small means and injured person goes without adequate compensation, insurance of motor vehicle covering the third party risk is made compulsory in India and the Motor Vehicles Act provides that, vehicle should not be used in public place without having insurance policy covering third party risks. [...] Third party risk means risk covered for bodily injury, death and damage of property of third party. Third party means any person except owner or passenger in the private vehicle. So pillion rider of the motor cycle, passengers in private cars, jeeps etc. are not third party. [...] However, passengers in public vehicle such as bus. <b>contract</b> <b>carriage</b> vehicle, taxi etc. are also third party and hence covered by third party or statutory policy.|$|E
50|$|The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation was {{established}} by State Government of Maharashtra as per the provision in Section 3 of RTC Act 1950.The M.S.R.T.C is operating its services by the approved scheme of road transport published vide Notification MVA 3173/30303-XIIA dated 29.11.1973 in the official gazette.The area covered by the scheme is entire area of the State of Maharashtra. The undertaking is operating stage and <b>contract</b> <b>carriage</b> services in the entire area {{of the state of}} Maharashtra except S.T. undertaking defined under Section 68 A (b) of M. V. Act and other exception published in the scheme.The First bus was flagged off from the Pune to Ahmednagar in 1948.Tracing the history that saw this development, {{we go back to the}} 1920s, when various entrepreneurs started their operations in the public transport scenario. Till the Motor Vehicle Act came into being in 1939, there were no regulations monitoring their activities, and this resulted in arbitrary competition, unregulated fares.The implementation of the act rectified matters to an extent. The individual operators were asked to form a union on defined routes in a particular area. This also proved to be beneficial for travelers as some sort of schedule set in, with a time table, pick-up points, conductors, and fixed ticket prices. Thus continued the state of affairs till 1948, when the then Bombay State Government, with the late Morarji Desai as the home minister, started its own state road transport service, called State Transport Bombay. And the first blue and silver-topped bus took off from Pune to Ahmednagar.The driver and conductor used to wear khaki uniforms and peak caps. There were 10 makes of buses in use then - Chevrolet, Fort, Bedford, Seddon, Studebaker, Morris Commercial, Albion, Leyland, Commer and Fiat.In the early 1950s, two luxury coaches were also introduced with Morris Commercial Chassis. These were called Neelkamal and Giriyarohini and used to ply on the Pune-Mahableshwar route. They had two by two seats, curtains, interior decoration, a clock and green tinted glasses.|$|E

50|$|A <b>contract</b> of <b>carriage</b> is a <b>contract</b> {{between a}} carrier of goods or {{passengers}} and the consignor, consignee or passenger. <b>Contracts</b> of <b>carriage</b> typically define the rights, duties and liabilities of {{parties to the}} contract, addressing topics such as acts of God and including clauses such as force majeure. Among common carriers, they are usually evidenced by standard terms and conditions printed on the reverse of a ticket or carriage document.|$|R

If the consignee is suing on an implied <b>contract</b> of <b>carriage</b> or there is negligent carriage of goods, it is the physical carrier against whom action is brought.|$|R

40|$|A {{class action}} brought under the New York statute (modeled after Federal Rule 23 of Civil Procedure) is an {{appropriate}} procedural device for remedying the continual breaches of the commuter carriage contract. In Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Puritan Coal Mining Co., the Supreme Court held that the common law mandates that common carriers treat passengers reasonably. Additionally, in the <b>contract</b> <b>carriage,</b> the carrier impliedly guarantees that the vehicle is in sound and proper order. Individual suits, unfortunately, have {{little effect on the}} actions of the common carriers; only nominal damages have been awarded in commuter actions against railroads for equipment failure, unreasonably delays, and poor conditions. However, the class action remedy may be helpful to the consumer [...] and thus [...] the commuter. Article 9 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), which was changed in 1975, changed the class action statute in New York to provide a more flexible, functional scheme for certifying classes and to prescribe basic guidelines for judicial management of class actions. Courts have narrowly interpreted Article 9 of the CPLR, however, and this interpretation should be broadened to align with the article 2 ̆ 7 s legislative purpose...|$|E

40|$|The {{liability}} of the carrier in international {{carriage of goods}} is a classical issue, which is well known, but still actual. The increasing intensity of international trade has impact on the demand for the transport services. Different rules in different legal systems constitute a hindrance for a proper functioning of international transport services. Nowadays, this problem is well solved by the international conventions containing certain rules, regarding <b>contract</b> of <b>carriage</b> in international transport of goods. However, these conventions govern the <b>contract</b> of <b>carriage</b> only in particular mode of transport which {{is the reason why}} it is necessary to describe the {{liability of}} the carrier in all these particular modes of transport. The starting point of this thesis is to describe the applicable sets of rules, which can govern the <b>contract</b> of <b>carriage</b> in international transport. Today, the relation among these sets of rules can appear be genuinely complicated. The most crucial point seems {{to solve the problem of}} relation between the conventions containing certain rules regarding <b>contract</b> of <b>carriage</b> and the legislation of the EU.
