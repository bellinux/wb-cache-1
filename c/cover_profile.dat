A total of 28 % of the 158 women with a Facebook profile and being involved in a romantic relationship had their romantic partners on their CPP. As predicted, women with their partners on the CPP were more satisfied with their romantic relationship than others. Furthermore, women who did not have their partner on the CPP tended to conceal or lie in their displayed mating status suggesting that this may be a strategy how to attract another potential mate. The partner-directed violence and intrasexual competition hypotheses were not supported.

40|$|Understanding the {{hydrological}} {{controls on}} subsurface flow and transport is of considerable {{importance in the}} study of reclaimed landscapes in the oil sands region of Canada. A significant portion of the reclaimed landscape will be comprised of a thin veneer (~ 1 m) of clay-rich reclamation soil overlying saline-sodic shale overburden, which is a waste by-product from the mining process. The global objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the first-order controls on soil moisture and salt transport dynamics within clay-rich reclamation covers overlying low permeability waste substrates. The study site is located in a cold, semi-arid climate in the oil sands region of northern Alberta. Preferential flow was the dominant mechanism responsible for the development of perched water table conditions on the cover-waste interface during the spring snow melt. Hydrological and geochemical data indicated that snowmelt infiltration occurs via the macroporosity while the ground is still frozen. An isotope hydrograph separation conducted on water collected in a weeping tile confirmed the presence of fresh snowmelt water at the onset of subsurface flow. This water transitions to a chemical signature that is comprised of approximately 80 % connate pore water as a result of chemical equilibration between pore water in the soil matrix and fresh water in the macropores. Detailed mapping of the spatial distribution of soil moisture and salts within a reclamation cover indicated the lower-slope positions are wetter due to the accumulation surface run-off and frozen ground infiltration in spring. Increased soil moisture conditions in lower-slope positions accelerate salt ingress, while drier conditions in middle and upper-slope positions attenuate salt ingress. The data indicated that fresh snowmelt water is bypassing the soil matrix higher in the <b>cover</b> <b>profile.</b> Subsurface flow and deep percolation are key mechanisms mitigating vertical salt ingress in lower and upper slope positions. The mesotopography of the cover-waste interface imposes a direct control on the depth of perched water and the downslope routing of water. Undulations in the cover-waste interface cause the depth of perched water to vary considerably (± 20 – 60 cm) over short distances (< 5 m), while saturated subsurface flow is routed through the lowest elevations in the <b>cover</b> <b>profile.</b> A numerical analysis of subsurface flow was able to simulate both the discharge rate and cumulative volume of flow to a weeping tile. Composite hydraulic functions were used in the simulations to account for the increased hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity created by the macroporosity at near-saturated conditions. The transient Na+ concentration of discharge water was modelled using the concept of an equivalent porous medium. The good match between measured and modelled data verified the conceptual model, which contends that saturated subsurface flow is dominated by the fracture network and that the concentration of discharge water is function of the depth of perched water. Finally, the results from this study suggest the mesotopography of the cover-waste interface could be used to manage ‘excess’ water and salts within the landscape...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics {{of snow in}} {{semi-arid}} {{mountains are}} poorly investigated {{despite the fact that}} snow may represent an important source of water for downstream populations especially in the spring and early summer. Data acquired by space-borne optical sensors (i. e. reflectance and derived snow indices) may be suitable for spatial and temporal monitoring of snow cover. However, due to prevailing terrain and climatic conditions, the use of satellite sensor data to monitor snow dynamics is not trivial over such regions. Snowfall as well as precipitation are characterized by strong space–time variability. Indeed snow can fall and melt within one week. Under such conditions, appropriate monitoring of snow dynamics requires space instruments that provide data with high spatial and high temporal resolutions. In this context we developed a new approach based on the combination of two types of instruments: low spatial and high temporal resolution (Syste`me Probatoire de l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) - VEGETATION) and high spatial and low temporal resolution (Landsat Thematic Mapper). This new approach improves the relationship between snow index and snow area. The method is validated against snow maps derived from classification of high spatial resolution data on the Atlas range, in Morocco. It is then applied to a one-year series of SPOT- 4 VEGETATION images allowing to derive a temporal snow <b>cover</b> <b>profile</b> at 1 km spatial resolution over the entire Atlas.

40|$|The {{application}} of satellite images for land cover mapping in Australia has achieved formidable developments {{in recent years}} as a result of increased data availability and improvements in software/hardware. However, the lack of standardization in land cover products creates considerable difficulty when integrating these land cover maps. To address this issue, this study investigated FAO’s land cover classification system (LCCS) to map the Brisbane and Gold Coast region, as representatives of the Australian urban landscape. The surface diversification of this region in Southeast Queensland offers a reasonable land <b>cover</b> <b>profile</b> {{that could be used to}} explain most of populated Australian coastal regions. SPOT 10 m satellite data supported by extensive field investigations and 2. 5 m very high resolution SPOT data were utilized for the classification. The SLATS 2001 - 2003 (State-wide Land cover and Trees Study) data were also used in identifying training sites and for preparing legend categories. Initially, SPOT 10 m Image was classified into three levels (dichotomous phase) of the FAO LCCS and then spectral features, field investigations, and SLATS data were used to generate 4 th level (Modular-Hierarchical phase) land cover categories. Results generated a very satisfactory land cover map with 15 sub-categories at 10 m resolution compare to existing land cover products of SEQ. The hierarchical FAO classification approach used in this study produced a land cover map which can be used with national and global level land cover products based on FAO LCCS. The future research steps are laying on investigating mapping rural and arid regions of Australia to combine into the national data set. ...|$|E

40|$|The City of Regina Fleet Street landfill, {{north-east}} of Regina, Saskatchewan, {{is approaching}} its maximum capacity after a 47 -year operating life and plans {{are now being}} made for its closure. As part of closure planning work, four test plots encompassing two different cover designs (a capillary break cover and a store-and-release cover) were constructed on the landfill {{in the summer of}} 2004. One cover of each design was constructed on both the north facing and the south facing slopes. The overall objective of this thesis is to evaluate the preliminary performance of the four test plots on the City of Regina landfill with regards to net percolation, gas flux, water balance and vegetation. To meet this overall objective three specific objectives were developed as follows: •Evaluate the performance and integrity of the monitoring scheme. •Characterize the properties of the soil covers on the four test plots. •Develop a preliminary water balance using the monitoring field data. A field instrumentation program was carried out which included detailed monitoring of gas composition, volumetric water content, matric suction and temperature within the <b>cover</b> <b>profile</b> as well as measurements of interflow, runoff and site-specific meteorology. Generally, the instrumentation performed well {{with the exception of the}} tipping bucket which did not accurately measure precipitation. Evaluation of the covers revealed that the slope aspect exerts greater influence over the water balance than that exerted by cover design itself. The south test plots were drier than the north, experienced more net radiation, and generally had more abundant vegetation. A water balance was conducted for each test plot at the upper, mid and lower slope. It is clear that a capillary break was not maintained on the north slope for the entire monitoring period and the percolation from the store-and-release cover was less than that of the capillary break cover. The south test plots were very dry and net percolation was nearly the same for both test plots. Therefore, it is believed that the store-and-release covers are performing better than the capillary break covers...|$|E

Direct observed participation of stakeholders, household questionnaire, and interview with key informants and focus group discussions were used to collect data. Our results showed a declining scattered bushland by a rate of 20. 61 km 2 per year between 1972 and 1986. On the other hand, Shrub encroachment increased by 32. 2 % between 1972 and 1986 and by 10. 3 % (77. 4 km 2) during the entire study period. Grassland was the largest cover type in the area between 1986 and 2006 and expanded by 14. 2 % (106. 4 km 2) between 1972 and 1986. The majority of respondents highlighted that the most important drivers of the observed LULC changes pre- 1995 were the combined effects of the land reform policy and changes in Park boundary (size of the Park). Population growth was reported to be the main driving factor for LULC change pre-and post- 1995. The continuing existence of the area as a national Park receives unreserved support from most pastoral and agro-pastoral communities. From the data we conclude that overall, decentralization in Ethiopia was not effective in terms of improving the status of Awash National Park.
