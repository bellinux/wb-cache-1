5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant {{to the business of}} selecting fiction.|$|E
5|$|Neerja {{reflects}} on her brief, unhappy arranged marriage to Naresh (Kavi Shastri), a professional in Doha, Qatar, who abused her over her small dowry and inability to perform household work.

Naresh sent her parents a letter <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dowry and their daughter's lack of domestic skills, demanding that Neerja either bring back money or not return at all. Neerja left Naresh and landed a job with Pan Am Airways.|$|E

5|$|Worcester was {{an urban}} castle, built within an {{existing}} settlement. Many such castles required the clearance of local properties, but unusually at Worcester Castle the ditch {{of the outer}} bailey cut through part of Worcester Cathedral's cemetery. It is unclear whether the cemetery was still in use at that time, but the desecration resulted in Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, with extensive interests in Worcester, <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> seizure {{of the land and}} formally cursing Urse.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E
5|$|James Broun-Ramsay, the Marquess of Dalhousie became Lord Warden; on his death, the Prime Minister Henry Temple, the Viscount Palmerston, {{took over}} the castle in 1861. Palmerston {{initially}} declined to buy {{the contents of the}} castle from his predecessor's estate on taking up the post, a practice which had become traditional for the Lords Warden, <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> high price being proposed. This raised the risk that the historical contents of the castle might be sold off at open auction; and some of Wellington's former belongings were therefore removed by his family for safekeeping.|$|E

5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{conquest of}} Algeria, Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying {{large parts of}} the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's son, William, spent {{little time}} at Stokesay {{and by the}} 1640s had leased it out to Charles Baldwyn, and his son Samuel. He rebuilt the {{gatehouse}} during 1640 and 1641, however, {{at a cost of}} around £533. In 1643 the English Civil War broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament. A Royalist supporter, William spent the war years at Elizabeth Stuart's court at the Hague, and gave large sums of money to the King's war effort. William installed a garrison in the castle, where the Baldwins were also strong Royalists, and, as the conflict progressed, the county of Shropshire became increasingly Royalist in sympathies. Despite this, by late 1644 bands of vigilante clubmen had risen up in Shropshire, <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> activities of Royalist forces in the region, and demanding, among other things, the removal of the garrison from Stokesay Castle.|$|E

5|$|The French met the {{remnants}} of Conrad's army at Lopadion, and Conrad joined Louis' force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and they arrived at Ephesus in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, {{and there was no}} guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a small battle outside Ephesus, the French were victorious. The French fended off another Turkish ambush at the Meander River.|$|E
5|$|This series {{proved to}} be highly controversial, with many people <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of pitch {{correction}} software on the broadcast of contestants' auditions, the decision to form two groups out of rejected soloists, the rejection of popular contestant Gamu Nhengu at judges' houses and Cole's failure to vote to eliminate an act in week 5 of the live shows. Controversy also surrounded contestants Shirlena Johnson, who was axed over fears for her mental health, and Treyc Cohen, who was reported to already have a record deal when the live shows started. There were also accusations of fixing, which were denied by the show's producers. It was the most watched series to date, {{with an average of}} 14.13million viewers per episode. The final was watched by 17.71million people, making it the highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker is {{the third}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added {{the passage of the}} bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In {{the latter half of the}} novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of exotic locations.|$|E

5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of Path of Radiance {{was handled}} by Nintendo of America's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. During the process, the team {{worked closely with}} Intelligent Systems staff members. The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English, which required staff from Japan {{to come over and}} check their work. When translating the dialogue, the localization team wanted to preserve the story's depth and serious tone, despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression. While they had the option to add extra text boxes, this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players, so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version. The western version's difficulty was also toned down: the Japanese version's Maniac setting was removed, Hard Mode was toned down, and a new Easy was introduced. These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback, and feedback from Japanese players <b>complaining</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's high difficulty. The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in Animal Crossing, but still enough to take several months to complete. Due to its serious nature, the team needed to take a different approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles. As far as possible, the team remained faithful to the original script, aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor. While {{most of the time they}} refrained from putting out-of-context remarks in character dialogue, an exception was Anna, a recurring Fire Emblem character who featured in optional tutorial missions. As she existed outside the game to a degree, they had more freedom to have her make pop culture references.|$|E
