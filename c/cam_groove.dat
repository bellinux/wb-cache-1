50|$|Operation of the Model 811 is by an {{external}} electric motor that drives a camshaft lying inside the receiver. This shaft has a spiral <b>cam</b> <b>groove</b> that engages with a lug on the bolt, so {{that as the}} shaft revolves, the bolt is moved back and forth. The shaft is also geared to the feed mechanism, so that feed is in strict synchronisation with the bolt's movements. A hang-fire safety device is provided. Fire modes are single shot, limited bursts or continuous bursts with a pre-selectable cyclic rate of fire at 125 or 400 rounds/min. The feed direction for the percussion-primed 25 × 137 ammunition can be either manually selected or remotely selected, through an electrical feeder selection device. The first round fired following selection comes from the belt that has just been selected. The external power feature {{can be used for}} maintenance and training using dummy rounds. The Model 811 can fire all NATO standard 25 × 137 ammunition. Current natures available from Nexter Munitions includes the following; High Explosive Incendiary Tracer (HEI-T), Target Practice (TP), Target Practice Tracer (TP-T), Armour-Piercing Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APDS-T) and Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilised Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APFSDS-T). According to Nexter Systems, the accuracy of the Model 811 25 mm is such that all rounds fired will hit a 1.5 m diameter target at a range of 1,500 m.|$|E

2500|$|Coordinate {{conversion}} from polar to rectangular {{was done}} by a mechanical resolver (called a [...] "component solver" [...] in US Navy fire control computers). Two discs on a common axis positioned a sliding block with pin (stubby shaft) on it. One disc was a face cam, and a follower on the block in the face <b>cam's</b> <b>groove</b> set the radius. The other disc, closer to the pin, contained a straight slot in which the block moved. The input angle rotated the latter disc (the face cam disc, for an unchanging radius, rotated with the other (angle) disc; a differential and a few gears did this correction).|$|R

50|$|The R4 is a {{selective}} fire, gas-operated weapon that fires from a closed bolt. As with the Galil parent weapon, {{the operating system}} is derived {{from that of the}} AK-47. It uses ignited powder gases channelled through a vent in the barrel to drive a long stroke piston located above the barrel in a gas cylinder to provide power to the operating system. The weapon features a self-regulating gas system and a rotary bolt breech locking mechanism (equipped with two locking lugs), which is rotated by a helical <b>camming</b> <b>groove</b> machined into the bolt carrier that engages a control pin on the bolt. Extraction is carried out by means of a spring-loaded extractor contained in the bolt and a protrusion on the left guide rail inside the receiver acts as the fixed ejector.|$|R

50|$|The Roth-Steyr pistol fires from {{an unusual}} style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, {{except for a}} sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The {{interior}} of the bolt has <b>cam</b> <b>grooves</b> cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the helical grooves in the muzzle bush cause the barrel to turn 90 degrees clockwise, after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety with intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing striker spring, similar to a hammerless revolver.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} sense, [...] "automatic revolver" [...] {{refers to the}} {{mechanism}} of firing rather than extraction. Double-action revolvers use a long trigger pull to cock the hammer, thus negating the need to manually cock the hammer between shots. The disadvantage {{of this is that}} the long, heavy pull cocking the hammer makes the double-action revolver much harder to shoot accurately than a single-action revolver (although cocking the hammer of a double-action reduces the length and weight of the trigger pull). A rare class of revolvers, called automatic for its firing design, attempts to overcome this restriction, giving the high speed of a double-action with the trigger effort of a single-action. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver is the most famous commercial example. It was recoil-operated, and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and revolve the cylinder. <b>Cam</b> <b>grooves</b> were milled {{on the outside of the}} cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber—half a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward[...]38 caliber versions held eight shots, [...]455 caliber versions six.

The automatic revolver was popular when it first came out, but was quickly superseded by the creation of reliable, inexpensive semi-automatic pistols.|$|R

50|$|Face cams {{may provide}} {{repetitive}} motion with a groove that forms a closed curve, or may provide function generation with a stopped <b>groove.</b> <b>Cams</b> used for function generation may have grooves that require several revolutions {{to cover the}} complete function, and in this case, the function generally needs to be invertible so that the groove does not self intersect, and the function output value must differ enough at corresponding rotations that there is sufficient material separating the adjacent groove segments. A common form is the constant lead cam, where displacement of the follower is linear with rotation, such as the scroll plate in a scroll chuck. Non-invertible functions, which require the groove to self-intersect, can be implemented using special follower designs.|$|R

In {{order to provide}} further insights into P 450 structure, function and substrate recognition, we have determined the crystal structure of this 4 -mutant without a substrate and its complex with PeCB. PeCB is bound face-on to the heme, with a weak Fe—Cl interaction. One PeCB chlorine {{is located in the}} cavity generated by the L 244 A mutation, in striking illustration of the role of this mutation in promoting PeCB binding. The structures also show that the P 450 (sub) <b>cam</b> oxygen-binding <b>groove</b> between G 248 and T 252 is flexible and can tolerate significant deviations from their conformations in the wild type without loss of enzyme activity. Analysis of the PeCB binding interactions led to introduction of the T 101 A mutation to enable the substrate to reorient during the catalytic cycle for more efficient oxidation. The resultant 5 -mutant F 87 W/Y 96 F/T 101 A/L 244 A/V 247 L is 3 -fold more active for PeCB oxidation than the 4 -mutant. Polychlorinated benzene binding by the mutants and the partitioning between substrate oxidation and non-productive (uncoupling) side reactions are correlated with the structural data.

40|$|Kennedy Space Center is {{not only}} {{home to one of}} the largest {{buildings}} in the world - the massive Vehicle Assembly Building - it also hosts a number of one-of-a-kind facilities. The more than 30 -mile-long campus has witnessed every launch from the Space Shuttle Launch Pad, as well as many homecomings at the Shuttle Landing Facility. Just as important, the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) has seen each element of the International Space Station (ISS) that passes through Kennedy before it goes into orbit. The SSPF is where ISS components are checked, tested, and adjusted before being packed into the Space Shuttle for transport. In an environment like the SSPF - spanning 457, 000 square feet of processing areas, operational control rooms, laboratories, logistics areas, and office space - large workstands and equipment used to support the processing of ISS components need to be moved around the facility. One of the devices employed for this task is an air pallet. An air pallet moves on cushions of air instead of wheels. Compressed air inflates the cushions underneath the pallet and is then expelled through exhaust holes. This forms a thin film of air between the cushions and the floor, lifting the platform off the floor and making it easy to move the heavy workstands, equipment, and ISS components. Concerned with the safety of the connections on the pressurized air hoses used for the air pallets, engineers at Kennedy modified an existing commercial <b>cam</b> and <b>groove</b> fitting to control the air supply hose {{in the event of an}} accidental release of a pressurized hose. This modification prevented the hose from detaching and, propelled by compressed air, striking workers or equipment. "At the time, these were not available on commercial coupling halves, so NASA made a modification and then put them into use. If a worker were to accidentally try to remove a pressurized hose from the pallet, it no longer rapidly separated, and it safely relieved the pressure," says Paul Schwindt, an engineer at Kennedy who together with Alan Littlefield, also an engineer at Kennedy, designed the modification...|$|R
