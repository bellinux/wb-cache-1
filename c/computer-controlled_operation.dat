50|$|Dynamically {{positioned}} vessels (DPVs) are vessels {{which can}} hold a position and heading by <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>operation</b> of thrusters and propellers. In many cases {{this can be done}} sufficiently precisely to use as a platform for diving operations, but there are specific hazards associated with this mode of diving. The vessel control system monitors its position by reference systems which may include taut wire, radar surface stations (Artemis), Seabed acoustic transponders (Hydracoustic Position Reference) or Differential Global Positioning System, using satellites and a terrestrial base station. International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) guidance requires at least three independent referencing systems of at least two different types for DPV diving operations, to minimise the risk of loss of position. The DP footprint is the scope of movement of the vessel, and it is limited for safety of the divers. Three alert levels are provided to the diving team to indicate the current capacity of the vessel to maintain position. Green indicates normal status, where diving work can be done, yellow indicates partly degraded status, where the divers would be recalled to the bell, and red indicates emergency status, where the dive would be aborted. The particular hazards of DPV diving include loss of position and thruster hazards. Special precautions are taken to prevent divers from getting into the danger zones of thrusters and propellers. These include limiting umbilical length, and other physical restraints.|$|E

It conquers the defections such as low-efficiency and low-grade surface quality of the traditional method. Deduced from the hydrodynamic lubrication theory of the Bingham plastic flow, the material removal model of MRF is established. The reliability of the model is verified by the experiment. finally, we get the mean Preston coefficient by the theoretical curve and the actual measured curves, the value will be applied to optical components of the <b>computer-controlled</b> MRF <b>operation.</b> Through the magnetorheological finishing experiments, the results that compared with the experimental results in good agreement prove that our proposed model is reasonable...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{placement}} as {{a manufacturing}} method for composite parts has gained popularity in recent years. Fiber placement {{has been used}} {{not only in the}} manufacturing of military hardware such as the inlet duct of the joint strike fighter 1 and the landing gear pod fairing of the C- 17 transport 2, but also in the manufacturing of lighter aircraft for civil aviation 3. Fiber placement technology has a number of advantages over hand layup processes. It can be used to fabricate composite components with highly complex shapes in one automated, computer-controlled program. The savings in labor and low scrap rate combine to reduce the production costs by as much as 50 %.

50|$|His basic {{research}} {{centers around the}} development of quantitative High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, aided by <b>computer-controlled</b> microscope <b>operation</b> and image simulation, which enables direct determination of atomic structure in defective materials. His research also involves using electron-microscopy-based methods to characterize advanced materials such as semiconductor heterostructures, magnetic thin films and multilayers, and nanostructures. Semiconductor systems of interest include ternary and quaternary Group III nitride alloys for light-emitting diodes and lasers, and II-VI alloys, such as mercury cadmium telluride for detectors of infra-red radiation. Magnetic materials being studied include shape-memory alloys, as well as magnetic tunnel junctions, {{which are based on}} ferromagnet-insulator-ferromagnet combinations, that have promising applications for non-volatile, high-storage-density recording media. Off-axis electron holography is a particularly powerful approach since it permits quantitative visualization of nanoscale electric and magnetic fields, and we are using the technique to investigate the magnetization behavior and fringing fields associated with patterned nanostructures.|$|R

40|$|Flow {{chemistry}} and continuous processing techniques are now frequently used in synthetic laboratories, {{taking advantage of}} the ability to contain reactive or hazardous intermediates and to perform moderate scale-up processes for important compounds. However, {{only a limited number of}} methods and tools for connecting flow synthesis steps into a single protocol have been described, and as a result manual interventions are frequently required between consecutive stages. There are two main challenges to overcome. Work-up operations such as solvent extractions and filtrations are invariably needed to ensure high purity of the intermediates. Solutions for achieving this are well established within industrial facilities for continuous production, but adapting such machinery for laboratory use is rarely straightforward. Secondly, the combination of multiple steps tends to result in a more elaborate reactor configuration. The control procedures required to achieve optimum performance may then be beyond the capabilities of a single researcher. Computer control and remote monitoring can help to make such experiments more practical; but commercially-available systems are often highly specialised, and purpose-built at high cost for a particular system, and so are not suitable for laboratory scientists to use routinely. This work describes the development of software tools to enable rapid prototyping of control systems that can integrate multiple instruments and devices (in Chapter 2). These are applied to three multi-step synthesis projects, which also make use of enabling technologies such as heterogeneous reagents and in-line work-up techniques so that material can be passed directly from one stage to the next: In Chapter 1, a series of analogues of a precursor to imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, are prepared. A “catch-react-release” technique for solid-phase synthesis is used, with <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>operation</b> of the reactors. In Chapter 3, a two-step procedure for the synthesis of piperazine- 2 -carboxamide, a valuable 3 D building block, is developed. A computer control system enabled extended running and the integration of several machines to perform optimisation experiments. In Chapter 4, improvements to the continuous synthesis of 2 -aminoadamantane- 2 -carboxylic acid are discussed. This includes an integrated sequence of three reactions and three workup operations. The final chapter describes a project to evaluate the application of control techniques to a medicinal chemistry project. New ligands for BRD 9 and CECR 2, proteins involved in the recognition of acetylated histone proteins, are produced. A number of triazolopyridazine compounds were synthesised and tested using a number of assay techniques, including a frontal-affinity chromatography system under development within our group. Pleasingly, the qualitative FAC data showed a good correlation with biological assessments made using established assay techniques. Further work using the FAC method is ongoing...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} method for {{the conversion of}} cheese whey lactose into ethanol has been demonstrated. With the help of continuous-culture technology, a catabolite repression-resistant mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae completely fermented equimolar mixtures of glucose and galactose into ethanol. The first step in this process was a <b>computer-controlled</b> fed-batch <b>operation</b> based on the carbon dioxide evolution rate of the culture. In the absence of inhibitory ethanol concentrations, this step allowed us to obtain high biomass concentrations before continuous fermentation. The continuous anaerobic process successfully incorporated a cell-recycle system to optimize the fermentor productivity. Under conditions permitting a low residual sugar concentration (≤ 1 %), maximum productivity (13. 6 g liter− 1 h− 1) was gained from 15 % substrate in the continuous feed at a dilution rate of 0. 2 h− 1. Complete fermentation of highly concentrated feed solutions (20 %) was also demonstrated, but only with greatly diminished fermentor productivity (5. 5 g liter− 1 h− 1) ...|$|R
