5|$|After {{conducting}} a critical study of Opus Dei, journalist John L.

5|$|Multiple {{critics also}} {{mentioned}} its presentation. Stella praised the visuals {{and enjoyed the}} music despite it sounding dated, while Hatfield praised the music but criticized the graphics as uninspired. Reddick praised the visual overhaul, despite limited animation for sprites outside battle. Dutton echoed Hatfield's sentiments about the visuals, finding them one of his main <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presentation alongside the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film {{were that}} its {{characters}} were underdeveloped, its script was crowded, {{and it was}} overlong. However, the special effects, chemistry between Stone and Garfield, Dane DeHaan's performance, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score were met with high praise. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, {{the most compelling}} reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait {{produces}} more {{newspapers and magazines}} per capita than its neighbors.

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{diplomatic}} duties, Peckham {{wrote to}} Llywelyn, and in those letters the archbishop continued his <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Welsh people, this time condemning their laws as contrary to both the Old and New Testament. Peckham was particularly offended that Welsh laws sought to get parties to homicides or other crimes to settle their differences rather than the process of English law which condemned the criminal.|$|E
5|$|Game critics praised Giants for {{state-of-the-art}} graphics, humorous story, {{and success}} in blending in one genre with another. <b>Criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game centered on crippling software bugs and lack of an in-game save feature. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, {{at the cost of}} removing several features. Giants sold poorly initially for both Windows and PlayStation2; however, it sold well afterwards and the game has gained a cult following.|$|E
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E

5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars: Jedi Arena {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from {{critics in the}} 1980s. Adam Thompson of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games likened the mechanism of damaging the opponent's shield to smashing bricks in Breakout and praised the game's glowing multi-colored laser blasts and the sound effects, the latter of which he felt added realism to the game. According to Peter Brown of GameSpot, however, the main <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game were the stationary Jedi and abstract combat, for the opposite of which action fans were expecting.|$|E
5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E

5|$|The {{association}} {{is open to}} all faiths with variations to the Scout Promise available to accommodate to those of different religious obligations or national beliefs. Following <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack of provision for atheists, in 2012 the association consulted members about the possibility of creating an additional alternative Promise for those without a religion, and in October 2013, announced that an alternative version of the promise would be available from January 2014 for those without a pronounced faith.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I felt that I was ungenerously treated by the harsh <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press and individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E

5|$|Wallace (1973) {{addressed}} {{a number of}} <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> committee including that it provides too little information on the reasons for rarity rejection.

5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} a unique and positive aspect of the book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. <b>Criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{more people}} were {{reported}} arrested in early August. According to the BBC, {{the total number of}} arrests in connection with the riots was over 1,500. The Financial Times estimated that the number was higher, citing an insider saying that some 4,000 arrests had already taken place by mid July, and that Ürümqi's prisons were so full that newly arrested people were being held in a People's Liberation Army warehouse. According to the Uyghur American Association, several other Uyghur journalists and bloggers were also detained after the riots; one of them, journalist Gheyret Niyaz, was later sentenced to 15 years in prison for having spoken to foreign media. In the most high-profile case, Ilham Tohti, an ethnic Uyghur economist at Minzu University of China, was arrested two days after the riots over his <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Xinjiang government.|$|E
