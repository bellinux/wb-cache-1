40|$|A {{metamodel}} definition presents {{some important}} {{issues in the}} construction of an object database management system, whose rich data model inevitably increases the metamodel complexity. The required features of an object database metamodel are investigated. Roles of a metamodel in an objectoriented database management system are presented and compared to the proposal defined in the ODMG standard of object-oriented database management systems. After outlining the metamodel definition included in the standard, its main drawbacks are identified and several changes to the ODMG metamodel definition are suggested. The biggest conceptual <b>change</b> concerns <b>flattening</b> <b>the</b> metamodel to reduce complexity and to support extendibility...|$|R
50|$|Rising (or falling) {{interest}} rates rarely rise {{by the same}} amount all along the yield curve—the curve rarely moves up in parallel. Because longer-term bonds have a larger duration, a rise in rates will cause a larger capital loss for them, than for short-term bonds. But almost always, the long maturity's rate will <b>change</b> much less, <b>flattening</b> <b>the</b> yield curve. The greater change in rates at the short end will offset to some extent the advantage provided by the shorter bond's lower duration.|$|R
40|$|Be- 10 {{terrestrial}} cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure ages from moraines on Nevado Illimani, Cordillera Real, Bolivia {{suggest that}} glaciers retreated from moraines during the periods 15. 5 - 13. 0 ka, 10. 0 - 8. 5 ka, and 3. 5 - 2. 0 ka. Late glacial moraines at Illimani {{are associated with}} an ELA depression of 400 - 600 m, {{which is consistent with}} other local reconstructions of late glacial ELAs in the Eastern Cordillera of the central Andes. A comparison of late glacial ELAs between the Eastern Cordillera and Western Cordillera indicates a marked <b>change</b> toward <b>flattening</b> of <b>the</b> east-to-west regional ELA gradient. This flattening is consistent with increased precipitation from the Pacific during the late glacial period. (C) 2010 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Metal pipes have a {{long history}} as fluid conduits, and are {{commonly}} joined with components such as elbows to form bent transport paths. However, with the increasing demands for economy and energy saving, pipes with reduced joints and thinner walls are desired. The number of joints can be reduced by a drawing and bending process that forms a bend section at any position in the pipe. However, this approach incurs problems such as wrinkling and flattening, especially under conditions of large bending angle, decreased bending radius, and thin pipe walls. In this research, applying vibrations to the mandrel was trialed as an approach for controlling the wrinkle depth and flattening. First, processing experiments were performed on thin walled pipes (wall thickness = 0. 5 mm; outer diameter = 14 mm). <b>The</b> <b>change</b> of <b>flattening</b> and <b>the</b> number and depths of wrinkles were investigated in the presence and absence of vibrations. Next, simulations were performed using the commercial nonlinear finite element software. Through these simulations, the flatness and appearance of wrinkles were analyzed by modeling the behavior and distribution of stresses and strains in the processing process. The application of vibration to the mandrel appears to be a promising approach for controlling <b>the</b> wrinkling and <b>flattening</b> problems during pipe processing...|$|R

40|$|Several {{properties}} of the cerebral cortex, including its columnar and laminar organization, {{as well as the}} topographic organization of cortical areas, can only be properly understood {{in the context of the}} intrinsic two-dimensional structure of the cortical surface. In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and <b>flattening</b> <b>the</b> cortical surface are described in a companion paper. These procedures allow for <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> use of cortical surface-based analysis and visualization methods in functional brain imaging...|$|R
