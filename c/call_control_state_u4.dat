40|$|With {{rapid growth}} {{in the use of}} {{telecommunication}} services, subscribers enjoy value-added services via different telecommunication technologies. The telecommunication companies need to get a single view of the subscriber data in order to profile them (for example:profitable subscribers) and reduce operational costs by the virtue of maintaining common subscriber data. A Home Location Register (HLR) in Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) domain and Home Subscriber Server (HSS) in IP Multimedia  Subsystem (IMS) domain store subscriber data. A subscriber may use both GSM and IMS services. The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) has specified separate standard specifications for HLR and for HSS. As a result, in many cases there is duplication of subscriber data in both of them. Minimizing duplication in subscriber data can be accomplished by developing a common HLR/HSS. This would result in providing single view of the subscriber data in the GSM and IMS services. This thesis work investigates the possibility to implement a common HLR/HSS product by adding a HSS Front-end (FE) server and an IMS subscriber database to an already existing HLR implementation consisting of a HLR FE server and a GSM subscriber database.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} novel {{integrated}} analytical framework for analyzing the quality-of-service (QoS) performance measures in a wireless mobile multimedia network. The framework integrates physical, radio link, and network layer parameters and protocols {{to analyze the}} call-level and packet-level performances. In the network layer, <b>call</b> admission <b>control</b> (CAC) is responsible for deciding whether an incoming call can be accepted or not so that the performances of the ongoing calls do not deteriorate below the acceptable level. Also, an adaptive channel allocation (ACA) scheme is used to maximize the utilization of the radio resources. In the data link layer, queue management and error control are used for non-real-time loss-sensitive traffic. In the physical layer, a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) is used to model channel fading, and adaptive modulation is used for rate adaptation according to channel quality. Various call-level and packet-level QoS measures for real-time, non-real-time, and best-effort traffic are obtained. The analytical results are validated by extensive simulations. Examples of the applications of the presented analytical framework are also provided.

Web Services that expose telecommunication networks to third parties are highly abstracted. This abstraction allows Web developers to create applications that provide <b>call</b> <b>control</b> functionality without detailed {{knowledge of the}} underlying network. Functionality offered by network operators is usually of a simple nature, and does not provide developers with advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> functionality, similar to that found in operator services. Advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> requires the Web application to have detailed knowledge {{of the state of}} the telecommunication resources. In this research an Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> <b>call</b> model and Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> Web service are developed and demonstrated to provide Web applications with this knowledge. To develop the Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> <b>call</b> model existing telecommunication call models were analysed for components suitable for Web <b>control.</b> The Extended <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> Web service was developed using advanced <b>call</b> <b>control</b> use cases.

40|$|In {{theoretical}} investigations, {{we review}} several nonlinear optical approaches towards subdiffraction-limited resolution in label-free imaging via coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). Using a density matrix model and numerical integration, we investigate various level schemes and combinations {{of the light}} fields that induce CARS along with additional control laser fields. As the key to techniques that gain far-field resolution below the diffraction limit, we identify the inhibition of the buildup of vibrational molecular coherence via saturation or depletion of population (Beeker et al. Opt Express 17 : 22632 – 22638, 2009) or the generation of Stark broadening and spatially dependent Rabi sideband generation (Beeker et al. Phys Rev A 81 (1), 2010). Depending on the coherence and population decay rates offered by a particular molecular energy level scheme, we identify various different regimes. In the first case, where an additional <b>state</b> (<b>called</b> the <b>control</b> <b>state)</b> and a vibrational state are able to rapidly exchange population via incoherent processes, a prepopulation of the upper vibrational state inhibits the buildup of vibrational coherence. With increasing control laser intensity, this suppresses CARS emission via an incoherent, saturation type of nonlinear process. Using an intense, donut-shaped control laser beam, similar to stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, this can suppress CARS emission from all sample locations except within a subdiffraction-sized range around the central node. Scanning the control beams across the sample provides subdiffraction-limited resolution imaging. An alternative, which {{does not require a}} rapid exchange of population with the <b>control</b> <b>state,</b> applies a <b>control</b> beam that only partially depletes the vibrational ground state. Thereby, a CARS point spread function containing a subdiffraction-limited component is generated. Subdiffraction images can then be retrieved through deconvolution. Further approaches are based on the coherent, nonlinear, resonant response of the sample. In this case, CARS signal depletion by Stark splitting of the weakly populated upper vibrational state or the observation of spatially dependent Rabi oscillation may increase the resolution beyond the diffraction limit...|$|R

Manufacturers of video conferencing equipment face new requirements when entering this market, including the need for increased personalization and flexibility of the services provided to the user. Using policies for <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is a promising approach to meet these requirements. Both SIP and H. 323 are important protocols for video conferencing, and this thesis therefore gives proposals for how to design a policy-based <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution for video conference networks using both of these protocols. This thesis starts with a description of the study performed on existing standards and proposals that may be used {{in the design of the}} <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution. The Common Open Policy Service (COPS), XACML, SAML, Ponder and Appel were studied. COPS, XACML, SAML and Ponder are all designed to be used in management solutions such as policy-based management of QoS networks. Appel is designed to be used for <b>call</b> <b>control.</b> This difference was shown to be significant, and was the main reason for selecting Appel as the proposal to use in a <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution. An important part of a system design process is identifying the requirements for the system. Use cases for the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution were written to find the requirements for this solution. Since these use cases also showed how the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution must be integrated with the conference network, main principles of the design of the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution were selected during the process of writing these use cases. These principles are described along with the requirements found. A set of main goals is expressed for the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution. The solution must provide the same functionality independent of the underlying protocol used (H. 323 or SIP). The solution must provide authorization of <b>calls</b> and conferences, <b>control</b> of properties of a call (e. g. the bandwidth used) and call forwarding, busy handling and similar. The thesis includes an evaluation of how Appel can be used to cover the above goals. The evaluation showed that a number of extensions of Appel are needed. Finally a description of two possible architectures for the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution is described. These show which units take part of the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> solution, and describes the roles these units play. </p...|$|R
