What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints. The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, <b>camera</b> <b>operation,</b> and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if the game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E

Lois arrives to pick Peter {{up from the}} bowling alley, but discovers Quagmire spying on her from {{the ceiling of the}} ladies' toilet. Quagmire is beaten up then arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog. After the fight, Peter returns to the neighborhood to return to the conversation and tells the women that, [...] "Quagmire's a good guy, he's just a little mixed up, that's all!" [...] Eventually, the women agree to let Quagmire stay in the neighborhood so long as he manages to control his perverse behavior. Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV <b>camera</b> <b>operation</b> room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that a lady in a fitting room is having a heart attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life. Quagmire is congratulated for his heroism, but his intention had been to molest the woman while she was unconscious (which he reveals by asking [...] "What the hell is CPR?").|$|E

30|$|Video shot {{boundaries}} can {{be classified}} into two types: abrupt shot boundary (ASB) (as in Fig. 2) and gradual shot boundary (GSB), according to a certain classification of scene transition, which in general is related to content variation over time. This is common in 2 D and 3 D video, {{despite the fact that}} scene transition in 3 D video may include depth changes besides the visual content itself. In ASB, the scene transition occurs over very few frames, usually a single frame defines the boundary. In the case of GSB, the transition takes place gradually over a short span of frames. The most common gradual transitions are fade-ins, fade-outs, dissolves and wipes [26 – 28]. A common problem in SBD is the correct discrimination between <b>camera</b> <b>operations</b> and object motion that originate the gradual transitions, since the temporal variation of the frame content can be of the same order of magnitude and take place over the same number of frames. This similarity of visual effects caused by <b>camera</b> <b>operations</b> and object motion can induce false detections of gradual shot boundaries. This problem is aggravated for video sequences with intense motion.|$|R

40|$|A massive {{amount of}} videos are {{uploaded}} on video websites, smooth video browsing, editing, retrieval, and summarization are demanded. Most of the videos employ several types of <b>camera</b> <b>operations</b> for expanding field of view, emphasizing events, and expressing cinematic effect. To digest heterogeneous videos in video websites and databases, video clips are profiled to 2 D image scroll containing both spatial and temporal information for video preview. The video profile is visually continuous, compact, scalable, and indexing to each frame. This work analyzes the camera kinematics including zoom, translation, and rotation, and categorize camera actions as their combinations. An automatic video summarization framework is proposed and developed. After conventional video clip segmentation and video segmentation for smooth <b>camera</b> <b>operations,</b> the global flow field under all camera actions has been investigated for profiling various types of video. A new algorithm {{has been designed to}} extract the major flow direction and convergence factor using condensed images. Then this work proposes a uniform scheme to segment video clips and sections, sample video volume across the major flow, compute flow convergence factor, in order to obtain an intrinsic scene space less influenced by the camera ego-motion. The motion blur technique has also been used to render dynamic targets in the profile. The resulting profile of video can be displayed in a video track to guide the access to video frames, help video editing, and facilitate the applications such as surveillance, visual archiving of environment, video retrieval, and online video preview. ...|$|R
40|$|Video is {{a medium}} of {{increasing}} popularity and {{widely used in}} many areas. However, classifying or retrieving video data by keywords or filenames is not sufficient in many situations. Moreover, it can yield unpredictable results. For example, when people use"kitten" as a keyword and want to find some video sequences that include a kitten, the output result may include sequences of a pop band called"atomic kitten". Hence, the concept of content-based video indexing and retrieval (CBVR,) is introduced and becomes a challenging problem. Existing CBVR techniques can be classified in three classes depending on what features they use: low level (e. g. pixels level: colors, edges, etc.), mid level and high level (e. g. concepts). Most of the works in the literature deal with low-level features. Only few works try {{to bridge the gap}} between low and high level. In this work, we intend to go one step further in that way. More especially, our work achieves a new technique to index and retrieve videos based on both the apparent motion and defocus blur. From those low-level features, we estimate some of the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameter changes, and then deduce <b>camera</b> <b>operations,</b> such as panning/tracking, tilting/booming, zooming/dollying and rolling, as well as focus changes. Finally, <b>camera</b> <b>operations</b> are recorded into an index which is then used for video retrieval. Experiments confirm that the proposed mid-level features can be accurately deduced from low-level features and that they can be used for indexing and retrieval purpose...|$|R
