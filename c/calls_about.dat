5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> the Boy in the Box.|$|E

Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug dealers arrive in pairs as the man attempts {{to gain access to the}} files. Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E

The ads and campaign continued throughout the year and were chosen as best of 1986 by Video Storyboard of New York.|$|E
25|$|Peckinpah {{was next}} signed to direct The Cincinnati Kid, a {{gambling}} {{drama about a}} young prodigy who takes on an old master during a big New Orleans poker match. Before filming started, producer Martin Ransohoff began to receive phone <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> the Major Dundee ordeal and was told Peckinpah was impossible to work with. In addition, Peckinpah decided to shoot {{in black and white}} and was hoping to transform the screenplay into a social realist saga about a kid surviving the tough streets of the Great Depression. After four days of filming, which reportedly included some nude scenes, Ransohoff disliked the rushes and immediately fired him. Eventually directed by Norman Jewison and starring Steve McQueen, the film {{went on to become a}} 1965 hit.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{relied on}} depots much less {{frequently}} laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes {{were marked by}} the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> finding depots. It {{is also clear that}} Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they {{would have been able to}} travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.|$|E

25|$|In August 2013, DCFEMS {{reported}} that it had significantly lowered EMS response times in April, May, June, and July 2013. The department said its standard was {{to respond to a}} call (e.g., leave the station) within 6.5 minutes 90 percent of the time. The department lowered its response time from 84 percent of the time in February 2013 to 92 percent of the time in June 2013. The response time for critical <b>calls</b> (<b>about</b> half of those received every day) also fell, from 5:03 minutes in February 2013 to 4:02 minutes in June 2013. Ellerbe attributed the improvements to a new protocol that required ambulance crews and firefighter EMTs to submit paperwork justifying the response time every time it exceeded the standard. Ellerbe suggested that some employees were simply not responding very quickly, and noted that at least one employee was disciplined {{for not being able to}} justify a slow response time. The firefighters' union complained about the amount of paperwork required, and said crews were sacrificing safety in order to meet the response time standard. The union claimed there had been a sharp rise in minor road accidents since Ellerbe's protocol went into effect, and that some crews were lying when they said they had responded.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} and court appeal, Panahi broke the ban imposed on him from making films and made the documentary feature This Is Not a Film (2011) in collaboration with Iranian filmmaker Mojtaba Mirtahmasb. This film was made for €3,200 and shot on a digital camcorder and, partly, an iPhone. It was shot in four days over a ten-day period in March 2011 and its title was inspired by René Magritte's painting The Treachery of Images. In the film, Panahi sits in his apartment making phone <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> his court case, watching TV news stories, interacting with his neighbors, talking about his past films and describing scenes from the film that he had begun shooting when he was arrested (much as he had described scenes from films to his sisters as a child). Ten days before the opening of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, This Is Not a Film was announced as a surprise entry into the festival. It was smuggled out of Iran on a USB thumb drive that had been hidden inside a cake. Panahi's wife and daughter attended the festival. In December 2012 it was shortlisted as one of 15 films eligible for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|In July 1991, {{the show}} began to air on KLSX in Los Angeles. Listeners jammed the station's {{switchboard}} {{during the first}} simulcast with mostly negative <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> the change. Stern rivaled with the KLOS morning team of Mark and Brian, who for three years had the area's top-rated program. In January 1992, Stern reached the number one spot in New York by overtaking the news station WINS, who had enjoyed a ten-year reign. He was reaching over one million listeners a week there, and hosted a live victory parade in Times Square to celebrate. In October 1992, Stern became {{the first person to}} have the number one show in New York and Los Angeles simultaneously, as he acquired a 9.5% market share in New York and 6.4% in Los Angeles. His victory funeral for Mark and Brian was held {{in the parking lot of}} the Los Angeles Palace Theatre in November 1992. By this time, advertisers in New York were charged as much as $3,000 per minute, and $1,500 in Los Angeles, for a one-minute commercial on the show. Following his 1992 debut on WNCX in Cleveland, Stern took the station from thirteenth in mornings to first place in under two years. On June 10, 1994, during the city's funeral broadcast William Alford, an engineer of competing station WMMS, cut a wire used for the show's satellite feed which stopped the broadcast temporarily. Alford was later sentenced to ten days in jail and a $1,000 fine.|$|E

500|$|On May 11, 1988, Mirth & Girth was {{displayed}} at a private exhibition {{in one of the}} school's main interior hallways. The painting was part of a set of six that Nelson was displaying in a judged three-day student fellowship exhibition held to showcase upcoming graduates. Another of his works was a self-portrait titled [...] "I'm Sensitive, and I Love All Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities. As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting. Shortly thereafter, the school began to receive angry phone <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> the painting.|$|E
500|$|Larter first {{appeared}} in the media when she portrayed the fictional character of Allegra Coleman in the November 1996 issue of Esquire. The magazine, which billed Coleman as the movies' next dream girl, told of Allegra's relationship with David Schwimmer, how Quentin Tarantino broke up with Mira Sorvino to date her, and how Woody Allen overhauled a film to give her a starring role. When the magazine was published, Esquire received hundreds of phone <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> the non-existent Coleman and various talent agencies sought to represent her, even after the hoax was revealed. Larter herself received a considerable amount of attention after the cover; she received phone calls from morning TV shows and others for interviews. The Esquire cover led Larter to a role on Varsity Blues. One particular scene where Larter's character, Darcy Sears, wears nothing but whipped cream to cover herself has become a media favorite. It has been referenced a number of times in the media including on MTV's Jersey Shore where one character refers to it as the [...] "Varsity Blues outfit". The scene also made Maxim list of Earth-Shattering Nude Scenes at #9.|$|E
500|$|Pam and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are invited}} to Pam's former fiancé Roy Anderson's (David Denman) wedding, which takes place at 8am before work.

During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E

500|$|The main talking {{point after}} the race was Hamilton's {{assertion}} {{that he would have}} preferred to go on a different strategy compared to his teammate to have a chance of passing him, an option denied by his team. Hamilton lobbied for his team to allow the drivers to take more risks, while his team principal, Toto Wolff, insisted that the team, not the drivers, were at liberty to make <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> strategy. Opinions on the matter were divided in the following days. [...] world champion Damon Hill shared Hamilton's frustration, saying: [...] "I have some sympathy with what Lewis was saying, the drivers should be allowed to call the shots - and if he wants to try something different and basically zag when the other guy is zigging." [...] Daniel Johnson, writing for The Daily Telegraph, concurred: [...] "It was not just Hamilton's failure to win the Brazilian Grand Prix, following home an obdurate Nico Rosberg; it was the manner of it, lacking the killer move while obeying a Mercedes strategy which rendered the drivers more robots than racers." [...] Meanwhile, the Daily Mails Jonathan McEvoy agreed with Mercedes' call, saying that it was [...] "a no-brainer for Mercedes to keep their drivers comfortably first and second by the safest means".|$|E

2500|$|An {{incident}} of disinformation about coprolalia and Tourette's involved Dr. Laura Schlessinger. According {{to the former}} Tourette Syndrome Association (name changed to Tourette Association of America in 2015), she berated a caller inquiring whether a child with TS should attend a family wedding, declaring {{that a majority of}} those with the condition exhibited coprolalia and should be excluded from many social situations, provoking an avalanche of angry <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> the misinformation. Garrison Keillor, radio show host of NPR's A Prairie Home Companion, produced a segment in 2006, titled [...] "Broadway Tourette's", about segregating people with stereotypical TS from other passengers on a cruise ship, prompting a press release from the Tourette Syndrome Association.|$|E
2500|$|More than a {{week after}} the death of Mr. Starks, police {{departments}} {{on both sides of the}} city were still being swamped with excited <b>calls</b> <b>about</b> prowlers and gunshots. Reports arranged from the possible to the ridiculous, yet officers diligently checked every report. On Friday, May 10, officers rushed to a home on Olive street with reports of strange noises coming from an upstairs room. Officers found a cat thrashing about in a trash can. Again on Olive street, officers checked a report that a strange man was on someone's porch. It turned out that he had stepped out of the rain to wait for a bus. On Magnolia street, a report of a prowler bumping up against a house turned out to be hedges being blown against it. On Sixteenth street, a family called in that they heard a tapping at their door. It was later discovered that a messenger was delivering a special letter. At one point, when white-faced calves broke loose around County Avenue and slept on lawns, frightened residents called to report [...] "white-faced things in the dark". Gunshots that were heard turned out to be someone shooting at something they thought was a prowler (usually a shadow), accidental discharges from people loading their guns, and even backfires from vehicles.|$|E
