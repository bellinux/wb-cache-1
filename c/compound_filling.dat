50|$|There are {{important}} Buddhist ruins {{in an area}} of this island and some key remains were found. Muhammad Ismāīl Dīdī, leading member of the committee exploring the Buddhist ruins of Toddu Island in the 1950s, was amazed at the care with which a Buddha statue they found had been buried. His mind wandered back to the time of forceful conversion and his opinion was:Even though the people in Malé had already become Muslims, (Toddu) islanders were still attached to the Buddhist tradition. However, knowing that they had to submit to the official religion, they decided to hide the idol they used to worship and did so with utmost care. As fast as they could, they removed the idol (budu) from its pedestal and placed it on a depression of the floor of the surrounding temple <b>compound</b> <b>filling</b> it with fine sand. They buried it very respectfully along with other holy implements and flower garlands, circling the perimeter with stones. They didn’t destroy the temple building itself, probably because our ancestors of this island hoped that after a short time, the Buddhist religion would establish itself again. Then {{they would be able to}} reinstate the idol to its original position.Unfortunately the Buddhist sites were not protected after excavation and have been vandalized in recent times.|$|E

This present work studies the kinetics of the flocculation process in silica-reinforced natural rubber (NR) compounds by following the changes of the storage modulus during thermal annealing under conditions applied for vulcanization. The results demonstrate that silica flocculation can be effectively suppressed by increasing compound dump temperature and amount of silane, as these result in a better degree of dispersion, higher degrees of hydrophobation, and filler–rubber interaction. The compounds containing highly dispersible silicas exhibit greater filler–rubber interaction, but their flocculation processes develop faster when compared to the <b>compounds</b> <b>filled</b> with conventional silicas.

In this work, the influences of various silicas, silane coupling agents and diphenylguanidine (DPG) on the properties of compounds and vulcanizates, i. e. cure characteristics, Mooney viscosity, flocculation kinetics, bound rubber content, Payne effect, tan δ at 60 °C, tensile and tear properties are investigated. The results demonstrate that compound viscosity and curing behavior, as well as vulcanizate properties of the silica-filled NR are much improved by incorporating silane coupling agents. Bis-triethoxysilylpropyltetrasulfide (TESPT) clearly gives better overall properties than the disulfide-based silane (TESPD), except for scorch safety. DPG acts as a synergist to sulfenamide primary accelerators, as well as activator for the silanization reaction. Highly dispersible (HD) silicas can significantly enhance the degree of dispersion, and so lead to higher filler-rubber interaction. As a consequence, the HD silicas provide better dynamic and mechanical properties for filled NR vulcanizates compared to conventional (CV) counterparts. The optimal quantities of both, silane coupling agent and DPG, required in the formulation are correlated to the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) specific surface area of the silicas.

40|$|Abstract. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is {{normally}} added into the rubber compounds {{as a white}} pigment and inorganic filler for an improvement of thermal property. TiO 2 is also known to have an outstanding photocatalytic activity. This work investigates the properties of natural rubber (NR) <b>compounds</b> <b>filled</b> with 5 phr of nano-TiO 2 (n-TiO 2). Since the direct incorporation of n-TiO 2 into NR encounters incompatibility problem, therefore two types of coupling agent (i. e. bis-(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT) and isopropyl trioleyl titanate (ITT)) are used. The coupling agent loading is varied {{in a range of}} 0 - 20 wt % relative to the n-TiO 2. Mooney viscosities and minimum cure torque (ML) of the compounds increase with increasing coupling agent content and the ones with ITT show higher viscosity than the mixes with TESPT. The use of TESPT leads to shorter optimum cure time and higher torque difference compared to the use of ITT. The addition of n-TiO 2 results in the improved modulus, reinforcing index and tensile strength compared to the unfilled vulcanizate. The presence of both TESPT and ITT significantly reduces a photodegradation efficiency. The difference in the properties and photocatalytic activity of n-TiO 2 filled NR having TESPT and ITT as coupling agent indicates their possible different level of dispersion and interactions at the interphases...|$|R
40|$|Carboxylated {{acrylonitrile}} butadiene rubber (XNBR) latex {{was filled with}} surface modified precipitated silica. Surface modification of silica was affected in an aqueous medium by reacting with a synthetic polymer (SP) containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The effectiveness of SP in enhancing reinforcing action of silica in XNBR latex films was evaluated through investigation of mechanical properties of vulcanized latex films cast from XNBR latex <b>compounds</b> <b>filled</b> with modified silica over a range of 5 to 20 phr loadings. Tear strength, which is an important mechanical property in certain latex based products like gloves, of modified silica filled cast films {{was found to be}} improved in comparison with that of unmodified silica filled cast films. Tear properties of cast films were continued to increase within the range of filler loadings investigated. An optimization of tensile strength was observed at 15 phr filler loading in films containing modified fillers and it exceeds the tensile strength of unmodified filler added films with same loading. Morphological studies performed by scanning electron microscopy illustrated that a better distribution of modified filler particles within the XNBR matrix has occurred which may be a consequence of the discouragement of filler aggregation with surface modification. Surface modification of silica has improved the reinforcement action on XNBR. IEEE			 IEEE Sri Lanka Section			 Robotics and Automation Section Chapter, IEEE Sri Lanka Sectio...|$|R
