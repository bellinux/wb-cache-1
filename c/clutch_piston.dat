40|$|Owing to {{the high}} power {{requirements}} of tractors, their low-power transmission gears often experience durability problems such as burning of the clutch. The operation of tractors under high load conditions also causes clutch slip, with the consequent longer operation duration exacerbating the burning of the friction plate. Solving this problem requires effective lubricant distribution. This was achieved {{in the present study}} by the development of an analysis model for predicting the lubricant flow rate. The reliability of the model was verified by comparing its predictions for various operation conditions with experimental measurements. Using the model, it was determined that effective distribution of the lubricant could be achieved without significant modification of the system, by only adjusting the gaps between the <b>clutch</b> <b>piston</b> and the housing, and between the separation plates and the case...|$|E
40|$|A low-order {{dynamic model}} of a clutch for {{hydraulic}} control in an automatic transmission is developed by separating dynamics of the shift into four regions based on <b>clutch</b> <b>piston</b> position. The first three regions of the shift are captured by a physics-based model and the fourth region is represented by a system identification model. These models are determined using nominal values and validated against nominal and off-nominal experimental data. The model provides two lumped flow parameters {{to be used for}} tuning to the desired hydraulic clutch system. Using feedback information from the model and transmission mechanicals, a closed -loop adaptive controller is designed. The controller is structured to update at three different rates: every time instance, every shift, and every n-th number of shifts. Part of the controller is designed to operate in open-loop for the first two regions of the shift until feedback information is available. The open-loop controller adapts within the shift, thus allowing for corrections to the control design to be made in following shifts. The model tuning parameters as well as the main spring preload become the adaptive parameters, which are then adjusted so that the plant matches the model. The control design is validated against a high fidelity simulation model of the transmission hydraulics and mechanicals. by Sarah Marie Thornton. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{the modern}} production, the {{measurement}} of surface functions {{becomes more and more}} important. Most previous work on surface functional characterization are focused on surface tribological properties (roughness domain) and cover only a small area of a large engineering surface. Therefore, characterizing large engineering surface comprehensively and rapidly presents significant challenges. This research is focused on extracting 3 D surface features from waviness domain and using these features to predict surface function and detect machining errors. In this research, an improved Gaussian filter is first designed to accurately extract 3 D surface waviness from a large surface height map measured by a large field view interferometer. This filter technique enhances the performance of the standard Gaussian filter when applied to a surface which has large form distortion and many sharp peaks/valleys/noise. Following this, a 3 D surface waviness feature of the machined workpiece is defined and applied to assess severe tool wear. Secondly, a two-channel filter bank diagram is developed that applies a 2 D wavelet to decompose a 3 D surface into multiple-scale subsurfaces. 3 D surface features extracted from multiple-scale subsurfaces are then used to predict surface functions and detect machining faults. In the proposed surface decomposition process, two important issues: the elimination of border distortion and the transformation between the wavelet scale and its physical dimension are addressed. Applications of 2 D wavelet decomposition to 3 D surfaces are demonstrated using several automotive case studies, including abrupt tool breakage detection, chatter detection, cylinder head mating/sealing surface leak path detection, and transmission <b>clutch</b> <b>piston</b> surface non-clean up detection. Finally, a novel and automated surface defect detection and classification system for flat machined surfaces is designed. The purpose of this work is to extract microscopic surface anomalies and assign each anomaly to a surface defect type commonly found on the automotive machined surfaces. A “breadboard” version surface defect inspection system using multiple directional illuminations is constructed. Related image processing algorithms are developed to detect and identify 5 types of 2 D or 3 D surface defects (pore, 2 D blemish, residue dirt, scratch, and gouge) ...|$|E

Never available for private ownership, the car was produced in small scale all the way until 1981. In 1963, GAZ introduced the world's first Q-car, the GAZ-23, by transplanting the large V8 engine and the powertrain of the Chaika into the unibody Volga. The transmission was adapted to the steering column shifter. This car was primarily used as a motorcade escort by the KGB's ninth directive (responsible for personal security).|$|R
40|$|Part 11 : Engineering Applications of AI and Artificial Neural NetworksInternational audienceIn a wet <b>clutch</b> system, a <b>piston</b> {{is used to}} {{compress}} the friction disks to close the clutch. The position and the velocity of the piston are the key effectors for achieving a good engagement performance. In a real setup, {{it is impossible to}} measure these variables. In this paper, we use transmission torque and slip to approximate the piston velocity and position information. By using this information, a process neural network is trained. This neural predictor shows good forecasting results on the piston position and velocity. It is helpful in designing a pressure profile which can result in a smooth and fast engagement in the future. This neural predictor can also be used in other model-based control techniques...|$|R
40|$|Nickel alloys have wide-spread {{applications}} in mechanical, tribological and corrosion components such as <b>clutches,</b> cylinder liners, <b>pistons</b> in {{the automotive industry}} and marine components in sea water owing to its relative corrosion resistant & good thermal conductivity. The presence of silicon results in reduction of the co-efficient of thermal expansion of nickel & produces an alloy with good casting machining & corrosion characteristics. Further it is reported that addition of silica, improves the mechanical properties {{which in turn has}} profound influence on the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of Nickel-SiO 2 alloys. Therefore an investigation in the present research will be made to fabricate and evaluate the microstructure, corrosion of chilled composites consisting of nickel matrix and fused SiO 2 particles as the reinforcement (size 40 - 150 µm) in the matrix. The reinforcement being added ranges from 3 to 12 wt. % in steps of 3 %. The resulting composites cast in moulds containing metallic and non metallic chill block (MS, SiC & Cu) were tested for their microstructure and corrosion behaviors. The main objective of the present research is to obtain fine grain Ni/SiO 2 chilled sound composite having very good mechanical and corrosion properties...|$|R

All were {{delivered}} to Tony Longhurst Racing for final preparation by the Frank Gardner run team. Eleven were {{made available to the}} general public (who had to possess a CAMS license to be allowed to buy one), while four were retained for the race series. The M3-R had locally sourced King springs fitted to Group N adjustable struts and rear perches, AP Racing twin plate <b>clutch</b> and four <b>piston</b> brake calipers, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head, A C Schnitzer cams, a 3.25:1 ratio medium case diff and M5 driveshaft, cold air snorkel into air filter box replacing left hand fog light, non-functional rear seat, air conditioner delete and more aggressive tune, GT front splitter and rear spoiler with extensions and gurney strips.

5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a <b>clutch</b> applr). Each <b>piston</b> in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary piston spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|R
