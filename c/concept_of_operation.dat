There {{is a need}} for methods that can systematically incorporate innovative allocations of authority and responsibility in the design <b>of</b> novel <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> to enable them to meet their specified performance and safety goals. This need translates to two objectives: 1) Create the methodology and tools for analysis of allocation of authority and responsibility in novel air traffic <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> and 2) Create the methodology and tools for synthesis of allocation of authority and responsibility in novel air traffic <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> This thesis first establishes concrete definitions of capability, authority and responsibility in the context of function allocations in the design <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> Then, it addresses the first objective by proposing a computational modeling and simulation methodology to assess allocations of authority and responsibility with respect to the performance and safety goals <b>of</b> the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> Subsequently, it addresses the second objective by proposing a methodology based on network modeling and optimization to systematically synthesize allocations of authority under specified allocations of responsibility to meet performance and safety goals. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated on a case study designing of allocations of authority and responsibility in aircraft merging and spacing operations during arrival.

5000|$|Rahner {{examines}} {{evolution in}} his work, Homanisation (1958, rev. 1965). The title represents a term he coined, deriving it from [...] "hominization", {{the theory of}} man’s evolutionary origins. The book's Preface describes the limits of Catholic theology with respect to evolution, further on giving a summary of official church teaching on the theory. The author then continues {{in the next sections}} to propound [...] "fundamental theology" [...] in order to elucidate the background or foundation of church teaching. In the third section Rahner raises some philosophical and theological questions relating to the concept of becoming, the concept of cause, the distinction between spirit and matter, the unity of spirit and matter, the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> and the creation of the spiritual soul. In his writing, Rahner does not simply deal with the origin of man, but with his existence and his future, issues that can be of some concern to the evolutionary theory. Central for Rahner is the theological doctrine of grace, which for Rahner is a constituent element of man’s existence, so that grace is a permanent modification of human nature in a supernatural [...] "existential", to use a Heidegger term. Accordingly, Rahner doubts the real possibility of a state of pure nature (natura pura), which is human existence without being involved with grace. In treating the present existence of man and his future as human, Rahner affirms that [...] "the fulfillment of human existence occurs in receiving God's gift of Himself, not only in the beatific vision at the end of time, but present now as seed in grace.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe feasibility of a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> {{to reduce the}} manpower required during shipboard sensor calibration is investigated in this thesis. The proposed calibration process takes into consideration security concerns and {{the layout of the}} ship whereby cables cannot be laid across decks and stairways. The current calibration process requires at least two technicians, one to read the sensor information displayed on the Machinery Control System (MCS) located on one deck and another to man the reference sensor installed on a different deck. In this thesis, IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN in connection with a Keyboard Video Monitor (KVM) switch is proposed to transmit the sensor information displayed on the MCS to the technician manning the reference sensor, reducing the required manpower to one. The range and number of repeaters used to extend the wireless network is investigated in this thesis to determine the feasibility of this <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> From the experimental results, we concluded that the proposed <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> is feasible for calibration processes that rely on steady-state readings rather than transient responses.
