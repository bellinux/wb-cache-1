5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian {{government}} decided to give the ship, along with much of the fleet, to the newly formed State of Slovenes, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs. This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer of Viribus Unitis to the State of Slovenes, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs, she was renamed Jugoslavija.|$|E
5|$|About 96% of {{inhabitants}} are <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> 98.3% speak Croatian {{as their}} mother tongue. The sex ratio is 90.63 men to 100 women, and {{the median age}} is 39.9 years, which makes Zaprešić one of the younger towns in Zagreb County.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Belgrade {{became the}} capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas, and Belgrade, {{together}} with Zemun and Pančevo, formed a separate administrative unit.|$|E

50|$|The Coalition itself {{originated}} in the Resolutions of Rijeka and Zadar of October 1905, wherein the groups of individual <b>Croat</b> <b>and</b> Serb parliamentary representatives formulated requests {{for the improvement of}} <b>Croat</b> <b>and</b> Serb national interests, respectively, focused on the integration of Dalmatia with Croatia-Slavonia and the elevation of the country's position within the monarchy.|$|R
5|$|Following World War I, the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, and the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost its possessions in the region. In 1918, a short-lived, unrecognised State of Slovenes, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs was formed out of parts of Austria-Hungary, comprising most of the former monarchy's Adriatic coastline and the entire present-day Croatian Littoral. Later that year, the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs formed the Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes—subsequently renamed to Yugoslavia. The new union's proponents {{at the time in}} the Croatian Parliament saw the move as a defence against Italian expansionism such as via provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London. The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and France because of conflicting promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) {{declared}} {{independence and}} decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs, which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats,</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes. The Croatian Parliament never ratified a decision to unite with Serbia and Montenegro. The 1921 constitution defining {{the country as a}} unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Trianon {{was signed}} in 1920, {{at the end of}} World War I, between the Allies of World War I and Hungary (as one of the {{successor}} states of Austria-Hungary). The treaty regulated the status of the independent Hungarian state and defined its borders. Compared to the prewar Kingdom of Hungary (as a part of Austria-Hungary), post-Trianon Hungary lost 72 percent of its territory. The principal beneficiaries of the territorial division of the prewar Kingdom of Hungary were Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes. The treaty established the southern border of Hungary along the Drava and Mura rivers (except in Baranya, where only {{the northern part of the}} county was retained by Hungary). On 4 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs (comprising present-day Croatia) joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats,</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes.|$|E

5|$|After the Erdut Agreement {{was signed}} in 1995, the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was {{established}} to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998. It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, {{and many of the}} pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitants– less than half the pre-war total– of whom 18,199 (57.46%) were <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> 10,412 (32.88%) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs now lived separate social lives. Public facilities such as shops, cafés, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for each community.|$|E
5|$|<b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs hold {{opposing}} {{views of}} the operation. In Croatia, 5 Augustthe day that the HV captured Kninwas chosen as Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day and the Day of Croatian Defenders, the Croatian public holiday when Operation Storm is officially celebrated. In Serbia and the Republika Srpska, the day is marked by mourning for the Serbs killed and those who fled during or after the operation.|$|E
25|$|In {{their joint}} {{statement}} the Bosnian <b>Croat</b> <b>and</b> Serb leadership {{described it as}} a peace agreement. Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, in a letter to United States senator Robert Dole, later presented the agreement as part of a Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina sponsored by the European Community. The parties ultimately parted ways without signing any agreement <b>and</b> clashes between <b>Croat</b> <b>and</b> Serb forces continued.|$|R

5|$|Glina {{is a small}} {{market town}} in the Banovina region of Croatia located about 55 {{kilometers}} (34 miles) south of Zagreb. In 1931, the town itself had a population of 2,315 people and was inhabited mostly by Serbs, <b>Croats,</b> <b>and</b> Jews. Shortly after the Ustaše took power, the Croatian Minister of Justice, Mirko Puk, established a base in the town.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius entered {{diplomatic}} relations with the <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs in the Balkans. He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church {{in regard to the}} Monophysites, by promoting a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism. The Church of the East (commonly called Nestorian) was also involved in the process. Eventually this project of unity was rejected by all sides of the dispute.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Serbs worsened. Serbian President Slobodan Milošević used Franjo Tuđman's actions to his advantage, portraying the Croatian leader and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) as a reincarnation of the Ustaše, a fascist movement that had ruled Croatia during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Some {{estimates}} include 220,000 <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> 300,000 Serbs internally displaced for {{the duration}} of the war in Croatia. In many areas, large numbers of civilians were forced out by the military. It was at this time that the term ethnic cleansing—the meaning of which ranged from eviction to murder—first entered the English lexicon.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes {{was created}} with {{the merger of}} Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav-inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes was established at war's end to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political hegemony.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, {{signed on}} 10 September 1919 {{observed}} that Maribor was firmly {{under the control}} of the Yugoslav army and that, since Slovenes constituted a majority in the region surrounding the city, Maribor should remain, with the rest of Lower Styria, within the Kingdom of Serbs, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Slovenes.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of {{military}} operations in Croatia, <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> a number of Serbian conscripts started to desert the JNA en masse, similar to {{what had happened in}} Slovenia. Albanians and Macedonians started to search for a way to legally leave the JNA or serve their conscription term in Macedonia; these moves further homogenized the ethnic composition of JNA troops in or near Croatia.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990 electoral {{defeat of}} the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia ethnic tensions between <b>Croats</b> <b>and</b> Croatian Serbs worsened, and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana, or TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia.|$|E
