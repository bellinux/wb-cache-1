2500|$|Transmission {{of color}} images using {{mechanical}} scanners had been conceived {{as early as}} the 1880s. A practical demonstration of mechanically-scanned color television was given by John Logie Baird in 1928, but the limitations of a mechanical system were apparent even then. Development of electronic scanning and display made an all-electronic system possible. [...] Early monochrome transmission standards were developed prior to the Second World War, but civilian electronics developments were frozen during much of the war. In August 1944, Baird gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic color television display. In the United States, commercially competing color standards were developed, finally resulting in the NTSC standard for color that retained compatibility with the prior monochrome system. Although the NTSC <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> was proclaimed in 1953 and limited programming became available, {{it was not until the}} early 1970's that color television in North American outsold black and white or monochrome units. [...] Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Proof Validation {{is another}} aspect of process control. While {{calibration}} only ensures that the proofing system is producing output {{as close to the}} baseline as possible, proof validation embeds color charts in the artwork itself to ensure that at the artwork matches an industry <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> or a custom <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> (i.e. a specific press that has been characterized). In short, it validates that the proofing system emulates the desired press results accurately.|$|E

50|$|Stanton {{helped lead}} the fight for color television. By 1950 CBS {{had been working on}} its field-sequential system of color TV for a decade. On October 11, 1950 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{approved}} CBS's system as the first official <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> for commercial broadcasting in the U.S., although subsequent court challenges delayed actual commercial broadcasting until June 25, 1951.|$|E
50|$|With {{technology}} {{rapidly changing}} {{the scope of}} television in 1950, {{the decision was made}} by the Federal Communications Commission to adopt a <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> for all broadcast television networks. Spain participated in the 1949-1950 demonstration of the RCA-compatible color television system. Though the FCC initially dropped RCA's system, a rehearing was held two years later and RCA's all-electronic system was adopted.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, Hitachi {{introduced}} a video disc {{system in which}} chrominance, luminance and sound information were encoded holographically. Each frame was recorded as a 1mm diameter hologram on a 305mm disc, while a laser beam read out the hologram from three angles. It had a capacity of 54,000 frames, with a running time of 30 minutes for the NTSC <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> or 36 minutes for PAL/SECAM.|$|E

50|$|Just as {{with the}} other <b>color</b> <b>standards</b> adopted for {{broadcast}} usage over the world, SECAM is a standard which permits existing monochrome television receivers predating its introduction {{to continue to be}} operated as monochrome televisions. Because of this compatibility requirement, <b>color</b> <b>standards</b> added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called chrominance or C for short, while the black-and-white information is called the luminance or Y for short. Monochrome television receivers only display the luminance, while color receivers process both signals.|$|R
50|$|A {{digitized}} {{version of}} the 1912 book <b>Color</b> <b>Standards</b> And <b>Color</b> Nomenclature lists tawny as AE6938, tawny-olive as 826644 or 967117, ochraceous-tawny as BE8A3D or 996515, and vinaceous-tawny as B4745E.|$|R
5000|$|While the <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> used by palomino {{organizations}} usually {{describes the}} ideal body color {{as that of}} a [...] "newly minted gold coin" [...] (sometimes mistakenly claimed to be a penny), a wider a body color range is often accepted, ranging from a cream-white color to a deep, dark, chocolate color ("chocolate palomino") that may actually be silver dapple or liver chestnut with a flaxen mane and tail.|$|E
50|$|When color signals {{were first}} {{added to the}} NTSC-encoded black and white video standard, the hue was {{represented}} by a phase shift of a color reference sub-carrier. P for phase information or phase shift has carried through to represent color information even in the case {{where there is no}} longer a phase shift used to represent hue. Thus, the Y PB PR nomenclature derives from engineering metrics developed for the NTSC <b>color</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
50|$|APHA color, also {{referred}} to as the Hazen scale, and more appropriately as the Platinum Cobalt(Pt/Co) scale, is a <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> named for the American Public Health Association and defined by ASTM D1209.

APHA color is a color scale sometimes referred to as a “yellowness index” that is used to assess the quality of liquids that are clear to yellowish in color.|$|E

5000|$|In December 1953 the FCC {{unanimously}} approved what is {{now called}} the NTSC color television standard (later defined as RS-170a). The compatible <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> retained full backward compatibility with existing black-and-white television sets. Color information was added to the black-and-white image by introducing a color subcarrier of precisely 315/88 MHz (usually described as 3.579545 MHz or 3.58 MHz). The precise frequency was chosen so that horizontal line-rate modulation components of the chrominance signal would fall exactly in between the horizontal line-rate modulation components of the luminance signal, thereby enabling the chrominance signal to be filtered out of the luminance signal with minor degradation of the luminance signal. Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits at the time the <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz. [...] The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz = 9/572 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by existing television receivers.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1950, a {{joint venture}} of CBS and the Washington Post {{purchased}} WOIC from Bamberger/Macy's for $1.4 million. The new owners, WTOP Incorporated (the Washington Post owned 55%, with CBS holding the remaining 45% stake), changed the station's call sign to WTOP-TV, after its new sister station WTOP radio (then at 1500 AM). Since WTOP took the callsign from the radio partners at the time, the callsign was a coincidence under ownership of the publisher, since they never stood for [...] "WashingTOn Post"; they instead stood {{for the fact that}} what was then known as WTOP was [...] "at the TOP of city's radio dial" [...] (WTOP has been known as WFED since 2006, and is now owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, not by the Post). In July 1950, WTOP-TV became the first television station in Washington authorized to broadcast color television in the 405-line field sequential <b>color</b> <b>standard,</b> which was incompatible with the black-and-white 525-line NTSC standard. Color broadcasts continued for nearly 30 months, when regulatory and commercial pressures forced the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to rescind its original <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> and begin the process of adopting the 525-line NTSC-3 standard, developed by RCA to be backwards compatible with the existing black-and-white televisions.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{it makes}} sense to align the proof with the press, but in other cases {{it makes sense}} to align the press with the proof. Typically, one would align the press with the proof when one is trying to achieve a {{particular}} industry specification (i.e. Fogra, GRACoL, SWOP, etc.). In situations where one is trying to achieve the best possible color on a particular press, typically to distinguish oneself as a printer, one would define a custom <b>color</b> <b>standard</b> for the press and then align the proof with the press.|$|E
