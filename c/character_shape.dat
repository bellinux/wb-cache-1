5000|$|Full-screen {{resolution}} {{generated by}} the SAA5050 was 480&times;500 pixels, corresponding to 40&times;25 characters. Each character position therefore corresponded to a 12&times;20 pixel space. Internally each <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> was defined on a 5&times;9 pixel grid. This was then interpolated by smoothing diagonals to give a 10&times;18 pixel character, with a characteristically angular shape, surrounded {{to the top and}} to the left by two pixels of blank space. This gave a particularly stable and flicker-free arrangement on interlaced displays. The alternate set of 2&times;3 block graphic characters were created on the same 12&times;20 pixel grid, so that the top two blocks were each 6&times;6 pixels, the middle two blocks each 6&times;8 pixels, and the bottom two blocks again 6&times;6 pixels (or two fewer in each direction, if the [...] "separated graphics" [...] control character had been sent).|$|E

50|$|Unicode {{includes}} {{a mechanism for}} modifying <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> that greatly extends the supported glyph repertoire. This covers the use of combining diacritical marks. They are inserted after the main character. Multiple combining diacritics may be stacked over the same character. Unicode also contains precomposed versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters. For example, é can be represented in Unicode as U+0065 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E) followed by U+0301 (COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT), {{but it can also}} be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character. To deal with this, Unicode provides the mechanism of canonical equivalence.|$|E
5000|$|Optical size {{allows the}} <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> to be {{modified}} based on how large it will appear to the reader.

These changes are designed to make small type easier to read. At larger sizes, these details can be finer and the lines more delicate. Note that the optical size is independent from the actual size of the type. It is up to the user to pick the appropriate optical size for the application and viewing environment (for example, a billboard would want to use small optical size even for extremely large text).|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the alphabetically {{arranged}} ABC Chinese-English Dictionary, {{virtually every}} Chinese dictionary {{was based upon}} character head entries, arranged either by <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> or pronunciation, that subsume words and phrases written with that head character as the first syllable. While pronunciation determines the placement of words within the unconventional ABC Dictionary, Chinese characters still determine the position of words within a standard dictionary. Comparing a Chinese character-based dictionary with the pinyin-based ABC Dictionary illustrates the difference. The Chinese-English Dictionary (Wu 1979: 431) locates the head character entry lín 林 [...] "① forest; woods; grove ② circles …" [...] as one of 14 characters pronounced lín, and alphabetically lists 17 words with lín as the first syllable, for instance, línchǎnpǐn 林产品 [...] "forest products", línhǎi 林海 [...] "immense forest", and línyè 林業 [...] "forestry". The ABC Dictionary includes lín 林 [...] "① forest; woods; grove ② forestry…" [...] as one of 6 characters pronounced lín, followed by alphabetically listed lin-initial headwords from línbā 淋巴 [...] "lymph" [...] to línfēng 臨風 [...] "facing against the wind", but then ling-initial words begin to appear with líng 〇 [...] "zero", and only after another three pages will one find lìngzūn 令尊 [...] "(courteous) your father" [...] followed by línhǎi [...] "immense forest" [...] (McGinnis 1997: 568). DeFrancis' ABC Chinese-English Dictionary is aptly described as having [...] "defied the tyranny of Chinese characters" [...] (Clark 2001: 387).|$|E

40|$|A new {{technique}} to locate content-representing words {{for a given}} document image using abstract representation of character shapes is described. A <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> code representation defined by {{the location of a}} character in a text line has been developed. <b>Character</b> <b>shape</b> code generation avoids the computational expense of conventional optical character recognition (OCR). Because <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> codes are an abstraction of standard character code (e. g., ASCH), the mapping is ambiguous. In this paper, the ambiguity is shown to be practically limited to an acceptable level. It is illustrated that: first, punctuation marks are clearly distinguished from the other characters; second, stop words are generally distinguishable from other words, because the permutations of <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> codes in function words are characteristically different from those in content words; and third, numerals and acronyms in capital letters are distinguish- able from other words. With these classifica- tions, potential content-representing words are identified, and an analysis of their distribution yields their rank. Consequently, introducing <b>character</b> <b>shape</b> codes makes it possible to inexpensively and robustly bridge the gap between electronic documents and hard-copy documents for the purpose of content identifi- cation...|$|E

Our work uses a different technology to provide this transformation. <b>Character</b> <b>shape</b> coding is a computationally efficient, extraordinarily robust, means of providing access to the character content of document images. While this transform is lossy, sufficient salient information is retained to support many applications.

This weighting scheme enhances the feature elements that belongs to the distinguishable portions of the similar <b>shaped</b> <b>characters</b> and reduces the feature elements of the common portion of the characters, so that similar <b>shaped</b> <b>characters</b> can be identified easily.
