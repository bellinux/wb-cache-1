50|$|The {{strategy}} was {{a variant of}} the Query Incentive Network model of Kleinberg and Raghavan, with the main difference being that the incentive rewards in the team's technique scale down for later participants. The recursive nature of the reward had two beneficial effects. First, participants had an incentive to involve others, as these new people would not become competitors for the reward but rather <b>cooperating</b> <b>partners.</b> Second, people not located in the United States were motivated to participate by passing along information even though they had no way of locating a balloon in person. This helped the team garner a large number (over 5,000) of participants. The team only began with four initial participants.|$|E

Portuguese and German data from the harmonised Community Innovation Survey (CIS III) allow us to compare innovation cooperation behaviour of private firms in the two countries. Using a bivariate probit model, we show that the characteristics of firms cooperating with foreigners in both countries are quite similar. International activities other than cooperation, firm size {{and the importance of}} protection methods for knowledge have a positive influence in both countries on the decision to <b>cooperate</b> with foreign <b>partners.</b> Some differences remain, however: In Germany, exporters are more likely to <b>cooperate</b> with foreign <b>partners</b> than non-exporters, whereas in Portugal this is not the case.

50|$|Relationships {{are usually}} based on {{resource}} ties, activity links and/or actor bonds (Ford et al., 2006). A company should therefore analyze their firm itself, their relationships and their business networks {{in terms of}} activities, actors and resources. In this way, a company can determine where there are new opportunities for relationships and where resources, technologies and/or skills can be developed, integrated or exploited from other companies (Ford et al., 2006). In this way, business development can be established with help of this business network. Nowadays, marketing is about the exchange of heterogeneous resources between dynamic, <b>cooperating</b> <b>partners</b> in network-like structures (Hakansson et al., 2004). It is about relationships, not about selling products. So, business marketers should be busy finding, developing and managing of relationships within the complex network that surrounds them (Ford et al., 2006). Blois (2004) provides three ways in which a firm can evolve from market to network mechanism. These are entrepreneurial alertness (being alert to value-creating opportunities), path dependence (historical events cause solutions to problems and become “locked in”) and replaceability (irreplaceable contributors get much attention of others trying to influence them).|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. While {{the aim of}} {{deepening}} {{integration in}} Southern Africa seems quite evident, the question remains what challenges SADC will face on its way. After introducing the organization SADC, this paper addresses the current challenges of regional integration in Southern Africa. However, in a globalizing world, regionalization is never just an internal affair of one world region. The interrelations with other regions and countries are and have always been an influential factor. Therefore this paper also analyses the role of SADC’s biggest International <b>Cooperating</b> <b>Partner</b> (ICP), the European Union, in the integration process. Finally, part three explores EUSADC relations {{with a view to}} its contribution to the objective of deepening integration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — For a three user Gaussian {{multiple}} access channel (MAC), we propose a new superposition block Markov encoding based cooperation scheme. Our scheme allows the three users to simultaneously cooperate both in pairs, and collectively, {{by dividing the}} transmitted messages into sub-messages intended for each <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner.</b> The proposed encoding and decoding at the transmitters {{take into account the}} relative qualities of the cooperation links between the transmitters. We obtain and evaluate the achievable rate region based on our encoding strategy, and compare it with the achievable rates for the two user cooperative MAC. We demonstrate that the added diversity by the presence of the third user improves the region of achievable rates, and this improvement is especially significant as far as the sum rate of the system is concerned.
