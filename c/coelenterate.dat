This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo <b>coelenterate</b> bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.|$|E

50|$|Nerve nets {{are found}} in species in the phyla Cnidaria (e.g. scyphozoa, box jellyfish, and sea anemones), Ctenophora, and Echinodermata. Cnidaria and Ctenophora both exhibit radial {{symmetry}} and are collectively known as <b>coelenterates.</b> <b>Coelenterates</b> diverged 570 million years ago, prior to the Cambrian explosion, {{and they are the}} first two phyla to possess nervous systems which differentiate during development and communicate by synaptic conduction. Most research on the evolution of nervous tissue concerning nerve nets has been conducted using cnidarians. The nervous systems of <b>coelenterates</b> allow for sensation, contraction, locomotion, and hunting/feeding behaviors. <b>Coelenterates</b> and bilaterians share common neurophysiological mechanisms; as such, <b>coelenterates</b> provide a model system for tracing the origins of neurogenesis. This is due to the first appearance of neurogenesis having occurred in eumetazoa, which was a common ancestor of <b>coelenterates</b> and bilaterians. A second wave of neurogenesis occurred after the divergence of coelenterata in the common ancestor of bilateria. Although animals with nerve nets lack a true brain, they have the ability to display complex movements and behaviors. The presence of a nerve net allows an organism belonging to the aforementioned phyla of Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Echinodermata to have increased fitness as a result of being able to respond to their environment.|$|R

40|$|Extract] Coral reefs are {{generally}} comprised {{of a complex}} array of communities that may include {{many different types of}} <b>coelenterates</b> such as cnidarians (which include hard or stony corals, soft corals, sea whips and sea fans, sea pens, hydroids, zoanthids, and sea anemones) as well as ascidians (tunicates) and sponges. The corals are comprised of hexacorals (stony corals), where polyps have six or multiples of six tentacles, and octocorals, where polyps have eight tentacles. These sedentary <b>coelenterates</b> {{are generally}} not restricted to tropical coral reefs, and species are also found in subtropical, temperate, Arctic, and Antarctic waters...|$|R

5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{validity of}} the term <b>coelenterate</b> is currently disputed, as the Cnidaria and Ctenophora have less in common than previously assumed. Coelentera may only be monophyletic if both Placozoa and Bilateria are included. In particular, the phylogenetic position of Ctenophora is controversial; it was first considered a sub-group of coelenterata but Hyman regarded it as a separate phylum. Some researchers suggest that Coelenterata is not monophyletic, and therefore any group containing Cnidaria and Ctenophora but excluding other phyla would be paraphyletic. However, some genomic studies have found support for monophyletic coelenterates. [...] Despite this uncertainty, the term <b>coelenterate</b> is still used in informal settings {{to refer to the}} Cnidaria and Ctenophora.|$|E
