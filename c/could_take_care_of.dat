25|$|Regarding health care, Ron Paul {{said that}} “managed care isn’t working” and that “drug {{companies}} lobby for managed care”. Paul said, “We <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> these poor people if we weren’t {{trying to maintain}} an empire overseas”. Ron Paul hit continued {{to discuss the issue}} of military non-interventionism, “70% of Americans want war over with and {{are sick and tired of}} big government at home and overseas”. They want their “civil liberties and not allow government to spend endlessly and bankrupt us”. Paul also answered questions related to his experience with Medicaid and endorsed allowing civil unions for same-sex couples country-wide, with marriage itself handled solely by religious institutions.|$|E

When Höglund was four, her mother became very sick {{and had to be}} hospitalised.

[...] "I had felt a great deal of concern about the handling of the United States interests down there and in the Atlantic, vis-à-vis the British...I had felt that the United States viewpoint had been handled rather naively in some previous instances and that it was imperative that we put somebody down there who <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> these interests." [...] Carney selected Admiral Jerauld Wright, who relieved McCormick on April 12, 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{reaction}} to the decision was highly unfavorable. Much of the public viewed the outcome as a gross violation of property rights and as a misinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment, the consequence {{of which would be}} to benefit large corporations at the expense of individual homeowners and local communities. Some in the legal profession construed the public's outrage as being directed not at the interpretation of legal principles involved in the case, but at the broad moral principles of the general outcome. Federal appeals court judge Richard Posner wrote that the political response to Kelo is [...] "evidence of [...] pragmatic soundness." [...] Judicial action would be unnecessary, Posner suggested, because the political process <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|States' rights {{theories}} gained {{strength from}} the awareness that the Northern population was growing {{much faster than}} {{the population of the}} South, so {{it was only a matter}} of time before the North controlled the federal government. Acting as a [...] "conscious minority", Southerners hoped that a strict, constructionist interpretation of the Constitution would limit federal power over the states, and that a defense of states' rights against federal encroachments or even nullification or secession would save the South. Before 1860, most presidents were either Southern or pro-South. The North's growing population would mean the election of pro-North presidents, and the addition of free-soil states would end Southern parity with the North in the Senate. As the historian Allan Nevins described Calhoun's theory of states' rights, [...] "Governments, observed Calhoun, were formed to protect minorities, for majorities <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> themselves".|$|E

2500|$|Independent {{developer}} Vortex Media Arts {{was placed}} in charge of programming, art, animation, sound, script, and voice artists for the series. Meanwhile, as publisher, Creative Wonders {{was in charge of}} producing, testing, package design, documentation, online assistance, print activities, and consulting. Vortex Media Arts was formed by a 1993 merger of game design and programming technology company Strategic Visions (aka Creative Vision, founded in 1991), and art and animation company Lil' Gangster Entertainment, {{in order to create a}} stronger value proposition to publishers. Prior to the creation of Vortex Media Arts, Lil' Gangster Entertainment partner Jay Francis supervised the animated series of Madeline while working for DIC Entertainment as the shows' producer. Michael Pole was familiar with Lil' Gangster Entertainment through their work for Electronic Arts, as well as Virgin Interactive and Disney Interactive, but felt that while the company <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the animation work of Madeline, it was unable to produce an entire title in-house. After the merger however, Creative Wonders was able to obtain the Madeline licensing deal from DIC alongside the new company Vortex. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, the premiere project of the Madeline video game series, was created on a budget of $500,000 and required 60,000 units to be sold to break even. It cost Vortex $300,000 to produce later Madeline video games, and they were paid through an [...] "advances against royalties" [...] deal, receiving an [...] "advance of $3 on a disc that sells for $20 wholesale"; at least 100,000 copies of a video game had to be sold before Vortex received a royalty. The company saved money during development through an advance called [...] "publisher's assistance", which meant [...] "equipment is essentially borrowed from the publisher"; and the publisher then had the right to [...] "repurchase the equipment at a depreciated value after the project is completed." [...] Many Vortex artists had previously worked on the DIC television series, so had familiarity with the characters and design, and therefore had a lower learning curve. The video game series used an established engine that had already been created by Strategic Visions/Creative Vision, which minimised the technology learning curve. With the money that was saved from the relatively low rights acquisition fee, plus these [...] "business and design caveats", Creative Wonders was able to publish video games with high quality on-screen elements for a cost well below the standard of the industry. [...] Nevertheless, without outside financing, [...] "overhead, salaries, and marketing" [...] costs made royalty reimbursement from the games slim.|$|E
