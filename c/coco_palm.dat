40|$|In many {{tropical}} and subtropical areas, coconut trees (Cocos nuci-fera) {{are grown}} {{for the food}} they produce, and the varieties grown are based largely on fruit characteristics. In Hawaii, the tree is used pri marily for its decorative value and is chiefly {{thought of as a}} tall or dwarf palm. Tall coconut palms may attain a height of more than 80 feet and live as long as 90 years. They begin to bear 6 to 10 years after planting. Dwarf coconut palms rarely grow to be more than 25 feet and bear fruit a little sooner. Frequently the dwarf types produce low quality coconut meat, so they are not good for commercial production of fruits. They are espe cially desirable for landscaping home gardens, where the buildings are low, the space is limited and the fruit is easily accessible. Polynesians use the waxlike inflorescences, the sheaths that enclose the flowers, and the leaves for decorations. HISTORY Revelations 22 : 2 refers to the coconut as "the tree of life, which bears twelve manner of fruits, and yieldeth her fruit every month. " Early Arabs and Europeans {{in the first half of}} the ninth century men tioned that travellers to China referred to the use of coir fiber and of toddy. Medieval writers called the coconut the Indian nut, a palm tree the frond of which produced a fruit as large as a man's head. The genus name of coconut (Cocos) probably was derived from the Spanish word coco, used to describe a monkey's face, because of the three "eyes " at the base of the coconut shell.

40|$|O Rio Grande do Sul se destaca por sua riqueza florística, entretanto, muitas espécies frutíferas permanecem desconhecidas, embora possuam potencial para se tornarem competitivas com as espécies já tradicionais. Neste sentido, este trabalho visa aprofundar a caracterização de alguns frutos nativos da região, estimulando a exploração desta biodiversidade, esclarecendo a potencialidade dos produtos e sua utilização em prol dos benefícios a saúde e o avanço da economia local e nacional. Para isso, foi realizada uma caracterização bromatológica e fitoquímica, como também foi verificado o potencial antioxidante de frutos nativos tais como: araticum (Rollinia sylvatica A. St. -Hil.), araçá (Psidium cattleyanum Sabine), butiá (Butia capitata Mart. (Becc.)), gabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.), uvaia (Eugenia pyriformis Cambes.) e tuna (Cereus hildmannianus K. Schum.). A partir dos resultados, pode-se verificar que entre os frutos da família Myrtaceae, a guabiroba destacou-se por apresentar maior quantidade de compostos fenólicos (1495, 27 mg/ 100 g), carotenóides (54, 35 μg/g), e vitamina C (5, 44 mg/ g) como também um {{excelente}} potencial antioxidante (90, 26 M eq. trolox/g de fruto fresco e 906, 63 g de fruto fresco/g DPPH), indicando ser um fruto bastante promissor tanto para consumo in natura quanto para utilização tecnológica, visto que também obteve melhor relação SST/ATT (45, 12). Entretanto, esse mesmo fruto se sobressaiu com os teores mais elevados de Al (31, 27 μg/g) e Cr (1, 80 μg/g), juntamente com a uvaia (1, 56 μg/g), que demonstrou quantidades superiores de Fe (21, 27 μg/g) e Zn (60, 48 μg/g). A uvaia também se destacou pelo elevado teor de carotenóides (50, 09 μg/g). O araçá, apesar de apresentar teores de compostos fenólicos e atividade antioxidantes inferiores à guabiroba, ainda assim apresentou-se superior a muitas frutas tradicionalmente consumidas. Quanto aos minerais analisados, o araçá amarelo se destacou pelo elevado teor de Na (828, 78 μg/g) e o vermelho de Co (3, 27 μg/g). Em relação ao outro grupo de frutos estudado, de famílias botânicas variadas, o butiá e a tuna apresentaram capacidade antioxidante superior à uvaia e à muitas espécies frutíferas tradicionalmente consumidas. O butiá também se destacou com teor mais elevado em carotenóides (39, 6 μg/g) e nos minerais Cd (0, 06 μg/g) e Ni (4, 99 μg/g). A tuna apresentou maior conteúdo de compostos fenólicos totais (1337, 28 mg/ 100 g) e predomínio de Ba (7, 97 μg/g), Bi (6, 36 μg/g), Ga (6, 02 μg/g), Mg (1215, 54 μg/g) e Mn (207, 90 μg/g). O araticum se sobressaiu quanto a concentração de vitamina C (0, 32 mg/g) e no resultado para SST/ATT (41, 92), mostrando-se adequado tanto para o consumo in natura como para o processamento. Para este mesmo fruto ainda foi observada quantidade de Cu (80, 38 μg/g) acima do recomendado, assim como também teve destaque com maiores concentrações de Pb (0, 10 μg/g), Sr (28, 95 μg/g), Ca (2579, 50 μg/g) e K (11522, 03 μg/g). The Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil) {{stands out}} for its richness flora, however, many fruit species remain unknown, {{although they have}} the potential to become competitive with the traditional species. Thus, this work aimed to deepen the characterization of some native fruits of the region, encouraging the exploitation of our biodiversity, preventing biopiracy, clarifying the potential of our products and their use in support of health benefits and advancement of the local and national economy. For this, we performed a phisicochemical and phytochemical characterization, and also was determined the potential of antioxidant custard apple (araticum) (Rollinia sylvatica A. St. - Hil.), Guava (araçá) (Psidium cattleyanum Sabine) <b>coco</b> <b>palm</b> (butiá) (Butia capitata Mart. (becc.)), gabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.), uvaia (Eugenia pyriformis Cambes.) and tuna cactus (tuna) (Cereus hildmannianus K. Schum.). From the results, one can see that among the fruits of the Myrtaceae, the guabiroba stood out due to its greater quantity of phenolic compounds (1495. 27 mg/ 100 g), carotenoids (54. 35 μg/g), and vitamin C (5. 44 mg/g), as well as, an excellent antioxidant potential (90. 26 M trolox/g and 906. 63 g/g DPPH) could be a promising fruit for both fresh consumption and for use technology, since they also obtained better TSS/TTA ratio (45. 12). However, the guabiroba showed the highest levels of Al (31. 27 μg/g) and Cr (1. 80 μg/g), together with uvaia (1. 56 mg/g), which showed higher amounts Fe (21. 27 μg/g) and Zn (60. 48 μg/g). The uvaia also stood out for presenting a relevant carotenoid content (50. 09 μg/g). Yellow guava, although showing a lower phenolic compound content and antioxidant activity then the guabiroba, nevertheless showed much higher values than many traditionally consumed fruit. Regarding minerals, the yellow guava stood out high concentrations of Na (828. 78 μg/g) and the red guava Co (3. 27 μg/g). The <b>coco</b> <b>palm</b> (25. 96 trolox μM/g and 3847. 54 g/g DPPH) and tuna cactus (19. 61 trolox μM/g 3249. 77 g/g DPPH) showed higher antioxidant capacity than many fruit species traditionally consumed. In the other group of fruits studied, in various plant families, the <b>coco</b> <b>palm</b> fruit stood out due to its elevate carotenoid content (39. 6 μg/g) and minerals Cd (0. 06 μg/g) and Ni (4. 99 μg/g). The tuna cactus fruit showed the highest total phenolic compound content (1337. 28 mg/ 100 g) and predominance of Ba (7. 97 μg/g), Bi (6. 36 μg/g), Ga (6. 02 μg/g) Mg (1215. 54 μg/g) and Mn (207. 90 μg/g). Although the custard apple showed the highest vitamin C content (0. 32 mg/g) showed the best result for the TSS/TTA ratio (41. 92), and was thus adequate for both in natura consumption and for processing. This fruit was also observed amounts of Cu (80. 38 μg/g) above the recommended, as was also stood out for its high concentrations of Pb (0. 10 μg/g), Sr (28. 95 μg/g), Ca (2579. 50 μg/g) and K (11, 522. 03 μg/g) ...|$|E
