He also designed the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar at the request of the Al-Thani Family. Although it was originally planned for the <b>corniche</b> <b>road</b> along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E

6000|$|If {{the little}} {{embankments}} above the <b>Corniche</b> <b>road,</b> which Dr. King {{saw in the}} act of formation by the accumulation of disintegrated and rolled worm-castings, were to become confluent along horizontal lines, ledges would be formed. Each embankment would tend to extend laterally by the lateral extension of the arrested castings; and animals grazing on a steep slope would almost certainly make use of every prominence at nearly the same level, and would indent the turf between them; and such intermediate indentations would again arrest the castings. An irregular ledge when once formed would also tend to become more regular and horizontal by some of the castings rolling laterally from the higher to the lower parts, which would thus be raised. Any projection beneath a ledge would not afterwards receive disintegrated matter from above, and would tend to be obliterated by rain and other atmospheric agencies. [...] There is some analogy between the formation, as here supposed, of these ledges, and that of the ripples of wind-drifted sand as described by Lyell. {78} ...|$|E

6000|$|When the {{castings}} near Nice {{had been}} ejected on an inclined surface, the disintegrated fragments rolled downwards, without losing their distinctive shape; {{and in some}} places could [...] "be collected in basketfuls." [...] Dr. King observed a striking instance of this fact on the <b>Corniche</b> <b>road,</b> where a drain, about 2.5 feet wide and 9 inches deep, {{had been made to}} catch the surface drainage from the adjoining hill-side. The bottom of this drain was covered for a distance of several hundred yards, to a depth of from 1.5 to 3 inches, by a layer of broken castings, still retaining their characteristic shape. Nearly all these innumerable fragments had rolled down from above, for extremely few castings had been ejected in the drain itself. The hill-side was steep, but varied much in inclination, which Dr. King estimated at from 30 degrees to 60 degrees with the horizon. He climbed up the slope, and [...] "found every here and there little embankments, formed by fragments of the castings that had been arrested in their downward progress by irregularities of the surface, by stones, twigs, &c. One little group of plants of Anemone hortensis had acted in this manner, and quite a small bank of soil had collected round it. Much of this soil had crumbled down, but a great deal of it still retained the form of castings." [...] Dr. King dug up this plant, and was struck with the thickness of the soil which must have recently accumulated over the crown of the rhizoma, as shown by the length of the bleached petioles, in comparison with those of other plants of the same kind, where there had been no such accumulation. The earth thus accumulated had no doubt been secured (as I have everywhere seen) by the smaller roots of the plants. After describing this and other analogous cases, Dr. King concludes: [...] "I can have no doubt that worms help greatly in the process of denudation." ...|$|E

Principal thoroughfares are the <b>Corniche,</b> Airport <b>Road,</b> Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street.

Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street #1, Khalifa is Street #3, Hamdan is Street #5, Electra street is Street #7 and so on. Conversely, Salam Street is St #8.|$|R

The city is protected by a wall with round towers, built in 1625, on the western and southern sides. The Gulf of Oman and the surrounding mountains form a natural boundary to the east and north. Until the mid-20th century, the gates were closed three hours after dusk. Anyone on the streets after this time had to carry a lantern with them. In addition, smoking was banned on the main streets and the public playing of music was also banned.|$|R

50|$|Ras Beirut IV or Bergy's Trench is 100 m east of Pigeon Rock, around 1.5 m {{beneath the}} soil {{on the slope}} of the 45 m terrace. The site was found by Auguste Bergy and {{published}} in 1932. Henri Fleisch also studied the area with and published some new discoveries in 1956. Early Levalloisian industries were found including bifacial Bir Hassan picks in the 20 cm layer on the bedrock. Larger flint flakes were found in the 80 cm layer above this. Fleisch recovered more of the earlier type of industry when the <b>Corniche</b> <b>Road</b> was widened and is suggested to still exist under a side road that leads to the Federal Hotel.|$|E

50|$|The Corniche (or <b>Corniche</b> <b>Road)</b> {{is located}} in the city of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It forms a {{sweeping}} curve on the western side of the main Abu Dhabi island and is replete with cycle paths, fountains and park areas. Between 2002 and 2003, land was reclaimed from the sea and the Corniche was extended. Some of the earlier landmarks were demolished in the process. Certain parts of the Corniche have significant deposition of sand, with people using the area as a public beach. Prior to the 1970s, the current area occupied by the Corniche was a beach, where dhows and ships used to anchor and transfer cargo or people; at the time, the Mina Zayed area was not yet constructed.|$|E
5000|$|Boghdadi {{also became}} a member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). In 1953, he was {{appointed}} inspector-general of the revolution's first political organization, the Liberation Rally. To remove and replace Muhammad Naguib, the President of Egypt who had been installed by the Free Officers, with Nasser, Nasser replaced the defense minister, a pro-Naguib officer, with Boghdadi for a brief period from 1953 to 1954. When Naguib was removed from his post and arrested in late 1954, Nasser was still prime minister and transferred Boghdadi to municipal affairs minister. During this time, he was responsible for the construction of the Nile <b>Corniche</b> <b>road</b> in Cairo, as well as the construction of many other new roads throughout the Egypt. For this reason Boghdadi was sometimes referred to sarcastically by his rivals as Abdel Rassif al-Boghdadi, rassif meaning [...] "pavement" [...] in Arabic.|$|E
5000|$|Formerly {{known as}} Cité Claudel, after {{independence}} {{the area was}} named after Aline Sitoe Diatta, an anti-colonial leader from Casamance. Although the name has changed, many still refer to the area as Claudel or Fann.

Just west of the prosperous Medina neighborhood and bordered by the ocean <b>Corniche</b> <b>road</b> and Point Fann, in the early 20th century the area was military drill ground, called the [...] "Champ de Fann", which later became a sports ground. [...] Administratively, it is part of Dakar Plateau, the city center.

5000|$|The {{legacy of}} the Daouk Family {{is one that is}} noteworthy, to the extent that two streets in the Beirut Central District are named after them. Omar Daouk Street is {{situated}} {{at the heart of the}} Lebanese Capital minutes away from Downtown Beirut (Coordinates: 33°53'55"N 35°29'53"E.) The street consists of two parallel roads, with residential and commercial buildings in between the roads that merge at the Omar Daouk Square. [...] "The Omar Daouk Square was designed by Mohammad Halawi around a bust by Maguerditch Mazmanian of Omar Daouk himself. With the aim of upgrading the square from a green island into a space connected to the surroundings, the new design of the Omar Daouk Square enlarges its size, introduces three terraces to soften the site incline, and creates an attractive open area where one can sit and rest." [...] Ahmad Daouk Street (Coordinates: 33°54'3.61"N35°30'0.00" [...] E) is perpendicular to Bab Idriss, which is connected to Omar Daouk Street. The street is two blocks from the Lebanese parliament and consists of a double-way two lane road connecting Beirut's <b>Corniche</b> <b>Road</b> to the Beirut Central District.|$|E
