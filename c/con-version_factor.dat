40|$|This work {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part, the doses in the human lung per unit exposure to thoron progeny, the dose <b>con-version</b> <b>factor</b> (DCF), was calculated. Dependence of the DCF on various environmental and subject-related parameters was investigated. The model used in these calculations was based on ICRP 66 recommendations. In the second part, the human lungs were considered {{as the source of}} beta and gamma radiation which target the other organs of the human body. The DCF to other organs was obtained as 20 mSv WLM– 1, which is larger than the DCF for radon progeny, which was 13 mSv WLM– 1. This is a consequence of the longer half-life of the relevant thoron progeny than that of the radon progeny. It {{is interesting to note that}} after the lungs, where the radiation source is actually located, muscle tissue receives the largest dose...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of sulfur-containing gases and chemiions in the combustor and their {{evolution in the}} turbine of aircraft-engines between combustor exit and engine exit are computed in-cluding the conversion fraction of fuel sulfur into SO 3 and H 2 SO 4. The combustion is ap-proximated by an adiabatic time-dependent box-model. The temperature and pressure evolu-tion in the flow between combustor exit and engine exit is modeled using a quasi one-dimensional (Q 1 D) model. New kinetic models for S-containing gases and chemiions are used. About 1 % of the sulfur molecules are computed to be converted into SO 3 within the combustor and about 10 % into SO 3 and H 2 SO 4 before engine exit. Box models agree with the Q 1 D results for the same initial and thermodynamic conditions, but underestimate sulfur <b>con-version</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 3 if using a linear temperature profile. The number {{of positive and negative}} ions formed within the combustor, mainly NO+ and HSO 4 ¯, depends strongly on the fuel/air ratio and on recombination reactions, mainly with C 2 H 3 O+ ions. The model computes a total ion emission of 2 × 1015 per kg of fuel burned at cruise. Far larger ion concentrations close to values observed behind engines at ground, are computed for higher combustor inle...|$|R
