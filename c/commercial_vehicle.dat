5|$|Representing {{the first}} major change since the VB original, the VK model of 1984 {{introduced}} a six-window glasshouse, {{as opposed to the}} previous four-window design, to make the Commodore appear larger. The revised design helped stimulate sales, which totalled 135,000 in two years. This did not put an end to Holden's monetary woes. Sales of the initially popular Camira slumped due to unforeseen quality issues, while the Holden WB series <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicle</b> range and the Statesman WB luxury models were starting to show their age; their 1971 origins compared unfavourably with Ford's more modern Falcon and Fairlane models.|$|E
5|$|A person under 21 who {{is convicted}} of driving with a BAC level {{of at least}} 0.01%, but less than 0.08% will have their driver's license {{suspended}} for 1 to 3 months, be required to perform 15–30 hours of community service, and take part in an alcohol education program. Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample {{are the same as}} driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a commercial driver's license (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a BAC of 0.04% or greater, drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% or greater, or refuse to submit a breath sample. More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school, or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle. DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered indictable crimes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E

40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the knowledge of passengers about the characteristics of <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles</b> that influence passenger’s choice and makes it attractive to private car users. It therefore presents the preference estimates for various attributes that affect <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles</b> choice, with reference to students in University of Ghana who patronize <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles</b> from Circle bus station in Accra to Kumasi with the main objective of understanding more about {{the factors that influence}} passenger’s choice of <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> A discrete choice experiment was designed to capture the responses for estimating passenger’s <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles</b> choice for various attributes specific to vehicles in the study area, that are loading passengers simultaneously. The main model was generated using the binary probit in STATA which was further segmented according to gender. The magnitude of estimates fromthe probit model indicated that, generally, passengers prefer <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles</b> with entertainment, very new and almost full with passengers. This was generally supported by the segmented model by gender. Also, passengers will generally trade the size and brand off for very new and <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicles</b> with reduced loading/waiting period...|$|R
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a stationmaster who was also responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil storage tank was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicle</b> hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
