25|$|In 1950, the Sierra Club {{had some}} 7,000 members, {{mostly on the}} West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active {{volunteer}} board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small <b>clerical</b> <b>staff.</b> Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began {{to catch up with}} major conservation organizations such as the National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, The Wilderness Society, and Izaak Walton League, which had long had professional staff.|$|E

25|$|Led by Local President, Rosemary DiMaggio and Chief Steward Rose Greenup, {{the members}} of California School Employees Association (CSEA) Chapter 44 walked out when {{negotiations}} for a new contract broke down. The previous year, their counterparts in Chapter #85, at neighbouring Antioch School District had gone out for 9 days, and tensions had been brewing in Pittsburg for some time, so {{it was no surprise}} when the bus drivers, custodians, teacher’s aides, food service workers, <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> and library assistants hit the bricks.|$|E
25|$|During British {{colonial rule}} in Malaya, Malays {{had always been}} {{in close contact with}} British {{officials}} by virtue of being the subjects of the Sultan's Court. Administratively, Malays displayed a highly structured system, which enabled the British to embed themselves into the existing structure with ease. To communicate effectively with the Malay Rulers, Malays were employed by the British to work in Resident's Offices as <b>clerical</b> <b>staff.</b> However, Malays were mostly educated in Islamic madrasah, with little exposure to Western education. To ensure a competent administrative workforce, the British established Malay schools to teach to basic clerical knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were {{a time of}} {{transition}} for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely 'old-style', while large corporations and government departments would already be 'new-style'; other offices would have a mixture. The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> {{to have to learn}} several new systems, one after the other, in just a few years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{declaration}} of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the province chief minister Khwaja Nazimuddin in 1948 {{that the people of}} East Bengal would have to adopt Urdu as the state language, protests broke out amongst the population. Mujib led the Muslim Students' League in organising strikes and protests, and was arrested along with Khaleque Nawaz Khan and Shamsul Haque by police on 11 March. The sustained protest from students and political activists led to the immediate release of Mujib and the others. Mujib was expelled from the university and arrested again in 1949 for attempting to organize the menial and <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> in an agitation over workers' rights.|$|E

[...] On August 20, Prime Minister of Lithuania Mykolas Sleževičius visited Sejny and called on Lithuanians to defend their lands [...] "to the end, however they can, with axes, pitchforks and scythes". According to Lesčius, {{at the time the}} Lithuanian command in Sejny had only 260 infantry and 70 cavalry personnel, stretched along the long line of defense. There were only 10 Lithuanian guards and 20 <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> in the town itself. Mańczuk and Buchowski note that the Polish insurgents estimated the Lithuanian forces at 1,200 infantry (Mańczuk also adds an estimate of 120 cavalry), including a 400-strong garrison in Sejny.|$|E

500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." [...] Within a month their needs were being met.|$|E

2500|$|One {{of the big}} {{breaks for}} the Illinois State Archives came when Norton {{discovered}} paperwork that provided proof of Illinois' land ownership. [...] With the Illinois State Archives considered a subdivision of the public library, Norton was provided with no additional support or <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> and often found herself combing through the refuges of state buildings. [...] On one venture she found a governor's letter book from 1823 which gave evidence that a [...] "Post and Paul survey" [...] of the Illinois and Michigan canal had been done and that the map had been forwarded to the federal government. [...] This find, by clarifying land ownership, quite possibly saved the state {{large amounts of money}} that could have been spent on ensuing court fees. [...] This find also gave Norton some of the repertoire and evidence needed to convince her superiors of the utilitarian value of archives.|$|E
2500|$|During the First World War, the United Kingdom's Army and Navy had {{separate}} {{signals intelligence}} agencies, MI1b and NID25 (initially known as Room 40) respectively. In 1919, the Cabinet's Secret Service Committee, chaired by Lord Curzon, recommended that a peace-time code breaking agency should be created, a task {{given to the}} Director of Naval Intelligence, Hugh Sinclair. Sinclair merged staff from NID25 and MI1b into the new organisation, which initially consisted of around 25–30 officers and a similar number of <b>clerical</b> <b>staff.</b> It was titled the [...] "Government Code and Cypher School", a cover-name chosen by Victor Forbes of the Foreign Office. Alastair Denniston, {{who had been a}} member of NID25, was appointed as its operational head. It was initially under the control of the Admiralty and located in Watergate House, Adelphi, London. Its public function was [...] "to advise as to the security of codes and cyphers used by all Government departments and to assist in their provision", but also had a secret directive to [...] "study the methods of cypher communications used by foreign powers".

50|$|This {{was also}} a time of {{increasing}} use of technology in retail banking. In 1959, banks agreed on a standard for machine readable characters (MICR) that was patented in the United States for use with cheques, {{which led to the}} first automated reader-sorter machines. In the 1960s, the first Automated Teller Machines (ATM) or Cash machines were developed and first machines started to appear {{by the end of the}} decade. Banks started to become heavy investors in computer technology to automate much of the manual processing, which began a shift by banks from large <b>clerical</b> <b>staffs</b> to new automated systems. By the 1970s the first payment systems started to develop that would lead to electronic payment systems for both international and domestic payments. The international SWIFT payment network was established in 1973 and domestic payment systems were developed around the world by banks working together with governments.|$|R

60|$|Burton {{stood for}} a moment upon the {{threshold}} of the office, looking around him. A new and peculiar distaste for these familiar surroundings seemed suddenly to have sprung into life. For the first time he realized the intense ugliness of this scene of his daily labors. The long desk, ink-splashed and decrepit, was covered with untidy piles of papers, some of them thick with dust; the walls were hung with seedy-looking files and an array of tattered bills; there were cobwebs in every corner, gaps in the linoleum floor-covering. In front of the office-boy--a youth about fourteen years of age, who represented the remaining <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> of the establishment--were pinned up several illustrations cut out from Comic Cuts, the Police News, and various other publications of a similar order. As Burton looked around him, his distaste grew. It seemed impossible that he had ever existed for an hour amid such an environment. The prospect of the future was suddenly hugely distasteful.|$|E
