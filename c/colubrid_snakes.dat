25|$|Boa constrictors {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. Boa constrictors also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many <b>colubrid</b> <b>snakes,</b> which have completely lost the left lung.|$|E
25|$|Snakes are {{the most}} common group of {{reptiles}} in the golden eagle's diet, making up about 2.9% of the remains from all studied golden eagle nests, though this figure can be much higher in parts of the range, as shown by studies in Japan (27.5%), Sicily (25.7%, one snake species), Arizona (14.9%, one snake species), Kazakhstan (9.7%, one snake species), and the French Pyrenees (9.7%). Usually <b>colubrid</b> <b>snakes</b> (sometimes called “harmless snakes”) are hunted but venomous species are also occasionally taken, especially the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) in North America and the European adder (Vipera berus) in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles {{that feed}} on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some <b>colubrid</b> <b>snakes</b> are known predators of slugs. Coastal {{populations of the}} garter snake,Thamnophis elegans, have a {{specialised}} diet consisting of slugs, such as Ariolimax, while inland populations have a generalized diet. One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feed on them. The redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) and the brown snake (Storeria dekayi) feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus Dipsas, Sibynomorphus (e.g. Sibynomorphus neuwiedi) and the common slug eater snake (Duberria lutrix), are exclusively slug eaters. Several lizards include slugs in their diet. This {{is the case in}} the slowworm (Anguis fragilis), the bobtail lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), the she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) and the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara).|$|E
