Many analytic approaches are based on simplified phenomenological models in which it is difficult to capture much of the complex physics associated with this system. Conversely, numerical approaches reproduce this complex behaviour, but are limited in the amount of theoretical insight they can provide. Using a systematic approach based on the spatial statistics of spin bath constituents, we develop a purely analytic theory for the central spin decoherence problem of Nitrogen Vacancy centres in diamond that reproduces the experimental and numerical results found in the literature, whilst correcting a number of limitations and inaccuracies associated with existing analytical approaches.
