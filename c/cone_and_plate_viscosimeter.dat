A Bohlin controlled‐stress rheometer with a rapid heating attachment was used. Because of potential slippage and sensitivity problems with cells and cell‐wall material, different geometries (parallel <b>plate,</b> <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate,</b> <b>and</b> concentric cylinder) were assessed. Initial experiments were designed to determine the linear viscoelastic regions for the cell and cell‐wall materials at 25 °C. Samples were subjected to varying shear stresses and oscillatory frequencies. For carrot cells, linearity was observed with <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry <b>and</b> with concentric cylinder geometry over a fairly wide range of stresses <b>and</b> frequencies.

Using the appropriate conditions of geometry, frequency and stress, the influence of heat treatments on cell and cell‐wall rheology was compared. A comparison of <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> concentric cylinder geometry was performed using cells and cell‐wall material heated from 25 to 90 °C. <b>Cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry showed greater changes in rheological properties during heating than concentric cylinder geometry and also allowed a greater range of heating rates. <b>Cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry was used in further studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Disturbance {{effect on}} {{time-dependent}} yield stress measurement of bentonite suspension was investigated using vane <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry. With <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry, the disturbance occurs {{as a result}} of the large strains the suspensions are subjected to when placed on the lower <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> when the <b>cone</b> is lowered to the testing position before the actual shear stress is applied. As an alternative, vane ge-ometry has been used to measure yield stress in bentonite suspension to (1) minimize the placing disturbance, and (2) eliminate the loading disturb-ance. Even though a minimal amount of disturbance was still induced by vane geometry, it was assumed that the amount of disturbance was small enough to be ignored compared to that with <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry. Yield stresses of bentonite suspensions at different weight fractions and vari-ous resting times were determined from stress ramp tests. Linear relationships were developed between yield stresses measured with the different geometries. Disturbance rapidly increased up to approximately 50 % with resting times, then converged at long resting times (60 % at 10 days). This indicates that <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> geometry significantly underestimated the actual yield stress of the tested material because of disturbance.

40|$|A {{large portion}} of Canada's {{reserves}} of crude oil consists of extra heavy crude and natural bitumens. As the reserves of conventional crude oil continue to decline, heavy oil and bitumen are becoming increasingly important sources of hydrocarbon liquids. Oil­-in-water emulsions provide an alternative to heating and dilution methods for transportation of these viscous heavy oils through conventional pipelines. One {{of the most important}} preconditions for implementing this technology is prediction of the flow behavior and stability of the heavy oil-in-water emulsions. Inversion, a process by which one type of emulsion (such as oil-in-water) is converted to another (such as water­-in-oil), is critical because it could cause a region of very high viscosity to form in the pipeline. This research attempts to investigate the causes of inversion, and to develop a simple and effective laboratory method for selecting suitable surfactants and their concentrations at the emulsion pipeline operation conditions. The inversion of heavy crude oil-in-brine emulsions stabilized with non-ionic surfactants has been studied experimentally. Tests were carried out in beakers <b>and</b> in a <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> viscometer. The effects of shear rate, surfactant species and concentration, temperature, and oil fraction on emulsion inversion were studied. Toroid tests were carried out to compare the data generated from the <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> viscometer to that for a pipeline. It was found that inversion of oil-in-brine emulsions was always associated with the disappearance of the non-ionic surfactant from the aqueous phase. The surfactant affinity (i. e., hydrophilic property) for the aqueous phase thus appeared to be critical in the stabilization of these emulsions. Increasing the number of ethylene oxide units increased the hydrophilic property of the non-ionic surfactant and the stability of the emulsion. The emulsion stability also depends on the strength of the interfacial adsorption film. High shear rates not only destroyed the film, but also displaced fragments of the film back to the aqueous phase. The emulsions remained stable only when the surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase was above the C. M. C. level, meaning there was enough surfactant stock to maintain the stability of the interfacial adsorption film. High temperatures reduced the physical strength of the interfacial adsorption film and the repulsive force between oil droplets, encouraging the flocculation and inversion. The toroid tests indicated that the <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> viscometer is probably a good simulation of the emulsion flow behavior in pipelines.

This phenomenon is very useful in heat transfer processes. With this initiation, a mathematical model is developed to investigate the heat transfer behaviour of electrically conducting MHD flow of a Casson nanofluid over a <b>cone,</b> wedge <b>and</b> a <b>plate.</b> We consider a Cattaneo-Christov heat flux model with variable source/sink and nonlinear radiation effects. We also considered water as the base fluid suspended with magnetite nanoparticles. R-K-Felhberg-integration scheme is employed to resolve the altered governing nonlinear equations. Impacts of governing parameters on common profiles (temperature and velocity) are conversed (in three cases). By viewing the same parameters, the friction factor coefficient and heat transfer rate are discussed with the assistance of tables. It is found that the boundary layers (thermal and flow) over three geometries (<b>cone,</b> wedge <b>and</b> a <b>plate)</b> are not uniform. It is also found that the thermal relaxation parameter effectively enhances the heat local Nusselt number and the heat transfer performance is high in the flow over a wedge when compared with the flows over a <b>cone</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate.</b> Keywords: MHD, Cattaneo-Christov heat flux, Space and temperature dependent source/sink, Nonlinear thermal radiation, Casson nanoflui...|$|R
