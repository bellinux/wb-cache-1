40|$|Our event-related {{functional}} MRI (efMRI) study investigates whether visual {{advance information}} (AI) affects rather perceptual or <b>central</b> response-related <b>processing</b> <b>areas.</b> Twelve subjects {{were required to}} make a go/no-go decision to a conjunction of a specific color and motion direction. The stimuli were preceded by a cue, providing 100 % valid advance information about motion direction. Partial and full advance information (PAI and FAI) predicted possible targets, respectively, certain nontargets, neutral cues (NAI) gave no prediction. The time between cue and stimulus (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA) was varied. A response benefit was found after PAI as compared with NAI. The benefit was small with a short SOA (150 ms), increased with intermediate SOA (450 ms) and sustained with long SOA (750 ms). Perceptual and <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>areas</b> were more active with increasing SOA, but only <b>central</b> response-related <b>processing</b> <b>areas</b> were selectively modulated by cue information. In particular, supplementary motor area and bilateral inferior parietal lobe were more active with PAI than with NAI. If comparing NAI with FAI, more errors were made and activity was larger in <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>areas.</b> Our results suggest that, depending on the processing time, cues providing perceptual information modulate central response-related processes. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Oscillatory {{dynamics}} is {{a universal}} design feature of olfactory information-processing systems. Recent results in honeybees and terrestrial slugs suggest that oscillations underlie temporal patterns of olfactory interneuron responses critical for odor discrimination. Additional general design features in olfactory information-processing systems include (1) the use of <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>areas</b> receiving direct olfactory input for odor memory storage and (2) modulation of circuit dynamics and olfactory memory function by nitric oxide.

40|$|The {{study of}} metaphor {{has long been}} hampercd by the post-Aristotelian bias that metaphor is mere poetic figurative language. Such bias has been {{compounded}} by sequential models of cognitive processes cemented into scientific (and subsequently psychological) literature. During the last decade, however, cognitive scientists have begun to re-cvaluate thc importancc of metaphor as {{a key element in}} abstract thinking, realizing particularly thc universality of the metaphoric dynamic. This focus has been further underscored by findings in cognitive neuroscience that show both that languagc proccssing involves visual, motor, auditory, and other neural systems, and that multimodal experiences related to metaphor may converge in <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>areas.</b> Further, they have noted that, rather than being geographically localized, language processing is distributed throughout the brain. To explain this distribution, one anthropological model proposes that growing societal complexity necessitated increased linguistic development for which the brain adapted existing brain areas.

40|$|This study {{examined}} methods for increasing seatbelt usage in {{one type of}} heavy logging machine (the skidder). This machine is used extensively for extracting felled trees and transporting them from where they are cut down to a <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>area.</b> Preliminary investigations suggested that the operators of these machines failed to wear their seatbelts because they were poorly designed and because the operators simply forgot. A survey {{of the literature on}} increasing safety behaviours found that the two most powerful techniques were behaviour modification and human factors engineering (or ergonomics). Therefore, these were the two techniques used here. The standard seatbelts were redesigned to make them easier to use and an orange flashing reminder light was installed into the machines of seven full-time skidder operators. These machines were operating in either Kaingaroa, Rotoehu, Tahorakuri or Te Whakao Forests in the central North Island of New Zealand. The experiment used a multiple baseline single subject design, with the subjects receiving each treatment twice. With the installation of the redesigned seatbelt, mean seatbelt usage for six subjects rose from 21 % to 31 %. One subject refused to wear a seatbelt throughout the experiment. Installing the reminder light increased seatbelt usage by a further 1 %. Removing the new seatbelt design caused usage to drop 16 %. A further decrease of 5 % occurred with the return to baseline phase when the reminder light had also been removed. The second introduction of the new seatbelt resulted in an increase in usage from 10 % to a mean level of 46 %. This was increased a further 22 % with the reintroduction of the reminder light. The results showed that an easier to use seatbelt in combination with a reminder light can increase the level of seatbelt usage. The results also provide further evidence of the power of both behaviour modification techniques and human factors engineering in the field of occupational safety...|$|E

This industry uses machines that make a noise which exceeds the limit point (NAB) 85 dB(A) and the industry has a hearing conservation program. Every year, the industry has audiometric test program to employees. Statistical analytic hasn’t been done by them, especially in correlation the age and the exposured periode with hearing capability. Therefore, the goal this research is to know correlation the age and exposured periode with auditory threshold of employees. This research is a explanatory research with cross sectional approach. The population of the research is all of employees in production unit <b>Central</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Area</b> which is amount 37 persons. By using purposive sampling technique, there are 35 persons as subjects. Datas are shown in to age and exposured periode distribution frequency table and it is processed by Pearson Product Moment analytic test. The result for analytic test in correlation the age with auditory threshold shows “r” value= 0. 749 (r= 0. 51 - 0. 75) and “p” value= 0. 000 (p≤ 0. 01). It means that there is a correlation the age with auditory threshold on strong correlation. The result for analytic test in correlation the exposure periode with auditory threshold shows “r” value= 0. 635 (r= 0. 51 - 0. 75) and “p” value= 0. 000 (p≤ 0. 01). It means that there is a correlation the exposured periode with auditory threshold on strong correlation. The increasing of age and exposured periode, it is followed by the increasing of auditory threshold. It means that the hearing capability decreases because of age and exposured periode. From this research, it can be concluded that there is a correlation the age and exposured periode with hearing capability base on audiometric test result of employees in Production Unit JOB P-PEJ. For suggestion, JOB P-PEJ should make a statistical analytic after they had done audiometric test to employees. It used for next evaluation how the result of audiometric test is.

50|$|For aftertaste, much {{is unclear}} about the {{cortical}} processing {{related to its}} perception. The first neuroimaging study to evaluate the temporal taste profile of aspartame, an artificial sweetener, in humans was published in 2009. In it, the insula was observed to be activated {{for a longer period}} of time than other sensory <b>processing</b> <b>areas</b> in the brain when the aftertaste profile of aspartame was measured. Subjects were administered a solution of aspartame for a specific amount of time before being instructed to swallow the solution. Functional magnetic resonance images of the blood flow in the subjects' brains were recorded before and after they swallowed the aspartame solution. Before swallowing, the amygdala, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia were all activated. After swallowing, only the insula remained activated and the response of the other brain regions was not evident. This suggests that the insula may be a primary region for aftertaste sensation because it was activated even after the aspartame solution was no longer present in the mouth. This finding aligns with the insula's identification as a <b>central</b> taste <b>processing</b> <b>area</b> and simply expands its function. An explanation for less activation of the amygdala was that because it is a reward center in the brain, less reward would be experienced by the subjects during prolonged exposure to the aspartame solution.|$|R
40|$|Organizational and activational {{effects of}} {{estrogen}} (E) {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS) are exerted directly by circulating E and indirectly after aromatization of circulating androgen to E in the brain itself. Understanding an environmental chemical's ability to disrupt E-dependent neural processes, therefore, requires attention to both pathways. Because aromatase (Aro) is highly expressed in teleost brain, when compared to mammals and other vertebrates, fish are technically advantageous for localization and regulation studies and may also provide a model in which the functional consequences of brain-derived (neuro-) E synthesis are exaggerated. Recently, Aro was immunolocalized in cell bodies and fiber projections of second- and third-order neurons of the goldfish retina and in <b>central</b> visual <b>processing</b> <b>areas.</b> Authentic Aro enzyme activity was verified biochemically, suggesting a heretofore unrecognized role of sex steroids in the visual system. Initial studies show that in vivo treatment with aromatizable androgen or E increases calmodulin synthesis and calmodulin protein in retina and also affects retinal protein and DNA. Whether there are related changes in the processing of visual information that is essential for seasonal reproduction or in the generative and regenerative capacity of the goldfish visual system requires further investigation. - Environ Health Perspect 103 (Suppl 7) : 51 - 57 (1995...|$|R
40|$|The {{accessory}} {{olfactory system}} {{is present in}} most tetrapods. It {{is involved in the}} perception of chemical stimuli, being implicated also in the detection of pheromone. However, it is sensitive also to some common odorant molecules, which have no clear implication in intraspecific chemical communication. The accessory olfactory system may complement the main olfactory system, and may contribute different perceptual features to the construction of a unitary representation, which merges the different chemosensory qualities. Crosstalk between the main and accessory olfactory systems occurs at different levels of <b>central</b> <b>processing,</b> in brain <b>areas</b> where the inputs from the two systems converge. Interestingly, centrifugal projections from more caudal brain areas are deeply involved in modulating both main and accessory sensory processing. A high degree of interaction between the two systems may be conceived, and partial overlapping appears to occur in many functions.

40|$|Abstract Background During the {{evolutionary}} radiation of Crustacea, several lineages in this taxon convergently succeeded {{in meeting the}} physiological challenges connected to establishing a fully terrestrial life style. These physiological adaptations include the need for sensory organs of terrestrial species to function in air rather than in water. Previous behavioral and neuroethological studies have provided solid evidence that the land hermit crabs (Coenobitidae, Anomura) are a group of crustaceans that have evolved {{a good sense of}} aerial olfaction during the conquest of land. We wanted to study the <b>central</b> olfactory <b>processing</b> <b>areas</b> in the brains of these organisms and to that end analyzed the brain of Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst, 1791; Anomura, Coenobitidae), a fully terrestrial tropical hermit crab, by immunohistochemistry against synaptic proteins, serotonin, FMRFamide-related peptides, and glutamine synthetase. Results The primary olfactory centers in this species dominate the brain and are composed of many elongate olfactory glomeruli. The secondary olfactory centers that receive an input from olfactory projection neurons are almost equally large as the olfactory lobes and are organized into parallel neuropil lamellae. The architecture of the optic neuropils and those areas associated with antenna two suggest that C. clypeatus has visual and mechanosensory skills that are comparable to those of marine Crustacea. Conclusion In parallel to previous behavioral findings of a good sense of aerial olfaction in C. clypeatus, our results indicate that in fact their central olfactory pathway is most prominent, indicating that olfaction is a major sensory modality that these brains process. Interestingly, the secondary olfactory neuropils of insects, the mushroom bodies, also display a layered structure (vertical and medial lobes), superficially similar to the lamellae in the secondary olfactory centers of C. clypeatus. More detailed analyses with additional markers will be necessary to explore the question if these similarities have evolved convergently with the establishment of superb aerial olfactory abilities or if this design goes back to a shared principle in the common ancestor of Crustacea and Hexapoda. </p...|$|R

Thus, we here investigated the central role of NO in formalin (3 %) -induced orofacial pain in rats by administering membrane-permeable or -impermeable inhibitors, relating to the NO signaling pathways, into intracisternal space. The intracisternal pretreatments with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, the NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, and the protein kinase C inhibitor GF 109203 X, all of which are permeable to the cell membrane, significantly reduced the formalin-induced pain, whereas the membrane-impermeable NO scavenger PTIO significantly enhanced it, compared to vehicle controls. These data suggest that an overall effect of NO production in the trigeminal nucleus is pronociceptive, but NO extracellularly diffused out of its producing neurons would have an antinociceptive action...|$|R
