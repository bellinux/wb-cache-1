40|$|Purpose: A novel {{method for}} dose <b>conformity</b> <b>evaluation</b> of {{treatment}} plans {{produced by the}} stereotactic radiosurgery treatment planning system is postulated. Methods and Materials: By consolidating {{the information contained in}} the integral dose-volume histogram and the treatment volume ratio, a plot of treatment volume ratio versus percentage dose may be considered as a useful tool for plan evaluation. To validate the suggested argument, two simple experiments simulating the conformal and nonconformal cases were conducted on the geometric phantom that is commercially available from Radionics. An actual patient treatment plan is also included to explore the effectiveness of the proposed parameters. It is an attempt to establish the baseline of a conformal plan. Results: A plot showed the ability to give the user an idea whether the size of the collimator was adequate to cover the delineated lesion when the user-defined criteria had been in place. Two parameters, namely take-off dose (TOD) and take-off volume (TOV) were defined. The former was defined as the maximum dose level found {{on the surface of the}} target volume. The TOD is also the maximum possible dose to be received by the adjacent normal tissue. The latter was defined as the percentage of the target volume that received the TOD. Another parameter, irradiated percentage volume (IPV), was defined here as the percentage of the target volume receiving at least the prescribed dose. When the prescribed dose is also the TOD, the IPV becomes the TOV. They were proved to be effective in evaluating the dose conformity. Another term known as equivalent fall-off distance (EFOD) was defined as the equivalent radial distance calculated between two isodose lines. In fact, the dose fall-off rate can also act as a measuring index for plan comparison, because a fast dose fall-off rate is often a requirement for radiosurgery in order to minimize the risk of radiation damage to the surrounding structures. The two phantom studies showed consistent results with the theoretical predictions. The ability of the plot was further explored in the patient treatment plan studies. It was demonstrated that the plot had a remarkable ability to check whether the hot spot is in the vicinity of the lesion. A baseline of a conformal plan was also established; for example, a plan is said to be conformal if its IPV has attained a value of not less than 95 % and its associated TVR is not greater than 2. Conclusion: The proposed method has demonstrated the effectiveness in dose <b>conformity</b> <b>evaluation.</b> It supplements the integral dose-volume histogram to provide a complete information of a treatment plan in terms of dose uniformity and conformity...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{numerous}} numerical calculation methods {{were developed in}} order to quantify structural safety. These developments enabled to provide a quantitative {{answer to the question}} "How safe are our concrete structures ?" and they made it possible to compare different influencing factors. However, the positive effect of quality control on the safety level is most often not considered in these calculations, although this is an important consideration when designing or evaluating performance-based concrete structures. Concrete production is subjected to strict quality requirements. Due to this quality control, the properties of the accepted material are considerably higher than can be expected without quality inspection. Furthermore, this improved quality leads to an increased safety of concrete structures. In this PhD thesis, different aspects of contemporary quality and conformity control for concrete are described in a probabilistic framework and the consequences with respect to the safety level of concrete structures are quantified. Therefore, the current conformity criteria for concrete compressive strength are systematically evaluated in a probabilistic way, as well as in case the family concept is used for the combined quality inspection of related concrete mixes. Further, also an original methodology is proposed to use production control for the <b>conformity</b> <b>evaluation</b> of concrete. The filtering effect of these different types of quality control on the strength distribution of concrete and the safety level of concrete structures is quantified and compared. In order to study the different research aspects, numerous recent developments with respect to Bayesian statistics and numerical simulation techniques are applied. Furthermore, an original Bayesian regression technique is proposed and different assessment methodes for determining the characteristic concrete compressive strength in existing concrete structures are evaluated and compared. With respect to the latter aspect, an original Bayesian method is proposed that allows to take prior information into account when assessing the characteristic concrete compressive strength in existing structures, which is of particular importance in case {{only a limited number of}} test samples are available...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} performance based testing methodology for concrete durability and work currently underway jointly at Queens University Belfast and Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, to undertake this research under a EPSRC funded project (EP/G 02152 X/ 1). EN 206 - 1 superseded BS 5328 on 1 st December 2003 and allows designers and producers to use {{a wide range of}} cements and aggregate types for a variety of exposure conditions. In this new standard, the durability of concrete is specified in terms of the constituent materials of concrete, properties of fresh and hardened concrete, limitations for concrete composition, specification of concrete, delivery of fresh concrete, production control procedures, <b>conformity</b> criteria and <b>evaluation</b> of <b>conformity</b> and verification of these properties. Within this, six basic forms of exposure is also specified, namely XO (no risk of corrosion), XC (Corrosion induced by carbonation), XF (Freeze / thaw attack), XS (Corrosion induced by chlorides from seawater), XD (Corrosion induced by chlorides other than from seawater) and XA (Chemical attack). According to EN 206 - 1, the performance method adopted should be based on satisfactory experience with local practices in local environments from data obtained from an established performance test method for the relevant mechanism, or using appropriate proven predictive models. Therefore, the methods that may be used include those methods based on:- · long-term experience of local materials and practices and on detailed knowledge of the local environment. · approved and proven tests that are representative of actual conditions and have approved performance criteria. · analytical models that have been calibrated against test data representative of actual conditions in practice. The concrete composition and the constituent materials should be closely defined to enable the level of performance to be maintained. In order to determine the best methods for assessing concrete durability for performance, it is important to review those methods which have been developed and used in Queens University Belfast and Heriot Watt University to test for permeability, diffusion and absorption as well as electrical methods used to assess if the performance criteria have been achieved in structures using non-destructive testing methods. Prior to specifying durability performance testing methods, a review of previous projects where limits on permeability, diffusion, electrical resistivity etc, are presented along with the various durability tests used to assess these limits. The examples given are from a number of projects in the UK, Ireland and Europe of varying complexity and size. Due to the relatively small number of such examples in the UK and Ireland, the need for the research presented here is further justified. The proposed experimental work for the EPSRC project is presented which includes a breakdown of the concrete samples, tests and details of a new marine exposure site on the Northwest coast of Ireland. Based on the findings of this experimental work and the numerical calibration using the ClinConc model, development of a methodology for testing the concrete durability to assess the performance limits set will be determined. Through this work, the performance methods adopted will satisfy the EN 206 - 1 guidelines above...|$|R
