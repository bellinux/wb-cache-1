The {{evidence}} {{collected in}} the following pages, in support of their pleading, is so complete, and the summary of his cause given with so temperate mastery by Mr. Somervell, that I find nothing to add in circumstance, and little to re-enforce in argument. And I have less heart to the writing even of what brief preface so good work might by its author's courtesy be permitted to receive from me, occupied as I so long have been in efforts tending in the same direction, because, on that very account, I am far less interested than my friend in this local and limited resistance to the elsewhere fatally victorious current of modern folly, cruelty, and ruin. When the frenzy of avarice is daily drowning our sailors, suffocating our miners, poisoning our children, and blasting the <b>cultivable</b> <b>surface</b> of England into a treeless waste of ashes,[20] what {{does it really matter}} whether a flock of sheep, more or less, be driven from the slopes of Helvellyn, or the little pool of Thirlmere filled with shale, or a few wild blossoms of St. John's vale lost to the coronal of English spring? Little to anyone; and--let me say this, at least, in the outset of all saying--nothing to me. No one need charge me with selfishness in any word or action for defense of these mossy hills. I do not move, with such small activity as I have yet shown in the business, because I live at Coniston (where no sound of the iron wheels by Dunmail Raise can reach me), nor because I can find no other place to remember Wordsworth by, than the daffodil margin of his little Rydal marsh. What thoughts and work are yet before me, such as he taught, must be independent of any narrow associations. All my own dear mountain grounds and treasure-cities, Chamouni, Interlachen, Lucerne, Geneva, Venice, are long ago destroyed by the European populace; and now, for my own part, I don't care what more they do; they may drain Loch Katrine, drink Loch Lomond, and blow all Wales and Cumberland into a heap of slate shingle; the world is wide enough yet to find me some refuge during the days appointed for me to stay in it. But it is no less my duty, in the cause of those to whom the sweet landscapes of England are yet precious, and to whom they may yet teach what they taught me, in early boyhood, and would still if I had it now to learn,--it is my duty to plead with what earnestness I may, that these sacred sibylline books may be redeemed from perishing.|$|E
40|$|Marine macroalgae {{are highly}} colonized by microorganisms, {{with which they}} {{maintain}} a close relationship characterized by both beneficial and detrimental interactions. Alga-associated bacteria have notably developed a range of enzymes enabling them to colonize the host surface and to use algal biomass as a carbon source. The hydrolytic potential of these bacteria, however, has been investigated almost solely at individual scale. Studies have shown the ability of some seaweed-associated bacterial strains to hydrolyze lipids, algal-cell-wall polysaccharides, and other sugars. In this work we aimed to investigate the hydrolytic potential of the bacterial microbiota associated with the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum. For this we employed two complementary function-based approaches: functional metagenomics applied to this microbiota and functional analysis of the cultivable fraction thereof. By functional metagenomics, we identified numerous esterase genes, a beta-glucosidase gene, and an endocellulase gene. The cellulase was purified and biochemically characterized, showing interesting biotechnological features such as halotolerance and activity at low temperature. Furthermore, we assigned tentative origins to the identified genes, thus getting {{a glimpse of the}} bacterial taxa associated with the studied alga. Secondly, we investigated the <b>cultivable</b> <b>surface</b> microbiota associated with three A. nodosum samples. More than 300 bacteria were isolated, assigned to a bacterial taxon and screened for algal-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes (agarase, iota-carrageenase, kappa-carrageenase, and alginate lyases). This allowed the identification of several polysaccharolytic isolates, some of them likely to be new strains or novel species, belonging to two classes: the Flavobacteriia and the Gammaproteobacteria. Subsequently, we constructed and screened two plurigenomic libraries, each produced with the genomes of five representative isolates of each class, and identified several functional genes. With this work we highlight the presence of A. nodosum-associated bacterial taxa likely to entertain a privileged relation with seaweeds and having developed a range of hydrolytic activities assumed to enable them to associate with algae. We also provide information (taxa, abundances, genomic potential) on macroalgal-polysaccharide-degrading bacteria, in which interest has grown over the last ten years...|$|E
40|$|The pre-war Croatian {{village was}} poor, over-populated and in debt. The peasant’s only outlet from this {{difficult}} situation {{in his opinion}} was to enlarge his holding and remain in the village. National ideology gained form from these pre- -war peasant illusions; the idyll of peasant life was preached while industrialization was scorned as a deviation of socio-economic development. Then during the critical historical Period, the Yugoslav Communist Party offered the peasantry a perspective of the industrial development {{and at the same}} time, sympathized with the peasants for fair land partitioning. That was the deciding point which led the peasantry to join the working class as an avant-garde movement and participate in the socialist revolution between 1941 and 1945. Basic facts about the post-war development of the social and private agricultural sector in SR Croatia are presented. The social sector now maintains 15 % of the cultivable land, while the private sector has 85 %. However, the participation of the social sector in the overall production and market production is noticeably larger than its percentage of <b>cultivable</b> <b>surface.</b> Howevet the overall changes in the socio-economic structure of the Croatian village are more significant than the process of socialization of agriculture. Approximately 55. 000 farmers left agriculture annually between 1961 — 1971. Because of this, the rural social structure became heterogeneous. About half of the rural population today are non-farmers, and this number continues to rise. and standard of living of the rural population has significantly increased. More than half of the income (56, 2 ¾) of the farm family is made off the farm, this non-agricultural income is mainly invested in homes and other basic household necessities. Thus, there has been a significantly higher post-war growth m the living standard of the rural population than in the growth of agricultural production. There has been as essential change in the attitudes and values of the rural population, particularly among the younger generation, who wish to find nonagricultural professions. Eighty percent of the farm children continue their education. The author believes that a modern and highly productive agriculture structure should be created in Yugoslavia through various forms of socialization. Furthermore, he believes that the leaders of this new agricultural structure should be a dynamic group of professional agriculturists. These farmers, (manufacturers of goodsh should be part, now more than ever, of the social decision-making body. Society s responsibility is to offer the farmers the same social protection given to other members of society, aboveall health insurance and pension rates. The rural population should have freer access to social and economic institutions. In this way, rural life would become more attractive with definite advantages...|$|E
50|$|During the Sikh rule, Europeans {{who visited}} the Valley {{documented}} the deprivation and starvation and also wrote of the abject poverty of the peasantry and the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. According to European traveler Moorcraft, no more than one-sixteenth of the <b>cultivable</b> land <b>surface</b> was under cultivation and due to starvation many people had fled to India. Kashmiri histories also emphasise the wretchedness of life for common Kashmiris during the Sikh rule. According to them, the peasantry became mired in poverty and migrations of Kashmiri peasants to the plains of Punjab reached high proportions. Several European travelers' accounts from the period agree and provide evidence for such assertions. When Moorcroft left the Valley in 1823, about 500 emigrants accompanied him across the Pir Panjal Pass.The Sikhs lost their independence with the Battle of Subraon. In 1846 Kashmir came {{under the rule of}} Gulab Singh, a Hindu Dogra Maharajah under the British suzerainty.|$|R
