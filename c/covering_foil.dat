40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} (1) improve our {{knowledge}} on existing geochemical methods for detailed {{reading of the}} marine archives, and (2) application of the geochemical toolbox to an area that because of its geographical location, its sensitivity to subtle climate-related changes, and the subsequent preservation of relevant paleo-proxies is a perfect area for studies of abrupt climate change: the eastern Mediterranean Sea. XRF core scanning is an often applied geochemical approach to produce paleoenvironmental records from sediments on cm-scales. In this study it is shown that during measurement a water film forms generally under the <b>covering</b> <b>foil</b> of the sediment. The water-film thickness underneath the plastic foil is highly variable, causing significant apparent variability in all elements from Al to Fe, through absorption by the water content. The unverified use of these elements in ratios can thus lead to deviations in the paleoenvironmental interpretation. It is shown how to recognize erroneous element (ratio) variability using Cl intensities, and a method is proposed for correcting XRF core-scan data using conventional analytical data of a few discrete samples. To produce even higher resolution (μm-scale) geochemical records from sediments, a laser ablation (LA) -ICP-MS line-scan method is tested by production of artificial sediments spiked with Al, V, Mo, and Ba {{in a range of}} concentrations. The data presented indicates that LA-ICP-MS line-scanning has high potential for reliable quantitative analysis of major to trace elements in (laminated) resin-embedded sediments. A standard protocol is described to produce (semi-) quantitative estimates of geochemical proxies on (tens of) μm-scales in sediments. The geochemical tools are subsequently applied to sediments in and around the Nile delta, which generally are deposited at high sedimentation rates. It is shown that Nile discharge during the early to middle Holocene was dominated by Indian Ocean moisture transport. This is indicated by a similar timing (~ 9. 5 ka) as well as similar solar-induced multi-centennial oscillations in Nile discharge, relative to contemporaneous Indian Ocean-derived monsoon records. These solar signals in Nile discharge also influenced paleo-environmental conditions (i. e. productivity and bottom water redox conditions) during sapropel S 1 formation. Moreover, the data in the study reveal that rapid sea-level rise can reduce overturning circulation in the eastern Mediterranean, which likely contributes to sapropel formation. This mechanism acts principally in addition to the primary process of excess-evaporation. Impacts of other controlling factors of Mediterranean overturning (e. g. temperature, net evaporation) are, similar to sea-level rise, expected to be higher at larger rates-of-change. Northern hemisphere cold events were therefore probably important for reduced Mediterranean overturning circulation. That is, because more rapid monsoon enhancement and temperature increase occurs immediately after these events, relative to the change that would have been imposed by insolation alone...|$|E

40|$|The {{criticism}} permanently expressed {{for many}} years with respect to chlorine chemistry has related in particular also to PVC production and its consequences. At present, PVC recycling is {{in the center of}} interest. The possible contribution of recycling to conserving resources and relieving the environment has been studied in more detail and described by formulas. Material recycling takes place at different 'energetic levels' of energy consumed in production, depending on whether products, materials or raw materials are involved. The smaller the number of products is which are decomposed into materials and raw materials, the more stored energy of production can be used in new production as savings of energy. The equations needed to calculate the energy equivalence with or without material recycling, with and without incineration and HCl recycling, stretching of resources, stretching of the capacity of landfills, and CO_ 2 reduction have been derived. The status of PVC recycling in practice has been explored during visits to demonstration plants and in talks with representatives of the PVC industry as regards important PVC products in the construction industry (windows, tubes, floor <b>coverings,</b> <b>foils).</b> The results are described and future PVC recycling potentials estimated. Open questions concerning the PVC material flow, energy and cost aspects, possible ways of disposal of used PVC products not amenable to recycling as well as possible actions are discussed. (orig.)

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the thermal issues related to the National Ignition Facility. In particular, the influences of the HVAC system and lighting fixtures on the operational performance of the laser guide beam tubes are reviewed and discussed. An analytical model of the oscillating HVAC air temperatures in the NIF switchyard and target bay will cause significant amounts of beam distortion. However, these negative effects can be drastically reduced by adding thermal insulation to the outside of the beam tubes. A computational fluid dynamics model and an analytical investigation found that the light-fixture to beam-tube separation distance must be on the order of 5. 7 m (18. 7 ft) to maintain acceptable beam operating performance in the current NIF design. By reducing the fluorescent light fixture power by 33 % this separation distance can be reduced to 3. 5 m (11. 5 ft). If in addition, thermal insulation with a reflective aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>covering</b> is added to the outside of the beam tubes, the separation distance can be reduced further to 1. 6 m (5. 2 ft). A 1. 27 cm (0. 5 in.) rigid foam insulation sheet with aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>covering</b> will provide adequate insulation for the beam tubes in the NIF switchyards and target bay.

40|$|The {{properties}} of single crystals of cadmium sulfide as radiation detectors are described. It {{has been found}} possible to select crystals such that: (a) The ratio of increase of conductivity under irradiation to the rate of absorption {{of energy in the}} crystal is substantially independent of particle energy (over the examined ranges of 500 ev to 80 kev for electrons and 5 kev to 180 kev for protons) and of the magnitude of energy flux (over the range from. 005 to 10 ergs/cm(sup 2 -sec); and (b) The above ration is substantially the same for protons, electrons, alpha particles, x-rays, and gamma-rays. For a driving voltage of 100 volts, typical crystal yield currents of 10 (sup - 7) to 10 (sup- 6) amperes for each erg/cm(sup 2 -sec) of energy absorbed by the crystal. The threshold of such crystal detectors (resulting from dark currents of the order of 10 (sup 10 amp) is typically 10 (sup - 3) ergs/cm(sup 2 - sec). For the selected crystals a response-temperature coefficient of - 0. 25 % per degree centigrade is found for the temperature range - 50 deg C to + 50 deg C. A description is given of a complete CdS total corpuscular energy detector for the study of geomagnetically trapped radiation by means of a satellite. The detector described has a dynamic range great than 10 (sup 4), a solid angle of 10 (exp - 3) steradian, and a detection threshold of approximately 1 erg/cm(sup 2 -sec-sterad). A similar detector employing a small magnet for the selective exclusion of electrons is also described. Noteworthy practical features of these detectors for satellite and space probe experiments are: (a) Use of bare crystals, without <b>covering</b> <b>foils,</b> in order to detect charged particles having energies as low as hundreds of electron volts. (b) Simplicity of electronic auxiliaries. (c) Compactness, lightweight and nechanical ruggedness. (d) Low electrical power requirements; and (e) Conversion of conduction current to the rate of a twostate relaxation oscillator in order to facilitate telemetric transmission of data.

40|$|International audienceLow-pressure {{chemical}} vapor deposition {{synthesis of}} graphene films on two different Cu foils, with different surface oxygen and carbon contents, was performed by controlling H 2 and/or Ar flow rates during heating. The influences of heating atmosphere on the final impurity level, quality of the synthesized graphene films and thickness uniformity were investigated depending on Cu foil impurities. Heating of carbon-rich, but oxygen-poor Cu foil in H 2 environment resulted in <b>covering</b> the <b>foil</b> surface by residual carbon which then acted as active sites for multilayer graphene growth. Ar-only flow was required during heating to promote high quality graphene growth on this foil. On carbon-poor, but oxygen-rich Cu foil high quality graphene growth was promoted when the heating was carried out under Ar/H 2 environment. Almost no carbon residues were observed on this foil even under H 2 only flow during heating. The heating atmosphere affected not only graphene growth, but also the type and amount of impurities formed on the surface. H 2 and Ar/H 2 heating resulted {{in the formation of}} spherical nanometer-sized impurities, while irregular-shaped, large (a few mm) SiO 2 impurities were observed when Ar alone was used during heating.

30|$|One {{important}} question is how the packing density of the model particles compares with that of cometary particles measured in situ. An analysis of the microcraters in the aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>covering</b> the Stardust sample collector reveals the material density of cometary dust particles being in the range 0.3 – 3 g/cm 3 (e.g., Hörz et al., 2006). If we assume the bulk material density for refractory species in comets, i.e., organics and Mg-rich silicates (Fomenkova, 1999; Jessberger, 1999), is in the range 1.5 – 3.5 g/cm 3, one can estimate the material density in the agglomerated debris particles being {{in the range from}} 0.35 to 0.83 g/cm 3. These values are consistent with the Stardust findings. In application to comets, agglomerated debris particles would be classified as those having fluffy morphology.|$|R

This technology is mechanically flexible, bendable, stretchable {{and does not}} need any rigid chips. Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) technology is applied.

40|$|We {{propose a}} concept of {{interferometric}} array based on diffractive focussing that could add {{a new line of}} instruments to the already existing space telescopes and telescope arrays. Fresnel interferometric arrays should be easier to build than equivalent resolution monolithic apertures or classical aperture synthesis arrays and allow larger fields and high dynamic range for astrophysical imaging. We present the concept and the first results of validation tests. Among high angular resolution imaging techniques, aperture synthesis provides the highest resolutions, but requires stringent path lengths control and optical surfaces quality. Beam recombining is also a challenge in the I. R, optical and shorter wavelength domains if the number of apertures exceeds a dozen. A large number of apertures is nonetheless necessary to allow imaging of complex objects, as a simple law binds the maximum number of independent pixels in a reconstructed image to the number of individual apertures in the interferometric array providing this image (Koechlin & Perez, 2002). The proposed Fresnel interferometric arrays allow aperture synthesis with hundreds of thousands of apertures. The previously required high precision optics are replaced by mere holes in a thin opaque <b>foil</b> <b>covering</b> the dimensions of the array. Focusing is achieved with no other optical element than vacuum and the edges of the holes; their shape and positioning alone being responsible for focalization and beam combining. The consequence of this high number of apertures is a large number of pixels and a very high dynamic range. 1. Principl...|$|R
40|$|Pecan [Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch] is an {{economically}} important nut tree native to Texas which is cultivated {{throughout much of}} the southern United States. Pecan trees are slow growing with a long period of juvenility, therefore asexual propagation through vegetative means is used to speed up the process as well as aiding in maintaining desirable characteristics through cloning. Current propagation methods for pecan typically require seedlings be {{at least two or three}} years old before they can be budded or grafted. One additional year or two may be required if budding or grafting is performed and unsuccessful. Studies on the propagation methods of T-budding, cuttings and a new method, the V-graft, were conducted on pecan seedlings. These methods are used on one- or two-year-old seedlings. T-budding and V-graft methods were performed testing different wrapping materials and <b>foil</b> <b>coverings.</b> Softwood pecan cuttings were collected and subjected to a common method for cutting propagation and the Ellepot system, as well as two different hormone concentrations. To support the findings of the budding and grafting studies, a callus study was also conducted in which pecan rootstocks were wounded, covered with the different wrapping treatments used in the T-budding and V-grafting studies, and placed in a controlled environment ideal for callus formation. The results supported that neither softwood cuttings nor T-budding are appropriate for propagation of pecan seedlings. V-grafting is a newly introduced method for pecan, and had some success. Since this is a newer method not yet reported to have high success, it is recommended that more grafts be conducted to observe what the outcome could be on a commercial level...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} Mars Sample Transfer Chain Architecture provides Planetary Protection Officers {{with clean}} samples {{that are required}} for the eventual release from confinement of the returned Martian samples. At the same time, absolute cleanliness and sterility requirement is not placed of {{any part of the}} Lander (including the deep drill), Mars Assent Vehicle (MAV), any part of the Orbiting Sample container (OS), Rover mobility platform, any part of the Minicorer, Robotic arm (including instrument sensors), and most of the caching equipment on the Rover. The removal of the strict requirements in excess of the Category IVa cleanliness (Pathfinder clean) is expected to lead to significant cost savings. The proposed architecture assumes that crosscontamination renders all surfaces {{in the vicinity of the}} rover(s) and the lander(s) contaminated. Thus, no accessible surface of Martian rocks and soil is Earth contamination free. As a result of the latter, only subsurface samples (either rock or soil) can be and will be collected for eventual return to Earth. Uncontaminated samples can be collected from a Category IVa clean platform. Both subsurface soil and rock samples can be maintained clean if they are collected by devices that are self-contained and clean and sterile inside only.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for producing mono-crystalline foils of some alkali halides for transmission electron microscopy. The formation mechanism of the crystals has been investigated. The foils, which have two free faces {{have been used as}} electron transparent substrates to grow epitaxial films of gold, on one or both surfaces of the substrates. It has been shown that by <b>covering</b> the above <b>foils</b> with a thin layer of another alkali halide, bending contours suitable for measuring the thickness of the foils, are produced. A chamber has been designed and constructed for transporting the specimen from the preparation vacuum system into the electron microscope without exposing it to the atmosphere. The variation of pressure inside the chamber has been measured and some possible modifications have been suggested. The device has been used to study the nucleation and growth from the vapour phase of LiF, NaF, NaCl, KOI, KBj, KI and Rbl, on electron transparent substrates of mica and potassium chloride. The crystallographic and atomic orientations of the above materials with respect to atomic arrangement of the substrates have been studied. It has been shown that the alkali halides form continuous films at average thicknesses below 2. 5 nm on substrates of mica and KCl. The effect of the heat treatment during and after growth of the films has been studied. The effects of atmospheric moisture on the overgrowths have been studied in detail, and {{it has been shown that}} there are some similarities between the effects of atmospheric moisture and the heat treatment on the hygroscopic alkali halides. It has been shown that when thin deposits of NaCl on the substrate of KCl are heated, diffusion or re-evaporation of the deposit does not occur randomly. The consequent possibility of the existence of periodic defect sites has been discussed. From a general consideration of the results it is concluded that (a) Chemical interactions are a dominant factor in the epitaxial growth of alkali halides on mica and KCl.
