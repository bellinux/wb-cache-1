40|$|LHC {{searches}} for BSM resonances in l^+ l^-, jj, tt̅, γγ and VV final states {{have so far}} not resulted in discovery of new physics. <b>Current</b> <b>results</b> <b>set</b> lower limits on mass scales of new physics resonances well into the O(1) TeV range, assuming that the new resonance decays dominantly {{to a pair of}} Standard Model particles. While the SM pair searches are a vital probe of possible new physics, it is important to re-examine the scope of new physics scenarios probed with such final states. Scenarios where new resonances decay dominantly to final states other than SM pairs, even though well theoretically motivated, lie beyond the scope of SM pair searches. In this paper we argue that LHC {{searches for}} (vector) resonances beyond two particle final states would be useful complementary probes of new physics scenarios. As an example, we consider a class of composite Higgs models, and identify specific model parameter points where the color singlet, electrically neutral vector resonance ρ_ 0 decays dominantly not to a pair of SM particles, but to a fermionic top partner T_f 1 and a top quark, with T_f 1 → tZ. We show that dominant decays of ρ_ 0 → T_f 1 t in the context of Composite Higgs models are possible even when the decay channel to a pair of T_f 1 is kinematically open. Our analysis deals with scenarios where both m_ρ and m_T_f 1 are of O(1) TeV, leading to highly boosted tt̅Z final state topologies. We show that the particular composite Higgs scenario we consider is discoverable at the LHC 13 with as little as 30 fb^- 1, while being allowed by other existing experimental constraints.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Pohlmeyer-type reduced theory found by explicitly solving the Virasoro constraints {{in the formulation}} of AdS 5 × S 5 superstring in terms of supercoset <b>currents.</b> The <b>resulting</b> <b>set</b> of classically equivalent, integrable Lagrangian equations of motion has the advantage of involving only a physical number of degrees of freedom and yet being 2 d Lorentz invariant. The corresponding reduced theory action may be written as a gauged WZW model coupled to fermions with further bosonic and fermionic potential terms. Since the AdS 5 × S 5 superstring sigma model is conformally invariant, its classical relation to the reduced theory may extend to the quantum level only if the latter is, in fact, UV finite. This theory is power counting renormalizable with the only possible divergences being of potential type. We explicitly verify its 1 -loop finiteness and show that the 2 -loop divergences are, in general, scheme dependent and vanish in dimensional reduction scheme. We expect that the reduced theory is finite to all orders in the loop expansion...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in constraining the sum of the masses of the three neutrino flavours by using cosmological measurements. Solar, atmospheric, and reactor neutrino experiments have confirmed neutrino oscillations, implying that neutrinos have non-zero mass, but without pinning down their absolute masses. While it is established that the effect of light neutrinos on the evolution of cosmic structure is small, the upper limits derived from large-scale structure could help significantly to constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino masses. It is also important to know the sum of neutrino masses as it is degenerate with the values of other cosmological parameters, e. g. the amplitude of fluctuations and the primordial spectral index. A summary of cosmological neutrino mass limits is given. <b>Current</b> <b>results</b> from cosmology <b>set</b> an upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of ~ 1 eV, somewhat depending on the data sets used in the analyses and assumed priors on cosmological parameters. It is important to emphasize that the total neutrino mass (`hot dark matter') is derived assuming that the other components in the universe are baryons, cold dark matter and dark energy. We assess the impact of neutrino masses on the matter power spectrum, the cosmic microwave background, peculiar velocities and gravitational lensing. We also discuss future methods to improve the mass upper limits by an order of magnitude. Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures. Minor changes, matches the accepted version.

Surgical removal of the prostate may cure the patient, but if metastatic spread has occurred, androgen suppression therapy is the standard treatment. However, most men will eventually fail this therapy and develop recurrent androgen-independent disease, {{for which there is}} no effective therapy. Our understanding of PC, including cell source and mechanisms in initiation and progression of PC, is impeded by our lack of knowledge regarding cell regulation, self-renewal, and cellular differentiation mechanisms in the prostate gland. In this study, we aimed to investigate these processes in the adult human prostate, by investigating localization, activity, and regulation of growth and differentiation modulating proteins in mature and differentiating cells of the adult prostate, including the benign and malignant prostate. In this thesis, I provide evidence for epithelial renewal in response to prostate tissue culture, and for basal and epithelial stem cell (SC) recruitment leading to an expansion of differentiating glandular precursor cells, and report the identification of several novel candidate epithelial SC-antigens in the prostate, including the putative suppressor of differentiation Dlk- 1. We also supply evidence that nuclear Notch- 1 activity down-regulates the candidate SC marker Dlk- 1 in differentiating glandular precursor cells, that Notch-signalling regulates proliferation of precursor cells, and that inactive Notch- 1 is a marker of mature glandular cells in the prostate. In addition, the identification of rare Dlk- 1 expressing neuroendocrine cells suggests the existence of a common prostate epithelial progenitor, and a late precursor phenotype to this cell lineage. Data further suggest that stem cell factor (SCF) regulates prostate SC/progenitor biology through KIT-receptors, and the existence of a novel stromal progenitor phenotype in the prostate. We further show that the inhibitory peptide somatostatin (SS) is expressed in the prostate epithelial and mesenchymal SC/progenitor niche, and that SS regulates expansion of immature epithelia in primary prostate cell cultures, and that specific SS-receptors are up-regulated in PC. New therapeutics may be based on inhibitors/agonists of critical SC/niche and precursor cell signalling and differentiation-modulating molecules, or of their receptors; <b>current</b> <b>results</b> may <b>set</b> the stage for the development of new therapies in prostate glandular and stromal diseases...|$|R
