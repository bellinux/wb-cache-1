25|$|In {{contemporary}} socio-political discussion, {{the term}} Kulturkampf (see also <b>culture</b> <b>war)</b> {{is often used}} to describe any conflict between secular and religious authorities or deeply opposing values, beliefs between sizable factions within a nation, community, or other group.|$|E
25|$|President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle easily won renomination by the Republican Party. However, {{the success}} of the {{conservative}} opposition forced the moderate Bush to move further to the right than in the previous election, and to incorporate many socially conservative planks in the party platform. Bush allowed Buchanan to give the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas, and his <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> speech alienated many moderates.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{took steps}} to silence or {{restrain}} political opposition, as evidenced by laws restricting {{the freedom of the}} press, and the anti-socialist laws. He waged a <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> (Kulturkampf) against the Catholic Church until he realized the conservatism of the Catholics made them natural allies against the Socialists. His king Wilhelm I rarely challenged the Chancellor's decisions; on several occasions, Bismarck obtained his monarch's approval by threatening to resign. However, Wilhelm II intended to govern the country himself, making the ousting of Bismarck one of his first tasks as Kaiser. Bismarck's successors as Chancellor were much less influential, as power was concentrated in the Emperor's hands.|$|E
25|$|The Catholics reacted by {{organizing}} {{themselves and}} strengthening the Centre Party. Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, was alarmed that secularists and socialists {{were using the}} Kulturkampf to attack all religion. He abandoned it in 1878 to preserve his remaining political capital since he now needed the Centre Party votes in his new battle against socialism. Pius IX died that year, replaced by the more pragmatic Pope Leo XIII who negotiated away most of the anti-Catholic laws. The Pope kept control of the selection of bishops, and Catholics {{for the most part}} supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies. However, they never forgot his <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> and preached solidarity to present organized resistance should it ever be resumed.|$|E
25|$|Observers have {{generally}} described Gamergate {{as part of}} a long-running <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games. Vox said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women. Ars Technica quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn. In First Things, Nathaniel Givens described Gamergate as a reaction to the aggressive promotion of a progressive environment in video game culture.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Americans United for Separation of Church and State launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the American Jewish Congress), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the Liberty Counsel, have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the U.S. Supreme Court {{as a threat to the}} expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Marilyn Manson and his eponymous band {{established}} {{themselves as a}} household name, and {{as one of the}} most controversial rock acts in music history. Their albums Antichrist Superstar (1996) and Mechanical Animals (1998) were both critical and commercial successes, and by the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999, the frontman had become a <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth. As their popularity increased, the confrontational nature of the group's music and imagery angered social conservatives. Numerous politicians lobbied to have their performances banned, citing false and exaggerated claims that they contained animal sacrifices, bestiality and rape. Their concerts were routinely picketed by religious advocates and parent groups, who asserted that their music had a corrupting influence on youth culture by inciting [...] "rape, murder, blasphemy and suicide".|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{expressed}} dismay at the then-upcoming presidential election. He felt {{confused by}} the country's <b>culture</b> <b>war,</b> noting the particular division among the general public on the Iraq War. Summing up his feelings {{in an interview at}} the time, he said, [...] "This war that's going on in Iraq [...] basically to build a pipeline and put up a fucking Wal-Mart." [...] Armstrong felt a duty to keep his sons away from violent images, including video games and news coverage of the war in Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. Armstrong noted divisions between America's [...] "television culture" [...] (which he said only cared about cable news) versus the world's view of America, which could be considered as careless warmongers. Dirnt felt similarly, especially so after viewing the 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. [...] "You don't have to analyze every bit of information in order to know that something's not fucking right, and it's time to make a change." [...] Cool hoped the record would influence young people to vote Bush out, or, as he put it, [...] "make the world a little more sane." [...] He had previously felt that it was not his place to [...] "preach" [...] to kids, but felt there was so much [...] "on the line" [...] in the 2004 election that he must.|$|E

2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{has been described}} as a manifestation of a <b>culture</b> <b>war</b> over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.

2500|$|Many of Gamergate's {{claims have}} been {{rejected}} as ill-founded and unsupported.
