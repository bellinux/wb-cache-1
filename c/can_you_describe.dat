This man," [...] he said, [...] "this Englishman, whom you twice saw, and whom I suspect to be {{the soul of the}} contrivance, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> him?

5000|$|I Am America (And So <b>Can</b> <b>You!)</b> is <b>described</b> {{as being}} a [...] "pure extension" [...] of The Colbert Report, delving into the views of Colbert's [...] "well-intentioned, poorly {{informed}} high status idiot" [...] character on what he considers {{to be the most}} pressing issues facing the United States. The book is influenced by the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as Bill O'Reilly's book, The O'Reilly Factor (2000) and Sean Hannity's Deliver Us From Evil (2004), which Colbert says he forced himself to read as a reference.|$|R

6000|$|There,--the {{murder is}} out! My paper is {{filled to the}} brim, {{and there is no}} time to speak of Lesueur's [...] "Crucifixion," [...] which is odiously colored, to be sure; but earnest, tender, simple, holy. But such things are most {{difficult}} to translate into words;--one lays down the pen, and thinks and thinks. The figures appear, and take their places one by one: ranging themselves according to order, in light or in gloom, the colors are reflected duly in the little camera obscura of the brain, and the whole picture lies there complete; but <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> it? No, not if pens were fitch-brushes, and words were bladders of paint. With which, for the present, adieu.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she said, [...] "the {{handwriting}} of {{most children}} who are learning to write is very much alike, {{for this is the}} stage of development when they 'print.' And their composition is the same: they talk only of things that interest all children--pets, toys, and their games. This is only ANY child's letter to ANY father. I couldn't really say it WAS Bobby's. As to the photograph, they have an odd way in South America of selling photographs of anybody, principally of pretty women, by the packet, to any one who wants them. So that it does not follow that the owner of this photograph had any personal interest in it. Now, as to your mysterious patron himself, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> him?" [...] She looked at Randolph with a certain feline intensity.|$|E
60|$|My lady's maid and the housemaid, had, it appeared, {{neither of}} them {{believed}} in Rosanna's illness of the previous day. These two devils--I ask your pardon; but how else <b>CAN</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> a couple of spiteful women?--had stolen up-stairs, at intervals during the Thursday afternoon; had tried Rosanna's door, and found it locked; had knocked, and not been answered; had listened, and not heard a sound inside. When the girl had come down to tea, and had been sent up, still out of sorts, to bed again, the two devils aforesaid had tried her door once more, and found it locked; had looked at the keyhole, and found it stopped up; had seen a light under the door at midnight, and had heard the crackling of a fire (a fire in a servant's bed-room {{in the month of}} June!) at four in the morning. All this they had told Sergeant Cuff, who, in return for their anxiety to enlighten him, had eyed them with sour and suspicious looks, and had shown them plainly that he didn't believe either one or the other. Hence, the unfavourable reports of him which these two women had brought out with them from the examination. Hence, also (without reckoning the influence of the tea-pot), their readiness to let their tongues run to any length {{on the subject of the}} Sergeant's ungracious behaviour to them.|$|E

[...] "I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, {{and it will be}} recognizable'... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have <b>you</b> and <b>can</b> <b>describe</b> <b>you.</b> That's fine.

6000|$|Now if {{all this}} can be done in the key of tragedy and philosophic comedy, it can, I have always contended, be done in the key of farcical comedy; and Overruled is a trifling {{experiment}} in that manner. Conventional farcical comedies are always finally tedious because the heart of them, the inevitable conjugal infidelity, is always evaded. Even its consequences are evaded. Mr. Granville Barker has pointed out rightly that if the third acts of our farcical comedies dared to describe the consequences that would follow from the first and second in real life, they would end as squalid tragedies; and in my opinion they would be greatly improved thereby even as entertainments; for I have never seen a three-act farcical comedy without being bored and tired by the third act, and observing {{that the rest of the}} audience were in the same condition, though they were not vigilantly introspective enough to find that out, and were apt to blame one another, especially the husbands and wives, for their crossness. But it is happily by no means true that conjugal infidelities always produce tragic consequences, or that they need produce even the unhappiness which they often do produce. Besides, the more momentous the consequences, the more interesting become the impulses and imaginations and reasonings, if any, of the people who disregard them. If I had an opportunity of conversing with the ghost of an executed murderer, I have no doubt he would begin to tell me eagerly about his trial, with the names of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen who honored him with their presence on that occasion, and then about his execution. All of which would bore me exceedingly. I should say, [...] "My dear sir: such manufactured ceremonies do not interest me in the least. I know how a man is tried, and how he is hanged. I should have had you killed in a much less disgusting, hypocritical, and unfriendly manner if the matter had been in my hands. What I want to know about is the murder. How did you feel when you committed it? Why did you do it? What did you say to yourself about it? If, like most murderers, you had not been hanged, would you have committed other murders? Did you really dislike the victim, or did you want his money, or did you murder a person whom you did not dislike, and from whose death you had nothing to gain, merely for the sake of murdering? If so, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> the charm to me? Does it come upon you periodically; or is it chronic? Has curiosity anything to do with it?" [...] I would ply him with all manner of questions to find out what murder is really like; and I should not be satisfied until I had realized that I, too, might commit a murder, or else that there is some specific quality present in a murderer and lacking in me. And, if so, what that quality is.|$|E

5000|$|In interviews, fellow musicians often {{described}} Dead as odd and introverted. Mayhem drummer Jan Axel 'Hellhammer' Blomberg described Dead as [...] "a very strange personality … depressed, melancholic, and dark". Likewise, Mayhem guitarist Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth once said: [...] "I honestly think Dead is mentally insane. Which other way <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> {{a guy who}} does not eat, {{in order to get}} starving wounds? Or who has a T-shirt with funeral announcements on it?" [...] Former Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim later likened Dead's personality to that of Marvin the Paranoid Android.|$|E
5000|$|When Ellery Channing {{published}} his book of poems, Ward subsidized its printing. Emerson edited the project but told Ward that Channing [...] "goes {{to the very}} end of the poetic license, and defies a little too disdainfully his dictionary and logic". Critic Edgar Allan Poe agreed and noted in his review of Channing's book that it was [...] "full of all kinds of mistakes, of which the most important is that of their having been written at all". After Margaret Fuller's death in 1850, Emerson attempted to persuade Ward into writing her biography, though he declined. [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> a Force? How can you write the life of Margaret?" [...] he asked.|$|E
5000|$|Although well {{received}} by the public as typical [...] "disaster movie" [...] fare, critical reception to The Hindenburg was generally unfavorable. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times dismissed it as a failed project, [...] "The Hindenburg is a disaster picture, all right. How else <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> a movie that cost $12 million and makes people laugh out loud at all the wrong times?" [...] Frank Rich, in his year-end review of films released that year, named The Hindenburg the year's worst disaster film, stating, [...] "The hero is a Nazi and the special effects couldn't fool Gerald Ford." [...] Similar reactions were recounted, and when the film eventually made it to television screens, the TV Guide summed up a near-universal review: [...] "This insipid, boring, implausible, senseless, deliciously funny, and expensively mounted film... There's no tension whatsoever {{and none of the}} characters is remotely interesting, let alone sympathetic." [...] Pauline Kael voiced her disapproval of the film and Wise's direction with the phrase, [...] "One gasbag meets another.". On the review Aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film currently holds a score of 40% rotten.|$|E
