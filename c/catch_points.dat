25|$|The line's railway {{signaling}} {{system is designed}} to ensure that trains wait on the double track section while a train is proceeding {{in the other direction}} on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already waiting for it at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by <b>catch</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Kand K1classes {{suffered}} from stability problems when travelling at speed over points and curves. The locomotive would initially roll (briefly lean heavily) to one side, followed by several further rolls of gradually reducing amplitude, {{combined with a}} side-slipping movement that caused the driving wheels to mount the rails. Several minor derailments {{of members of the}} class were followed by the serious derailment of No.A800 River Cray at Sevenoaks, Kent, in August 1927, caused by a combination of a surge in the water tanks and the flanges of the locomotive's lead driving wheels mounting the rail at speed due to poor quality track-work. The locomotive was hauling a Cannon Street to [...] express with a Pullman carriage when the leading driving wheels derailed at [...] over <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> in a cutting. Several carriages were flung against a road bridge, injuring 40 and killing 13 passengers.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 May 2014, Class 37 diesel {{electric}} locomotive 37198 {{ran away from}} Quorn & Woodhouse pushing a TPO carriage [...] They collided with a rake of five carriages at Loughborough Central. The RAIB investigated into the accident. Their report was published on 21 May 2015. The investigation found that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver of the locomotive failing to use the handbrake. Additional factors were that there was no brake van in the train, contrary to GCR rules, and that the train was left parked in a position where there was no runaway protection, such as <b>catch</b> <b>points,</b> available. The RAIB made four recommendations {{as a result of the}} accident.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> became {{widespread}} in the United Kingdom after the Abergele rail disaster (1868), where runaway wagons containing paraffin oil (kerosene) collided with an express train. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> continued {{to be used in}} the UK until the mid-20th century. At this time, continuous automatic brakes, which automatically stop any vehicles separated from their train, were widely adopted, making <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> largely obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> {{are rarely}} needed, {{it is not}} always clear whether they will in fact derail a runaway train {{effectively}} and as safely as possible. For example, use of Castle Cary <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> would result in the train being directed into a footbridge. Use of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> to derail a train that had passed a signal at danger at London Paddington station in June 2016 resulted in the empty train, a British Rail Class 165, hitting and severely damaging an overhead line electrification stanchion, causing all services to and from the station to be halted for hours.|$|E
50|$|Yehi {{made his}} Evolve debut at Evolve 51 losing to Lio Rush. Yehi {{returned}} to Evolve in early 2016 in the Style Battle 2016 Tournament Round Robin Challenge losing to Tracy Williams and Matt Riddle. At Evolve 55 he lost to Anthony Nese in a four-way match. At Evolve 56, Yehi joined <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> after {{a loss to}} Drew Gulak. At Evolve 61, Yehi lost a WWE Cruiserweight Classic qualifying match to T.J. Perkins. Yehi defeated Anthony Nese at Evolve 62 after applying a Koji Clutch after Nese attempted a 450 Splash, this was Yehi's first win in Evolve. At Evolve 65, <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> defeat Jonathan Gresham, Darby Allin and Chris Dickinson. At Evolve 73, Yehi and Tracy Williams became the Evolve tag team champions {{for the first time}} after defeating Chris Hero (replacement for Drew Galloway) and DUSTIN, Tony Nese and Drew Gulak, and The Gatekeepers. <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> successfully defended the Evolve Tag Team titles at Evolve 74, defeating Peter Kaasa and Ricochet.|$|R

50|$|Ae 6/6 11437 «Stadt Basel» {{caused a}} stir when it derailed after passed a ground signal ("Zwergsignal") at red on a {{shunting}} track and derailed on a <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b> The engine {{ended up in a}} tilted position in the ballast beside the main track.

50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> are {{installed}} on the running line itself, where the railway climbs at a steep gradient. They are used to prevent runaway vehicles colliding with another train further down the slope. In some cases, <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> lead into a sand drag to safely stop the runaway vehicle, which may be travelling at some speed. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> are usually held in the 'derail' position by a spring. They can be set to allow a train to pass safely in the downhill direction using a lever or other mechanism to override the spring for a short time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> may {{consist of}} a full turnout or a single switch blade. In some cases, on a track that is only traversed by uphill traffic, {{trailing}} point blades are held {{in a position to}} derail any vehicle travelling downhill. However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the switch blades into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances.|$|E

50|$|The {{new line}} {{runs through the}} area of the station on a roughly 15 metre-high embankment. The station's tracks are divided into an area for {{high-speed}} line operations (with the German operating points code of FMT) and an area serving regional operations on the Lower Westerwald Railway (operating points abbreviation FMTN). There is only an indirect connection between the two parts: the eastern <b>catch</b> <b>point</b> from the northern Intercity-Express (ICE) platform track (4), has a connection to platform track 5 (the regional platform); this involves a reversal.|$|R

50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> {{originate}} {{from the days}} of the 'unfitted' goods train. As these trains tended to consist of either completely unbraked wagons (relying entirely on the locomotive's own brakes), or ones with unlinked, manually applied brakes (necessitating a stop at the top of steep downgrades for the guard to walk along the train and set the brakes on each wagon in turn), they also lacked any mechanism to automatically brake runaway cars. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> were therefore required to stop the rear portion of a poorly coupled train that might break away whilst climbing a steep grade - although they would also stop vehicles that ran away for any other reason. Now that trains are all 'fitted' (and broken couplings are far less common), <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> are mostly obsolete.|$|E

50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> and {{trap points}} are types of turnout which act as railway safety devices. Both work by guiding railway {{carriages}} and trucks from a dangerous route onto a separate, safer track. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> {{are used to}} derail vehicles which {{are out of control}} on steep slopes (known as runaways). Trap points are used to protect main railway lines from unauthorised vehicles moving onto them from sidings or branch lines. Either of these track arrangements may lead the vehicles into a sand drag or safety siding, track arrangements which are used to safely stop them after they have left the main tracks.|$|E
50|$|A {{freight train}} became divided at Pendlebury, Lancashire. The rear portion {{was too heavy}} for the banking {{locomotive}} to hold, and it was pushed back downhill and derailed by <b>catch</b> <b>points,</b> as were the wagons.|$|E
50|$|In October 2009 it was {{confirmed}} that the Byrom Street cutting was a hitching and unhitching point for trains being cable hauled to Edge Hill via the Victoria Tunnel. Shunting locomotives took trains from The Waterloo Good Station to the cutting to be hitched onto the cable. The Cutting was also a water and fuelling point for shunters. After 1895 cable hauling ceased and locomotives pulled trains the whole length of the Victoria and Waterloo tunnels. Byrom Street Cutting became a runaway <b>catch</b> <b>point</b> for runaway trains in the tunnel. Byrom Street cutting was never a passenger station. The Victoria and Waterloo tunnels were cleared of debris and reflectors placed on the roof after a survey of the tunnels.|$|R
