40|$|Multi-photon {{entanglement}} {{has been}} successfully made by experimental groups. As the increase of photon number, several problems are encountered, say, greater number of copies, longer time, the error of fidelity and so on. In this paper, we present a new scheme based on Lagrange multiplier and feedback to save the measure copies in multi-photon experiment and five percent of measuring time, also guarantee the acceptable error of fidelity. All {{the results have been}} supported by the data of eight photon experiment. Furthermore, same approach is applied in the simulation for ten photon entanglement, and 22. 45 percent of copies are saved, optimized <b>copy</b> <b>distribution</b> gives better estimation of fidelity than the average <b>copy</b> <b>distribution...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{year has}} passed with our {{newsletter}} published only in electronic version. As a newsletter editor, I watch closely format {{of different kinds}} of newsletter publications within IEEE and outside. I also watch the discussion regarding which formats are convenient for readers. There are five primary kinds of publications: traditional printed, printable electronic version available on a Web site, non-easy-printable version on a Web site, News portal with database-based content management, and distributed by e-mail, usually in a reduced HTML (Web) format. My definition of “printable ” was “it is reasonably easy to print the whole newsletter or at least its part (part in sense of a department) without browsing through multiple pages and clicking print multiple times. Our newsletter evolved from traditional printed version to printable electronic version with an HTML excerpt send to subscribers by email when the next issue of the newsletter is ready on the Web site. During the transition, first a non-printable version was added in 1997, followed by e-mail notification added in 2000. In 2002, the Web-based version was changed to PDF-based printable as the printing and hard <b>copy</b> <b>distribution</b> was suspended. The electronic version, however, opened possibility to publish more and colorful graphics. That yielded making the file size manageable soon started to be challenging. The solution for now is to publish two versions, one low-byte/low-fat with significantly reduced quality of graphics (400 - 600 kB), and another one large but with full printing house quality (2 - 3 MB). The current PDFbased version lacks flexibility that would allow reader to jump immediately to any page by clicking a link in the excerpt that is sent by email. We will work on that...|$|E
40|$|Methodology: The {{paper is}} based on {{empirical}} research on some media companies print and online in Albania. The research includes interviews, literature on the field, observations in the market by author and some media measurements companies in Tirana; time of searching: January-April 2014; media selected: broadsheet newspapers&online, Panorama, Shqiptarja. com, Shqip. Some of the main results of the research are: a. The business model of written media is transforming. - Supplier model of content: content is provided free of charge through social media and other browsers aside from traditional model through purchase or creation by reporters. -Preparation, selection and packaging of content has been improved continuously. There are ongoing preparations and publication of content, its selection is adapted for different distribution channels accessible by customers through various communication tools. -The distribution channels are transformed. Print product still stands {{as one of the}} most important package, but there is the progressive substitution of single <b>copy</b> <b>distribution</b> market with the Internet. b. Revenue models: -Freemium model has failed. There are not in filed any case of profit by content selling. -Single copy sales and subscriptions and advertising model in print are reinforced with advertising online model. - Some of the print media have decrease printing costs as a result of increased revenue through increasing of selling online advertisings. c. News room was adapted to accomplish the new distribution channels of content. Strength of customer access to content through comments, share and like. Open journalism is in field, also.
