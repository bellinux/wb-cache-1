40|$|A phenomenological {{study of}} the {{characteristics}} of a two-phase, oil and air mixture was undertaken in a combustion engine crankcase model at speeds of up to 6000 rpm. The idealized model comprised production components and tolerances. Nonintrusive measurement techniques, such as PIV and PDA and high-speed photography, were applied to the {{study of the}} oil aerosol and liquid films. Agitated oil pools and impingement on the crankcase surfaces contributed to the aeration of oil in the sump due to windage effects. A mean, wakelike, flow pattern was observed that lagged the crankshaft rotation. Harmonic frequencies were recorded that could be identified with the passage of the position of the maximum <b>crank</b> profile <b>radii</b> and a delay time related to the involute-shaped cord and droplet trajectories induced by drag forces. Highly unsteady flow conditions were measured close to the chamber walls. Three classical breakup modes were identified over three speed ranges. Sheet, ligament, and droplet breakup were observed in the ranges of idle to 1800, 4200, and 6000 rpm. Classification of the particle size distribution for the break-up modes was carried out using the PDA technique. Droplet diameter and velocity data varied in the ranges of 2 μm (dmin) to 130 μm (dmax) and 0 − 40 ms− 1 at 6000 rpm. The ratio of the droplet diameter, dmin;max to a characteristic diameter D at which the oil was observed to break away was compared to the disk Bond number, BoD. For the largest measured droplets, the ratio was approximated by dmax/D = 1. 30 BoD− 0. 33. The disk Bond number was 2. 21, while the empirical constant was in the range of 1. 82 − 2. 39. The result showed that an appropriate correction must be applied to the universal power law, proposed by Simpkins in 1997 for the estimate of the primary droplet size generated by a spinning disk homogenous atomizer, which had overpredicted the droplet sizes in the case of the crankshaft...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of various mechanical work loads on ventilation rate and heart rate, under duplicate work conditions. The task was to crank a six inch <b>radius</b> <b>crank</b> at 60 RPM against torques of O, 16, 32. 1, 48 and 64. 2 inch pounds equivalent to work loads of 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ft. lb/min, respectively. Introduction During the past few years more research efforts have been expanded in an attempt to measure the amount of energy consumed (physiological cost) by an individual performing physical work. The energy that a person consumes can be divided into two categories. The 2 ̆ 2 basal metabolic rate 2 ̆ 2 is that caloric expenditure required to maintain the body in a resting state. That caloric expenditure beyond the basal metabolism is the 2 ̆ 2 physiological cost 2 ̆ 2 of additional work. Measurement of energy expended can be performed by purely physical methods: (1) measure the caloric value of all food, 2 ̆ 2 fuel for the combustion process, 2 ̆ 2 or (2) measure the work and heat produced by the combustion process. Total caloric expenditure multiplied by an efficiency factor would yield the physiological cost for a given amount of work. However, it is very complicated and difficult to evaluate the human body 2 ̆ 7 s combustion process and to determine the efficiency of the machinery which varies from individual to individual. A more indirect but convenient approach is to attempt to correlate the rates of body processes that are affected by muscular activity to given work rates of activities. Heart rate, blood pressure, chemical changes, ventilation rate, body temperature, and perspiration rate are all affected by muscular activity. If a correlation between one of these processes and work rate can be determined and if an efficiency factor can be developed to account for individual discrepancies in muscle condition and size, then this body process could be monitored to determine the physiological cost of muscular activity that produces a given amount of work...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{selection}} of numerical optimisation methods were developed for application to realistic solar sail heliocentric trajectory optimisation problems. A Non-Linear Programming method based on Sequential Quadratic Programming was developed, with the sail controls parameterised in time. This method was hybridised with Genetic Algorithms or locally-optimal analytical control laws to generate an initial guess, where required. The goal of this thesis {{is to create a}} detailed catalogue of trajectories to a broad range of heliocentric targets, subject to realistic constraints on trip-time, sail performance, and thermal-limited solar approach. This thesis illustrates the wide range of targets in the solar system that can be reached with solar sailing. In addition, the trajectory problems for which solar sailing is not attractive are also identified. Trajectory analysis of sample return missions to the terrestrial planets, Mars, Venus and Mercury, has been conducted. Extensive depmiure date scans were perfOlmed, where it was found that there are minima and maxima in trip-time, separated by discontinuities, providing effective launch windows. Roundtrip optimal launch dates were identified, after combining outbound and return departure date scans. For Mercury rendezvous, the application of positive launch excess velocity and a Venus gravity assist was investigated, where a small trip-time saving can be made. Trajectories to rendezvous with the Short Period Comet Wirtanen have been optimised, where it was found that a significant reduction in trip time and launch mass could have been realised, relative to a conventional mission. An investigation of using higher performance sails to flyby Long Period Comets has also been conducted, to demonstrate that solar sailing could be used to reach newly discovered comets soon after first discovery, such as the previous Hale-Bopp apparition. It is also shown that solar sailing could be used, instead of solar electric propulsion, to rendezvous with two Main-Belt asteroids, with a reduction in launch mass. The open ended nature of solar sailing was used to show that rendezvous with two further asteroids is also possible. It is also shown that a three-phase trajectory concept, utilising an inclination cranking manoeuvre, could be used to return a sample from a high inclination Near-Earth Asteroid, that would be essentially impossible to reach using conventional propulsion. It is demonstrated that flyby missions to the outer planets, such as Pluto are feasible in reasonable timescales using a solar photonic assist concept. However, due to the faint solar radiation pressure at Jupiter, only flyby missions are practical to the Jovian system with solar sails. An extensive trade-off between launch hyperbolic excess energy, Jupiter arrival velocity, hip-time, and the number of photonic assist loops has been conducted. By contrast, solar sailing appears to be the only feasible option for missions to the Heliopause at 200 AD. Heliopause trajectory analysis included investigation of the number of loops, and the effect of thermallyconstrained closest solar approach on escape velocity and trip-time. It was found that, in order to reach the Heliopause in 25 years, a solar sail of characteristic acceleration of order 1. 5 mm S- 2 would be required, executing a thermally constrained solar photonic assist at 0. 25 AD. Investigation of the effect of positive launch energy is also conducted for Heliopause trajectOlies. A key near-term mission application for solar sails is a Solar Polar Orbiter. Trajectory analysis has revealed that a solar sail transfer to a true solar polar orbit, Earth resonant at 0. 48 AU, in 5 years would require a characteristic acceleration of 0. 42 nun S- 2. In the course of the parametric analysis, two-phase and three-phase scenarios were investigated, with an assessment of the effect of spiralling down to a close <b>cranking</b> orbit <b>radius</b> from positive launch excess energy. Finally, new transfers to exotic, displaced Non-Keplerian Orbits have been optimised for a range of final orbit dimensions among one family of these unique orbits. For lower performance sails, transfers to artificial Lagrange points have been optimised, {{in the context of the}} Geostorm and Polar Observer missions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{parameterized}} dynamic {{simulation model}} for a multi-link high precision press {{has been established in}} the ADAMS software environment based on the displacement equations. The press being developed is taken as an example to study the slider’s displacement curves, velocity curves and acceleration curves under different <b>crank</b> <b>radius</b> in practice as well as the working angle curves and torque curves. With the <b>crank</b> <b>radius</b> increasing, the started punching angle comes early and the slider’s velocity and acceleration at bottom dead center (B. D. C) decreases significantly which help to improve the accuracy of B. D. C and to lower the torque consumption during stamping. Meanwhile, the increasing of working angle helps to reduce the lateral force acting on the slider, such as the torque required to overcome the inertial forces increases rapidly, the torque needed to overcome the nominal force decreases and the peak of nominal force shifts to the lower left gradually. Results of the research mentioned above are helpful to develop the multi-link high-speed press. Intorduction Multi-link high-speed precision presses are mainly used to stamp some small precision parts in microelectronics industry, such as lead frames, stroke of which is usually less than 30 mm and the speed is about 600 r/min.

40|$|The Jansen {{mechanism}} is a one degree-of-freedom, planar, 12 -link, leg mechanism {{that can be}} used in mobile robotic applications and in gait analysis. This paper presents the kinematics and dynamics of the Jansen leg mechanism. The forward kinematics, accomplished using circle intersection method, determines the trajectories of various points on the mechanism in the chassis (stationary link) reference frame. From the foot point trajectory, the step length is shown to vary linearly while step height varies non-linearly with change in <b>crank</b> <b>radius.</b> A dynamic model for the Jansen leg {{mechanism is}} proposed using bond graph approach with modulated multiport transformers. For given ground reaction force pattern and crank angular speed, this model helps determine the motor torque profile as well as the link and joint stresses. The model can therefore be used to rate the actuator torque and in design of the hardware and controller for such a system. The kinematics of the mechanism can also be obtained from this dynamic model. The proposed model is thus a useful tool for analysis and design of systems based on the Jansen leg mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. One new sliding-block {{balancing}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} single-cylinder diesel engine. In the new mechanism, the sliding block is installed against the engine piston. The reciprocation trajectory of sliding block is collinear with the piston trajectory, while sliding block and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods. The new mechanism includes the crankshaft, connecting rod ring, the slider and the guide components. Through the bearing, connecting rod is installed in the eccentric journal of the crankshaft. The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the guide groove. Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the guide hole of the slide. The optimized parameters for the sliding block show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of <b>crank</b> <b>radius</b> to connecting rod length. The appropriate results can balance both the centrifugal inertia force and the reciprocating inertia force generated by piston group. Even the complete balance of the first and second-order reciprocating inertia forces can be obtained, which can reduce the vibration and noise of diesel engine...|$|E
