50|$|The {{technique}} of stochastic screening, which has existed since the seventies, {{has had a}} revival in recent times thanks to increased use of computer-to-plate (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, computer to film, during the exposure {{there could be a}} drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal <b>correction</b> <b>curve.</b> When you make a plate with stochastic screening you must use a tone <b>correction</b> <b>curve,</b> this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard.Given the same final presswork tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM halftone screen frequencies.The creation of a plate with stochastic screening is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the stochastic screening to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2).|$|E
5000|$|Filters such as A-weighting {{attempt to}} adjust sound {{measurements}} {{to correspond to}} loudness as perceived by the typical human, however this approach is only truly valid for loudness of single tones. A-weighting follows human sensitivity to sound and describes relative perceived loudness for at quiet to moderate speech levels, around 40 phons. However, physiological loudness perception {{is a much more}} complex process than can be captured with a single <b>correction</b> <b>curve.</b> Not only do equal-loudness contours vary with intensity, but perceived loudness of a complex sound depends on whether its spectral components are closely or widely spaced in frequency. When generating neural impulses in response to sounds of one frequency, the ear is less sensitive to nearby frequencies, which are said {{to be in the same}} critical band. Sounds containing spectral components in many critical bands are perceived as louder even if the total sound pressure remains constant.|$|E

Results of an experimental investigation of pressure gradients due to axial temperature gradients in small diameter tubes are presented. The tests, which covered {{the region of}} Knudsen numbers (based on tube inside radius) of 0. 01 to 6, indicate good correlation with theory. It is of value to note that this correlation was obtained by using [Delta]T equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends of the tubes and T[subscript ave] equal to the average of these two temperatures. In contrast, theory would dictate obtaining the temperature variation {{along the length of}} the tube and applying the formulas to small incremental [Delta]T's, then summing to get the total effect.

40|$|A {{biological}} {{method for}} measuring the activity in 14 C-ampoulcs is dcscribcd. All 14 COa is assimilated by ChZoreEla and {{the activity of the}} algae is measured. The new technique gives results substantially (31 %) lower than the values obtained by the original BaCOs technique but seems to be in accordance with other techniques recently developed. When the new technique {{for measuring the}} activity of the ampoules is used, the 14 C method and the oxygen method give identical results. Skeletonema costatum was used as the test organism. [...] INTRODUCI’ION In the determination of organic produc-tion by plankton algae by means of the 14 C technique first described by Steemann Nielsen (1952), it is necessary to measure the radioactivity both of the 14 COz added and of the algae {{at the end of the}} experi-ment. The activity of the algae is measured after filtration through a membrane filter. The amount of algae is kept so low that self-absorption is negligible. According to the original description of the technique, the CO 2 in the ampoules is precipitated as BaC 03 and the radioactivity is measured after filtration through a mem-brane filter. Unfortunately, it is generally impossible to make the filtration in such a way that self-absorption is negligible. It was therefore necessary to determine the radioactivity of the BaCOs at zero weight by means of a self-absorption <b>correction</b> <b>curve.</b> The technique for precipitating CO 2 as BaC 03 and the preparation of a self-absorp-tion <b>correction</b> <b>curve</b> were described by Calvin et al. (1949, p. 104 - 117). It has always been assumed that the determination of the radioactivity by means of a BaC 03 -self-absorption <b>correction</b> <b>curve</b> is only an approximation. Two factors work-ing in opposite directions influence the accuracy of the determinations: 1) the wide energy spectrum of the P-rays emitted by 14 C, and 2) the self-scattering of the p-radiation. By using a thin-window chamber instead of a windowless chamber, all,&rays of very low energy are cut off, thus reducing the influence of the wide energy spectrum con-siderably. Theoretically, therefore, it should be easier to extrapolate to zero weight, since the curve more closely approaches a straight line on a semilogarithmic plot...|$|E
