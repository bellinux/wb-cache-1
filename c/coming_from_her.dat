She feels uncomfortable {{replacing}} a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg, with her exposition <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E

Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night. Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> room with a head detached from the neck and floating {{in the air in}} front of the body.

500|$|In {{terms of}} Tennyson's other poems, {{there is a}} strong {{connection}} between the character Mariana and Tennyson's other female characters. Both [...] "Mariana" [...] and [...] "Oriana" [...] have characters that experience a mental imprisonment, which are revealed in the poetic refrains. However, Oriana is able to have control over her own story when she serves as narrator of it while Mariana is denied control by Tennyson's use of a third-person narrative structure. The difference is further compounded by Oriana's imprisonment <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> own memories while Mariana's is the external results of her lover having not returned. The character Fatima of Fatima is connected to [...] "Mariana" [...] simply because she is a reversal of Mariana's character: Fatima, like Mariana, waits for her lover but suffers from an intense passion that causes her to lose control over her mind while also being able to experience the world around her. The character Oenone of [...] "Oenone" [...] is a combination of aspects from both Mariana's and Fatima's characters. In the revised version Mariana in the South, the second Mariana is similar to the Lady of Shalott in that they both live in a world between fantasy and reality.|$|E
500|$|As {{a direct}} result, Kaoma's 1989 single [...] "Lambada" [...] re-entered the charts {{after more than}} two decades, making its digital chart debut at number three on the Billboard World Digital Chart. In the week {{following}} the music video's debut, [...] "On the Floor" [...] experienced a 31% increase in sales, which totaled 232,000copies, and landed the song at number two on the Hot Digital Songs chart, as well as number five on the Hot 100. [...] "On the Floor" [...] thus became Lopez's seventh top-five hit in the United States. It is the first single since [...] "So What" [...] (2008) by Pink to debut in the top-ten of the Hot 100, and then climb up the chart in its second week. Just over a month after release [...] "On the Floor" [...] had sold over 600,000copies in the United States, according to USA Todays Bill Keveney. Keveney, attributed Lopez's commercial comeback to product endorsement deals with L'Oreal and Gillette, also noting her appointment as a judge on American Idol a contributing factor in the growth of her popularity. During the week ending May 8,2011, [...] "On the Floor" [...] rose from number seven to a new peak of number three on the Hot 100. By March 28, 2011, [...] "On the Floor" [...] reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, becoming her fifth consecutive US dance chart topper, with three <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> album Love?, including [...] "Fresh Out the Oven" [...] (with Pitbull) and [...] "Louboutins" [...] (2009). [...] "On the Floor" [...] brings Lopez's US dance number ones total to nine singles since she launched her career in 1999. Since then, it has been certified 3× Multi-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies. As a result of Lopez's first televised performance of the song on May 5, 2011, [...] "On the Floor" [...] logged 175,000digital sales that week (up 25% on the previous week), earning Lopez the [...] "Digital Gainer" [...] title that week. Consequently, [...] "On the Floor" [...] reached a new peak of number three on the Hot 100 and number five on the US Pop Songs chart, becoming her highest charting single commercial single as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since 2002's [...] "Jenny from the Block". By April 2012, the song has sold 3,486,000 downloads in the US alone. A year later in April 2013, it was reported that [...] "On the Floor" [...] had sold 3,800,000 downloads in the United States. It also became the 60th best selling digital single of all time.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{uncommon}} in Portugal that a married woman has two given names and six surnames, two from her mother's family, two from her father's family, and the last two <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> husband. In addition, some of these names may be made {{of more than one}} word, so that a full feminine name can have more than 12 words. For instance, the name [...] "Maria do Carmo Mão de Ferro e Cunha de Almeida Santa Rita Santos Abreu" [...] would not be surprising in a married woman. Mão de Ferro (iron hand) and Santa Rita (after Saint Rita of Cascia) count only as one surname each. In this case, Santos Abreu would probably have come from this woman's husband.|$|E

2500|$|In the decision, {{the grand}} jury noted many {{problems}} with Brawley's story. Among these were that the rape kit results did not indicate sexual assault. Additionally, despite her claim of having been held captive outdoors for days, Brawley was not suffering from hypothermia, was well-nourished, and appeared to have brushed her teeth recently. Despite her clothing being charred, there were no burns on her body. Although a shoe she was wearing was cut through, Brawley had no injuries to her foot. The racial epithets written on her were upside down, which led to suspicion that Brawley had written the words. Testimony from her schoolmates indicated she had attended a local party {{during the time of}} her supposed abduction. One witness claimed to have observed Brawley's climbing into the garbage bag. The feces on her body were identified as <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> neighbor's dog. [...] Brawley never testified.|$|E
2500|$|The second 2006 {{production}} {{opened at}} the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on 9 June {{as part of the}} Complete Works Festival, under the title Taitasu Andoronikasu. Directed by Yukio Ninagawa, it starred Kotaro Yoshida as Titus, Rei Asami as Tamora, Shun Oguri as Aaron and Hitomi Manaka as Lavinia. Performed in Japanese, the original English text was projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. In stark contrast to Bailey's production, theatricality was emphasised; the play begins with the company still rehearsing and getting into costume and the stage hands still putting the sets together. The production followed the 1955 Brook production in its depiction of violence; actress Hitomi Manaka appeared after the rape scene with stylised red ribbons <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mouth and arms, substituting for blood. Throughout the play, {{at the back of the}} stage, a huge marble wolf can be seen from which feed Romulus and Remus, with the implication being that Rome is a society based on animalistic origins. The play ends with Young Lucius holding Aaron's baby out to the audience and crying out [...] "The horror! The horror!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson had {{considered}} postponing music for other career plans, but ultimately decided {{to record a}} new album. Jackson attempted several new musical styles; lyrically exploring her sexuality more explicitly and freely. A central theme of split personalities is incorporated within the content of several songs. Jackson stated [...] "It shows the different sides of me, the different characters that I feel that I display at different moments in my life" [...] "I am divulging myself a little more on this album, and it's definitely much more intimate. That's another side of myself that people have seen, but not to this level." [...] Comparing the process of producing to directing, Jackson searched for [...] "sensitive people who can technically express what I'm going through emotionally" [...] while seeking new collaborators. Jimmy Jam added; [...] "Her albums are always what she's thinking at the moment." [...] "Her thoughts may change six months from now. Her biggest thing is {{to be honest with}} her fans. Whatever stuff she wants to talk about, it's <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> heart." [...] Dallas Austin said [...] "she always shows what's going on with her life through her records, reveals the phase she's in with her life and brings out that experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{support the}} album's release {{the group had}} been {{scheduled}} to play at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. During this period Vliet suffered severe anxiety attacks that made him convinced that he was having a heart attack, possibly exacerbated by his heavy LSD use and the fact that his father had died of heart failure a few years earlier. At a vital [...] "warm-up" [...] performance at the Mt. Tamalpais Festival (June 10/11) shortly before the scheduled Monterey Festival (June 16/18), the band began to play [...] "Electricity" [...] and Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the [...] stage and landed on manager Bob Krasnow. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mouth. This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet, effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. With such complex guitar parts there was no means for the band to find a competent replacement in time for Monterey. Cooder's spot was eventually filled for a short spell by Gerry McGee, who had played with the Monkees. According to French the band did two gigs with McGee, one of which was at The Peppermint Twist near Long Beach. The other was at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, August 7, 1967, as opening act for the Yardbirds. McGee was in the group long enough to have an outfit made by a Santa Monica boutique that also created the gear worn by the band on the Strictly Personal cover stamps.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, [...] {{with the}} {{permission}} of the mistress of the house, Chandra was taken by Ajan Thongsuk to meet Luang Pu Sodh for the first time. She was going to spend a month at Wat Paknam. [...] Having met Luang Pu Sodh, he addressed her with the words: [...] "You are too late!" [...] as though they had known each other previously. He allowed her to join an experienced group of meditation practitioners in Wat Paknam without having to pass any probation or tests. This was highly unusual. This privilege was not taken for granted by others at the temple, however, and she was looked down on at first. Despite these obstacles, she was able to develop her meditation and, still within the first month, was given a special meditation seat (...) used for training mindfulness, considered a sign of inner progress. Before her period of leave was finished, Chandra decided to ordain as a mae ji and stay at Wat Paknam. She and Ajan Thongsuk ordained at the same day. In the literature of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, it is described that Mae Ji Chandra quickly became one of Luang Lu Sodh's best students and was praised by him as [...] "first among many, second to none". At that time, she became well-known because people believed she had the ability to share merit with people who had died, analyze people's karma, and other forms of abhiñña (mental powers) <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> meditation practice. Mae Ji Chandra is believed by some practitioners to have prevented several bombs from hitting Bangkok during World War II. However, other temples have contested Mae Ji Chandra's significance as the number one student in Dhammakaya meditation, claiming that an illiterate person {{would not be able to}} meditate at the highest levels.|$|E

[...] He declares his love and insists upon staying to defend her while she proclaims that she hears her mother's voice <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> tomb (Aria: Ah, dal sen di quella tomba / [...] "Ah, from the depths of that tomb there echoes a sinister trembling"). [...] Egberto comes across the couple, sends Mina away, and then confronts Godvino, offering him the choice of two proffered swords. [...] Godvino refuses to take one. [...] The older man continues to press him ("Are you dead to any sense of honour?"), accusing him of cowardice and stating that he will reveal him to be a bastard. [...] At that remark, Godvino accepts the challenge and the two men fight until interrupted by the arrival of Aroldo. [...] Stating that [...] "I speak in the name of God", Aroldo tries to force the two men to stop their fighting. [...] In disarming him, he takes Godvino's hand only to have Egberto question how Aroldo can take the hand of the very man who has betrayed him. [...] With Mina's return, Aroldo finally realizes the truth (Aria: Ah no! è impossibile / [...] "Ah no! [...] It is impossible. [...] Tell me at least that I have been mistaken"). Finally, Egberto insists that Aroldo must punish the right person and not Mina, and Aroldo attempts to return Godvino's sword and commence fighting him. [...] Godvino refuses. [...] With Briano's arrival and his attempts to calm his friend ("my heart has lost everything", Aroldo cries, while the chorus of praying parishioners can be heard coming from the church), all join in a plea for forgiveness.

2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E
2500|$|Williams began 2007 {{with renewed}} confidence, stating her {{intention}} {{to return to}} the top of the rankings, a comment 1987 Wimbledon men's singles champion and commentator Pat Cash branded [...] "deluded." [...] Williams lost in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Hobart, Australia, a warm-up for the Australian Open. Williams was unseeded at the Australian Open because of her world No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as [...] "out of shape." [...] Williams experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself prior to the tournament, <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> fans and the press as well as Serena herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing. Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid Williams a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she didn't perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least. The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games to Mara Santangelo and defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets. By this point, a blister had developed on Williamses' foot and she had contracted a cold. In the third round, Williams found herself two points away from going home against Nadia Petrova, but fought back to win in three sets, which was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. Williams then made it all the way to the final, defeating Janković, Pe'er and Vaidišová. Williams described them as [...] "good players. Strong players. Players who certainly didn't expect an overweight, out-of-shape, has been champion like me to give them a game.". Williams also found herself two points from going out against Peer before turning it around. By the time Williams had reached the final, the cold and blister had both left. Previewing the finals, Tracy Austin stated that, although Serena had a great tournament, she believed that the ride was over and that Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Serena thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation along with other criticism. In the final, Williams lost just three games against Maria Sharapova winning her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open 24 months prior. Williams became the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title whilst not being seeded, and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased half-sister Yetunde. Her performance in the final was described in the press as [...] "one of the best performances of her career" [...] and [...] "arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis." [...] In her post match interview, Williams took a swipe at her critics, stating that she had proved them wrong.|$|E
