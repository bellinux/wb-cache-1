2500|$|His {{withdrawal}} {{may have}} been at his father's behest. [...] While César-Auguste was pursuing his academic studies, he was, at his father's demand, also teaching privately and giving concerts. [...] "It was a hard life for him, [...] [...] [...] and not made easier by the ill-tempered and even vindictive behavior of his father [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Concerts performed by young Franck (some with his brother on the violin, some including Franck's own compositions) were at first received well, but increasingly Nicolas-Joseph's <b>commercial</b> <b>promotion</b> of his sons antagonized the Parisian musical journals and critics. [...] César-Auguste's technical abilities as a pianist were acknowledged; his abilities as a composer were (probably justly at this point) felt to be wanting. [...] The whole situation was aggravated by what in the end became a feud between Nicolas-Joseph and Henri Blanchard, the principal critic of the Revue et Gazette musicale, who lost no opportunity to castigate the aggressive pretensions {{of the father and}} to mock the [...] "imperial" [...] names of the elder son. [...] This animosity, [...] "undoubtedly personal", may well have caused Nicolas-Joseph to decide that a return to Belgium was in order, and [...] in 1842 [...] "a peremptory order" [...] to young Franck compelled the latter to leave the Conservatoire and accompany him.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Stay Alive, two {{different}} sample versions of the song [...] "Dance" [...] were released by Universal Records via YouTube. After a couple of days, the song received rotation over the radio, but was immediately pulled out due to cancellation of the album release. In October 2011, the song was officially released and started receiving limited airplay through radio stations. It was later revealed that Nina personally picked the song as the album's lead single, accepting the risk of catering a new different sound to listeners. [...] "Dance" [...] is an aggressive uptempo club, house dance song, described as an [...] "upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Two versions were shot as official music videos for the song, both directed by Sean Lim. The second version was released on December 9, 2011, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes. Knight of R Duncan Ramos made an appearance in the video, portraying her love interest in the club-dancing scenes. The song was given very limited <b>commercial</b> <b>promotion,</b> and its video was not played on myx until March 2012which led Nina's fans to questioning Universal's marketing strategy. On January 30, 2012, Universal posted a sample version of [...] "However Much Love", revealing it as the second single from the album. The song was set for a Valentine release as a radio-only single to boost up album sales. It was both critically and commercially acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Philippine Entertainment Portal and peaking at number one for three consecutive weeks, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008's [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing".
