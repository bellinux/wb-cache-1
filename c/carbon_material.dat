25|$|The {{resulting}} case-hardened part {{may show}} distinct surface discoloration, if the <b>carbon</b> <b>material</b> is mixed organic matter as described above. The steel darkens significantly, and shows a mottled pattern of black, blue and purple, {{caused by the}} various compounds formed from impurities in the bone and charcoal.

Case colouring refers to this pattern and is commonly encountered as a decorative finish on firearms.|$|E
25|$|Soon after came tilting-disc valves. The first {{clinically}} available tilting disk valve was the Bjork-Shiley valve and {{has undergone}} several significant design changes since its introduction in 1969. Tilting disk valves {{have a single}} circular occluder controlled by a metal strut. They are made of a metal ring covered by an ePTFE fabric, into which the suture threads are stitched in order to hold the valve in place. The metal ring holds, by means of two metal supports, a disc which opens and closes as the heart pumps blood through the valve. The disc is usually made of an extremely hard <b>carbon</b> <b>material</b> (pyrolytic carbon), {{in order to allow}} the valve to function for years without wearing out. The Medtronic-Hall model is the most common tilting-disc design in the US. In some models of mechanical valves, the disc is divided into two parts, which open and close as a door.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and <b>carbon</b> <b>material</b> for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|E

Operators of composting toilets commonly add {{a small amount of}} absorbent <b>carbon</b> <b>material</b> (such as untreated sawdust, coconut coir, peat moss) after each use to create air pockets to encourage aerobic processing, to absorb liquid and to create an odor barrier.

2500|$|The {{moving coil}} driver, more {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "dynamic" [...] driver is the most common type used in headphones. [...] It consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. [...] A voice coil, a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, <b>carbon</b> <b>material,</b> paper or the like. [...] When the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field which reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate back and forth. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air producing sound waves.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{is being}} done testing various {{activated}} carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. [...] The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the <b>carbon</b> <b>material</b> via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons {{have been able to}} achieve bonding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work {{or in the case of}} hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on board compression tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of the reactive oxidant (i. e., hydroxyl radical) by the Fenton-like reaction (Fe(III) /H 2 O 2) was greatly improved {{by the addition of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> such as powdered activated carbon (PAC) and carbon nanotubes (CNT). The presence of <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> enhanced the oxidative conversion of methanol into formaldehyde by the Fe(III) /H 2 O 2 system. CNT exhibited a slightly higher activity than PAC. In the presence of the <b>carbon</b> <b>materials,</b> the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) was accelerated while the decomposition rate of H 2 O 2 increased, which appears to be responsible for the enhanced oxidant production. The reducing power of <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> was also shown by the reductive conversion of polyoxomolybdate. Increasing the addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> exhibited saturated (or slightly decreased) oxidant yields, while decreasing the H 2 O 2 utilization efficiency. The enhanced oxidant production by <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> was more pronounced in the absence of dissolved oxygen, which was explained by the reactions of organo-radicals produced by methanol oxidation. ⓒ 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Heteroatom-doped <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> {{have been}} one of the most {{remarkable}} families of materials with promising applications in fuel cells, supercapacitors, and batteries. Among them, conjugated polymer (CP) -derived heteroatom-doped <b>carbon</b> <b>materials</b> exhibit remarkable electrochemical performances because the heteroatoms can be preserved at a relatively high content and keep stable under harsh working conditions. In this review, we summarized recent advances in the rational design and various applications of CP-derived heteroatom-doped <b>carbon</b> <b>materials,</b> including polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and their ramification-derived carbons, as well as transition metal-carbon nanocomposites.
