5|$|The Action of 6 November 1794 (Known in French as the Combat du 16 Brumaire an III) was a naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars. Two British ships of the line, HMS Alexander and HMS Canada were intercepted while returning to Britain through the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> {{by a large}} French squadron. The French squadron had sailed from Brest {{in search of an}} inward bound British convoy in October, but instead encountered the two British ships returning from escorting an outward-bound convoy. There had been no warning of the French approach as the British force assigned to watch Brest was absent at Plymouth due to the policy of operating a distant blockade.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, {{following}} years of rising tension, the French Republic that {{had emerged from}} the French Revolution declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain. For the Royal Navy {{one of the most}} immediate concerns was to contain the French Atlantic Fleet based in the massively fortified harbour at Brest in Brittany. This port was ideally positioned to disrupt the merchant shipping convoys that passed through the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Bay of Biscay en route to Britain from all over the world, and it was therefore imperative that the French fleet was not permitted to put to sea without being challenged. For the French, Brest was a vital port for the receipt of grain supplies from the Americas and so French fleets regularly sailed on missions to escort these convoys into the harbour and to disrupt British convoys entering the English Channel.|$|E

40|$|Current {{legislation}} {{requires the}} UK to achieve Good Environmental Status by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive {{and it is}} generally recognised that stakeholders will have {{a vital role in}} achieving this goal. The aim of this project is to determine how stakeholders, specifically the fishing industry, relate to the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> in the South West of England. This will be achieved through a questionnaire distributed to the stakeholders in the South West by the online Survey Monkey Tool and supplemented by face-to-face interviews with the fishing industry specifically. The results indicate the stakeholders in the South West use the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> for work and recreational purposes, or in some cases both. There is differing perceptions amongst the stakeholders regarding the boundary, management and condition of the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> which contributes to the varying levels of engagement encountered including their ability to influence decision- making. The working and recreation respondents identified conflict in the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas,</b> with the main contributing factors being space, resource and legislation but experience them at varying levels from none to a lot. The respondents suggested a number of mechanisms which could be used to prevent or minimise conflict in the future. Interestingly a common theme was the need for greater stakeholder involvement to achieve a better understanding, awareness, and appreciation of the marine environment and each other’s needs but there was acknowledgement that such efforts to date have not been very effective. Greater stakeholder involvement can have a number of benefits including better communication and increasing trust between the stakeholders, however further work is needed to better understand what can be done differently so that stakeholders feel they have a role and voice in the decision being made.

5|$|Intensive {{fishing for}} the {{porbeagle}} dates back the 1930s, when Norway {{and to a}} lesser extent Denmark began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after World War II. Soon after the stock collapsed: Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10–40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Bay of Biscay, and saw a decline from an annual catch of over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300–400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the European Union and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in international waters. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.|$|E

40|$|Hydrographic, plankton, benthos, {{fisheries}} landings, {{and fish}} diet data from shelf sea {{areas in the}} Northeast Atlantic have been combined into {{an analysis of the}} foodweb structure and secondary production requirements of regional fisheries. Fish landings from the Baltic and North Sea are shown to be taken from a lower trophic level and are shown to be overall more planktivorous than those from shelf edge regions. The secondary production required per unit of landed fish from the North Sea was approximately half that for landings from the southwest approaches to the UK, referred to as the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas,</b> where zooplankton production accounted for {{only a small fraction of}} the secondary production demands of the fisheries. In the North Sea, variability in zooplankton production seems to have exerted a bottom-up effect on fish production, which in turn has exerted a top-down effect on the benthos. Conversely, <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> benthos production has been a bottom-up driver of fish production, which seems to have been independent of variability in plankton production. Thus, climate and fishing pressures can be expected to influence these regional fisheries in very different ways.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are a management tool used {{to respond to}} human-derived threats in marine ecosystems. Historically, MPAs have been established on an individual ad hoc basis, rather than through a systematic, planned process. However, high levels of functional and spatial connectivity within marine ecosystems {{have led to the}} suggestion that networks of MPAs provide greater ecological benefits than individual MPAs. Consequently, international policy has developed to consider broader spatial requirements for marine conservation, resulting in a number of international and regional agreements that require the establishment of ecologically coherent MPA networks. Existing MPAs are now being considered, retrospectively, alongside new designations, as networks of MPAs across regions, both nationally and internationally. Under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), France, the Republic of Ireland, and the UK (including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man) are required to work together to ensure coordinated development of marine strategies for the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> subregion. Accordingly, MPAs have been identified as crucial components of the programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) under the MSFD. Here, we provide the first ecological coherence assessment of an MPA network spanning an MSFD subregion. A network of 533 MPAs, or parts thereof, across the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> subregion was assessed using five criteria and two methodologies, with a focus on broadscale habitats. While the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> MPA network as a whole is not ecologically coherent (according to accepted thresholds), progress toward a number of global targets has been achieved, for example, protection of 10 % of marine and coastal areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Further, all MSFD predominant habitat types assessed are adequately represented and replicated within the network. However, a number of gaps were identified, including a lack of MPAs in offshore and deeper areas, and inadequate proportions of predominant habitat types within MPAs. Addressing these gaps to enable the MPA network to fulfill its critical role in the delivery of GES under the MSFD will require both national progress toward designation of adequate and viable MPAs and transboundary agreements and coordination of MPA designation processes at the European level...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of applying remote sensing algorithms based on blue/green reflectance ratios to Case 2 waters. Two algorithms from the SeaDAS (NASA) image processing package, OC 4 v 4 for surface chlorophyll concentration, Chl, and K(490) for the attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance at 490 nm, Kd(490), were investigated using an extensive set of observations from the Irish and <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas.</b> In situ data from a profiling radiometer were used as inputs for the algorithms to avoid uncertainties in atmospheric correction procedures, and direct measurements of Chl and Kd 490 and were used for validation purposes. The standard versions of the algorithms performed poorly: OC 4 v 4 generally overestimated Chl (with a very low coefficient of determination), and K(490) progressively underestimated Kd 490 for values greater than 0. 3 m− 1. A two-step procedure for level 2 product generation was therefore devised in which the numerical coefficients of OC 4 v 4 and K(490) were tuned for the two optical water types known to occur most frequently in this region (McKee, D., Cunningham, A., 2006. Identification and characterisation of two optical water types in the Irish Sea from in situ inherent optical properties and seawater constituents. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 68, 305 - 316) by statistical regression on a data set of 102 stations from the Irish and <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas.</b> The water types were distinguished by the magnitude of their normalised water leaving radiance signals at 665 nm, nLw(665), and appropriate versions of the tuned algorithms applied to each water type. When this procedure was tested on an independent data set of 19 stations from the Bristol Channel, Chl values were recovered with an RMS error of 0. 36 mg m− 3 and Kd(490) values with an RMS error of 0. 095 m− 1. The identification of water types from water-leaving radiance signals, {{and the application of}} band-ratio algorithms tuned for specific water types, may therefore provide a simple means of improving the quality of remote sensing products in optically complex shelf seas...|$|R
