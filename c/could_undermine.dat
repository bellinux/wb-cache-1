5|$|The first {{satellite}} to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. It was followed up by three other EOS satellites: Terra, Aqua and QuikSCAT. To ensure a sustainable financing of operations, NSC started negotiating with other potential customers. However, {{the project was}} rejected by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Instead, a cooperation was made with Kongsberg Aerospace and Defence and Lockheed Martin, who built the second antenna as a joint venture. In 2001, a German research group applied for permission to establish a ground station in Ny-Ålesund. NSC feared that the competition <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the financial capabilities of SvalSat. However, no facility in Ny-Ålesund was built.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E

She has criticized television shows which present mediums and psychics as a fact, which in her opinion <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the understanding of science among teenagers. Kelly also considers that {{a belief in the}} supernatural prevents people from appreciating science and the real wonders of the world, and causes unnecessary fear in young people.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increased}} growth in tourism at Angkor, new {{hotels and restaurants}} are being built to accommodate such growth. Each new construction project drills underground to reach the water table, which has a limited storage capacity. This demand on the water table <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> {{the stability of the}} sandy soils under the monuments at Angkor, leading to cracks, fissures and collapses. Making matters worse, the peak tourist season corresponds with Cambodia's dry season, which leads to excessive pumping of ground water when it is least replenished naturally.|$|E

Currently these perceptions translate into ongoing defence, security, economic, aid, environmental and humanitarian activities (Firth 2008: 1).|$|R
25|$|In decrees issued {{two days}} before the presidential election, the Afghan {{government}} imposed censorship for election day, barring news organizations from reporting any information about violence between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. out of concern that reports of violence could reduce voter turnout and damage chances of staging a successful election. Low turnout <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the credibility of the election – and could also hurt Karzai's results in the election if not enough ethnic Pashtun people, who form his base of support, turned out for the vote in the insurgent-dominated south of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The Court's {{mandatory}} jurisdiction {{came from}} three sources: the Optional Clause of the League of Nations, general international conventions and special bipartite international treaties. Cases {{could also be}} submitted directly by states, {{but they were not}} bound to submit material unless it fell into those three categories. The Court could issue either judgments or advisory opinions. Judgments were directly binding while advisory opinions were not.

25|$|As {{a member}} of the Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre had taken part in the discussions about the draft {{documents}} submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council. His concerns with these proposals {{led to the formation of}} the study group to deal with a number of issues at the Council. A primary element of their agenda was opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, which they feared <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> papal primacy and the rights of individual bishops. They thought there should be a specific condemnation of communism and that there should be a separate Council document elevating the status of the Blessed Virgin Mary, not merely a chapter in Lumen gentium.|$|E

25|$|Political {{support for}} LGBT rights {{is limited in}} South Korea due to the {{significant}} lobbying power exerted by conservative Christian groups. Support for LGBT rights is limited even in the nominally progressive Democratic Party of Korea and its leader, former human rights lawyer and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. During the 2017 presidential election, in which he emerged victorious, Moon stated that he opposed homosexuality and that gay soldiers <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the Korean military. Moon later said that he opposed same-sex marriage while also opposing discrimination against homosexual people. Only one of the 14 presidential candidates in 2017, the Justice Party's Sim Sang-jung, expressed clear support for LGBT rights and introducing discrimination protections for LGBT people.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} Helgerson's office {{completed}} {{in the spring of}} 2004 warned that some CIA-approved interrogation procedures appeared to constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, as defined by the international Convention Against Torture. Some of the inspector general's work on detention issues was conducted by Mary O. McCarthy, who was fired from the agency in 2006 after being accused of leaking classified information. Helgerson's office is reportedly nearing completion on a number of inquiries into CIA detention, interrogation, and renditions. Members of the House and Senate intelligence committees expressed concern about the inquiry, saying that it <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the inspector general's role as independent watchdog. Senator Ron Wyden (D–Oregon) said he was sending a letter to Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, asking him to instruct Hayden to drop the inquiry.|$|E
25|$|In the 1821 Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, both Mexico and Central America {{declared}} {{their independence}} after three centuries of Spanish rule and formed the First Mexican Empire, although Central America quickly rejected the union. After priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's 1810 Grito de Dolores (call for independence), the insurgent army began an eleven-year war. At first, the Criollo class {{fought against the}} rebels. But in 1820, a military coup in Spain forced Ferdinand VII to accept {{the authority of the}} liberal Spanish Constitution. The specter of liberalism that <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the authority and autonomy of the Roman Catholic Church made the Church hierarchy in New Spain view independence in a different light. In an independent nation, the Church anticipated retaining its power. Royalist military officer Agustín de Iturbide proposed uniting with the insurgents with whom he had battled, and gained the alliance of Vicente Guerrero, leader of the insurgents in a region now bearing his name. Royal government collapsed in New Spain and the Army of the Three Guarantees marched triumphantly into Mexico City in 1821.|$|E

25|$|The Arab Revolt was {{the last}} major test of Britain's {{security}} services in the Middle East before World War II. The development and deployment of intelligence-led counterinsurgency strategies was integral to the restoration of British imperial control in Palestine as the revolt had demonstrated to the British authorities how a popular rebellion <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> intelligence gathering operations and thereby impair their ability to predict and respond to inter-communal disorder. The rebellion had brought together urban nationalism and peasant economic grievances arising from rural poverty and landlessness, which was blamed on British misrule. Accordingly, the Palestinian revolt targeted {{the political and economic}} apparatus of the British colonial state, including the communications network, pipelines, police stations, army outposts and British personnel. It was this aspect of the revolt, rather than attacks on Jews or violence between rivals for leadership of the national movement, that most concerned the high commissioner. The mandate authorities were further disturbed by the unity of purpose displayed during the six-month general strike and by the resurgence of pan-Arab nationalism as evidenced by the rise of the Istiqlal Party.|$|E
500|$|An {{article in}} the North Carolina Law Review argued that Kennedy's {{majority}} opinion wrongly set forth {{the understanding of the}} role of an attorney. The author, Jessica Sharpe, criticized the Court's thesis that the role of the attorney is that of an advocate such that a restriction on the attorney served as a direct restriction of advocacy. This rationale, Sharpe argued, <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the balance of abortion restrictions because state regulations on abortion access also could be seen as an intrusion into doctor–patient speech. Because Velazquez [...] "blurred" [...] this distinction, the privileged nature of doctor–patient conversations could be subjected to future regulations and limitations.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{after an}} {{internal}} debate {{that had been}} going on since 1991, ENO announced that surtitles would be introduced at the Coliseum. Surveys had shown that only a quarter of audience members could hear the words clearly. With a few exceptions, including Lesley Garrett and Andrew Shore, ENO singers of the 21st century were considered to have poorer diction than earlier singers such as Masterson and Derek Hammond-Stroud. Harewood and Pountney had been immovably opposed to surtitles, as both believed that opera in English was pointless if it could not be understood. [...] Harewood thought, moreover, that surtitles <b>could</b> <b>undermine</b> the case for a publicly funded opera-in-English company. The editor of Opera magazine, Rodney Milnes, campaigned against surtitles on the grounds that [...] "singers would give up trying to articulate clearly and audiences would cease focusing on the stage". Despite these objections, surtitles were introduced from October 2005.|$|E

The Minister for Law K. Shanmugam was asked in Parliament on 25 August 2008 to clarify the Attorney-General's comments. Shanmugam described the presumption of innocence as an [...] "important and fundamental principle" [...] which the Government was [...] "absolutely committed to upholding". Nonetheless, it was [...] "entirely possible for a person to have committed acts which amount to a crime and yet, there may be no conviction", as the trial process was designed to prove guilt and not innocence.
