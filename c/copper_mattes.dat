40|$|An {{investigation}} of <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> vacuum purification was undertaken. A mathematical model using monatomic, diatomic sulphide and diatomic oxide vapours of the impurities {{was developed to}} explain the vacuum refining process. The model was used to predict the overall refining rates for variables such as temperature, matte grade, oxygen activity and chamber pressure of the melt. A series of experiments was undertaken to characterize the dust produced during vacuum refining of <b>copper</b> <b>matte.</b> An attempt to selectively condense the vapours produced during the vacuum refining experiments was carried out. The "Lift-Spray" vacuum refining process was used to refine 15 to 40 kg batches of molten <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> containing 35 to 78 % copper. The removal rates of lead, bismuth, arsenic, antimony, selenium, nickel and silver were measured under different levels of matte grade, chamber pressure, lifting gas flow rate and dissolved oxygen content in the melt. The ranges of the variables under study were from 10 to 600 pascals chamber pressure, 0 to 40 normal milliliter per second of lifting gas flow rate and 10 $ sp{- 16 }$ to 10 $ sp{- 7 }$ atmosphere of oxygen activity.

Many copper concentrates contain small amounts of cobalt, a metal of considerable value but also of some environmental interest. In this work, the matte/slag distribution ratio (weight percent) of cobalt between <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> (55 wt pet) and iron silicate slag was thermodynamically modeled and predicted to be approximately 5.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{computer program}} using FORTRAN language {{was developed to}} model the mass and heat balance {{of the process of}} continuous converting of <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> {{in order to determine the}} effect of oxygen enrichment in the blast air on process efficiency. The program integrates all parameters involved in the continuous converting of <b>copper</b> <b>matte.</b> It applies fundamental thermodynamics as well as empirical and semi-empirical expressions to predict process outcomes as a function of varying input parameters. These parameters include the tonnages, composition, temperature and enthalpies of blast air, liquid matte, solid matte, reverts, flux and scrap. Predicted process outcomes include the quantities, composition, temperature and heat content of semi-blister, white metal, slag and off-gas. The computer program predicts that using oxygen enriched air enhances process efficiency dramatically. With higher oxygen levels in the blast, higher converting temperatures can be achieved, and hence, allowing the usage of more feed materials (scrap, reverts, etc.). Also, by increasing the oxygen level in the blast air to 30 vol. %, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the off-gas can be increased by about 45 vol. %. The copper content in the slag was found to be lower when converting at higher temperatures. 2. Keywords: converting, process, copper, modeling...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{information on}} atmospheric emissions during {{the production of}} copper in primary smelters. More than 80 copper smelters around the world employ various conventional pyrometallurgical techniques to produce more than 90 % of the total copper production (e. g. Pacyna, 1989). Generally there are 3 steps in this process: 1) roasting of ores to remove sulphur, 2) smelting of roaster product to remove {{a part of the}} gangue for production of the <b>copper</b> <b>matte,</b> and 3) converting of the <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> to blister <b>copper.</b> Atmospheric emissions of sulphur dioxide and heavy metals on fine particles occur during all the above mentioned processes. Both emissions from fuel combustion in the primary copper plants and industrial processes are discussed here. 2 CONTRIBUTIONS TO TOTAL EMISSIONS Emissions of sulphur dioxide from non-ferrous metal production, particularly copper production contribute less than 10 % to the total global emissions of this pollutant. However, copper smelting can be the most important source of sulphur dioxide emissions in certain regions, such as the Kola Peninsula, the Urals, the Norilsk area, and the Fergana region in Russia, Lower Silesia in Poland, and the Gijon region in Spain. The contribution of emissions released from primary copper production to total emissions in countries of the CORINAIR 90 inventory is given as follows...|$|R

40|$|The copper loss in {{smelting}} slag {{is mainly}} {{in the form of}} entrapped matte droplets which strongly influences the productivity of the copper extractive process. In order to minimize the copper loss in smelting slag and increase the direct recovery of copper in the smelting process, {{it is important to understand}} the settlement mechanisms of <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> droplets in the slag. The settlement of matte droplets is also directly related to the slag cleaning process where the target is to achieve lowest copper content in the discarded slag. A bottom-blown furnace for slag cleaning is under development in Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals Co., Ltd. Preliminary trials have shown low level of copper in the final slag indicating fluid dynamic plays important role in settlement of the matte droplets. A simulation of <b>copper</b> <b>matte</b> settlement in slags was investigated by settling water droplet in silicone oil with/without stirring. It was found that terminal velocity of water droplet settling in stagnant silicone oil is a function of droplet radius, density difference of two liquids and viscosity of silicone oil (slag). Quantitatively the terminal velocity of water droplet settling in stagnant silicone oil can be represented as a simplified Hadamard-Rybczynski equation. Under stirring by bottom-blown gas, it was found that the settlement velocity of water droplet in silicone oil was enhanced comparing with its settlement in stagnant silicone oil and it increases with increasing gas flowrate until the standing wave occurred. This result clearly explains the advantage of bottom-blown furnace in cleaning of smelting slags and it will be used to further improve the copper recovery in slag cleaning process using bottom-blown furnace...|$|R
