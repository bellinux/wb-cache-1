This market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of Annex 1 Parties under the Kyoto Protocol, and of liable entities under the EU Emission Trading Scheme.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} voluntary individual <b>carbon</b> <b>offsetting,</b> i. e. the financial compensation of emissions from energy use. In contrast to former studies in this field, we particularly consider a comprehensive set of factors that {{are discussed in the}} context of voluntary contributions to public goods, such as psychological motives or social norms. The empirical analysis is based on unique data from representative surveys among more than 2000 citizens from Germany and the United States. These data reveal a higher extent of the past purchase of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> in the United States. In both countries, our micro-econometric analysis with discrete choice models indicates a strong positive correlation between the perceived contribution of this offsetting mechanism to climate protection and both actual <b>carbon</b> <b>offsetting</b> in the past and the planned purchase of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> in the future. In Germany, psychological motives such as the feeling of warm glow play an additional important role, while in the Unites States social motives such as expectations from the society are of a high relevance. Interestingly, a high environmental preference (measured by the membership in an environmental organization and the identification with green politics) is significantly correlated with already purchased <b>carbon</b> <b>offsets</b> in the United States, but not in Germany. These results suggest that not only the whole society in Germany has a lower average acceptance of <b>carbon</b> <b>offsetting,</b> but also that environmentally conscious people in this country obviously did not consider <b>carbon</b> <b>offsetting</b> as a measure to avoid further anthropogenic global warming so far...|$|R

25|$|Offsets are {{typically}} achieved through financial support of projects that reduce the emission {{of greenhouse gases}} in the short- or long-term. The most common project type is renewable energy, such as wind farms, biomass energy, or hydroelectric dams. Others include energy efficiency projects, the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts, destruction of landfill methane, and forestry projects.

25|$|Certification regime. The {{certification}} regime {{describes the}} systems and procedures {{that are used}} to certify and register carbon offsets. Different methodologies are used for measuring and verifying emissions reductions, depending on project type, size and location. For example, the CDM uses another. In the voluntary market, a variety of industry standards exist. These include the Voluntary Carbon Standard and the CDM Gold Standard that are implemented to provide third-party verification of <b>carbon</b> <b>offset</b> projects. There are some additional standards for the validation of co-benefits, including the CCBS, issued by the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance and the Social Carbon Standard, issued by Ecologica Institute.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{important}} for any carbon credit (offset) to prove a concept called additionality. The concept of additionality addresses {{the question of whether}} the project would have happened in the absence of an intervention in the form of the price signal of carbon credits. Only projects with emissions below their baseline level, defined as emissions under a scenario without this price signal (holding all other factors constant), represent a net environmental benefit. Carbon projects that yield strong financial returns even in the absence of revenue from carbon credits; or that are compelled by regulations; or that represent common practice in an industry; are usually not considered additional. A full determination of additionality requires a careful investigation of proposed <b>carbon</b> <b>offset</b> projects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the much}} smaller, {{voluntary}} market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets {{to compensate for the}} greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Many companies (see list) offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during the sales process so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase (such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight, car rental, hotel stay, consumer good, etc.). In 2008, about $705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market, representing about 123.4 million metric tons of CO2e reductions. Some fuel suppliers in the UK offer fuel which has been <b>carbon</b> <b>offset</b> such as Fuel dyes.|$|E

In that respect carbon Offsets are similar to most consumer products, with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers, the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets, who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas.|$|E
