Based on this, a comprehensive study is carried out for the creation of cylinders.

The dual space drawing methods of the circular cylinder with boundary conditions and segment construction are also discussed. Rena Din...|$|R

40|$|Ruled surface {{design and}} its {{applications}} {{are widely used}} in CAGD (<b>Computer</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Geometric</b> <b>Design)</b> and industrial areas. In this paper, the cone is a particular ruled surface, which is drawn by using the dual methods based on the cylindrical shape [Ding 2003] with its same base curve. The underlying principle is the conversion from cylinders to cones by application of the dual displacement methods [Sprott and Ravani 1997]. Based on the dual methods, a comprehensive study is carried out {{for the creation of}} cones. The translation, which satisfies the condition of dual methods, from cylinders which have been created by using the dual De Casteljau algorithm [Ding 2003] to cones is investigated. During the process, a new theorem, the tangential interpolation line theorem is unveiled. This discovery lays the foundation for the conversion from cylinders to cones. The new methods are put forward to draw different cones, which have been successfully implemented by computer simulation. Rena Ding and Yan Zhan...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the BMT distribution as an unimodal alternative to continuous univariate distributions supported on a bounded interval. The ideas behind the mathematical formulation {{of this new}} distribution come from <b>computer</b> <b>aid</b> <b>geometric</b> <b>design,</b> specifically from Bezier curves. First, we review general properties of a distribution given by parametric equations and extend {{the definition of a}} Bezier distribution. Then, after proposing the BMT cumulative distribution function, we derive its probability density function and a closed-form expression for quantile function, median, interquartile range, mode, and moments. The domain change from [0, 1] to [c,d] is mentioned. Estimation of parameters is approached by the methods of maximum likelihood and maximum product of spacing. We test the numerical estimation procedures using some simulated data. Usefulness and flexibility of the new distribution are illustrated in three real data sets. The BMT distribution has a significant potential to estimate domain parameters and to model data outside the scope of the beta or similar distributions. Comment: 30 pages, 5 figures, 8 table...|$|R
40|$|Subdivision schemes are {{iterative}} {{methods for}} the design of smooth curves and surfaces. Any linear subdivision scheme can be identified by a sequence of Laurent polynomials, also called subdivision symbols, which describe the linear rules determining successive refinements of coarse initial meshes. The goal of this work is to derive explicit expressions of the subdivision symbols of exponential pseudo-splines reproducing exponential polynomials and to study their symmetry properties. The k-level subdivision symbol of an exponential pseudo-spline is defined by a suitable polynomial "correction" of the k-level subdivision symbol of an exponential B-spline. The polynomial correction is such that the resulting subdivision symbol is the one of minimal support that fulfills the conditions for reproduction of the space of exponential polynomials generated by the exponential B-spline, or a subset of it. Reproduction of exponential polynomials is indeed an important property in many applicative areas ranging from <b>computer</b> [...] <b>aided</b> <b>geometric</b> <b>design</b> to signal and image processing...|$|R
