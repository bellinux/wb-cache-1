2500|$|The TR.9D HF radio {{telephone}} set in fighters {{at the time}} of the Battle of Britain had two channels and the operating frequencies of the two could only be selected before take-off. One channel was used for voice communication with sector control, while the other was used by the [...] "pip-squeak" [...] system. With only one voice <b>channel,</b> <b>set</b> to a squadron-specific frequency, the TR.9D limited the ability to co-ordinate with other squadrons. The set was low power, with a range of about [...] air-to-ground and [...] air-to-air, which presented numerous problems with reception quality. The TR.9 originally operated on a band that was relatively empty, but by the time of the war it was much busier and interference was a constant problem.|$|E

30|$|At the beginning, a {{group of}} time slots is {{established}} and repeated over time, where the number of slots in a group {{is equal to the}} number of channels. In each time slot, a beacon is broadcasted using one of available channels in one-by-one manner. By listening to beacons, subsequent nodes synchronize and exchange the available <b>channel</b> <b>sets.</b> Every node examines the <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> in order to prepare a Node Channel Matrix (NCM) which will be described later.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel analysis of cochannel reuse in Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) microcellular systems with an in [...] cell channel reuse constraint. Mathematical analysis {{is used to}} show that DCA systems exhibit significantly closer cochannel reuse than Fixed Channel Assignment (FCA) systems despite the reuse constraint. Closed form expressions for the cochannel reuse ratio (CRR) distributions in DCA microcell systems are derived. It is shown that the DCA reuse distributions cannot be obtained using conventional cellular engineering techniques, and are a fundamental consequence of the microcell architecture. 1 INTRODUCTION In conventional cellular radio communications systems (`macrocell' systems), the available radio channels are partitioned into C <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> (C is called the `cluster size') and each transmitter is allocated the use {{of one of these}} <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> [1]. This is called Fixed Channel Assignment (FCA). Once the system grows beyond C cells, the <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> are re [...] ...|$|R

30|$|The {{operation}} of TEEN consists of many periods. Each period consists of many rounds. The process of CH election, clustering, and data transmission will be restarted {{after the end}} of each round. In order to adapt to spectrum variability of CWSN, this paper joins the process of available channel detection {{at the beginning of each}} round. Each node has a <b>set</b> of available <b>channel</b> after the process of available channel detection, such as if node i has the available <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> M(i), cluster node j has the available <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> M(j). Once the clusters are formed, CHs broadcast a time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedule to CMs. TDMA schedule gives the order to CMs when they can transmit data to CHs and avoids conflicts between nodes.|$|R
