40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. In the {{automotive}} industry, {{there is a}} big push to improve performance, fuel efficiency and other tailor-made engineering properties of vehicles. Manufacturers are now looking at other better, lightweight materials like magnesium and aluminum to use alongside steel. Traditional joining methods like welding are not suitable for these dissimilar materials. The friction stir forming process was developed and was able to create a single-pin fusion joint between aluminum and steel. This research now focuses on the issues that stemmed from the newly developed friction stir forming process. The first part studies the corrosion that occurred due to the usage of dissimilar metals. Friction stir formed samples were deployed to three different test sites, each with different atmospheric conditions for an 8 -month period. The corrosion products were characterized and the effects of these were related to the mechanical properties of the joints. Zinc was discovered to be the first metal to be attacked, followed by aluminum, and formed corrosion products in the joint. Higher chloride concentrations proved to be a more corrosive environment. Corrosion caused significant decrease in the strength of the joints. The second part of the research aimed to change the structure and makeup of the previous single-pin fusion joint. By developing a new anvil and the usage of a different tool, a new joint called the <b>clinch</b> <b>joint</b> was produced. The optimal parameters for the friction stir clinching process were determined. The <b>clinch</b> <b>joint</b> is a mechanical interlock and its mechanical properties were compared to the previous single-pin fusion joint.

40|$|The {{building}} industry {{has a particular}} interest in using clinching as a joining method for frame constructions of light-frame housing. Normally many clinch joints are required in joining of frames. In order to maximise {{the strength of the}} complete assembly, each <b>clinch</b> <b>joint</b> must be as sound as possible. Experimental testing is the main means of optimising a particular <b>clinch</b> <b>joint.</b> This includes shear strength testing and visual observation of joint cross-sections. The manufacturers of clinching equipment normally perform such experimental trials. Finite element analysis {{can also be used to}} optimise the tool geometry and the process parameter, X, which represents the thickness of the base of the joint. However, such procedures require dedicated software, a skilled operator, and test specimens in order to verify the finite element model. In addition, when using current technology several hours' computing time may be necessary. The objective of the study was to develop a simple calculation procedure for rapidly establishing an optimum value for the parameter X for a given tool combination. It should be possible to use the procedure on a daily basis, without stringent demands on the skill of the operator or the equipment. It is also desirable that the procedure would significantly decrease thenumber of shear strength tests required for verification. The experimental workinvolved tests in order to obtain an understanding of the behaviour of the sheets during clinching. The most notable observation concerned the stage of the process in which the upper sheet was initially bent, after which the deformation mechanism changed to shearing and elongation. The amount of deformation was measured relative to the original location of the upper sheet, and characterised as the C-measure. By understanding in detail the behaviour of the upper sheet, it waspossible to estimate a bending line function for the surface of the upper sheet. A procedure was developed, which makes it possible to estimate the process parameter X for each tool combination with a fixed die. The procedure is based on equating the volume of material on the punch side with the volume of the die. Detailed information concerning the behaviour of material on the punch side is required, assuming that the volume of die does not change during the process. The procedure was applied to shear strength testing of a sample material. The sample material was continuously hot-dip zinc-coated high-strength constructional steel,with a nominal thickness of 1. 0 mm. The minimum Rp 0. 2 proof stress was 637 N/mm 2. Such material has not yet been used extensively in light-frame housing, and little has been published on clinching of the material. The performance of the material is therefore of particular interest. Companies that use clinching on a daily basis stand to gain the greatest benefit from the procedure. By understanding the behaviour of sheets in different cases, it is possible to use data at an early stage for adjusting and optimising the process. In particular, the functionality of common tools can be increased since it is possible to characterise the complete range of existing tools. The study increases and broadens the amount ofbasic information concerning the clinching process. New approaches and points of view are presented and used for generating new knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum alloy sheets {{have been}} widely used to build the {{thin-walled}} structures by mechanical clinching technology in recent years. However, there is an exterior protrusion located on the lower sheet and a pit on the upper sheet, which may restrict the application of the clinching technology in visible areas. In the present study, an improved <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> used to join aluminum alloy sheets was investigated by experimental method. The improved clinching process used for joining aluminum alloy evolves through four phases: (a) localized deformation; (b) drawing; (c) backward extrusion; and (d) mechanical interlock forming. A flat surface can be produced using the improved clinching process. Shearing strength, tensile strength, material flow, main geometrical parameters, and failure mode of the improved <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> were investigated. The sheet material was compressed to flow radially and upward using a punch, which generated a mechanical interlock by producing severe localized plastic deformation. The neck thickness and interlock of the improved <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> were increased by increasing the forming force, which also contributed to increase the strength of the <b>clinched</b> <b>joint.</b> The improved <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> can get high shearing strength and tensile strength.

50|$|Clinching {{does not}} require a {{pre-cleaning}} of the surfaces, which is needed before applying adhesives. Clinching is almost an instant joining process (the required joining time is lower than a second) while adhesive joining often requires a much longer time mainly owing to the curing of the joint (up to many hours). <b>Clinched</b> <b>joints</b> are less affected by environmental agents and effect of aging.|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of surface irregularities or crevices leads to crevice corrosion attack, due to electrolyte accumulation in the interstices.

The activation and propagation of local cracks due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) weaken furthermore the <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> at long ageing times (Li et al. 2010; Winzer et al. 2005).|$|R
30|$|In particular, (LeBozec et al. 2008) {{have shown}} that the {{corrosion}} resistance of basic materials (e.g. steel or zinc-coated steel) and consequently, their durability performances are highly dependent on the kind of used accelerated-corrosion test. Consequently, the uncertainty about the degradation mechanisms induced by corrosion of the <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> is still relevant. At the same time, the variety of the joint type in the automotive design, as well as the assembly procedure, make any theoretical approach very difficult.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} stability of clinched junctions {{is influenced by}} several {{factors such as the}} correct selection of process parameters or the geometry of assembled materials (Varis and Lepisto 2003; Lee et al. 2010; Oudjene and Ben-Ayed 2008). Saberi et al.

30|$|The {{aluminium}} sheet in the <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> {{will be subject}} to oxide film formation that will act as protective barrier between the metal and the surrounding medium if the pH value of the environment is in the range of about 4 to 8.

Consequently, the oxidised metal leads to breakage due to the thinning induced by electrochemical dissolution (UK Aluminium Industry Fact Sheet 2 2012).|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} {{confirms that}} the two thickness combinations and ageing time are the significant factors. At 0 weeks, neglecting the effect of ageing, the maximum load values of all samples {{belong to the same}} population.

30|$|When the <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> {{work in an}} {{aggressive}} environment, particular attention would {{be placed on the}} electrochemical stability and corrosion resistance of the metal constituents (Mizukoshi and Okada 1997).

The durability of the metal joints could be heavily influenced in a corrosive environment, whereas the less noble material will tend to increase its corrosion rate; instead, the nobler one will reduce its electrochemical dissolution (He et al. 2008; Bardal 2004).|$|R
30|$|The {{clinching}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common metal joining processes in the manufacturing of metal plate based products (similar or dissimilar, pre-coated or galvanized), especially when the assembly without adding major joining elements is required. When the <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> work in an aggressive environment, particular attention would be placed on the electrochemical stability and corrosion resistance of the metal constituents (Mizukoshi and Okada 1997). In joining design, an appropriate material selection reduces the electrochemical potential differences and prevents significant galvanic currents (Kruger and Mandel 2011; Calabrese et al. 2014). The durability of the metal joints could be heavily influenced in a corrosive environment, whereas the less noble material will tend to increase its corrosion rate; instead the more noble one will reduce its electrochemical dissolution (He et al. 2008; Bardal 2004). Accelerated ageing tests (i.e. salt fog test) were carried out to evaluate the durability of the joints in highly aggressive environments (Calabrese et al. 2013; LeBozec et al. 2012). Although the durability for a long time of the <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> in a corrosion environment is a known problem, few works focus the attention on the relationship between durability of joints and electrochemical behaviour of the metal constituents. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the durability at long ageing time in salt spray test (according to ASTM B 117) of carbon steel/aluminium alloy <b>joints,</b> obtained by <b>clinching.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{resistance}} of the <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> decreases over time due to ageing in salt spray environment. The trends, at first, show a linear increase of the load. In this phase, the joint resistance is due both to the friction resistance, resulting from the contact pressure between the aluminium and steel sheets induced by forced mechanical joining. In this linear region, the maximum slope of the load/displacement curve is reached. After this phase, the activation of damage mechanisms of the joint occurs. In particular, the samples, at low ageing time, lose gradually their stiffness. This {{is due to a}} bending effect {{at the edge of the}} sheets in the overlapping area. After that, the maximum load value is reached, and the mechanical stability of the joints is critically prejudiced. Then, the slope of the load/displacement curve becomes negative with a gradual reduction of load, thus confirming that the mechanical interlocking is compromised. The joints subsequently open as a press-stud, such rupture occurs in the most of the <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> (Varis 2006). The ageing treatment reduces significantly the performances of the joint giving rise premature failure mechanisms induced by localized corrosion phenomena. At long ageing times, where the joint presents an advanced state of degradation, breakages in the neck of the joint both on the aluminium side and on the steel one could occur.|$|R

40|$|Dieless rivet {{clinching}} {{is a new}} {{joining method}} working with a flat anvil as a counter tool. The joining process requires neither predrilled holes nor special machinery set-ups. By superimposing the straight movement of the punch with a wobble movement a noticeable reduction of the necessary joining force can be reached. Potential application areas, where {{the use of the}} dieless rivet clinching is of special advantage compared to conventional joining methods, are those where the contoured die used in the conventional joining methods is causing problems. For example in tasks where joining equipment with a wide outreach is required, the realization of a proper alignment between the contoured die and the punch in conventional joining methods is very costly. As the counter tool in dieless rivet clinching is a flat anvil misalignments do not affect the formation of the joint. Also advantageous in dieless rivet clinching is the fact, that a change of the joining task does not require a change of the joining tools for all possible joining operations are done with the same flat anvil. Thus huge savings can be made as there are no or only little costs for purchasing, storing, changing and aligning the joining tools. For selected joining tasks the influence of relevant process parameters and characteristics of the rivet on the formation of the joint in dieless rivet clinching was investigated. Through extensive experiments and supporting FEM-calculations the principle of the formation of the joint and the effects of important parameters have been analyzed in detail. The general knowledge acquired in the research project can help to choose the right rivets and process parameters even for joining tasks, that have not been researched yet. The limits concerning the tasks that can be joined with the dieless rivet clinching have been profoundly researched. It was found that the joining of sheets with a similar thickness is feasible. The same is true for the joining of sheets with a different thickness as long as the thinner sheet is positioned on the rivet side and the thicker sheet is positioned on the anvil side. It is possible to join sheets of the same material as well as sheets of different materials. If sheets of different materials are to be joined the positioning of the sheet with the higher strength on the rivet side has proven to be advantageous. For a selected joining task the strength values of dieless rivet <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> where tested and compared to the strength values of joints similar in size, that where made by conventional joining methods using a contoured die. The results show, that dieless rivet <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> under both static and cyclic shear tension load have considerably higher strength values than self-pierce riveted joints. On the other hand the peel tension strength and the head tension strength values of dieless rivet <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> are only slightly higher than the values of <b>clinched</b> <b>joints.</b> The peel tension strength and the head tension strength values of self-pierce riveted joints are noticeably higher.

40|$|Manufacturing {{thin-walled}} {{structures and}} products inevitably involves {{the selection of}} suited joining techniques. The ongoing search for new, sustainable and innovative lightweight materials puts high demands on joining skills. In order to integrate these new materials in structures, products or vehicles, appropriate joining techniques have to be available. In particular for the joining of lightweight metallic sheets, which can be coated and/or dissimilar, alternative joining techniques have emerged in recent years. Amongst those, clinching -or press-joining- can assemble sheet metal parts by solely relying on local plastic deformation of the combining sheets. Unlike traditional joining techniques, clinching does not use additional material inserts such as a rivet or a bolt, and, as a consequence, the mechanical strength of such a connection highly depends on the final geometry after forming. This work focuses on the so called single stroke round clinch process with a closed die. In addition, the quasi-static mechanical response of joints produced by this technology is studied. This thesis can be divided in three major parts: 1. Since clinch forming involves severe plastic deformation, the first part embarks on the identification of plastic material properties at large plastic strains. Two alternative sheet metal material tests are presented. The purpose of these tests is to reveal the plastic material behaviour hidden in the post-necking regime of thin metal sheet. 2. In the second part, the complex metal flow during forming is studied {{with the aid of}} finite element techniques. Since friction {{plays an important role in}} this forming process, a strategy to identify the elements of the tribological system in clinch forming is presented. The predicted final geometry of the joint after forming is systematically compared with experiments. 3. The third part concerns the mechanical response of <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> to quasi-static loading conditions. To be specific, the capability of finite element techniques to reproduce the experimental results obtained with pull-out tests, single lap shear tests and multi-axial loading of <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> is investigated.

30|$|The {{two sets}} of joints show a {{different}} behaviour at increasing ageing time: the St 1.5 /Al 1 batch shows a constant decay of the load values, instead the St 1 /Al 1.5 set maintains acceptable values of resistance for several weeks of ageing, at tenth week the mechanical stability is strongly impaired. In the latter case {{the presence of the}} thin oxide layer at the overlapping interface, which behaves as an adhesive interlayer, and the larger thickness of the aluminium plate improve the resistance of the St 1 /Al 1.5 joints. Statistical analysis confirms that the two thickness combinations and ageing time are the significant factors. At zero weeks, neglecting the effect of ageing, the maximum load values of all samples belong to the same population. This means that the resistance of the <b>clinched</b> <b>joints</b> is the same regardless the combination of thicknesses, but by considering both the ageing and thickness, the analysis of variance shows that both thickness and weeks are significant parameters distinguishing two different populations in the distribution of loads.|$|R
40|$|Clinching is a {{mechanical}} joining technique that involves severe {{local plastic deformation}} {{of two or more}} metal sheet parts resulting in a permanent mechanical interlock. Today, it is a reliable joining technique used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), automotive and general steel constructions whilst still gaining interest. As it is not computationally feasible to include detailed sub models of these type of joints in FE simulations of clinched assemblies during the design stage, this paper proposes a simple methodology to represent these connections with simplified elements. The key point of the method is the use of uncoupled plastic behaviour to model the joint plastic properties. In order to calibrate the parameters governing the equivalent model, a simple shear lap and pull-out reference test of a single <b>clinched</b> <b>joint</b> was used.

Since clinch forming locally results in a complex region, a good knowledge of the plastic material properties is of the utmost importance to perform a sufficiently accurate simulation. The identification of post-necking hardening behavior of sheet metal is complex and there is no general agreement on how to perform this.
