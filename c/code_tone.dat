The high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), which leads to OFDM signal distortion and power inefficiency in the OFDM system transmitter radio frequency amplifier, shows a major limitation of OFDM. Several PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed and used, such as, tone injection, amplitude clipping, <b>coding,</b> <b>tone</b> injection, Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), interleaving, and Selected Mapping (SLM). This paper introduced an effective SLM technique which gives a better OFDM PAPR reduction performance than conventional SLM technique. In achieving this, phase rotation of OFDM symbol is performed using a new set of phase rotation factors, and a Hann window function is applied to further reduce peaks in the OFDM signal. The results of computer simulations show that the PAPR reduction performance of the proposed technique is higher than conventional SLM by 0. 2 dB...|$|R

Many techniques are proposed to reduce PAPR including amplitude clipping, clipping and filtering, <b>coding,</b> <b>tone</b> reservation (TR), tone injection (TI), active constellation extension (ACE), partial transmit sequence (PTS), selected mapping (SLM) and interleaving. One of the effective methods, Partial Transmit Sequence is described in this article. In the conventional PTS (C-PTS) several inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operations and complicated calculations to obtain optimum phase sequence, increase computational complexity of C-PTS. But in new proposed phase sequence the number of IFFT operations is reduced to half {{at the expense of}} a slight PAPR degradation.

40|$|One of the {{normative}} functions of economic news is surveillance, making monitorial citizens aware of significant economic developments. In this light, {{it is important}} to look at the way economic news covers periods of recession and economic boom. Previous studies have focused on how the media cover monthly developments of the economy rather than how coverage varies {{over the course of the}} economic cycle. Based on parallels between self-reinforcing news waves or media hypes, on the one hand, and coverage of recession and economic boom, on the other, we argue that the media amplify periods of prolonged economic growth or contraction by making the economy more visible and reporting with an overly positive or negative tone. A time-series analysis of the relation between economic developments and the automatically <b>coded</b> <b>tone</b> and visibility of economic news in Danish newspapers (1996 - 2012) shows that the media functioned as a magnifying glass. During recession, the economy became more negative and visible than economic developments would predict. During economic boom, economic news became more positive, but not more visible. The media adjusted the tone downwards before the economy entered recession. These results are assessed in light of the surveillance function...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{wireless}} communication {{has taken its}} leap for a high data rate using the multi-carrier transmission technique. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM) is one of such popular method for achieving this high information rate. OFDM has several advantages,but {{one of the main}} drawbacks is its high peak-to-average power ratio(PAPR). This is due to a large number of the subcarrier,which leads to distortion problem at receiver. An OFDM signal with the high PAPR requires power amplifier’s(PAs) with large dynamic ranges. Such PAs are less efficient,costly to manufacture and very much difficult to design. There have been a large number of techniques are available in the literature to reduce the PAPR, such as Partial transmit sequence,Selective mapping,Block <b>Coding,</b> <b>Tone</b> rejection,etc. However,the challenging part {{is that most of the}} PAPR reduction schemes come with high computational complexity. Recent PAPR reduction techniques such as partial transmit sequence(PTS) has been considered as most popular for PAPR reduction. This research work explores to find a solution for the PAPR reduction by using PTS technique, which has been implemented by using sub-blocks partitioning. In sub-block partition consists of OFDM data frame which is partitioned into several sub-blocks. An adjacent partitioning(AP) method can be perceived as the best of the existing partitioning method when the cost and PAPR reduction performance are considered together. A new technique is based on modified PTS using phase rotation and circular shifting to attain the overall reduction of PAPR in MIMO-OFDM system, but computational complexity does not decrease for the same. A Co-operative PTS technique which is mainly based on alternative PTS technique is applied. In this technique although a slight loss of PAPR reduction performance is there but with much lower computational complexity...|$|R

The tones are usually referred to as sub-audible tones. In an FM two-way radio system, CTCSS encoder levels are usually set for 15% of system deviation. For example, in a 5 kHz deviation system, the CTCSS tone level would normally be set to 750 Hz deviation.
