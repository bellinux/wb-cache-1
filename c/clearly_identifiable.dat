In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is <b>clearly</b> <b>identifiable</b> as grapevine.|$|E
5|$|The line {{of route}} runs {{parallel}} to the West Somerset Railway from Watchet to Washford where it forms a foot and cycle path. Washford station has been demolished and a bungalow is on the site. The line then curves south west, partly {{in the form of}} a road, past Cleeve Abbey and Roadwater, where the station buildings survive with an extension to form a bungalow. The line continues to Comberow. The siding group that was at the foot of the incline is <b>clearly</b> <b>identifiable</b> at Comberow, to the west of the bridge that carried the incline, as is the station master's house and traces of the platform. Part of the line northwards from there seems to be a footpath.|$|E

Interestingly, Golden {{is described}} as being a 'creamy' like Thowra himself, yet is much more clearly identified as being a Palomino by her name, indicating that she is probably a darker, more traditionally 'golden' coloured Palomino, though <b>clearly</b> still <b>identifiable</b> as being the same colour as Thowra.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the {{symbolic}} meaning of the helmet's design. The griffin was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and fate. They were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat. The meaning of the face and headpiece are less <b>clearly</b> <b>identifiable.</b> Suggestions have ranged from the Greek god Attis and the hero Perseus, to the Roman gods Mithras and Jupiter Dolichenus, to a more general Eastern Mediterranean appearance that could possibly have been meant to suggest a Trojan identity. The Phrygian cap was often used by the Romans as a visual motif representing the Trojans.|$|E
5|$|An Indian Mughal {{painting}} rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo {{along with}} native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A. Iwanow and dodo specialist Julian Hume {{regard it as}} one of the most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are <b>clearly</b> <b>identifiable</b> and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen dodos. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.|$|E

However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who treated the arrangements and wrote {{the bulk of the}} music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. <b>Clearly</b> <b>identifiable</b> on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts.|$|E

We {{have made}} a clear {{detection}} of p-mode oscillations in the nearest solar-like G 2 V star α Cen A with the CORALIE spectrograph on the 1. 2 -m Swiss telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory. We report the 5 nights of observation on this star in May 2001 during which 1260 high precision radial velocity measurements were obtained. The power spectrum <b>clearly</b> shows several <b>identifiable</b> peaks between 1. 7 and 3 mHz.

30|$|White mosaics, however, were {{composed}} mainly by a calcite-based matrix without {{the application of}} any pictorial layer, {{as shown in the}} obtained Raman spectrum. In Additional file 1 : Figure S 3 the typical bands of calcite at 282, 712 and 1086  cm− 1 [5] can be observed. In this case no additional colored compounds apart from calcite were detected, suggesting that the molecular composition of these white tesserae consisted only in calcite. As observed in previous works [11, 17], in Roman white tesserae the presence of calcite-bearing rock was <b>clearly</b> and frequently <b>identifiable</b> as the mineral constituting the substrate. In this case, pictorial layers were not added to obtain different colored hues.|$|R

In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, <b>clearly</b> <b>identifiable</b> by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a Coronation of the Virgin in a niche above the central portal.

It is found that: (1) it is the extreme values of the southward interplanetary magnetic fields rather than solar wind speeds that are the primary causes of great magnetic storms, (2) shocked and draped sheath fields preceding the driver gas (magnetic cloud) are at least as effective in causing the onset of great magnetic storms (3 of 5 events) as the strong fields within the driver gas itself, and (3) precursor southward fields ahead of the high speed streams allow the shock compression mechanism (item 2) to be particularly geoeffective...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the revival of}} public policies as a theme {{in the field of}} geography. The main assumption is that policies are constructed as a result of issues elaborated and recognized as public, due to conflicts of interest and divergent projects, that are arise within <b>clearly</b> defined and <b>identifiable</b> territories. Thus, the main objective is to underscore the possible contributions the geographer may bring, as a professional and a thinker, to the debate on public policies in a context of increasing rearrangement of the political spaces and the establishment of new channels and territories for public debate and action. In light of decentralization processes, of current notions about territorial public policies, participation and territorial governance, the discussion is addressed by concentrating on three main topics: the thematic, the epistemological and the methodological. At last, the debate is placed within the Brazilian context...|$|R

The findings suggest that the peer rating system makes visible what the participants find immediately valuable and allocates a form of recognition that extends the “legitimation code”, which refers to the credentials that make someone competent and worthy of recognition...|$|R

40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea {{states that}} repressive actions against piracy {{can only be}} carried out by {{warships}} or other ships that are <b>clearly</b> marked and <b>identifiable</b> as being on government service and authorised to that effect. In principle, merchant ships are thus not empowered to resort to such actions. This fairly reasonable requirement gives rise to some problems. Warships are obviously seldom targeted and, because of the large range of modern pirates, they are not often able to catch the pirates in the act, causing serious difficulties with regard to evidence. Apart from the evidentiary issues, hypothetical situations wherein the crew of a merchant ship succeeds in averting an attack and eventually overpowers the pirate suspects also need to be considered. Is the crew then obliged to let the pirates escape without consequence, {{in the absence of any}} competence to apprehend them, or is there a way to realise adequate arrest and prosecution of these suspects...|$|R

In this case, the questions we ask will have to do with our presuppositions about literature, reading, and writing; and about the function and place of literature, the study of literature, and even the concept "literature" in our culture. The texts we look at will not for the most part be works of imaginative literature. In some cases they are not even <b>clearly</b> about an <b>identifiable</b> work of literature, though all are centrally important to the way discourse about literature is currently being conducted.

50|$|Also {{characteristic}} of Exekias is his expert use of line, {{both in terms}} of his finely drawn figures and also his carefully incised detail—to delineate hair, beards, unique facial features, aspects of armor and furniture, traits of plants and animals, and particularly the patterns on woven or embroidered garments, which are impressively varied and spectacularly precise. This can be appreciated in the famous Vatican amphora (344), on which Achilles and Ajax are both shown wearing richly ornamented cloaks, with almost every element <b>clearly</b> visible and <b>identifiable</b> despite the small scale. Incised designs include rosettes of various types, swastikas with squared or rounded arms, stars, and loops, arranged in panels divided by bands of many types of geometric decoration. Musculature is deftly executed, as are details of hands, feet, and armor, and hair is precisely drawn with a series of lines that run exactly parallel and end in curls; the facial expressions of the two heroes are likewise perfectly accomplished, so as to indicate, within the conventions of black figure, the intense concentration as shown by the gaze of both players.|$|R

In 1966, the AATTV's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Milner, decided that the unit and its far-flung members needed an identifying unit badge. Warrant Officer Class Two Laurie Nicholson, who had been temporarily attached to AATTV HQ, was instructed by Milner to come up with designs for his consideration.

25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a <b>clearly</b> <b>identifiable</b> larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E
