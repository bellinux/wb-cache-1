Little or no effort has been invested to research about the cause(s) of the huge returns of packages (send – agains) daily by <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> drivers in the supply chain management industry. Even leading courier firms in the industry has paid lipped service to this problem but continued to focus their attention and resources on the minimization of operational cost and increased profit maximization. This research study ventures to delve into the reasons and causes to the aforementioned problem of how do <b>parcel</b> (package) <b>delivery</b> firms deal or can curtail the increasing volume of high send – agains (returns) daily in their respective hubs [...] Data collected in the field from 10 different service providers (drivers) resulted in findings like, most customers are not at home during a delivery; delivery drivers not having access codes to residential (apartment) buildings and not having work telephone among other factors that have been unearth that cause’s huge send –agains. The poor flow of communication (i. e. delivery date and time) between the courier companies and customers also have an adverse effect <b>on</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery.</b> The causality of huge returns that affect and hinders a successful <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> are discussed in-depth in this research.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the impact}} of {{international}} transport time on bilateral trade flows in goods using previously unexploited information drawn from a large dataset <b>on</b> international <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> times. In line with previous work, we find that an extra day spent in international transit reduces bilateral trade by just under one percent at the sample median. In addition, {{and for the first}} time in the literature, we examine {{the impact of}} time-related uncertainty, which requires traders to hold costly inventories or build costly redundancies into supply chains. We find that a one day increase in international transport time uncertainty reduces bilateral trade flows by just over one percent. Splitting the sample into developing and developed countries shows that international transit time matters primarily for South-South trade, whereas uncertainty is relatively more important for North-North trade. Using new data on trade in intermediate versus final goods, we also find some evidence that time and uncertainty both matter more for movements of intermediates of the type that takes place within global value chains...|$|R

40|$|Optimizing city {{logistics}} {{is a topic}} of great importance for big cities today. Even though the environmental- and economical consequences of the increasing goods transportation fleet has been present for quite some time, actions from affected stakeholders has not been taken until just recently.   In this brief 9 week project the aim has been to,  from a design point-of-view, in this complex topic, give a suggestion and raise a discussion onto how goods transportation in cities {{can be made in}} the future.   The basic idea is to get the consignments as close to the consignees and their travel patterns as possible. Public transportation networks are an existing grid where people are moving around and can potentially be used for combined transport of goods and people. The outcome of this concept is focusing <b>on</b> light <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> towards private consignees, due to the increasing e-commerce trend. By using small transporter vehicles connected to buses, light parcels can be distributed throughout a city and easily accessible for consignees at the bus stops.   The transporter vehicle developed through this project aims to conceptualize connectivity and integration between mobility and <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> services, to ease the every day life of urban citizens as well as decrease the environmental- and economical impacts which the distribution vehicle-fleet of today entails.   The design of the transporter vehicle is an interpretation of how a autonomous distribution vehicle can look like in a future city environment where the integration of public-utility-vehicles is of greater importance...|$|R
40|$|Medium-duty {{vehicles}} {{are used in}} {{a broad array of}} fleet applications, including <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery.</b> These {{vehicles are}} excellent candidates for electric drive applications due to their transient-intensive duty cycles, operation in densely populated areas, and relatively high fuel consumption and emissions. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a robust assessment of <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> routes and completed a model-based techno-economic analysis of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) configurations. First, NREL characterized <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> vehicle usage patterns, most notably daily distance driven and drive-cycle intensity. Second, drive-cycle analysis results framed the selection of drive cycles used to test a <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> HEV <b>on</b> a chassis dynamometer. Next, measured fuel consumption results were used to validate simulated fuel consumption values derived from a dynamic model of the <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> vehicle. Finally, NREL swept a matrix of 120 component size, usage, and cost combinations to assess impacts on fuel consumption and vehicle cost. The results illustrated the dependency of component sizing on drive-cycle intensity and daily distance driven and may allow <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> fleets to match the most appropriate electric drive vehicle (EDV) to their fleet usage profile...|$|R

50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and <b>collect</b> it <b>on</b> <b>delivery.</b> Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|R
