5|$|Microscopic {{theoretical}} {{treatment of}} fluid phases can become quite complicated, {{owing to the}} high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy {{in all of these}} interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E

25|$|From 1980 to 1997, {{the number}} of twin births in the United States rose 52%. This rise <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partly be {{attributed}} to the increasing popularity of fertility drugs and procedures such as IVF, which result in multiple births more frequently than unassisted fertilizations do. It may also be linked to the increase of growth hormones in food.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{physical}} circumstances {{do not allow}} molecules to be studied in solution, {{and at the same}} time not by other spectroscopic techniques to an atomic level, either. In solid-phase media, such as crystals, microcrystalline powders, gels, anisotropic solutions, etc., it is in particular the dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy that become dominant to the behaviour of the nuclear spin systems. In conventional solution-state NMR spectroscopy, these additional interactions would lead to a significant broadening of spectral lines. A variety of techniques allows establishing high-resolution conditions, that <b>can,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> for 13C spectra, be comparable to solution-state NMR spectra.|$|E

He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false.

25|$|Just as {{uncertain}} is {{the nature}} of the sacrifices made there. Judging from the remains of the actual, relatively small fire altar inside the huge altar edifice, it <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be concluded that its shape resembled a horseshoe. It was apparently an altar with two projecting side wings and one or several steps in front. Possibly the thighs of sacrificial animals were burned here. But it is just as possible that the altar served only for libations— the offering of sacrifices in the form of incense, wine and fruits. It is likely that only priests, members of the royal household and illustrious foreign guests were allowed access to the fire altar.|$|E
25|$|Although Minnan is the {{mainstream}} Southern Min language and is spoken in Teochew speaking region's closest neighbour, Southern Fujian towards the northeast, most Teochew {{people do not}} speak it and the majority see themselves as a distinct group from their mainstream counterparts in their neighbouring Southern Fujian. Most <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> understand Minnan marginally and they treat Minnan as an improper form of their own tongue. However, there are a minority group of Teochew people who speak Minnan exclusively, {{most of whom have}} had relatives and close contacts with their mainstream counterparts from their neighbouring Southern Fujian. For these Minnan speaking Teochews, Minnan is highly considered as their native language as well and they treat their hometown language as a merely accented form of Minnan. They usually have a strong sense of identity as Hoklo Minnan people and they integrate easily into {{the mainstream}} Southern Min culture.|$|E
25|$|Emotional labor {{also affects}} women by perpetuating {{occupational}} segregation and the gender wage gap. Job segregation, {{which is the}} systematic tendency {{for men and women}} to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and empathizing are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations. The emotion work expected of many female employees is essentially invisible and uncompensated while the employer gains profit more generally. Thus, according to Guy and Newman (2004), ignored and uncompensated emotional labor is at least one underlying cause for both occupational gender segregation and the gender wage gap.|$|E

500|$|Himmler was {{inspired}} by the noted successes of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry in World War I. He [...] "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army {{in the form of a}} Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local [...] "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. [...] "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by... the Bosnian division... so that we <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{shock and}} {{confusion}} {{with which the}} male characters in [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] react to the Woods scandal, and the extreme measures they undertake to learn why rich and successful men crave sex, served as a parody to the wide media attention and analysis the scandal received. The episode puts forward a pragmatic explanation that it is natural for men to crave sex, so although Woods's actions cannot be condoned, they <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be understood for what they are. This point of view particularly conveyed in the speech of one SWAT team member {{near the end of}} the episode, who is ostracized, imprisoned and unknowingly shot to death by Kyle and Butters after expressing his common sense views. The episode suggests men of normal financial means would likely be tempted by infidelity and sexual affairs if they had enough fame and money to obtain them easily.|$|E

[...] Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Johnson commented, [...] "Billy Crystal returned as host of the Academy Awards on Monday night and proved that even if mainline Hollywood is nearly shut out in the trophy dispensing, one of its representatives <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> make a television broadcast entertaining." [...] Television critic Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register quipped, [...] "In his fifth stint as host, Crystal served up the sense of inclusive, insider movie community that had been missing during his three-year absence."

500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> see where it all began. And while you’re still pondering how Grey's can still be so damn good sometimes," ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still trying to figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E
