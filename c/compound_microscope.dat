5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just {{beginning}} to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> in 1665. But it was not until Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

500|$|In 1609, Galileo was, {{along with}} Englishman Thomas Harriot and others, {{among the first}} to use a refracting {{telescope}} as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name [...] "telescope" [...] was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani, at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei. The name was derived from the Greek tele = 'far' and skopein = 'to look or see'. In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects. By 1624, Galileo had used a <b>compound</b> <b>microscope.</b> He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria, and in September, he sent another to Prince Cesi. The Linceans played a role again in naming the [...] "microscope" [...] a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo's invention from the Greek words μικρόν (micron) meaning [...] "small", and σκοπεῖν (skopein) meaning [...] "to look at". The word was meant to be analogous with [...] "telescope". Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a <b>compound</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{stars that}} {{comprise}} Microscopium {{are in a}} region previously considered the hind feet of Sagittarius, a neighbouring constellation. [...] John Ellard Gore wrote that al-Sufi seems to have reported that Ptolemy had seen the stars but he (Al Sufi) did not pinpoint their positions. Microscopium itself was introduced in 1751–52 by Lacaille with the French name le Microscope, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Commemorating the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope,</b> the Microscope's name had been Latinised by Lacaille to Microscopium by 1763.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} compound microscopes, which combine {{an objective lens}} near the specimen with an eyepiece to view a real image, appeared in Europe around 1620. The design {{is very similar to}} the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the Netherlands including claims it was invented in 1590 by Zacharias Janssen and/or his father, Hans Martens, claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, and claims it was invented by expatriate Cornelis Drebbel who was noted to have a version in London in 1619. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name [...] "microscope" [...] was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> in 1625.|$|E

60|$|Generative System.--The {{contents}} of the animal, between the sack containing the thorax and the outer integuments, and directly under the thorax, varied much in condition: in young and lately attached specimens the whole consisted of a pulpy mass with numerous oil-globules; in other specimens, apparently more mature, there were vast numbers of cells, sometimes cohering in sheets, about 3/10,000ths of an inch in diameter, and having darkish granular centres; these I {{believe to be the}} testes, for in a specimen presently to be mentioned, in which the vesicula seminalis was gorged with spermatozoa, I found adhering to its outside, a mass of cells of exactly the same diameter, but now empty and transparent instead of having brownish centres. Lastly, in several other specimens, at the very bottom of the sack-formed animal, there was a brownish, pear-shaped bag, of different sizes in different individuals, and occasionally broader even than the thorax. This bag contained either pulpy matter, or a great mass of spermatozoa. Before being disturbed, these spermatozoa lay parallel to each other in flocks, and they yielded to the needle in a peculiar manner, so that I found (having had experience with these bodies in living Cirripedia) I could almost tell before examination under the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope,</b> whether or not I should see spermatozoa. Many had distinct heads,[52] which were two or three times as broad as the filamentary bodies; the latter when placed between glass were the 1/20,000th of an inch in diameter. I compared these spermatozoa with others taken out of the vesiculæ seminales of the individual hermaphrodite S. vulgare, to which the parasite was attached, and could not perceive the slightest difference in them. The brownish pear-shaped bag, or vesicula seminalis, the coat of which seems fibrous, could sometimes be distinctly traced, sending a chord or prolongation far up the thorax: {{at the end of the}} abdominal lobe, no doubt there is an orifice; and this, I believe, I once distinguished. Owing to this chord, the bag often adheres to the thorax, when the latter is dissected out of the general integuments; in this condition, I twice clearly made out that it was single: in one other specimen, however, there appeared to be two small vesiculæ seminales. By using a condenser and very brilliant light, the outline of the vesicula seminalis could sometimes be distinguished before dissection, at the bottom of the sack-formed animal; and such was the case in the specimen drawn in fig. 9.|$|E

50|$|The actual {{inventor}} of the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> is unknown although many claims have been made over the years. These include a claim 35 years after they appeared by Dutch spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen that his father, Zacharias Janssen, invented the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> and/or the telescope as early as 1590. Johannes' (some claim dubious) testimony pushes the invention date so far back that Zacharias {{would have been a}} child at the time, leading to speculation that, for Johannes' claim to be true, the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> would have to have been invented by Johannes' grandfather, Hans Martens. Another claim is that Janssen's competitor, Hans Lippershey (who applied for the first telescope patent in 1608) also invented the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope.</b> Other historians point to the Dutch innovator Cornelis Drebbel with his 1621 <b>compound</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the optical}} devices some historians believe Drebbel invented {{when he was}} working for the Duke of Buckingham was the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope.</b> The device {{appeared}} in Europe around 1620 with the earliest account being Dutch Ambassador Willem Boreel's 1619 visit to London where he saw a <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> in Drebbel's possession, described as an instrument about eighteen inches long, two inches in diameter, and supported on 3 brass dolphins. In 1621 Drebbel had a <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> with two convex lenses. Several of his contemporaries, including Christiaan Huygens, credited the invention of the <b>compound</b> <b>microscope</b> to Drebbel. The invention has many counter claims including Dutch spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen's claim that Drebbel stole the idea from him and his father, Zacharias Jansen, and claims that Galileo Galilei used his telescope after 1610 as a type of <b>compound</b> <b>microscope.</b> In 1624 Galileo saw Drebbel's design for a microscope in Rome and created an improved version of it to send to Federico Cesi, founder of the Accademia dei Lincei, who used it to illustrate Apiarum, his book about bees.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis The self-fertilizing {{mangrove}} killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is {{an upcoming}} model species {{for a range}} of biological disciplines. To further establish this model in the field of developmental biology, we examined several techniques for embryonic manipulation and for imaging {{that can be used in}} an array of experimental designs. These methodological approaches can be divided into two categories: handling of embryos with and without their chorionic membrane. Embryos still enclosed in their chorion can be manipulated using an agarose bed or a methyl cellulose system, holding them in place and allowing their rotation to more specific angles and positions. Using these methods, we demonstrate microinjection of embryos and monitoring of fluorescent yolk syncytial nuclei (YSN) using both stereo and <b>compound</b> <b>microscopes.</b> For higher magnification imaging using <b>compound</b> <b>microscopes</b> as well as time-lapse analyses, embryos were dechorionated and embedded in low-melting-point agarose. To demonstrate this embedding technique, we further examined fluorescent YSN and also analyzed the yolk surface of K. marmoratus embryos. The latter was observed to provide an excellent imaging platform for study of the behavior and morphology of cells during embryonic development, for various types of cells. Our data demonstrate that K. marmoratus is an excellent model species for research in developmental biology, as methodological approaches for the manipulation and imaging of embryos are efficient and readily available...|$|R
