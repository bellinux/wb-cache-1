40|$|The {{recycling}} of electronic components {{has become a}} major concern for the industry and government as it potentially impacts the security and reliability {{of a wide variety of}} electronic systems. The sheer number of component types (analog, digital, and mixed-signal) and sizes (large or small) makes it extremely challenging to find a one-sizefits- all solution to detect and prevent recycled ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring <b>circuit</b> <b>usage</b> time when used in the field. These solutions include light-weight, onchip structures based on ring oscillators (RO-CDIR), anti-fuses (AF-CDIR). Each structure meets the unique needs and limitations of different part types and sizes providing excellent coverage of recycled parts. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis is used to separate process and temperature variations ’ effects on the sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based sensor, counters and embedded one-time programmable memory are used to record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design. Simulation results show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in AF-based sensors shows thatrecycled ICs, even used for a very short period, can be accurately identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} power-sensitive design has grown {{significantly}} {{in recent years}} due to tremendous growth in portable applications. Consequently, the need for power efficient design techniques has grown considerably. Several efficient design techniques have been proposed to reduce both dynamic as well as static power in state-of-the-art VLSI circuit applications. With the scaling of technology {{and the need for}} higher performance and more functionality, power dissipation is becoming a major bottleneck for microprocessor designs. Clock power is significant in high-performance processors. Deterministic Clock Gating (DCG) technique effectively reduces the clock power. DCG is based on the key observation that for many of the pipelined stages of a modern processor, the circuit block usage in the near future is known a few cycles ahead of time. DCG exploits this advance knowledge to clock-gate the unused blocks. Because individual <b>circuit</b> <b>usage</b> varies within and across applications, not all the circuits are used all the time, giving rise to power reduction opportunity. By ANDing the clock with a gate-control signal, clock-gating essentially disables the clock to a circuit whenever the circuit is not used, avoiding power dissipation due to unnecessary charging and discharging of the unused circuits. Results show that DCG is very effective in reducing clock power. 25 – 33 % power consumption is reduced by using this method. As high-performance processor pipelines get deeper and power becomes a more critical factor, DCG’s effectiveness and simplicity will continue to be important...|$|E

40|$|Future {{lithography}} systems must {{produce more}} dense chips with smaller feature sizes, {{while maintaining the}} throughput of one wafer per sixty seconds per layer achieved by today's optical lithography systems. To achieve this throughput with a direct-write maskless lithography system, using 25 nm pixels for 50 nm feature sizes, requires data rates of about 10 Tb/s. In a previous paper, we presented an architecture which achieves this data rate contingent on consistent 25 to 1 compression of lithography data, and on implementation of a decoder-writer chip with a real-time decompressor fabricated on the same chip as the massively parallel array of lithography writers. In this paper, we examine the compression efficiency of a spectrum of techniques suitable for lithography data, including two industry standards JBIG and JPEG-LS, a wavelet based technique SPIHT, general file compression techniques ZIP and BZIP 2, our own 2 D-LZ technique, and a simple list-of-rectangles representation RECT. Layouts rasterized both to black-and-white pixels, and to 32 level gray pixels are considered. Based on compression efficiency, JBIG, ZIP, 2 D-LZ, and BZIP 2 {{are found to be}} strong candidates for application to maskless lithography data, in many cases far exceeding the required compression ratio of 25. To demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the decoder-writer chip, we consider the design of a hardware decoder based on ZIP, the simplest of the four candidate techniques. The basic algorithm behind ZIP compression is Lempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ 77), and the design parameters of LZ 77 decompression are optimized to minimize <b>circuit</b> <b>usage</b> while maintaining compression efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{promotion}} of ΝΟ reduction by C 3 H 6 on Rh/YSZ catalystelectrodes, in presence of excess oxygen: The reduction of ΝΟ by propylene {{in the presence}} of excess oxygen is a very important reaction from the environmental point of view. The effect of electrochemical promotion (Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity-NEMCA) was used to promote this reaction by employing Rh polycrystalline films interfaced with yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) in galvanic cells of the type: C 3 H 6, NO, O 2, products, Rh/YSZ/Au, C 3 H 6, NO, O 2, products It was found that both the catalytic activity and the selectivity of the Rh catalyst-electrode is affected dramatically upon varying its potential with respect to the Au reference electrode. Catalytic rate enhancements up to 15000 % and 6000 % were observed for direct propylene oxidation and NO reduction, respectively, while the product selectivity to N 2 production is affected significantly (up to 200 %) upon positive potential application. Electrochemical {{promotion of}} a classically promoted Rh catalyst with NaOH for the reduction of NO by CO {{in the presence of}} Ο 2 : The reduction of NO by CO in presence of Ο 2, a reaction of great technological importance, was investigated on porous polycrystalline Rh catalyst-electrodes on YSZ (Y 2 O 3 -stabilized-ZrO 2) -an O 2 - conductor. It was found that application of current or potential between the Rh catalyst and a Au counter-electrode enhances the rate of NO reduction and CO 2 formation by up to a factor 20. These rates increases are strongly non-Faradaic with apparent Faradaic efficiencies, Λ, up to 20, manifesting the effect of Electrochemical Promotion or Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA). The Rh catalyst electrodes were subsequently promoted in a classical way, via dry impregnation with NaOH, followed by drying and calcination. The thus Na-promoted Rh films were found to exhibit much higher catalytic activity than the unpromoted films, with a pronounced decrease in their light-off temperature 440 ο to 320 oC. The effect of Electrochemical Promotion was then studied on these, already Na-promoted Rh catalyst. Positive (+ 1 V) potentials were found to further increase the rate of NO reduction by up to a factor of 4 with a Faradaic efficiency up to 20 and concomitant reduction in light-off temperature down to 260 oC. Study of the electrochemical promotion effect via AC Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) technique: The present thesis is the first detailed AC Impedance Spectroscopy implementation on the study and understanding of the mechanism regarding the Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis effect (EPOC or NEMCA effect). The main advantage of the IS is that it provides a possibility of an electrical <b>circuit</b> <b>usage</b> towards the representation of an electrochemical system. For example, an electrode/electrolyte interface in which an electrochemical reaction is taking place is corresponding to an electrical circuit which consists of a specific combination of resistances and capacitors. The use of AC theory is possible in order to characterize the electrochemical system based on its equivalent circuit. In fact we can correlate the IS spectra of a specific electrochemical system to one or more than one equivalent circuits. This information can be used as to identify a mechanism model for the above mentioned system or, at least, to reject inappropriate models. When a certain model is chosen, the electrochemical system’s physical or chemical properties can be related to certain electrical circuit elements, and extract numeric values for the physical and chemical phenomena. In the present study the IS technique was used in order to investigate the Au, Pt and Rh (deposited on YSZ) electrode-catalysts behavior during the potential application on metal/YSZ interface under low temperatures (320 o- 500 oC) and oxidizing and reducing conditions. The above mentioned systems spectra were simulated with Gerischer impedance form, showing that by varying the UWR potential catalyst, the metal/gas phase double layer capacitance is also varying. The measured high capacitance values (order of 100 and 1000 μF/cm 2 of solid electrolyte) under positive polarizations reveal the formation of the effective double layer which is extended over the entire gas-exposed electrode surface in accordance with the theory of the electrochemical promotion effect. The capacitance magnitude order as well as the IS spectra simulations accuracy have been verified by equivalent cyclic voltammograms and current-overpotential measurements on steady state conditions. Furthermore, it has been found that the IS technique can be an alternative method to estimate the three phase boundary length, once the gas exposed electrode surface area is known. ...|$|E

The analysis of cylinder pressure is a relatively computationally expensive task {{that is difficult to}} implement in existing engine controllers due to the real time demands. This paper describes an approach to obtain such a high speed heat release analysis. The de-scribed system could act as a platform for further feedback control experiments. An experi-mental setup is put together. The heat release algorithm is then developed using MATLAB and SIMULINK. The emerging environment will serve as a prototyping system {{that can be used for}} further development of advanced cylinder pressure based feedback control strategies. The per-formance of the developed algorithm/system is examined in a simulated engine environment. The heart of the system is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), an FPGA is best de-scribed as an reconfigurable Application Specific Integrated <b>Circuit</b> (ASIC). The <b>usage</b> of an FPGA gives the possibility of very high throughput and very low delay time and jitter of th...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{intentional}} {{degradation of the}} US-American Navstar-GPS signal has been switched off in the year 2000 {{and thanks to the}} progress in the integration of digital and analog <b>circuits</b> the <b>usage</b> of satellite navigation receivers has been increased significantly. Beside the "Navstar GPS" system, which is supported by most commercially receivers available today, further satellite navigation systems already exist or are under current development. The Russian system "GLONASS" is fully operable again since 2009 and the European "Galileo" as well as the Chinese "Compass" systems are in the deployment phase. A full constellation, consisting of these four "Global Navigation Satellite Systems" (GNSSs), will significantly increase accuracy, availability, and integrity for future GNSS users. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the conception and design of energy- and area-efficient digital GNSS receivers. A new methodology is developed for a structured analysis of GNSS receiver architectures and receiver parameters, which identifies efficient receiver solutions for a given application. The presented approach comprises optimizations on all levels of CMOS design, starting from algorithmic system level and ending with the physical-implementation level. For the correlator a flexible model is introduced, which enables a comparison of different implementations as well as an analysis of possible trade-offs between silicon area and power dissipation (costs) in a very early design phase. The impact of the correlator-channel parameters on the signal-to-noise-ratio (benefit) are determined by a theoretical analysis and are validated by simulations as well as by measurements. Since the central processing unit has to provide an increased computational performance to process all available GNSSs in parallel, an "Application Specific Instruction Set Processor" (ASIP) optimized for GNSS receiver algorithms is proposed. The exploration of the design space in order to increase the ASIP’s efficiency by using an optimized instruction set as well as tightly coupled application-specific co-processors is described. Finally, "Single Instruction Multiple Data" (SIMD) ASIP architecture, which provides sufficient performance to realize a "Software Defined Radio" (SDR) GNSS receiver, is introduced. It allows for a significantly increased flexibility, as the whole digital receiver processing, including the correlation, can be defined in software...|$|R
