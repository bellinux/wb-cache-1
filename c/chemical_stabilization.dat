40|$|Oil Sands Mature Fine Tailings (MFT) are {{generated}} from extraction of bitumen from oil sands. Fine tailings contain significant fraction of clay minerals, which makes dewatering and consolidation difficult and time-consuming. In this thesis, <b>chemical</b> <b>stabilization</b> of MFT is investigated in an experimental program. Portland cement (PC) and two liquid-based silicate grouts (NS and AAAS) {{are used for}} stabilization of MFT. The effectiveness of these stabilizers at different dosages and curing durations is assessed by conducting a series of laboratory tests {{in terms of the}} undrained shear strength (Su) and solid content (S%), plasticity and pore fluid chemistry. The gel time and gel syneresis of silicate grouts are studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses are conducted to understand the microstructural changes in MFT after <b>chemical</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The results indicate that the inclusion of Portland cement or silicate grouts increases the solid contents and Atterberg limits of MFT. The undrained shear strength of MFT after chemical treatment increases up to 7. 65 kPa with 10 % PC, 15. 5 kPa with 15 % PC, 7. 55 kPa with 15 % NS and 5. 5 kPa with 8 % AAAS after 28 days of curing period. The pH of MFT paste increases after chemical treatments. Furthermore, SEM analyses indicate that after chemical treatment by Portland cement, fibrous cement hydrates (CS- H gel) formed during stabilization process bind the MFT particles together, while after the treatment of silicate grouts, gelling products with undulating and irregular shapes serve as cementation agent.

Manganese oxides are naturally present in soils and they exhibit a number of properties for being efficient sorbents of toxic metal(loid) s, such as a low point of zero charge, a large specific surface and a structure that allows ion acceptance. The focus of this thesis is to determine efficiency of <b>chemical</b> <b>stabilization</b> of a smelter-contaminated soil using the amorphous manganese oxide (AMO) under various pH conditions.

We evaluated both compounds for their acute and chronic toxicity via tarsal toxicity assays and oviposition inhibitory effects. Since isofuranodiene is a thermosensitive molecule undergoing Cope rearrangement giving the less active isomer curzerene, we achieved its <b>chemical</b> <b>stabilization</b> by interaction with a silver(I) ion (Ag triflate, AgCF 3 SO 3), and the isofuranodiene adduct was tested for acaricidal activity and oviposition inhibitory potential. Results showed that isofuranodiene achieved the lowest LD 50 values, both in acute (15. 8 µg cm− 2) and chronic toxicity assays (11. 9 µg cm− 3).

40|$|Objective: Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a major {{inorganic}} bactericidal {{compound of}} innate immunity, is effective against {{a broad range}} of microorganisms. Owing to its chemical nature, HOCl has never been used as a pharmaceutical drug for treating infection. In this article, we describe the <b>chemical</b> production, <b>stabilization,</b> and biological activity of a pharmaceutically useful formulation of HOCl. Methods: Stabilized HOCl {{is in the form of}} a physiologically balanced solution in 0. 9 % saline at a pH range of 3. 5 to 4. 0. Chlorine species distribution in solution is a function of pH. In aqueous solution, HOCl is the predominant species at the pH range of 3 to 6. At pH values less than 3. 5, the solution exists as a mixture of chlorine in aqueous phase, chlorine gas, trichloride (Cl − 3), and HOCl. At pH greater than 5. 5, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) starts to form and becomes the predominant species in the alkaline pH. To maintain HOCl solution in a stable form, maximize its antimicrobial activities, and minimize undesirable side products, the pH must be maintained at 3. 5 to 5.
