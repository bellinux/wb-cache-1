Empirical formulae were calculated for each waste {{based on the results}} of chemical analysis and these formulae were used to estimate the <b>COD</b> <b>equivalent</b> and stoichiometric methane potential (SMP). The actual COD and biochemical methane potential (BMP) were determined experimentally for each waste and for both parameters there was a good agreement between the empirical and experimental values. The potential of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to act as an indicator of biomass yield (mg VSS mg 1 COD removed) was determined during the anaerobic digestion process. The biomass yield determined from ATP analysis was in the range 0. 01 – 0. 25 mg VSS mg 1 COD removed which corroborated well with previously reported studies. Empirical formula based SMP together with ATP measurement were shown to provide rapid methods to replace or augment the traditional BMP and VSS measurements and are useful for evaluating the bioenergy and biomass potential of solid wastes for anaerobic digestion...|$|E

Supernatants were used for soluble product analysis by transferring to new microcentrifuge tubes. The pellets were re-suspended with 0.9  % (w/v) NaCl and centrifuged at the same aforementioned conditions. Supernatants were discarded, and 1  ml of 0.2  M NaOH was added to microcentrifuge tubes and vortexed to re-suspend the pellet. Microcentrifuge tubes were placed in a water bath at 100  °C for 10  min. After cooling, tubes were centrifuged and supernatants were collected for Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard, measured by a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Cary 50 Bio, Varian, Australia) at 595  nm. The cellulose pellet was quantified gravimetrically after being dried overnight at 100  °C (Liu et al. 2008). pH was measured using a B 10 P SympHony pH meter (VWR®). Ethanol, glucose, cellobiose, and lactic, formic, acetic, and butyric acids, were measured as follows: supernatants for metabolites analysis were filtered through 0.2  µm and measured using an HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) consisting of a Dionex GP 50 Gradient pump and a Dionex LC 25 Chromatography oven equipped with an Aminex HPX- 87 H column (Bio-Rad) at 30  °C and 9  mM H 2 SO 4 at 0.6  ml min− 1 as mobile phase, connected to a Perkin Elmer 200 series refractive index detector (RID). Standard curves of metabolites, glucose and cellobiose were performed on ATCC 1191 medium. Cellular protein content was then converted to dry weight using the correlation dry weight (g l− 1) =  0.0051  × protein (µg ml− 1) (Gomez-Flores et al. 2015). For the estimation of the <b>COD</b> <b>equivalents</b> for the biomass dry weight, the empirical formula of the organic fraction of the biomass of C 5 H 7 O 2 N (Metcalf and Eddy 2003), and an organic fraction of 90  % of the cell dry weight (Pavlostathis et al. 1988), were assumed.|$|R

40|$|Performance of a {{hydrolysis}} reactor {{in which}} the solids and liquid retention times were uncoupled to give enhanced solids retention and removal of hydrolysis products was evaluated for a feedstock of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW). The reactor was operated both alone {{and as part of}} a two-stage process in series with an anaerobic filter. Operating with a hydraulic flush to give hydraulic retention times (HRT) between 1. 6 and 5. 3 days, and a solids retention time (SRT) of 20 days increased hydrolysis in comparison with a control reactor where HRT and SRT were equal. Overall biodegradability was low; however, with an effluent chemical oxygen demand (<b>COD)</b> <b>equivalent</b> to 30 % of the substrate biochemical methane potential (BMP). When operated as part of a two-stage process using effluent from the anaerobic filter as the flush liquor the characteristics of the system changed substantially with an increase in performance to an overall methane production of 0. 22 – 0. 24 L g? 1 volatile solids (VS) added. This was achieved even when the maximum loading of 7. 5 gVS L? 1 day? 1 was applied. During acclimatization the first-stage hydrolytic reactor became methanogenic despite the short HRT, and was responsible for as much as 70 % of the overall methane production. The system could not revert to single-stage operation after acclimatization, showing the continuing importance of the anaerobic filter. The combined system was robust, and could recover from major disturbances and step increases in loading without reduction in continuous methane production, indicating some potential for larger scale application in BMW disposa...|$|E
40|$|Mixed-culture {{fermentation}} {{that does}} not require an energy-intensive sterilization process is a viable approach for the economically feasible production of lactic acid (LA) due to the potential use of organic waste as feedstock. This study investigated mixed-culture LA fermentation of whey, a high-strength organic wastewater, in continuous mode. Variations in the hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 120 to 8 h under different pH regimes in two thermophilic reactors (55 A degrees C) were compared for their fermentation performance. One reactor was maintained at a low pH (pH 3. 0) during operation at HRTs of 120 to 24 h and then adjusted to pH 5. 5 in the later phases of fermentation at HRTs of 24 to 8 h (R 1), while the second reactor was maintained at pH 5. 5 throughout the experiment (R 2). Although the LA production in R 1 was negligible at low pH, it increased dramatically after the pH was raised to 5. 5 and exceeded that in R 2 when stabilized at HRTs of 8 and 12 h. The maximum yield (0. 62 g LA/g substrate fed as the chemical oxygen demand (<b>COD)</b> <b>equivalent),</b> the production rate (11. 5 g/L day), and the selectivity (95 %) of LA were all determined at a 12 -h HRT in R 1. Additionally, molecular and statistical analyses revealed that changes in the HRT and the pH significantly affected the bacterial community structure and thus the fermentation characteristics of the experimental reactors. Bacillus coagulans was likely the predominant LA producer in both reactors. The overall results suggest that low pH start-up has {{a positive effect on}} yield and selectivity in mixed-culture LA fermentationclose 0...|$|E

Unlike speech coders {{such as those}} based on Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP), the iLBC {{achieves}} superior robustness to packet loss by avoiding inter-frame coding dependencies. While robustness to packet loss is essential, a VoIP codec should also possess the flexibility to change its source coding rate in order to counter network congestion and facilitate joint source channel coding for wireless channels. Previously, we presented a new variation of the iLBC encoding procedure which yielded a more efficient, rate-flexible result.

40|$|A novel process {{consisted}} of an anaerobic bioscrubber was {{studied at the}} field scale {{for the removal of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from a printing press facility. The pilot unit worked under high fluctuating waste gas emissions containing ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 1 -ethoxy- 2 -propanol as main pollutants, with airflows ranging between 184 and 1253 m 3 h− 1 and an average concentration of 1126 ± 470 mg-C Nm− 3. Three scrubber configurations (cross-flow and vertical-flow packings and spray tower) were tested, and cross-flow packing was found to be the best one. For this packing, daily average values of VOC removal efficiency ranged between 83 % and 93 % for liquid to air volume ratios between 3. 5 · 10 − 3 and 9. 1 · 10 − 3. Biomass growth was prevented by periodical chemical cleaning; the average pressure drop was 165 Pa m− 1. Rapid initiation of anaerobic degradation was achieved by using granular sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant. Despite the intermittent and fluctuating organic load, the expanded granular sludge bed reactor showed an excellent level of performance, reaching removal efficiencies of 93 ± 5 % at 25. 1 ± 3. 2 °C, with biogas methane content of 94 ± 3 % in volume. Volatile fatty acid concentration was as low as 200 mg acetic acid L− 1 by treating daily average organic loads up to 3. 0 kg <b>COD</b> h− 1, <b>equivalent</b> to 24 kg COD m− 3 bed d− 1. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results revealed the initial shift of the domains Archaea and Bacteria associated with the limitation of the carbon source to a few organic solvents. The Archaea domain was more sensitive, resulting in a drop of the Shannon index from 1. 07 to 0. 41 in the first 123 days. Among Archaea, the predominance of Methanosaeta persisted throughout the experimental period. The increase in the proportion of Methanospirillum and Methanobacterium sp. was linked to the spontaneous variations of operating temperature and load, respectively.

40|$|Cet article présente les résultats d'une étude menée sur le {{traitement}} d'effluents fortement chargés (DCO > 1, 5 kg. m- 3) par un procédé à boues activées. L'objectif principal de ce travail est de montrer qu'une alimentation séquentielle d'un réacteur parfaitement agité avec maintien permanent du recyclage des boues et de l'oxygénation permet d'obtenir une bonne épuration tant du point de vue de l'élimination de la pollution carbonée que de la maîtrise de la décantabilité des flocs microbiens. Les essais sont menés sur un pilote de laboratoire constitué d'une colonne à bulles et d'un décanteur, alimenté avec un substrat synthétique. Contrairement à une alimentation continue, {{la mise en place}} de cycles d'alimentation permet d'obtenir des flocs de bonne décantabilité de manière constante dans le temps. Ainsi une concentration élevée en biomasse peut être maintenue dans le réacteur. De plus, le suivi d'un cycle 1 h/ 1 h confirme que la mise en œuvre d'un cycle court n'entraîne pas de variations importantes des performances d'épuration. Par ailleurs, le suivi d'un long cycle (24 h/ 24 h) montre des variations significatives des concentrations en DCO, polysaccharides dans la phase liquide et exopolysaccharides dans les flocs microbiens. Ceci semble indiquer que des produits microbiens sont relargués des flocs vers la phase liquide pendant l'arrêt de l'alimentation et que des exopolysaccharides sont produits dans les flocs pendant l'alimentation. The {{overall efficiency}} of an activated sludge {{wastewater treatment system}} depends both on the ability of the activated sludge culture to remove the soluble organic pollution and on the efficiency of the separation of the treated water from the biomass. In the treatment of a high-strength wastewater (COD > 1. 5 kg. m- 3), ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems can sometimes substitute for the final clarifier, the separation of the sludge from the effluent water being very good regardless of changes in sludge settleability. Because of the high pollutant concentrations, the biomass must be more concentrated in the bioreactor than in the usual aerobic processes (10 to 20 kg. m- 3 rather than 4 kg. m- 3), whatever the separation system (settler or filtration system). Thus, with this biomass concentration, the volumetric loading rate can be increased while the organic loading rate is maintained at a low level. The use of a clarifier is preferable because it is cheaper than ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems, which have very high investment and operation costs, on the other hand, and some fouling problems, on the other hand. However, its use requires a very good biomass settleability. Results from the literature show that there is no general relation between sludge settleability and such wastewater treatment operating parameters as dissolved oxygen concentration in the aeration basin, organic loading rates, pH, or low relative influent nitrogen and phosphorus contents. On the other hand, the separation ability of the clarifier depends on the hydraulic configuration of the aerated reactor: biomass settleability can be controlled by completely stirred reactors in series, plug-flow reactors or intermittently-fed systems. Indeed, this spatial or temporal staggering should allow microorganisms to consume their accumulated substrate and thus restore their accumulation capacity. In the case of high-strength wastewater treatment, temporal staggering is better than spatial staggering. Indeed, higher organic loading rates require a higher number of reactors. Thus, the COD concentration significantly increases in the first reactors of the cascade and some toxic or inhibitory problems could appear. For this reason, a temporal staggering was chosen. Biomass settleability is linked to the extracellular polymers that are the third component of the sludge flocs, after the cells and the water. These polymers are composed largely of microbial exopolysaccharides. Measurements of exopolysaccharides could be used to characterize sludge settleability. A too low level of exopolysaccharides indicates a sludge defloculation problem, whereas a too high level of exopolysaccharides means that sludge settleability could be hindered because of an excessive growth of filamentous organisms. The purpose of the present work is to show that the use of only one completely stirred reactor, fed in a cyclic way with permanent oxygenation and return sludge flow, leads to good sludge settleability and effluent quality. The experiments have been performed with a laboratory pilot-plant composed of a 11. 3 litre bubble column, which is a completely stirred reactor, and a secondary settling tank of 14. 8 litres. The reactor is fed with an equilibrated synthetic substrate consisting mainly of meat extract, saccharose and ethanol (COD:N:P= 100 : 5 : 1 and 1 kg COD= 1 kg meat extract + 0. 444 kg saccharose + 0. 2 kg ethanol). The feeding cycle is a set of consecutive periods of feeding and starvation. For example, during a 1 h/ 2 h feeding cycle, the substrate feeding is continuous during 1 hour and stopped during 2 hours. The sludge comes from the Nancy-Maxéville wastewater treatment plant and its acclimation to the synthetic substrate begins with an aeration without feeding during 12 hours. Afterwards, the experimental system is fed during 1 hour every 2 hours with the substrate (first concentration of COD= 0. 1 kg. m- 3). Then, the inlet COD is increased by steps of 0. 1 kg. m- 3 every day until the required concentration is reached. Once the biomass is acclimated to the influent and sufficiently concentrated, the experiment can begin. In order to show the positive influence of cyclic feeding on wastewater treatment quality, we have carried out one experiment with continuous feeding and two experiments with cyclic feeding (see Table 1). For these experiments, the volumetric loading rate is about 4 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1. With an appropriate feeding cycle, the settleability of the sludge and the effluent quality remain good: the diluted sludge volume index is 56 cm 3. g- 1 and 96 % of the inlet COD is removed. Thus, the biomass concentration remains high in the reactor (19 kg. m- 3). This is not the case with a continuous feeding where the biomass settleability rapidly deteriorates. The principal advantage of sequential feeding is the maintenance of good sludge settleability and a high biomass concentration in the aeration basin. Moreover, during the short feeding cycles, the variations of the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides in the bulk phase and extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are very low. This augurs well for system stability. In contrast, monitoring of a long cycle (24 h of feeding and 24 h of starvation) shows great variations in the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides in the system. When the feeding is stopped, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase increase whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration in sludge flocs decreases. Reciprocally, after the feeding is begun, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase decrease, and then remain constant, whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration increases. As 1 kg of measured polysaccharides represents 0. 9 kg COD, and as in the bulk phase the <b>COD</b> concentration is <b>equivalent</b> to 4 times the polysaccharide concentration, it seems that microbial products other than polysaccharides are released in the bulk phase during starvation, these products being slowly biodegradable. Extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are formed during the feeding phase...|$|R
