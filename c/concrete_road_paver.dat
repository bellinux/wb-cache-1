50|$|In general, {{roads in}} India are {{primarily}} bitumen-based macadamised roads. However, {{a few of}} the National Highways have <b>concrete</b> <b>roads</b> too. In some locations, such as in Kanpur, British-built <b>concrete</b> <b>roads</b> are still in use. <b>Concrete</b> <b>roads</b> were less popular prior to the 1990s because of low availability of cement then. However, with large supplies of cement in the country and the virtues of <b>concrete</b> <b>roads,</b> they are gaining popularity. <b>Concrete</b> <b>roads</b> are durable, weather-proof and require lower maintenance compared to bituminous <b>roads.</b> Moreover, new <b>concrete</b> pavement technology has developed such as cool pavement, quiet pavement and permeable pavement, which has rendered it more attractive and eco-friendly.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To assess dermal {{exposure}} to bitumen condensate among <b>road</b> <b>pavers</b> and indoor mastic workers in multiple crews using a semi-quantitative observational method [DeRmal Exposure Assessment Method (DREAM) ]. Methods: Two skilled observers assessed {{dermal exposure}} to bitumen condensate among 85 asphalt workers from 12 crews from nine companies active within four European countries using the DREAM methodology, which produces {{an estimate of}} exposure expressed in dimensionless DREAM units. Both observers independently evaluated each crew member's job (N = 14 jobs) for road paving and mastic applications. Potential and actual dermal exposures were estimated for hands {{and for the rest}} of the body separately, taking into account the effect of protective clothing. To evaluate the reproducibility of the observational method intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. The exposures in DREAM units were modelled using linear mixed models to estimate average relative scores for each job. Correlations between dermal exposure parameters were evaluated by estimating Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: A total of 170 observations were completed by two observers independently (n = 118 and n = 52 for 59 <b>road</b> <b>pavers</b> and 26 mastic workers, respectively) in 11 days. The mean ICCs (for potential and actual exposure in DREAM units) varied between 0. 74 and 0. 80 with values for actual units being slightly higher. Geometric mean potential dermal exposure units of mastic workers were higher than for <b>road</b> <b>pavers</b> (factor 3 for hands and factor 4 for rest of the body). Differences for actual dermal exposure units were smaller for hands (factor 2) and larger for actual exposure units of rest of the body (factor 5). Differences in dermal exposure at the hands between jobs within a paving crew were much larger than between jobs within a mastic crew. Within paving crews, a consistent pattern for all exposure units emerged with 'screed man' and 'raker' as the two highest exposed jobs. Within mastic crews, 'driver dumper truck' and 'spreader of mastic' were scored as the two jobs with the highest exposure units. Potential and actual exposure units were highly correlated. Hands were more profoundly exposed than the rest of the body, with transfer from contaminated surface to the hands as the most important route. Conclusions: DREAM observations were reproducible and showed a consistent dermal exposure pattern among the observed crews. The study provided a clear picture of dermal exposure among <b>road</b> <b>pavers</b> and indoor mastic workers, with the mastic workers being considerably more highly exposed. The most important route of exposure appeared to be transferred from contaminated surfaces to the hands. © The Author 2011...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Flexural {{strength}} {{is a measure}} of the tensile strength of an unreinforced concrete beam or slab to resist failure in bending. It is useful in knowing the quality of concrete work done in road construction. Because of low initial cost, flexible roads are preferred, to <b>concrete</b> <b>road</b> pavement, but bituminous roads gets deteriorated during rainy season and maintenance becomes costly, therefore Government agencies have decided to go for <b>concrete</b> <b>roads.</b> Generally limestone as coarse aggregates for <b>concrete</b> <b>roads</b> are preferred but sometimes may not be easily available at all places nearby, therefore its replacement is necessary. Impact test, abrasion test & water absorption test were performed on demolished building waste concrete also, to recommend its suitability in making <b>concrete</b> <b>roads</b> as per Indian Standards Importantly boiling water curing has been done on some samples before flexural strength test for determining early strength of concrete, for predicting later age strength of <b>concrete</b> in <b>roads.</b> Behavior of flexural strength of <b>concrete</b> <b>roads</b> with lime stone, locally available is studied in this paper for concrete pavements. Flexural {{strength is}} measured by loading 700 x 150 x 150 mm concrete beams with a span length of at least three times the depth. The flexural strength is expressed as Modulus of Rupture (MR) in psi (MPa) and is determined by standard test methods ASTM C 78 (third-point loading). Flexural MR is about 10 to 20 percent of compressive strength depending on the type, size and volume of coarse aggregate used. However, the best correlation for specific materials is obtained by laboratory tests for given materials and mix design...|$|R
