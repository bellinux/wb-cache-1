Shortly afterwards a stroke paralysed his right hand and caused a speech impediment. He applied for a junior <b>clerical</b> <b>post</b> with WAAC and was refused.

In the course of her ILP {{activities}} she had met and befriended John [...] "Jack" [...] Braddock, a wagon builder and union activist with a reputation as a firebrand. He had arrived in Liverpool from Dewsbury in 1915, hoping to emigrate to Canada, but had stayed in the port and immersed himself in left-wing politics and the fight to improve working conditions. He and Bessie became very close; in 1919 they helped Mary Bamber to fight for a Liverpool council seat, as the ILP's candidate in the Everton district. The election campaign was bitter and at times violent, but resulted in Bamber's victory by the slim margin of 13 votes.|$|E

50|$|Pope Nicholas II, {{elected in}} 1058, {{initiated}} {{a process of}} reform which exposed the underlying tension between empire and papacy. In 1059, at a synod in Rome, Nicholas condemned various abuses within the church, and issued In nomine Domini. These included simony (the selling of <b>clerical</b> <b>posts),</b> the marriage of clergy and, more controversially, corrupt practices in papal elections. Nicholas then restricted {{the choice of a}} new pope to a conclave of cardinals, thus ruling out any direct influence by secular powers. The primary objective of these actions was to restrict the influence of the Holy Roman Emperor on papal elections.

Bloxam worked with Babington on the flowering plants of Charnwood Forest. He supplied Hewett C.

40|$|Merit was {{strongly}} {{emphasized in the}} Privileges of the Clergy (in 1723) and legislative reforms, {{as well as in}} the formalization of election practices in connection with clerical appointments in the Kingdom of Sweden in the early 18 th century. According to existing research, this resulted in a deepening difference between the standpoints of the laity and the ecclesiastical authorities. However, in studying the appointments of clergy in the Lutheran parishes in Russia’s western border area in the mid- and late 18 th century, this article argues that the boundary between the opinions of the diocesan board (in this case the Consistory of Fredrikshamn) and those of the parishioners with regard to the candidates’ suitability for vacant <b>clerical</b> <b>posts</b> may have been more fuzzy. The focus is on the consistory’s proposals for investiture. The investitures were structured according to normative rules of procedure, but the wording in the descriptions of the candidates in the consistory’s proposals strongly emphasized the importance not only of merit but also of other factors, such as the parishioners’ opinion and the different parties’ familiarity with the candidates...|$|R

Walter of Guisborough, the chronicler, felt that the king's treatment of the archbishop so scared the archbishop that Thomas fell sick and died as a result.

50|$|The play {{explores the}} lives of the lower middle class who filled up the <b>{{clerical}}</b> <b>posts</b> of the office world in Edwardian England. The Wilsons are a young couple who live in the suburbs of London. Charley is a clerk in the City, while Lily is a homemaker. In order to make ends meet, they take in lodgers. Fred Tenant, their present lodger, has decided to abandon his clerical career and emigrate to Australia with what meagre savings he has in order to seek a new life. Charley, who finds life in England narrow and constraining, also wishes to leave. His desire is given added impetus as his company, going through difficult times, has reduced his wages. Practically everyone ridicules Fred Tenant for throwing up a 'good situation', and Charley finds himself alone in his desire to emigrate. His wife, his in-laws, his friends all oppose his wish; only his feisty sister-in-law Maggie can see what grinds him down and supports him. In the end, Fred leaves but Charley fails to do the same as his wife Lily has fallen pregnant. Charley abandons thoughts of Australia, accepts his fate with great bitterness and returns to his clerical job.|$|R
5000|$|Migration of Hindu {{community}} to Afghanistan was {{mainly from the}} neighbouring kingdom of Punjab, later a province of British India. By the nineteenth century a large Hindu community, comprising ethnic groups such as Lohanis and Shikarpuri Khatris, was widespread throughout the region and tribes and concerned primarily with commerce. A city peopled by Khatri Hindus, Shikarpur, {{was established in the}} 1800s and rose to be one of Afghanistan's main centres of commerce - primarily a money market and banking centre, which had outlying partnerships with places as widely apart as [...] "Bombay, Punjab, Sindh, Khorasan, parts of Persia and Russia". They eventually developed control of the banking throughout Central Asia ranging from [...] "Astrakhan to Meshid to Calcutta" [...] (vide Alexander Burnes).

50|$|Around {{the middle}} of the fifteenth century the patriarch Shemon IV Basidi made the patriarchal {{succession}} hereditary, normally from uncle to nephew. This practice, which tended to result in a shortage of eligible heirs, eventually led to a schism in the Church of the East. The patriarch Shemʿon VII Ishoʿyahb (1539-58) caused great offence {{at the beginning of his}} reign by designating his twelve-year-old nephew Hnanishoʿ as his successor, presumably because no older relatives were available. Several years later, probably because Hnanishoʿ had died in the interim, he designated as successor his fifteen-year-old brother Eliya, the future patriarch Eliya VII (1558-91). Besides making these two provocative appointments, he was also accused by his opponents of permitting concubinage, selling <b>clerical</b> <b>posts</b> and living intemperately. By 1552 Shemʿon VII Ishoʿyahb had become so unpopular that his opponents rebelled against his authority. The rebels, principally from the Amid, Seert and Salmas districts, elected as patriarch a monk named Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa, the leader of Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh. Unfortunately, no bishop of metropolitan rank was available to consecrate him, as canonically required. Franciscan missionaries were already at work among the Nestorians as well, and they legitimised their position by persuading Sulaqa’s supporters and getting him consecrated by Pope Julius III (1550-5).|$|R
