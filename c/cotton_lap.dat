50|$|Sir Richard Arkwright (22 December 1732 - 3 August 1792) was an English {{inventor}} and {{a leading}} entrepreneur during the early Industrial Revolution. Although his patents were eventually overturned, he is credited with inventing the spinning frame, which following the transition to water power was renamed the water frame. He also patented a rotary carding engine that transformed raw cotton into <b>cotton</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} roller-printing machine {{consists of a}} strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in {{the sides of the}} rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the engraved copper roller rests in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a cogwheel is fixed to gear with the driving wheel of the machine, and at the other end a smaller cogwheel to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron pressure cylinder is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and <b>cotton</b> <b>lapping,</b> the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.|$|R
50|$|The pitched {{battle at}} the front saw Roberts lead the 15th <b>lap,</b> <b>Cotton</b> Owens lead on lap 16, Junior Johnson on lap 17 and Roberts again on lap 18. The {{blistering}} pace allowed the front runners to lap nearly the entire field. But Yunick's flat-out strategy caused Roberts {{to run out of}} gas twice in the early going. During pit stops, Roberts pulled down his window by hand, just like a passenger car driver, to accept a drink.|$|R
