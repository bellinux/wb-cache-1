40|$|We {{investigated}} the gradual emergence of visual and conceptual perspective-taking {{between three and}} four-year-old children. We hypothesized {{that the ability to}} perform non-egocentrically on visual perspective-taking would emerge before the ability to perform non-egocentrically on conceptual perspective-taking. Furthermore, we believed that four-year-olds would respond less egocentrically on both tasks in comparison to three-year-olds. We created a visual perspective-taking task, which consisted of identifying the viewpoints of a stuffed bear from a colorful box with distinct sides, and a conceptual perspective-taking task, which consisted of choosing an item for their mothers between a <b>child</b> <b>item</b> and an adult item. We found no support for our hypothesis regarding differences in performance across both tasks between three and four-year-olds. However, according to a binomial test of significance, we found that visual perspective-taking does emerge before conceptual perspective-taking. Thus, it is conceivable that conceptual perspective-taking requires a higher level of cognitive understanding and reasoning than visual perspective-taking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{tested the}} {{properties}} of the 18 Household Food Security Survey (HFSS) items, and the validity of the resulting food security classifications, in an English-speaking middle-income country. Methods Survey of primary school children in Trinidad and Tobago. Parents completed the HFSS. Responses were analysed for the 10 adult-referenced items and the eight child-referenced items. Item response theory models were fitted. Item calibrations and subject scores from a one-parameter logistic (1 PL) model were compared with those from either two-parameter logistic model (2 PL) or a model for differential item functioning (DIF) by ethnicity. Results There were 5219 eligible with 3858 (74 %) completing at least one food security item. Adult item calibrations (standard error) in the 1 PL model ranged from - 4. 082 (0. 019) for the 'worried food would run out' item to 3. 023 (0. 042) for 'adults often do not eat for a whole day'. <b>Child</b> <b>item</b> calibrations ranged from - 3. 715 (0. 025) for 'relied on a few kinds of low cost food' to 3. 088 (0. 039) for 'child didn't eat for a whole day'. Fitting either a 2 PL model, which allowed discrimination parameters to vary between items, or a differential item functioning model, which allowed item calibrations to vary between ethnic groups, had little influence on interpretation. The classification based on the adult-referenced items showed that there were 19 % of respondents who were food insecure without hunger, 10 % food insecure with moderate hunger and 6 % food insecure with severe hunger. The classification based on the child-referenced items showed that there were 23 % of children who were food insecure without hunger and 9 % food insecure with hunger. In both children and adults food insecurity showed a strong, graded association with lower monthly household income (P Conclusion These results support the use of 18 HFSS items to classify food security status of adults or children in an English-speaking country where food insecurity and hunger are more frequent overall than in the US. </p...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that restaurant-based interventions {{have the potential}} to promote healthier purchasing and improve the nutrients consumed. This study adds to this body of research by reporting the results of a trial focused on promoting the sale of healthy <b>child</b> menu <b>items</b> in independently owned restaurants. Eight pair-matched restaurants that met the eligibility criteria were randomized to a menu-only versus a menu-plus intervention condition. Both of the conditions implemented new healthy <b>child</b> menu <b>items</b> and received support for implementation for eight weeks. The menu-plus condition also conducted a marketing campaign involving employee trainings and promotional materials. Process evaluation data captured intervention implementation. Sales of new and existing <b>child</b> menu <b>items</b> were tracked for 16 weeks. Results indicated that the interventions were implemented with moderate to high fidelity depending on the component. Sales of new healthy <b>child</b> menu <b>items</b> occurred immediately, but decreased during the post-intervention period in both conditions. Sales of existing <b>child</b> menu <b>items</b> demonstrated a time by condition effect with restaurants in the menu-plus condition observing significant decreases and menu-only restaurants observing significant increases in sales of existing <b>child</b> menu <b>items.</b> Additional efforts are needed to inform sustainable methods for improving access to healthy foods and beverages in restaurants...|$|R
