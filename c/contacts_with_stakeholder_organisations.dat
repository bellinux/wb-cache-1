40|$|Recently {{numerous}} references {{have been}} made to corporate social responsibility, corporate or brand citizenship, stakeholder engagement, partnerships, sustainable development and effective corporate governance. One of the fundamental issues in corporate citizenship is the ability of an organisation to cope <b>with</b> its various <b>stakeholders</b> and enter into partnerships <b>with</b> these <b>stakeholders</b> for improved business ventures. The question, however, remains how can organisations take a structured approach to engage and consult <b>with</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> <b>Organisations</b> need to know who their stakeholders are, and should be accountable to these stakeholders. Stakeholder accountability requires that organisations must ensure that governance systems foster an understanding of business relationships which will allow balanced business judgments to be made. Stakeholder "voices" need to be heard at the highest level of organisational governance. This article attempts to define and describe the concept of stakeholders, illustrates how partnerships can be built between <b>stakeholders</b> and <b>organisations,</b> and provides a South African perspective on public/private partnerships in a rapidly changing business landscape.

40|$|Global {{energy demand}} and scarce {{petroleum}} resources require communities {{to adapt to}} a rapidly changing Arctic environment, but as well to a transforming socio-economic environment instigated by oil and gas development. This is illustrated by liquefied natural gas production by Statoil at Hammerfest, which opened up the Barents Sea for oil and gas drilling. Although environmental organisations, Sámi indigenous people, fisheries and local inhabitants of Hammerfest try to strive for environmental and community development in relation to liquefied natural gas production by engaging in negotiations with Statoil and the Norwegian government, they are overshadowed by economic growth, implemented by a strong coalition between Statoil and the Norwegian State. Sustainable development of liquefied natural gas production is therefore constrained by centralized decision-making by the institutional coalition. Statoil’s concessions on environmental and community development were rather based on cost-efficient and short-term means. This is strengthened by the fact that <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>stakeholders</b> faded away once the social license to operate was achieved.

40|$|The ambitious 16 + GW {{new nuclear}} {{programme}} in Britain marks a distinctive low-carbon energy pathway. The proposed new build projects are megainvestments instituting novel ways of governance and public engagement with striking contrasts to previous constructions. To probe {{into this new}} era of nuclear megainvestments, the thesis focuses on the proposed £ 14 bn Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey, on the northwest fringe of Wales. In the intersection of sociotechnical transitions, human geography, and science and technology studies (STS) literatures, the case study addresses the geographies of energy transitions, the politics of governing low-carbon investments, and the changing participation in large-scale infrastructural projects. The multi-scalar ethnographic study included both living in local communities and engaging <b>with</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>organisations,</b> from local councils to Whitehall ministries and multinational investors, through interviewing, document analysis, and meeting participations. Based on the findings, the thesis claims that the new nuclear project is better characterised as a megainvestment assembled together from diverse issues across multiple scales, from Welsh language protection to supply chain development, than as a technological object, an energy-generating source, or a financial megaproject. The megainvestment is transformative well beyond Anglesey with distinct practices and visions tied to the investment across various geographic scales. The governance of Wylfa Newydd is blurring the boundaries {{between public and private}} organisations with a shift towards collaborative platforms and coproduction of specialist knowledge. The public consultations displace the political controversies to legal wrangles and disputes on (geographic) boundaries by fragmenting affected publics and customising issues. In summary, this transformative project marks a new era of doing megainvestments on multiple geographic scales, with shifts in particular towards collaborative evidence-based governance and customised public consultations...|$|R
40|$|Invasions by {{invasive}} non-native species (INNS) {{can have}} profound consequences for natural environments, impacting on biodiversity and the biophysical landscape {{in ways that}} can endanger other species, human wellbeing and infrastructure. The financial costs of dealing with established INNS populations can be extremely high. Biosecurity measures (simple procedures designed {{to reduce the risk}} of human activities spreading INNS to new areas) are being promoted in order to minimize these negative impacts and associated costs. This paper reports on research undertaken <b>with</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>organisations</b> that operate within UK natural environments. It aims to evaluate stakeholder perceptions of their role in INNS biosecurity practice in the UK, and the implications of this for INNS strategy more broadly. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with organisation representatives to explore current practices and communications about INNS and perceptions of barriers and opportunities to implement better biosecurity. Whilst participants generally agreed on the need for biosecurity, there were variations among participants in levels of knowledge about INNS (related to background) and the capacity of organisations to engage in biosecurity practices (related to organisational size). Critical barriers to biosecurity were identified as costs, lack of clear guidance, difficulties changing attitudes and implementing collective responsibility, and reactionary versus precautionary approaches. As a result, partnership working on INNS is difficult and action tends to focus on individual species perceived as the most threatening to a particular organisations’ interests. In this way, action on INNS biosecurity faces the kinds of barriers that are common to many environmental problems where individuals/ organisations prioritise self-interest despite the potential to obtain greater benefits if collective action could be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Regular {{cannabis}} use {{is associated}} with negative mental health impacts including psychosis, depression and anxiety. Rates of cannabis use have increased in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in northern Australia within the last two decades, presenting a significant increased risk to young people's mental health in these regions. Improved screening, early detection and treatment for cannabis-related mental health issues are urgently required. This paper describes a service-level action research intervention and evaluation protocol {{for use in the}} few services where it is possible to engage young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Methods/Design: The protocol is being developed in two services where youth mental health is core business: a primary healthcare centre and a youth service in the Cairns and hinterland region, far north Queensland. The protocol calls first for baseline data to be collected using staff and client surveys; network mapping; and analysis of screening, treatment and referral rates. The protocol's intervention phase is driven by service needs identified from baseline data. Intervention strategies focus on implementing/enhancing cannabis screening instruments and processes in line with current best practice; enhancing networks with external drug and mental health services; developing culturally acceptable training and resources; developing activities aiming to reduce cannabis use in young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients using the services. The protocol requires implementation of the multilevel intervention within each service for 1  year, with follow-up data then collected and compared to baseline. Process evaluation identifies the more effective intervention strategies and documents the challenges to be overcome for full implementation.

Enterprises contribute to the progressing degradation of existing ecosystems, cause serious threats to the biological diversity of our planet, emit hazardous pollutants and use available natural resources excessively, {{which can lead to}} their premature exhaustion. There-fore, for the world’s nations to grow and develop in a sustainable manner, there is an urgent need to minimize the adverse impact of business activities, households and whole societies on the environment. Environmental degradation cannot be restrained by the neutralization of produced pollutants alone. Today, we need efficient environment-friendly technologies and production processes. Effective efforts aimed at the reduction of our ecological footprint should be undertaken by all involved entities, including designers, engineers and managers at all stages of the product design, production and distribution processes.

40|$|The World Health Organisation’s {{framework}} for innovative care of chronic diseases identifies self-management support {{as part of}} the building blocks for effective health care organisations (World Health Organisation, 2002). This project reports on initial research involving interviewing key stakeholders on attitudes to Guided Chronic Disease Self Management (GCDSM) as a step towards developing an information architecture to support guided patient self-management of chronic disease. Few chronic disease sufferers are provided with care plans and there are few means for monitoring compliance. Self-management programmes that exist tend to be focused on specific diseases with no common information architecture and few means of sharing information across carers and between clinicians, carers, patients and their families. As patients age and accumulate co-morbidities they need to interact with the various different means that information providers have to assist them. This research-in-progress aims to identify requirements for a generic architecture for chronic disease guided self-management to assist the elderly in particular in accessing often critical information in a timely and targeted way to assist self-care.

40|$|Abstract Land use changes {{induced by}} nature {{conservation}} regulation and management practices, especially in protected areas, often result in trade-offs between ecosystem services (ESs). Exploring trade-offs between ESs and linking them <b>with</b> <b>stakeholders</b> can help reveal the potential losers and winners {{of land use}} changes. In this paper, we demonstrate that ES trade-offs do not always {{go hand in hand}} with conflicts. The perception of local stakeholders about trade-offs between ESs at three protected sites in the Great Hungarian Plain were assessed through qualitative methods. In all areas significant conservation measures had been introduced since the 1990 s resulting in land use changes. Locals (farmers at each site and inhabitants at one site) were the main ‘losers’ of the land use changes and related ES trade-offs, while there were many winners at different spatial and temporal scales. Conflicts appeared only between locals and the national park directorates, and not between locals and other beneficiaries of the new ESs. Due to scale mismatch, locals might not be in direct <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> other <b>stakeholders,</b> and vice versa, and therefore there is no interface between them for confrontation and negotiation. Integrating scale into the analysis also helps in advising policy instruments to minimise local-level conflicts...|$|R
40|$|The project’s aims were to {{identify}} areas and structures of special heritage character on the North Shore of Auckland City, research and document {{the history of}} the site(s) identified and establish <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the local community, especially the community groups that are involved in the preservation or heritage architecture and landscapes. The approach taken was one of gathering information and photographic images, both archival and commissioned, making <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and producing artworks based on these resources. The most important findings can be grouped into two categories; the first is the discovery that three heritage sites and four heritage buildings can be linked to create a heritage walking trail, that if created would protect the sites and lead to a restoration and design project of regional significance. The second is that any project that is based on an inclusive and consultative program with the local community has to be given a reasonably long timetable, and has to be designed to fit in with local meetings and events. This project is achieving something rather than has achieved something, as it is through necessity ongoing into 2011, but it is successfully establishing a methodology for collaborative inter-disciplinary projects designed to work within communities regarding disputed and neglected sites. It has proven the importance of using a mixture of advocacy and consultation as a precursor to design when working within communities on sensitive sites. The conclusion of this project required two stages, to complete it to the stage a final design project that demonstrated complete engagement with the local community, Iwi and stakeholders could take place. The first stage was a public exhibition of the research findings and the artwork based on it. The exhibition allowed the community to see the findings as a celebration of their environment and as a document of work they can contribute to.

40|$|From 2003 to 2006, a {{consortium}} of six European partners analysed the future of olive production systems on sloping land in the Mediterranean basin. Olive production on such land dates back to pre-Roman times, but the production systems (known by the acronym SMOPS, for "Sloping and Mountainous Olive Production Systems"), are under threat. Many are unsustainable environmentally (erosion hazard), socially (exodus of young people) or economically (high labour costs). The OLIVERO research project was possible thanks to a grant of euro 1. 5 million from the European Union, which gives out euro 2. 5 billion in subsidies annually for olive production. An extended {{survey conducted by the}} project in five sites in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece revealed the diversity and multifunctionality of SMOPS. Four main systems were identified as important for the future: traditional, organic, semi-intensive and intensive. The conceptual framework of OLIVERO involved six phases, ranging from the initial survey up to policy recommendations. In all phases there was intensive <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and institutions. End-users were identified at three levels: local, intermediate and regional, and national/international. This paper presents the highlights of the physical analysis of land and water resources, crop and land management, and economics and policies. Scenario studies gave insight into the possible future: some SMOPS will be gradually abandoned or transformed into nature conservation areas, others will exploit drip irrigation and follow the intensification patterns of agriculture in the valleys, and a third group will continue to be managed more extensively, perhaps augmenting their income with other activities (possibly off-farm) or turning to organic production systems. At the five international OLIVERO meetings held from 2003 to 2006, knowledge, experience and ideas on the future of olive production systems were intensively exchanged. A network was established for ongoing and future cooperation. Two end-user seminars were held in Matera (Italy) and Lisbon. Over 70 scientific papers have been published...|$|R

These websites and selected social media pages are platforms the organisation can utilise to manage organisational identity and put in place channels and procedures for two-way communication to occur. A qualitative content analysis is used to conduct research on the thirty organisational websites and selected social media pages.

Also, organisations tended to use their websites as a source of information whereas in social media organisations are more concerned with the conservation and generation of return visits of their target public.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} exploring the meanings young migrant and minority ethnic women aged 18 - 30 living in Ireland bring to their sexual relationships, sexual health, and reproductive healthcare decisions, including contraceptive use, pregnancy and motherhood. This in-depth, qualitative study considers how legal, cultural, social and economic factors play out in their decisions and practices. The main purpose of this work is to ensure greater understanding and sensitivity to the specific needs and issues of concern for non-Irish national and ethnic minority women {{in relation to their}} sexual well-being. Comparative to other Northern and European countries, Ireland’s status as a country of immigration is relatively recent. While a small number of minority ethnic communities have been established for some time in Ireland, overall ethnic diversity is emergent in Irish society, so that many minority ethnic communities are at this time equivalent to migrant communities. Many of the young women in this study are first-generation migrants who have come alone or with families to live in Ireland within the past twenty years or less. The underdevelopment of research on this issue in the Irish context means that the study is building on a very low knowledge base and as such constitutes an initial exploratory study. The sensitivity of the topic of interest and marginalisation of the population of interest were also issues to consider {{in the design of the}} study. Taken together these issues provided a strong rationale for the selection of social justice orientated methodologies, and a community-based participatory research approach was taken. The study design comprised: • Consultation <b>with</b> <b>stakeholder</b> <b>organisations</b> for cultural immersion in the topic and to assess the cultural appropriateness of the research approach. • Engaging peer researchers to be involved in the data-generation process. • Qualitative, in-depth interviews with a sample young migrant and minority ethnic women aged 18 - 30. The study focuses on four communities within the overall migrant and minority ethnic community in Ireland – Chinese, Nigerian, Polish and Muslim – selected for diversity based on analysis of recent patterns of migration into Ireland. Qualitative interviews with women aged between eighteen and thirty years from each community drew out detailed accounts of their individual experiences, views and needs in relation to sexual and reproductive health. Such an approach generates a nuanced and detailed picture of the particularities and specificities of risk, care and support needs of our study group, to help inform the formation of policy and service delivery in the context of a more ethnically diverse and transient population...|$|R
