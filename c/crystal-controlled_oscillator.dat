25|$|For {{indirect}} FM modulation, {{the message}} signal is integrated {{to generate a}} phase-modulated signal. This is used to modulate a <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator,</b> {{and the result is}} passed through a frequency multiplier to produce an FM signal.

25|$|A crystal {{oscillator}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses the}} mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used {{to keep track of}} time as used in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The first <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator,</b> using a crystal of Rochelle Salt, was invented by Alexander M. Nicholson. However, it is generally accepted that Dr. Walter Guyton Cady was the first to use a quartz to control the frequency of an oscillator circuit. Nevertheless, Nicholson is still regarded as the inventor of the {{crystal oscillator}}.|$|E

Digital error-detection-and-correction circuit in color-television {{oscillator}} circuit provides synchronization when color-burst frequency drifts outside normal tolerance.

50|$|In all {{performances}} cases, <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillators</b> {{are better}} behaved than the semiconductor- and LC-based alternatives. They {{tend to be}} more stable, more repeatable, have fewer and lower harmonics and lower noise than all the alternatives in their cost-band. This in part explains their huge popularity in low-cost and computer-controlled (i.e. PLL and synthesizer-based) VFOs.|$|R
2500|$|PLLs {{may include}} a divider between the {{oscillator}} and the feedback input to the phase detector {{to produce a}} frequency synthesizer. [...] A programmable divider is particularly useful in radio transmitter applications, since {{a large number of}} transmit frequencies can be produced from a single stable, accurate, but expensive, quartz <b>crystal–controlled</b> reference <b>oscillator.</b>|$|R

50|$|Piezoelectricity was {{discovered}} by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. Paul Langevin first investigated quartz resonators for use in sonar during World War I. The first <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator,</b> using a crystal of Rochelle salt, was built in 1917 and patented in 1918 by Alexander M. Nicholson at Bell Telephone Laboratories, although his priority was disputed by Walter Guyton Cady. Cady built the first quartz crystal oscillator in 1921.Other early innovators in quartz crystal oscillators include G. W. Pierce and Louis Essen.|$|E
50|$|Direct FM (true Frequency modulation) {{is where}} the {{frequency}} of an oscillator is altered to impose the modulation upon the carrier wave. This {{can be done by}} using a voltage-controlled capacitor (Varicap diode) in a <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> or frequency synthesiser. The frequency of the oscillator is then multiplied up using a frequency multiplier stage, or is translated upwards using a mixing stage, to the output frequency of the transmitter. The amount of modulation {{is referred to as the}} deviation, being the amount that the frequency of the carrier instantaneously deviates from the centre carrier frequency.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. Harry Diamond Laboratories (HDL) has a {{need for}} gun-rugged UHF {{telemetry}} transmitters for use in research and fuze testing programs. An in-house design program was started because of the specialized performance requirements for artillery electronics. This is the first status report on the effort. UHF transmitters are extremely sensitive to physical deformation because small dimensional changes produce reactance changes that can cause an appreciable change in frequency. Since ruggedized <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillators</b> limit the frequency shift to low levels and therefore permit early acquisition of artillery telemetry signals; a prototype transmitter was constructed to determine the degree of efficiency and compactness that could be obtained at L band. A compact 1510 -MHz transmitter having an efficiency of 6 percent at an output power level of 160 mW is described. Physical dimensions are such that the transmitter can be readily potted in any artillery telemetry housing currently in use. Temperature compensation and gun ruggedization tests are currently in progress...|$|R
50|$|Phase locked loop (PLL): Using a varactor-controlled or voltage-controlled {{oscillator}} (VCO) (described above in varactor under analog VFO techniques) and a phase detector, a control-loop {{can be set}} up so that the VCO's output is frequency-locked to a <b>crystal-controlled</b> reference <b>oscillator.</b> The phase detector's comparison is made between the outputs of the two oscillators after frequency division by different divisors. Then by altering the frequency-division divisor(s) under computer control, a variety of actual (undivided) VCO output frequencies can be generated. The PLL technique dominates most radio VFO designs today.|$|R
50|$|Flyable TRADIC also {{incorporated}} a single high-power output vacuum-tube amplifier to supply clock {{power to the}} system. The designers originally devised a system clock using a <b>crystal-controlled</b> transistor <b>oscillator</b> driving a multitude of transistor amplifiers because each transistor was too low powered, but since the phase shift of the amplifiers could not be controlled to the required tolerances {{this had to be}} abandoned. So by the same criterion of incorporating vacuum tubes the flyable TRADIC was either not a fully transistorized computer, or followed the after the Manchester University Transistor Computer in 1953. In contrast, the operating requirements for the Flyable TRADIC included performing across a wide temperature range of -55 °C (-67 °F) to +55 °C (+131 °F).|$|R
50|$|Cady {{held more}} than 50 patents, {{and was the}} {{inventor}} of the <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator,</b> the highly selective narrow-band crystal filter, one of the principal theorists of the ferroelectricity in crystals, and a historian of the science of piezoelectric crystals. He won the 1928 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award, and in 1936 was the second American to receive the Duddell Medal and Prize of the Physical Society of London. He received honorary degrees from Brown University in 1938, and from Wesleyan in 1958. His papers are archived at the Smithsonian Institution and the Rhode Island Historical Society.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} of the heterodyne beat type for {{measurement of the}} dipole moment is described, which consists of a 1 Mc <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator,</b> a variable oscillator of the Franklin type, and a mixer and beat indicator. The Franklin oscillator has excellent stability, the frequency variation being within 1 cps for about one hour. Since the singnals from the fixed and variable oscillators are pure sine, no spurious beat appears on the beat indicator. The dipole moments measured on nitrobenzene and chlorbenzenein benzene solutions give 3. 99 D and 1. 59 D respectively, being very consistent with the literature value. During studies on the conformation of some polar polymers in solutions it became necessary to measure the dipole moment. Although there are several methods for measurement of the dipole moment, an {{apparatus of}} the heterodyne beat type was constructed {{in view of the}} accuracy". The apparatus consists of three units, a fixed frequency oscillator, a variable frequency oscillator, and a mixer and beat indicator. The fixed oscillator is a <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> using a 1 Mc quartz crystal. The circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The output signal is taken from the grid of the 6 C 4 oscil-lator tube and coupled to a buffer amplifier. Thus an almost pure sine wave wa...|$|E

25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} {{needed to}} modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a <b>crystal-controlled</b> high frequency <b>oscillator</b> with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|R
40|$|A thermal {{monitoring}} system for measuring body core temperatures was developed that contains an ingestible pill {{which is both}} commandable and rechargeable, and which uses magnetic induction for command and telemetry {{as well as for}} recharging. The pill electronics consist of a battery power source, a <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> that drives a small air coil, and a command detection circuit. The resulting 262 -kHz magnetilc field can be easily detected from a distance of 1 m. The pill oscillator functions at voltages less than 1 V, supplied by a single Ni-Cd battery, which must be recharged after 72 h of continuous transmission. The pill can be recalibrated periodically to compensate for long-term drift...|$|E
40|$|Precision {{time and}} {{frequency}} reference signals were effectively disseminated using high-quality intricate fiber-optic distribution systems. The quality of signals distributed by such systems is excellent, {{but the cost}} of these systems makes them unavailable to many potential users. A study of signal quality maintained using inexpensive commercial transmitter/receiver pairs is undertaken. Seven different transmitter/receiver pairs obtained from four different manufacturers were thoroughly tested using a 5 MHz sinusoid derived from a precision, temperature controlled, <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator.</b> The electrical signal output from each fiber-optic receiver was tested for spectral purity, single-sideband phase noise, and AM noise, and the results are tabulated and discussed without identification of the manufacturer or the equipment model number...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} constructed {{in which the}} output of a 5 mc/s <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> of short-time frequency stability 1 in 108 is frequency multiplied to frequencies of 270 mc/sec and 2970 mc/sec. The oscillator frequency is variable by ± 600 cps by varying the capacity across the crystal, the frequency deviation from 5 mc/sec being measured within 0. 1 cps by comparison with a 5 mc/s frequency standard and standard tuning forks. By obtaining resonance-curves of a high-Q resonant cavity at 270 mc/s measurements have {{been made of the}} dielectric constant and loss tangent of dry air and three dry non-polar gases. The loss tangent of each of the gases at N. T. P. is shown to be less than 5 x 10 - 6. Preliminary similar measurements on dry air have been made at 2970 mc/s.
