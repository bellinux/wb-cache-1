5|$|<b>Care</b> <b>needs</b> to {{be taken}} when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled {{as if they were}} toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In Germany, {{the share}} of the older {{population}} has been continuously growing. Is the increase paralleled by a rising number of frail people, however? In search of an answer, we analyse the development of <b>care</b> <b>need</b> incidence in West Germany between 1986 and 2005 on the basis of longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The results show a lower transition risk to <b>care</b> <b>need</b> for each successive cohort when all degrees of <b>care</b> <b>need</b> are taken into account. However, no change occurs when only severe <b>care</b> <b>need</b> is measured...|$|R

5|$|The lack of {{maternal}} health contributes to future economic disparities for {{mothers and their}} children. Poor maternal health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability to participate in economic activities. Therefore, national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health <b>care</b> <b>needs</b> of women across India.|$|E
5|$|There are 37 {{hospitals}} and seven clinical labs in Thanjavur that {{take care of}} the health <b>care</b> <b>needs</b> of the citizens. There are a total of 9,745 street lamps: 492 sodium lamps, 2,061 mercury vapour lamps, 7,180 tube lights and twelve high mast beam lamps. The Corporation operates three markets, namely the Serfoji Market, Amarar Swaminathan Market and Kamaraj Market and another market, the Subramaniya Swami Koil Market, is maintained by the Subramania Swami Temple authority. Thanjavur comes under the Thanjavur Telecom circle of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), India's state-owned telecom and internet services provider. Apart from telecom, BSNL also provides broadband internet service. The Regional Passport office, Trichy, operates a Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) in Thanjavur, which PSK covers the Nagappattinam, Thiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukkottai, and Ariyalur revenue districts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} bivariate semiparametric index {{models as}} a tool for modelling the interplay of socioeconomic and health characteristics in determining health care utilisation. These models allow for a fully nonparametric relationship between socioeconomic status, health <b>care</b> <b>need</b> and <b>care</b> utilisation. The only parametric restriction imposed is that multiple socioeconomic and health indicators can be aggregated into two distinct indices that measure the broader concepts of socioeconomic status and health <b>care</b> <b>need,</b> respectively. We demonstrate the usefulness of this class of models based on an illustrative empirical example. The estimations highlight complex interactions of socioeconomic status and health <b>care</b> <b>need</b> in determining <b>care</b> use, which may be difficult to grasp via standard parametric modelling approaches. ...|$|R

50|$|A special health <b>care</b> <b>need</b> {{patient can}} be defined as a person with physical, developmental, mental, sensory, behavioural, cognitive, {{emotional}} impairment which may be congenital, developmental, or acquired through disease, trauma, or environmental cause. This condition may hinder the patients’ daily routine activities. It may impact their oral and general health. The example of special health <b>care</b> <b>need</b> patients are individuals suffering from compromised immunity such as Leukemia, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, cardiac conditions associated with Endocarditis. Furthermore, individuals with the disorders of orofacial complex such as Amelogenesis imperfecta, Dentinogenesis imperfecta, Cleft lip/palate, oral cancer and a like, are also considered as special health <b>care</b> <b>need</b> patients. These individuals need special oral health care which is required for their disease management.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} interplay of {{socioeconomic}} and medical determinants of health care utilization among elderly Europeans from ten countries. Using novel strictly comparable cross-national data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), the study exploits recent semi- and nonparametric estimation methods to illustrate how individual socioeconomic status and health determine health care utilization in different institutional settings. Our flexible estimation method allows {{for the use of}} multiple health measures to adjust for individual differences in health <b>care</b> <b>need</b> without sacrificing cross-national comparability of the resulting estimates. Within countries, we find only a small, if any, socioeconomic gradient. Moreover, all health systems appear to be reasonably responsive to differences in <b>care</b> <b>need.</b> At the same time, we find considerable variation in treatment intensity across countries, which we cannot fully explain by differences in health <b>care</b> <b>need.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health <b>care</b> <b>needs.</b> Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years. But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health <b>care</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E

25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation.
