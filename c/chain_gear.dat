40|$|Abstract. A fault {{diagnosis}} method based on wavelet and adaptive interference canceling is presented for {{the identification of}} a damaged gear tooth. A damaged tooth of a certain <b>gear</b> <b>chain</b> generates impulsive signals that could be informative to fault detections. Many publications are available {{not only for the}} impulsive vibration signal analysis but the application of signal processing techniques to the impulsive signal detections. However, most of the studies about the gear fault detection using the impulsive vibration signals of a driving <b>gear</b> <b>chain</b> are limited to the verification of damage existence on a gear pair. Requirements for more advanced method locating damaged tooth in a driving <b>gear</b> <b>chain</b> should be a motivation of further studies. In this work an adaptive interference canceling combined with wavelet method is used for a successful identification of the damaged tooth location. An application of the wavelet technique provides a superior resolution for the damage detection to the traditional frequency spectrum based methods. An analysis and experiment with three pair <b>gear</b> <b>chain</b> show the feasibility of this study yielding a precise location of the damaged gear tooth...|$|R

40|$|Research {{activity}} and results obtained within the European project ARISTOTEL (2010 - 2013) are presented. It deals with anatomy, modelling and prediction of Rotorcraft Pilot Coupling (RPC) phenomena, {{which are a}} really broad and wide category of events, ranging from discomfort to catastrophic crash. The main top- ics concerning piloted helicopter simulation that are of interest for designers are examined. These include comprehensive rotorcraft modelling suited for Pilot Assisted Oscillations (PAO) prediction, modelling of pilot biodynamics behaviour in the PAO frequency range of interest, definition and application of criteria for detec- tion of RPC instabilities of aeroservoelastic nature. The numerical investigation considers Bo 105 and IAR 330 Puma helicopter models, as representatives of two different rotorcraft categories (small-size and medium-size helicopters, respectively). Factors affecting aeroservoelastic RPC prediction are investigated (like, for instance, pilot modelling, system modelling, number of controls on which the pilot exerts forces, control <b>chain</b> <b>gearing</b> ratios), {{with the aim of}} defining design guidelines for prevention of adverse RPCs occurrence...|$|R
5000|$|Ralf Hütter is an {{enthusiastic}} cycling fan, a fact reflected {{in some of}} the band's work. It was widely claimed that, when he was on tour, the group's bus would drop off Hütter 100 miles away from the next venue and he would cycle the rest of the way, a story that Hütter later confirmed. The band members took up cycling when recording the album The Man-Machine in the late 1970s. Ralf Hütter had been looking for a new form of exercise. The single [...] "Tour de France" [...] includes sounds that follow this theme, including bicycle <b>chains,</b> <b>gear</b> mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single's release Ralf Hütter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based around cycling. At the time this did not happen, but the project eventually was released as Tour de France Soundtracks in 2003.|$|R
