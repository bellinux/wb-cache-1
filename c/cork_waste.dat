40|$|Cork powder, {{the major}} waste from cork {{processing}} industries, is generated from grinding, cutting and finishing operations throughout the industrial cork process. Cork powder {{has been used}} mainly as fuel in cork industries. <b>Cork</b> <b>waste</b> ash is usually landfilled but if efficiently used in cement based construction materials it could contribute to sustainability. Strength and durability testing was undergone on mortar with 10 and 20 % cement replacement with <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> ash. Although strength is acceptable for 10 % cement replacement with cork ash (5 % loss at 90 days, compared to control), most durability properties (tested up to 6 months according to test type) reduced performance probably due to a broader pore structure caused by coarse particles in the ash which tested non pozzolanic. Moreover, <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> ash does not present the necessary requirements in terms of chemical properties considering several standards. Present work has revealed that this <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> cannot {{be used as a}} pozzolan or as a filler in cement based materials. In fact it is known that chemical composition of biomass ash is highly variable due to moisture variations, ash yield and different genetic types of inorganic matter in biomass and therefore it is important to pinpoint which types of biomass waste are adequate or not to use as cement replacement in construction...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{cork stopper}} {{manufacturing}} produces {{a significant amount}} of <b>cork</b> <b>waste,</b> which is granulated and combined with synthetic glues for use {{in a wide range of}} applications. There is a high demand for using biosourced polymers in these composite materials. In this study, xanthan gum (XG) and chitosan (CS) were investigated as possible natural binders for cork. Xanthan gum was oxidized at two different aldehyde contents as a strategy to improve its water resistance. This modification was studied in detail by 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and the degree of oxidation was determined by the hydroxylamine hydrochloride titration method. The performance of the adhesives was studied by tensile tests and total soluble matter (TSM) determinations. Xanthan gum showed no water resistance, contrary to oxidized xanthan gum and chitosan. It is hypothesized that the good performance of oxidized xanthan gum is due to the reaction of aldehyde groups—formed in the oxidation process—with hydroxyl groups on the cork surface during the high temperature drying. Combining oxidized xanthan gum with chitosan did not yield significant improvements...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{patented}} {{process for the}} treatment and reprocessing of waste and effluents from olive oil and cork industries (such as two-phase olive husks cork powder), new research {{has been carried out}} incorporating other industrial waste. In previous research, using only olive oil and <b>cork</b> <b>waste,</b> biomass pellets were obtained having high calorific values (20. 6 MJ/kg and 22. 2 MJ/kg), low moisture (8. 9 %) and relatively a low ash percentage (3. 9 %). Several new formulations and their relevance to the calorific value were now tested using other waste or by-products. The potential inclusion of olive leaves from the olive oil industry, grape husks and grape seeds from the winery industry and chestnut shells (outer shell and inner skin) from the chestnut industry has been analysed. This process will contribute to solving environmental problems resulting from the discharge of those waste and effluents and to create a viable and profitable alternative to their storage and/or deposition in landfill. The increase of other biomass sources for these types of process is extremely important from an environmental and economic management point of view. This research shows that the use of different types of raw materials as biomass sources (giving different pellets formulations) results in a different final product with different physical and chemical characteristics that may improve its quality...|$|E

Batch experiments, either for equilibrium or for kinetics, with two granulated cork sizes were performed and results {{were compared with}} those obtained with of activated carbon sorption. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were obtained both showing high linear correlations. Bifenthrin desorption was evaluated for cork and results varied with the granule size of sorbent. The results obtained in this work indicate that <b>cork</b> <b>wastes</b> {{may be used as}} a cheap natural sorbent for bifenthrin or similar compounds removal from wastewaters...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic voltammetry is {{proposed}} {{for evaluating the}} ability of <b>cork</b> <b>wastes</b> to remove Mn(II) ions by sorption from waters {{to be used for}} public supply. As the first stage, the concentration of several naturally occurring cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+ and Na+) were analyzed in the acid washings that were performed to remove them from the cork. The obtained results were then related to the total concentrations of cations released, as measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy of solutions made by dissolving ashed samples. Cyclic voltammetry {{is proposed}} to measure the manganese concentration in the uptake solutions because it allows the metal oxidation state to be controlled, and was determined to be suitable for use with standard addition methods. Contact time and particle size effects on Mn(II) sorption were evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> in adsorbing aqueous {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) has been previously reported. Biodegradation of contaminated cork using filamentous fungi {{could be a good}} alternative for detoxifying cork to facilitate its final processing. For this purpose, the degradation {{efficiency of}} anthracene by three ligninolytic white-rot fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Irpex lacteus and Pleurotus ostreatus) and three non-ligninolytic fungi which are found in the cork itself (Aspergillus Niger, Penicillium simplicissimum and Mucor racemosus) are compared. Anthracene degradation by all fungi was examined in solid-phase cultures after 0, 16, 30 and 61 days. The degradation products of anthracene by P. simplicissimum and I. lacteus were also identified by GC-MS and a metabolic pathway was proposed for P. simplicissimum. Results show that all the fungi tested degraded anthracene. After 61 days of incubation, approximately 86 %, 40 %, and 38 % of the initial concentration of anthracene (i. e., 100 μM) was degraded by P. simplicissimum, P. chrysosporium and I. lacteus, respectively. The rest of the fungi degraded anthracene to a lesser extent (< 30 %). As a final remark, the results obtained in this study indicate that P. simplicissimum, a non-ligninolytic fungi characteristic of cork itself, could be used as an efficient degrader of PAH-contaminated corkThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación as part of the project CTM 2009 - 07162 and CTM 2010 - 1518...|$|E
40|$|The cork {{industry}} {{presents itself}} {{as one of}} the most entrepreneurial in the Portuguese industrial sector, contributing significantly to the increase of exports. However, it’s an industry in which the use of raw materials is maximised leaving a large volume of waste. The cork industry has tried to take advantage of these residues, mainly through direct energy recovery, despite the technical and safety difficulties presented by the use of such low density material, which complicates and hinders its transportation for industrial uses outside the area in which it is produced. The densification process opens new doors for such use and also for its storage, because it produces better results when compared with other more common products, such as wood sawdust or even forest and agricultural waste. Thus, cork pellets emerge as a safer and more easily transportable alternative for energy recovery from cork dust and other granulated types of <b>cork</b> <b>waste,</b> which offer the prospects for wider use. The results demonstrate that cork pellets have higher calorific value when compared with other biomass pellets; typically, approximately 20 MJ/kg with 3 % volume of ashes, which is equivalent to that obtained from the combustion of pellets produced from combined forest and agricultural waste with a bulk density of 750 kg/m 3, which offers real advantages in terms of logistics...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the potencial of <b>cork</b> <b>waste</b> to remove Cu (II) and Cr (VI) from aqueous {{solutions}} has been studied. Raw cork and biochar prepared by pyrolysis of the cork, were used. Kinetic and equilibrium batch sorption experiments were performed {{in order to}} compare the sorption efficiency of each material. Adsorption isotherms were expressed by Langmuir and Freundlich equilibrium models. Moreover the batch kinetic experiments were fitted to the commonly pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations. The {{results showed that the}} metal removal using raw cork as the sorbent is pH-dependent with the uptake of 61. 5 % for chromium at pH 3 and 55. 6 % for copper at pH 6. Two types of cork size (0. 5 mm and 2 mm particle size) showed the same adsorption potential. Biochar with high specific surface area (300 m 2 g- 1) can be easily prepared from the raw cork. The raw cork results show that pseudo-second-order describe better kinetic data for both metals. According to kinetic data the adsorption of chromium using biochar is the best option for removing this metal from water. Biochar is able to sorb copper and chromium. The Langmuir model is not able to fit the experimental values for Cr, nevertheless is able to fit Cu, where the maximum adsorption was 13. 4 mg kg- 1. Freundlich model can fit the experimental values for both metals. Where Cu maximum adsorption was 14. 8 mg kg- 1 and Cr maximum adsorption was 4. 6 mg kg-...|$|E
40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{possibility}} of using <b>cork</b> <b>wastes</b> form <b>cork</b> processing for energy production. In cork processing operations an important <b>waste</b> is produced, <b>cork</b> powder, the main <b>waste</b> of the <b>cork</b> industry, which is estimated to reach over 30000 tons/year. There are various types of cork powders with higher calorific values ranging from 4, 000 - 7, 000 Kcal/kg. This powder is commonly burned to produce steam or heat used in the factories themselves, given the high energy content of this material. As an example, a cork company of a large industrial group that produces cork products for construction meets 60 % of its energy needs using <b>waste</b> <b>cork.</b> Cork boiling wastewater (CBW) is an aqueous and complex effluent of the cork industry which is produced during the boiling of the cork planks. CBW contains organic materials such as phenolic. This boiling wastewater has no utility, being a serious environmental hazard. Anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for the treatment of organic effluents and for the simultaneous recovery of its energetic potential through methane production. Its application to cork effluents was studied. An anaerobic assay was conducted. The resultant methane potentials were 0. 126 - 0. 142 m 3 CH 4 kg- 1 COD. The calculated total volume of CBW produced yearly in Portugal is 30 374 m 3. As 1 m 3 of CBW (6, 5 COD kg m- 3) in cogeneration can produce in average 1, 72 kWh of electric energy and 3, 73 kWh of thermal energy, the total CBW volume produced in Portugal in one year corresponds to a total energy value of 165 400 kWh...|$|R
40|$|Activated carbons were {{prepared}} from solid <b>cork</b> <b>wastes</b> by physical activation with carbon dioxide or steam, and chemical activation by impregnation with phosphoric acid. In this work we show {{the possibility of}} using these activated carbons for the adsorption of phenolic compounds from the aqueous phase. The materials present a different response to the adsorptives used (p-nitrophenol, p-chlorophenol, p-cresol and phenol), {{depending on the type of}} activation and the parameters (burn-off, absolute concentration) used in each case. All the samples were capable of retaining the contaminants, with the best result being reached by the sample with higher burnoff and the worst with the carbonised, while intermediate values were reached with the remaining samples. The experimental isotherms were analysed with two and three parameters equations (Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin–Radushkevich–Kaganer and Redlich–Peterson). The results obtained from the application of the equations are similar in some aspects, but the degree of confidence is quite different. The best fit was achieved with the Redlich–Peterson equation, which can be explained by the fact that this has three adjustable parameters. However, overall the Freundlich and DRK equations appear to be more useful and provide parameters which can be correlated with the structural characteristics of the solids obtained from N 2 adsorption measurements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{computation}} of the thermal delay provided by concrete floors built {{with layers of}} cork and lightweight screed that incorporate expanded <b>cork</b> granule <b>waste.</b> The heat transfer by conduction across these multilayer systems is simulated analytically under unsteady boundary conditions. The thermal delay is computed for multilayer concrete floors with varying numbers of layers and layer thicknesses. The mass density and thermal conductivity of the various materials were determined experimentally. Given its heterogeneity, the specific heat of the lightweight screed was obtained indirectly using both the experimental results and the analytical model. The results obtained show the potential of these composites in applications for increasing the thermal performance of concrete floors, in particular the thermal delay and thermal resistance. The {{results show that the}} contribution of the insulating lightweight screed material's properties to thermal delay is more relevant in systems composed of few layers. The constructive solutions composed of a greater number of layers present higher thermal delay value...|$|R

40|$|When {{it comes}} to cork the first idea, the natural cork stopper which protects the best wines in the world, still remains the best known application. History shows that in 3000 BC cork was already being used in regions {{as far away as}} China, Egypt, Babylon and Persia, in {{applications}} designed for fishing, in burial artifacts, in decorative items and also in containers to store food. Despite this history, today there is constant research, development and exploitation of new applications for this noble material and its derivatives before and after production. In this article, a review of the research developed around the use of <b>waste</b> <b>cork</b> materials for the production of activated carbons used for adsorption in both gas and liquid phases is presented. The results shown by some of the samples show the possibility of producing carbon adsorbents with a set of characteristics, not only structural but also surface chemistry, which are very interesting and comparable to those of commercial carbons, and therefore capable of application in real systems. In the gas phase there is the possibility of adsorption and separation of gases such as N 2, O 2, CH 4, CO 2 and volatile organic compounds, while in the liquid phase the removal of phenolic compounds and pharmaceutical compounds present interesting results. Another avenue relates to the production of composites and monoliths from activated carbons or even from recycled cork aglomerates...|$|R
40|$|Two {{vegetable}} <b>wastes,</b> <b>cork</b> {{bark and}} grape stalks, were investigated {{for the removal}} of methylene blue from aqueous solution. The effects of contact time, dye concentration, pH, and temperature on sorption were studied relative to adsorption on a commercially-activated carbon. The highest adsorption yield was obtained within the pH range 5 to 10 for grape stalks and 7 to 10 for cork bark. The sorption kinetics of dye onto activated carbon and grape stalks was very fast. Kinetics data were fitted to the pseudo-first and second order kinetic equations, and the values of the pseudo-second-order initial rate constants were found to be 1. 69 mg g- 1 min- 1 for activated carbon, 2. 24 mg g- 1 min- 1 for grape stalks, and 0. 90 mg g- 1 min- 1 for cork bark. Langmuir maximum sorption capacities for activated carbon, grape stalks, and cork bark for methylene blue estimated by the Orthogonal Distance Regression method (ODR) were 157. 5 mg g- 1, 105. 6 mg g- 1, and 30. 52 mg g- 1, respectively. FTIR spectra indicated that carboxylic groups and lignin {{play a significant role in}} the sorption of methylene blue.

40|$|Objectives: Mycological {{contamination}} of occupational environments {{can be a}} result of fungal spores’ dispersion in the air and on surfaces. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} assess it in both types of the samples. In the present study we assessed fungal contamination in the air and in the surface samples to show relevance of surfaces sampling in complementing the results obtained in the air samples. Material and Methods: In total, 42 settings were assessed by the analysis of air and surfaces samples. The settings were divided into settings with a high fungal load (7 poultry farms and 7 pig farms, 3 <b>cork</b> industries, 3 <b>waste</b> management plants, 2 wastewater treatment plants and 1 horse stable) and a low fungal load (10 hospital canteens, 8 college canteens and 1 maternity hospital). In addition to culture-based methods, molecular tools were also applied to detect fungal burden in the settings with a higher fungal load. Results: From the 218 sampling sites, 140 (64. 2 %) presented different species in the examined surfaces when compared with the species identified in the air. A positive association in the high fungal load settings was found between the presence of different species in the air and surfaces. Wastewater treatment plants constituted the setting with the highest number of different species between the air and surface. Conclusions: We observed that surfaces sampling and application of molecular tools showed the same efficacy of species detection in high fungal load settings, corroborating the fact that surface sampling is crucial for a correct and complete analysis of occupational scenarios...|$|R
