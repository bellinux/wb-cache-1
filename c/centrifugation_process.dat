5000|$|The gas <b>centrifugation</b> <b>process</b> {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} design that allows gas to constantly flow {{in and out}} of the centrifuge. Unlike most centrifuges which rely on batch processing, the gas centrifuge utilizes continuous processing, allowing cascading, in which multiple identical processes occur in succession.The gas centrifuge consists of a cylindrical rotor, a casing, an electric motor, and three lines for material to travel. The gas centrifuge is designed with a casing that completely encloses the centrifuge. The cylindrical rotor is located inside the casing, which is evacuated of all air to produce a near frictionless rotation when operating. The motor spins the rotor, creating the centripetal force on the components as they enter the cylindrical rotor. There are two output lines, one located at the top of the centrifuge and the other located at the bottom. The heavier molecules will segregate to the bottom of the centrifuge while the lighter molecules will segregate to the top of the centrifuge. The output lines take these separations to other centrifuges to continue to the <b>centrifugation</b> <b>process.</b> The process began with the rotor is balanced in three stages.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} we {{show how}} the phenomenological theory of sedimentation-consolidation processes can be extended {{to the presence of}} a centrifugal field. The modelling starts from the basic mass and linear momentum balances for the solid and liquid phase, which are referred to a rotating frame of reference. These equations are specified for flocculated suspensions by constitutive assumptions that are {{similar to that of the}} pure gravity case. The neglection of the influence of the gravitational relative to the centrifugal field and of Coriolis terms leads to one scalar hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equation for the solids concentration distribution as a function of radius and time. Both cases of a rotating tube and of a rotating axisymmetric vessel are included. A numerical algorithm to solve this equation is presented and employed to calculate numerical examples of the dynamic behaviour of a flocculated suspension in a sedimenting centrifuge. The phenomenological model is appropriately embedded into the existing theories of kinematic <b>centrifugation</b> <b>processes</b> of ideal (non-flocculated) suspensions. (orig.)

40|$|A low {{temperature}} environmentally friendly synthesis of magnetic zeolites by hydrothermal activation is reported. The novelty {{of the process}} {{is related to the}} use of a mixture of waste materials (fly ash (FA) and red mud (RM)) as precursors for the one-step synthesis (without passing through the additional synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles) of zeolites with good magnetic properties. The structural and magnetic investigation indicated that different types of zeolites were obtained for different FA/RM percentages and incubation temperatures, and all of these zeolites possess sufficiently high magnetic moments to enable their easy separation from the solution using an external magnet. Therefore, the time consuming and expensive high performance <b>centrifugation</b> <b>processes,</b> which are typically employed to recover zeolites, can be eliminated. In detail, sodalite and mixed Ti-Fe oxides formed using the 80 % RM mixture, and a higher amount of A-type zeolites was observed for the 50 % RM mixture.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was then performed and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of reprocessed uranium in fresh Light Water Reactor fuel {{as a measure}} against proliferation has been recently put forward in the non-proliferation discussion. In particular, the use of reprocessed uranium implies {{the presence of the}} 232 U radioisotope, and this can make the possible diversion of the fresh fuel and further uranium re-enrichment more complicated. This work attempts to further evaluate a composition of a proliferation resistant UO 2 fuel made of a mixture of fresh and reprocessed uranium, therefore implying, inter alia, the presence of 232 U and 236 U in the resulting fuel. A new UO 2 fuel half-made of fresh uranium with the other half of reprocessed UO 2 is proposed and assessed via simulation. 232 U/ 208 Tl emits a high energy gamma-ray of 2. 6 MeV enhancing its detectability and any attempt to further enrich the mixture to weapon grade using, for example, <b>centrifugation</b> <b>process</b> could be hindered as the enrichment of 232 U will rise faster than that of 235 U.
