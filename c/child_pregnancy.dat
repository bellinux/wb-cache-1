40|$|The study {{investigated}} the firstborn's dependence behaviors {{in the context of}} a second <b>child's</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Five preschool firstborns and their respective mothers, in the third trimester of pregnancy, took part in the study. The Fables Test was used in order to assess children's perceptions, and a semi-structured interview in order to investigate mothers' perceptions. The results revealed a dependence behavior tendency in the firstborn. There were also independence behaviors suggesting ambivalence. The results indicate that a second <b>child's</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is a special moment for the firstborn who is no longer an only child and has to learn to share maternal care. The investigation concerning changes in family relationships and their implications for each family member are of fundamental importance for understanding human development. This article represents a contribution to the literature which has not studied the extent to which the firstborn's behavior is affected by the presence of a sibling already during pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the prognostic {{value of the}} low Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels {{in the early stages}} of pregnancy (11 – 13 weeks GA) independently and in combination with a Doppler test of the uterine arteries during the second half of pregnancy (22 – 23 weeks GA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study covered the period 2010 – 2011 and included 106 pregnant women, aged 35 – 40, with a single <b>child</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> The research excluded pregnant women with anomalies of the fetus, smokers and women taking prophylactically low doses of aspirin. RESULTS: Thirty-six pregnant women had PAPP-A level below 0. 4 MoM, whereas 20 of them developed preeclampsia and 7 – early preeclampsia. The combination of the low PAPP-A values and the abnormal Doppler test of the uterine arteries is with a considerably better prognostic value in regards to the risk of developing preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: The Doppler test is a non-invasive, quick and easy method for assessment of the uterine-placental blood flow...|$|E
40|$|Adolescents {{and young}} adults, {{between the ages}} of 10 to 24, {{comprise}} approximately 30 percent of India's population. These youths, 365 millionstrong, will shape the future of the nation. Although the Government of India has been spending enormous amount of money in a relentless mannerover decades and the current cohorts of youth are healthier and bettereducated than ever before, {{the fact of the matter}} is, vulnerabilities stillpersist for adolescent girls (World Bank, 2014). We argue in this paperthat vulnerability of adolescent girls cannot be dealt with by executingverticals programmes in Education, Health, Nutrition and Protection inisolation rather it needs to be handled by running these programmes in a converged manner. The comprehensive reports and analysis of data across these domains would provide a 360 -degree view of individual girls,predicting their potential vulnerability well ahead of time, thereby enabling the stakeholders to intervene and prevent untoward incidents like childmarriage, child labour, <b>child</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> and trafficking among others. Furthermore, insights generated from analysing the data from the field can be used to identify the areas of improvement for the programme as applicable to decision makers at different levels of societal structure starting withvillages to blocks to districts.

40|$|Assessment of {{thyroid disease}} in {{pregnancy}} {{is important for}} gestational maternal health, obstetric outcome and, subsequent development of <b>child.</b> <b>Pregnancy</b> has pro­found effects on the regulation of thyroid function, and on thyroidal functional disorders, {{that need to be}} recognized, carefully evaluated and correctly managed. In women with normal thyroid function there is an increase in thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) production and inhibition of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the first trimester of pregnancy,. In the pregnant woman, elevated thyroxine-binding globulin (TGB) and concomitant increases in total T 4 and T 3 levels plateau at 12 - 14 weeks of pregnancy, and free T 4 measurements slowly decrease. The most frequent thyroid disorder in pregnancy is maternal hy­pothyroidism. It is associated with fetal loss, placental abruptions, preeclampsia, preterm delivery and reduced intellectual function in the offspring. Hyperthyroidism dur­ing pregnancy is relatively uncommon, with a prevalence estimated to range between 0. 1 % and 1 %. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, as this etiology accounts for 85 % of clinical hyperthyroid­ism in pregnancy. Another cause of hyperthyroidism is hyperemesis gravidarum. This is common and requires differentiation from Graves disease. There has been much discussion and many publications on the optimal management of pregnant women who are hyperthyroid or hypothyroid. Despite the lack of consensus organiza­tions, which are based on analyses, support screening in all pregnant women in the first trimester for thyroid disease. In this article, we provide information about the current approaches of thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy. J Clin Exp Invest 2016; 7 (1) : 120 - 12...|$|E

40|$|Background Advances {{in medical}} {{treatment}} {{during the last}} 50 years have resulted in more individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD) and Marfan syndrome reaching childbearing age. The substantial physiological changes during pregnancy result in a high-risk situation, and pregnancy {{is a major concern}} in women with these conditions. Aims To describe the socio-demographic characteristics, birth characteristics and reproductive patterns of individuals with CHD and women with Marfan syndrome. To investigate obstetric and neonatal outcomes in the firstborn children of individuals with CHD and women with Marfan syndrome. To study long-term cardiovascular outcomes after childbirth in women with Marfan´syndrome. Methods The studies are population-based register studies. The study population in the first paper included all women born between 1973 and 1983 who were alive and resident in Sweden at the age of 13 (494 692 women, of whom 2 216 were women with CHD). In the second paper, the same definition of the study population was chosen, except that it involved all men born between 1973 and 1983 (522 216 men, of whom 2 689 men with CHD). The third and fourth papers involved a study population of all Swedish women born between 1973 and 1993 who were still living in Sweden at age 13. This population consisted of 1 017 538 women, 273 of whom had been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Results and conclusions The individuals studied were more often born preterm, and were small-for-gestational age babies. They {{were more likely to have}} been born by cesarean section. In women with CHD, these characteristics were repeated in their firstborn children. No increased risks were found in children of men with CHD or in children of women with Marfan syndrome. There was no increased risk of aortic dissection in women with Marfan syndrome during pregnancy compared to women with Marfan syndrome who did not give birth. Higher frequencies of cardiac arrhythmia and valvular heart disease were found after childbirth in women with Marfan syndrome. Pregnancy in women with CHD is a high-risk situation associated with increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes for the expected <b>child.</b> <b>Pregnancy</b> in women without CHD, but where the father has CHD is not so associated with increased risk of adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes. Pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome is not associated with adverse outcomes for the expected child...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{patterns}} of intrahousehold food allocation among rural families in Southern Ethiopia. Individual food sufficiency is measured by the total calorie intake of each individual divided by the Recommended Dietary Allowance of calories. This is divided by the household total of this variable to get the individual’s share in household food resources. We used data on 583 families, collected in 1995. We first ran wage regressions corrected for selectivity and imputed potential wages of all individuals. We then used the imputed wages as explanatory variables, in addition to other socioeconomic variables, in regressions explaining the individual’s share in the household food resources. Different regressions were estimated for male household heads, female household heads or spouses, and children in three different age groups. We failed to find that the potential wages of the household head and spouse reflect their bargaining power towards each other, but we did find that the economic position of women has a positive effect on the relative nutritional status of their <b>children.</b> <b>Pregnancy</b> and breastfeedin...|$|R
