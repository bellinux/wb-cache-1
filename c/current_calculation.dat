40|$|Abstract: In the Netherlands, several field {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} in piled embankments with a geosynthetic basal reinforcement (GR). This paper presents a series of nineteen 3 D model experiments on piled embankments. Purpose of the tests was to find an explanation why the calculated GR strains exceed the GR strains measured in the field. This paper focuses on the starting points of the test series, the test set-up and the scaling rules and gives {{a summary of the}} results. Van Eekelen et al., (2011 b and 2011 c) describe the results of the tests extensively. Five starting points were leading {{to the development of the}} test set-up. (1) Possibility to evaluate the two calculation steps separately, (2) Possibility to evaluate the influence of consolidation of the subsoil, (3) Inclusion of GR, (4), Modelling the fill realistically, (5) a realistic stress level and scale. For the test conditions (static load, laboratory scale), it was found that consolidation of the subsoil results in an increase of arching. This is not in agreement with the <b>current</b> <b>calculation</b> models. Loading on the GR is concentrated on the strips lying above and between adjacent piles (the “GR strips”) which is in agreement with the <b>current</b> <b>calculation</b> models. The measured load on a GR strip has the distribution of an inverse triangle, although the load may be even more concentrated around the pile caps than this indicates. This is not in agreement with the <b>current</b> <b>calculation</b> models. Implementing this in the CUR/EBGEO calculation model results in 19 - 26 % less GR strain...|$|E
