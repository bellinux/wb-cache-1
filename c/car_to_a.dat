5|$|Steve becomes {{paranoid}} that Charlie will {{steal the}} gold, {{and starts to}} launder it faster, but he is forced to kill Yevhen when he reveals {{his knowledge of the}} Venice heist. Yevhen's death infuriates Mashkov, his cousin and a leading member of an Ukrainian crime family. Mashkov connects the murder to Charlie through Skinny Pete. Further uneased, Steve makes plans to transport the gold to Mexico City by a private plane from Los Angeles International Airport after transporting it there in an armored car. Napster overhears of this, and Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system to force the armored <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> planned spot where they will execute the heist.|$|E
5|$|Tom later {{searches}} Black's office, stealing his gun {{and finding}} Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is exactly why he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way. In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not expect her to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E

50|$|Plant {{operations}} changed immensely. Until 1948, 100-inch {{wood was}} handled by hand. Large unloading crews handled the wood from railroad <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> system of conveyors for building huge storage piles on the river’s edge.|$|R

25|$|To further {{emphasize}} the durability and prove {{the reliability of}} the new Rebels, an absolute record of 30 hours flat was set in the long-distance Baja run down Mexico's Baja California Peninsula in 1967.

25|$|As an example, {{the choice}} {{set for a}} person {{deciding}} which mode of transport to take to work includes driving alone, carpooling, taking bus, etc. The choice set {{is complicated by the}} fact that a person can use multiple modes for a given trip, such as driving a <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> train station and then taking train to work. In this case, the choice set can include each possible combination of modes. Alternatively, the choice can be defined as the choice of “primary” mode, with the set consisting of car, bus, rail, and other (e.g. walking, bicycles, etc.). Note that the alternative “other” is included in order to make the choice set exhaustive.|$|E
25|$|Due to no {{funding from}} the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties, MARTA has {{struggled}} for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area. As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> MARTA rail station (instead of using bus service) if their job is near an adjacent one. MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.|$|E

Sponsorship for this car came mainly from Trus Joist and Auto Value. Kahne and Mayfield shared the driving duties for the three races the team ran with a best finish of 4th at Richmond in May. Kahne also drove the <b>car</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 12th-place finish at New Hampshire and Mayfield had a best finish of 29th at Charlotte. While the team didn't run in 2006, {{a couple of the}} chassis from the No. 79 were run by Erin Crocker in her first couple of races.|$|E
50|$|When a {{locomotive}} pulls a train of freight <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> loading/unloading station, it approximately positions them {{with respect to}} freight handling equipment, since locomotives are not well-suited for precise positioning. Therefore, special systems (car spotters) are invented for car spotting. Systems that handle strings (trains) of <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> spot them one after another are known as car progressors or car indexers.|$|R
