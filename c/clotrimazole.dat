5|$|Several {{combination}} acne treatments containing clindamycin {{are also}} marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, {{a combination of}} clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with <b>clotrimazole</b> are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, <b>clotrimazole,</b> rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E

25|$|The {{substituted}} imidazole derivatives {{are valuable}} in treatment of many systemic fungal infections. Imidazoles {{belong to the}} class of azole antifungals, which includes ketoconazole, miconazole, and <b>clotrimazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Clotrimazole</b> {{is usually}} used 5 times daily for 14 days for oral thrush, twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks for skin infections, and once daily for 3 or 7 days for vaginal infections.|$|E
25|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment application of <b>clotrimazole</b> (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or miconazole (commonly prescribed for vaginal yeast infections).|$|E
25|$|Combined with {{marbofloxacin}} and <b>clotrimazole,</b> dexamethasone {{is available}} {{under the name}} Aurizon, CAS number 115550-35-1, and used to treat difficult ear infections, especially in dogs. It can also be combined with trichlormethiazide to treat horses with swelling of distal limbs and general bruising.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical <b>clotrimazole</b> or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including <b>clotrimazole.</b> In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clotrimazole</b> may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with <b>clotrimazole</b> monotherapy.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{substituted}} imidazoles, including <b>clotrimazole,</b> are selective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, {{which makes them}} interesting drug targets in inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system. Other biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the downregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with translation initiation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clotrimazole,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Canesten among others, is an {{antifungal}} medication. It is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, pityriasis versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch. It can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clotrimazole</b> was {{discovered}} in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world as of 2014 is 0.20–0.86 USD per 20gm tube of cream. In the United States a course of treatment typically costs less than 25 USD.|$|E
25|$|Some {{methods of}} {{prevention}} include avoiding walking barefoot in public showers, keeping the toenails short, wearing big enough shoes, and changing socks daily. When infected, the feet {{should be kept}} dry and clean and wearing sandals may help. Treatment can be either with antifungal medication applied to the skin such as <b>clotrimazole</b> or for persistent infections antifungal medication that are taken by mouth such as terbinafine. The use of the cream is typically recommended for four weeks.|$|E
500|$|An {{inflammation}} of the glans penis and foreskin is called balanoposthitis, and the condition affecting the glans alone is called balanitis. [...] Most cases of these conditions occur in uncircumcised males, affecting 411% of that group. [...] The moist, warm space underneath the foreskin is thought to facilitate the growth of pathogens, particularly when hygiene is poor. [...] Yeasts, especially Candida albicans, {{are the most common}} penile infection and are rarely identified in samples taken from circumcised males. [...] Both conditions are usually treated with topical antibiotics (metronidazole cream) and antifungals (<b>clotrimazole</b> cream) or low-potency steroid creams. Circumcision is a treatment option for refractory or recurrent balanoposthitis, but in recent years the availability of the other treatments have made it less necessary.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{no known}} {{significant}} drug interactions with topical <b>clotrimazole.</b> However, with oral (troche) <b>clotrimazole,</b> {{there are multiple}} interactions as the medication is a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor, primarily CYP3A4. Thus, any medication that is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme will potentially have elevated levels when oral <b>clotrimazole</b> is used.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. [...] There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. [...] About 70 percent of infections are caused by Microsporum canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. [...] Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. [...] Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the cliinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or <b>clotrimazole.</b> [...] Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or itraconazole. [...] Infection can spread to humans.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Cancer Institute, the {{aluminium}} acetates {{are used}} topically in humans as antiseptic agents, which also cause body tissues to shrink.

[...] The Food and Drug Administration has approved it for use for [...] "temporary relief of minor skin irritations due to ... 'poison ivy,' 'poison oak,' 'poison sumac,' 'insect bites,' 'athlete's foot,' or 'rashes caused by soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry.'" [...] For these applications, over-the-counter preparations such as Burow's solution are typically used, while diluted forms are used as gargles for conditions like aphthous ulcers of the mouth, including with amino acid additives to improve palatability and taste. [...] The most common use of Burow's solution is in treating ear infections including otomycosis, though it is generally not as effective as <b>clotrimazole</b> in these fungal infections.
