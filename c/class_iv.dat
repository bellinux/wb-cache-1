5|$|In Mauritius, a {{total of}} 200people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters due to the cyclone. The island was under a Cyclone Warning Class III for 36hours, {{and for a few}} more hours it was under a Cyclone Warning <b>Class</b> <b>IV,</b> the latter meaning wind gusts of 120km/h (75mph) were reported or expected. Prior to the storm affecting the area, officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban. Due to the threat of the storm, several flights in and out of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were canceled. Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|The Autumn Arietids also radiate from Aries. The shower lasts from 7 September to 27 October and peaks on 9 October. Its peak rate is low. The Epsilon Arietids {{appear from}} 12 to 23 October. Other meteor showers {{radiating}} from Aries include the October Delta Arietids, Daytime Epsilon Arietids, Daytime May Arietids, Sigma Arietids, Nu Arietids, and Beta Arietids. The Sigma Arietids, a <b>class</b> <b>IV</b> meteor shower, are visible from 12 to 19 October, {{with a maximum}} zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|The Merced River and {{its tributaries}} are a popular {{recreational}} area {{in part because of}} Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and <b>Class</b> <b>IV,</b> mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River {{and its tributaries}} include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E

40|$|In England and Wales {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} excess of ischaemic heart disease death rates among men and women of social <b>classes</b> <b>IV</b> and V compared with those in classes I and II and this excess is greater in young than in old adults. The male excess over women in IHD death rates is much greater in social classes I and II than in <b>classes</b> <b>IV</b> and V. Although men in professional occupations are at low risk for IHD compared with men in other occupations, women married to professional men are at an even lower risk compared with other women. Also, women married to men in unskilled occupations have relatively higher IHD rates than their husbands. These patterns are not seen for "all causes," cerebrovascular disease, chronic bronchitis, or stomach cancer, where the social class mortality gradients are similar in men and women. There may thus be factors associated with professional occupations that increase the risk of IHD despite the relatively low death rates of men engaged in them. In addition there may be factors operating in women in social <b>classes</b> <b>IV</b> and V that put them at a particularly high risk for the development of IHD...|$|R
5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to <b>class</b> <b>IV</b> whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{mortality}} trends over 40 years in England and Wales showed that mortality from {{coronary heart disease}} had become progressively more common in working-class men and women than in those from {{the middle and upper}} classes. The change was most noticeable for men. Whereas in 1931 and 1951 heart disease was more common in men of social classes I and II, by 1961 it was more common in men of <b>classes</b> <b>IV</b> and V. This change in social-class distribution can only partly be explained by changes in diagnostic methods. The worsening mortality of <b>classes</b> <b>IV</b> and V correlated with relatively more smoking, a higher consumption of sugar, and a lower consumption of wholemeal bread in these classes. There was no correlation between change in heart disease and change in the social-class pattern of fat consumption...|$|R

25|$|Class I, II and III RPDs {{that have}} {{multiple}} edentulous {{areas in which}} replacement teeth are being placed are further classified with modification states that were defined by Oliver C. Applegate. Kennedy classification is governed by the most posterior edentulous area that is being restored. Thus if, for example, a maxillary arch is missing teeth #1, 3, 7-10 and 16, the RPD would be Kennedy Class III mod 1. It would not be Class I, because missing third molars are generally not restored in an RPD (although if they were, the classification would indeed be Class I), {{and it would not}} be <b>Class</b> <b>IV,</b> because modification spaces are not allowed for Kennedy <b>Class</b> <b>IV.</b>|$|E
