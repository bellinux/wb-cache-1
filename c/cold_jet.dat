50|$|There {{are many}} complex {{interactions}} with the warm-core ring and thus lifetime productivity is not {{very different from the}} surrounding shelf water. A study in 1998 found that the primary productivity within a warm-core ring was almost the same as in the <b>cold</b> <b>jet</b> outside it, with evidence of upwelling of nutrients within the ring. In addition, there was discovery of dense populations of phytoplankton at the nutricline in a ring, presumably supported by upward mixing of nutrients. Furthermore, there have been acoustic studies in the warm-core ring, which showed intense sound scattering from zooplankton and fish populations in the ring and very sparse acoustic signals outside of it.|$|E
50|$|Single-hose {{technology}} {{was developed by}} <b>Cold</b> <b>Jet,</b> LLC in 1986, and uses a single hose to deliver air blasts and dry ice. Single-hose dry-ice blasters share many {{of the advantages of}} single-hose abrasive-blast systems. To avoid the potential dangers of a pressurized hopper, single-hose dry-ice blasters make use of a quickly cycling airlock. The single-hose system can use a longer hose than its double-hose counterpart without a significant drop in pressure when the ice leaves the hose. The additional power comes at the cost of increased complexity. Single-hose systems are used where more aggressive cleaning is an advantage. This allows heavier build-up to be cleaned and allows moderate buildup to be cleaned faster.|$|E

5000|$|When the brinicle becomes thick enough, {{it becomes}} self-sustaining. As ice accumulates around the down-flowing <b>cold</b> <b>jet,</b> it forms an insulating layer that {{prevents}} the cold, saline water from diffusing and warming. As a result, the ice jacket surrounding the jet grows downward with the flow. The inner wall {{temperature of the}} stalactite remains on the salinity-determined freezing curve, so as the stalactite grows and the temperature deficit of the brine goes into the growth of ice, the inner wall melts to dilute and cool the adjacent brine back to its freezing point. [...] It is like an icicle turned inside-out; rather than cold air freezing liquid water into layers, down-rushing cold water is freezing the surrounding water, enabling it to descend even deeper. As it does, it creates more ice, and the brinicle grows longer.|$|E

40|$|We present {{steady-state}} {{calculations of}} self-similar magnetized accretion discs driving <b>cold,</b> adiabatic, non-relativistic <b>jets.</b> For the first time, both the magnetic torque {{due to the}} jets and a turbulent "viscous" torque are taken into account. This latter torque allows a dissipation of the accretion power as radiation at the disc surfaces, while the former predominantly provides jets with power. The parameter space of these structures has been explored. It is characterized by four free parameters, namely the disc aspect ratio and three MHD turbulence parameters, related to the anomalous magnetic diffusivities and viscosity. It turns out that launching <b>cold</b> <b>jets</b> from thin, dissipative discs implies anisotropic turbulent dissipation. Jets that asymptotically reach a high Alfvenic Mach number are only produced by weakly dissipative discs. We obtained general analytical relations between disc and jet quantities that must be fulfilled by any steady-state model of <b>cold</b> <b>jets,</b> launched from a large radial extension of thin discs. We also show that such discs cannot have a dominant viscous torque. This {{is because of the}} chosen geometry, imposing the locus of the Alfven surface.

40|$|Abstract. The {{presence}} of an imposed external magnetic field drastically influences the structure of thin accretion disks. The magnetic field energy {{is assumed to be}} in balance with the thermal energy of the accretion flow, and a diffusion approximation simulates the (vertical) energy transport. Our main result is that inside the corotation radius the resulting radial inclination i of the magnetic field lines from the rotation axis easily exceeds the critical value 30 (required to launch <b>cold</b> <b>jets)</b> even for mag-netic Prandtl numbers of order unity. The self-consistent consideration of both magnetic field and accretion flow demonstrates only a weak dependence of the inclination angle on the magnetic Prandtl number. The surface values of the toroidal magnetic fields necessary to induce considerably high values for the radial inclination are much smaller than expected. As the innermost part of the disk produces the largest Btor, the largest radial inclination can also be expected there.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{importance}} of astrocyte-neuron communication in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity has become increasingly clear. Since neuron-astrocyte interactions represent highly dynamic and reciprocal processes, we hypothesized that many astrocyte genes may be regulated {{as a consequence of}} their interactions with maturing neurons. In order to identify such neuron-responsive astrocyte genes in vitro, we sought to establish an expedite technique for separation of neurons from co-cultured astrocytes. Our newly established method makes use of <b>cold</b> <b>jet,</b> which exploits different adhesion characteristics of subpopulations of cells (Jirsova et al., 1997), and is rapid, performed under ice-cold conditions and avoids protease-mediated isolation of astrocytes or time-consuming centrifugation, yielding intact astrocyte mRNA with approximately 90 % of neuronal RNA removed. Using this purification method, we executed genome-wide profiling in which RNA derived from astrocyte-only cultures was compared with astrocyte RNA derived from differentiating neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Data analysis determined that many astrocytic mRNAs and biological processes are regulated by neuronal interaction. Our results validate the <b>cold</b> <b>jet</b> as an efficient method to separate astrocytes from neurons in co-culture, and reveals that neurons induce robust gene-expression changes in co-cultured astrocytes...|$|E

Four ideally-expanded supersonic jets, M= 2. 0 <b>cold</b> <b>jet,</b> M= 3. 0 <b>cold</b> <b>jet,</b> M= 2. 0 hot jet and M= 3. 0 hot jet, are computed and analyzed.

The results of the focused array methods show that the high frequency sources are located at the upstream region, while the low frequency sources are located at the downstream region. In addition, Mach waves emitted from the high frequency sources are propagated with the large angle to the axis, while that from the low frequency sources are propagated with the small angle.

Impulsive and brief time injection cases with a piston stroke Lp ¼ 4 are simulated for fairly large Reynolds numbers (Re = 750 and 1500).
