40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between artificially and {{naturally}} regenerated {{stands in the}} south-eastern part of North Karelia, Finland, and naturally regenerated stands in the western parts of the Republic of Karelia, Russian Federation. The effect of soil fertility and silvicultural operations on the stand structure was also investigated. The {{results of the study}} show clearly that when forests are artificially regenerated the stand structure includes less variation when compared with the stands naturally regenerated. Differences between the regeneration methods are clearer the more fertile the forest site is. Within the regeneration method there is also a clear trend in stand structure, with the variation decreasing the poorer the site. The effect of silvicultural operations, i. e. the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> the sapling <b>stand,</b> has disappeared by the time of first thinning, although it appears to have a permanent effect on the dynamics of the tree species within a <b>stand.</b> The variation <b>of</b> the <b>stand</b> structure can be regarded as an essential factor for the potential biodiversity <b>of</b> the <b>stand</b> also at its young vegetation succession stage. This capacity for maintaining the forest biodiversity, developed at the young vegetation succession stage, becomes increasingly important in subsequent vegetation succession stages. Natural regeneration provides improved possibilities for the operations preserving forest biodiversity, as it generates more dense stands with a wider variation in stand structure, compared to artificial regeneration...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the causes of}} the steep drop in United States infant mortality, 1900 - 1940. I consider the country’s national experience, as well as the local experience of Pittsburgh. In Section One, I present historical evidence on potential factors in the infant mortality drop. In Section Two, I estimate the effect of several of these factors on the United States infant mortality rate, as well as the Pittsburgh infant mortality rate. I find that the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> market milk and the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> drinking water are associated with significant decreases in infant mortality. My analysis suggests that the effect <b>of</b> the national <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> market milk was greater than the effect <b>of</b> the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> water...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research of efficacy of the lightweight low power chainsaw Stihl MS 260 in the operations of juvenile thinning in preserved even-aged mixed <b>stands</b> <b>of</b> pedunculate oak with hornbeam, ash and other hard hardwoods. The investigations were carried out in the territory of FE “Sremska Mitrovica” in three sample plots of different ages. It is the first research of this kind based on the choice of optimal technological solution for the <b>cleaning</b> cuts <b>of</b> oak <b>stands.</b> Technology <b>of</b> work is based on cutting unwanted species at a certain height in order to favor pedunculate oak as the main species. In sample plot 1 the cutting through of undesirable species was carried out in one place and then third parties carried out their processing and transportation. In sample plots 2 and 3 workers cut the unwanted species in several places and stacked the timber on the ground so as not to interfere with the growth of pedunculate oak which does not tolerate shading. In this study, we applied time and work study. Group system of work was recorded. The group typically consisted of 4 workers and a foreman. Fuel consumption was recorded by the method of tank refuelling. The research results show that operating conditions {{have a significant impact on}} the effects of work with a chainsaw, as well as on the consumption of fuel and lubricants. The differences are mainly caused by different structures of cut timber...|$|R
