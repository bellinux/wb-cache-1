The Sex Knowledge Inventory was administered along with the Knowledge portion of the Sex Knowledge and Attitude Test. The Sex Knowledge Inventory measured knowledge of such topics as masturbation, homosexuality, reproduction, birth control, anatomy and physiology, sexual intercourse, and AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Analysis revealed that the Sex Knowledge Inventory is a valid instrument for assessing sex knowledge in both hearing and deaf populations. Data collected demonstrated that deaf <b>college</b> <b>freshmen</b> lag behind hearing <b>college</b> <b>freshmen</b> in nearly every aspect of sex knowledge examined.

The results revealed that IA can significantly predict the generation and development of NMCs, and that when such maladaptive cognitions have been established, they can further adversely affect the extent of the students’ IA. A vicious cycle was observed between these two variables, with IA having predictive priority in its relationship with NMC. This study also determined that the relationship between these two variables was the same for both males and females; therefore, the final model we established can be extensively applied to Chinese <b>college</b> <b>freshmen,</b> regardless of gender.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Higher Education Leadership)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The {{review of}} {{literature}} for this study explores {{the differences in the}} adjustment process of freshmen who commute to college in contrast to freshmen who live in on campus housing while attending college. The literature that was reviewed for this study consists of how living environments impact a <b>college</b> <b>freshman???s</b> adjustment process as well as other factors that impact a freshman???s adjustment process. In the review of the literature several key themes were addressed such as transition, involvement, sense of belonging, and social adjustment. Statement of Problem This thesis is a quantitative study exploring the differences in the adjustment process of <b>freshmen</b> <b>college</b> students who commute in contrast to the adjustment process of <b>college</b> <b>freshmen</b> who live in the residence halls at a small, private university. This study explores the effects of adjustment and living environments on retention. This study was completed at Jones University located in the Sacramento Valley of California. The study consisted of two surveys which were distributed at Jones University to freshmen. Sources of Data The literature which was reviewed for this study looks at major factors affecting the adjustment process for <b>college</b> <b>freshmen.</b> Those factors consist of transition, involvement, social adjustment, sense of belonging, and living environments. The literature review also explores how these factors mentioned above affect not only <b>college</b> <b>freshmen</b> as a whole, but also <b>college</b> <b>freshmen</b> who commute to campus and <b>college</b> <b>freshmen</b> who live in the residence halls. Conclusions Reached This study concluded that the factors that affect the freshman adjustment process which were researched in the literature such as transition, involvement, social adjustment, sense of belonging and living environments all play a large role in the adjustment of both commuter students and residential students. Differences were seen in their overall involvement in campus activities as well as how often commuter students and residential students interacted with faculty. The conclusion was also drawn that there was not {{a significant difference in the}} overall adjustment of the freshmen who commuted to campus at Jones University and the freshman who lived in on- campus housing.
