In the upstream and intermediate zones, the low water temperature and the high conductivity revealed a connection with the groundwater. Moreover, the geomorphological riffle characterizing the intermediate zone created the same downwelling and upwelling processes as in running water, with a groundwater/hyporheic/surface water ecotone and produced physico-chemical differences between the upstream and the downstream zones and thereby modify the diatom, macroinvertebrate and macrophyte distribution.

The first 42 km of the channel is a linear reach followed for the next 83. 8 km by a sinuous reach. The sinuous reach has a sinuosity index of 1. 66 before it changes back to a linear reach for the next 22. 2 km. A second sinuous reach is 40. 2 km long and the two reaches are separated by a crevasse splay and a large landslide that deflected the channel northwest towards Gorda Basin. Both sinuous reaches have oxbow bends, <b>cut-off</b> <b>meanders,</b> interior and exterior terraces and extensive levee systems. The lower sinuous reach becomes more linear for the next 22. 2 km before the channel relief falls below the resolution of the data.

The bathymetry and acoustic backscatter, together with previously collected seismic data and box and piston cores provide details to suggest Mendocino Channel may be no older than early Quaternary.

However, was the event exceptional {{with respect to}} resultant deposition downstream? Off-river waterbodies to the Lower Connecticut River, such as <b>cut-off</b> <b>meanders</b> and blocked valley lakes, are a particularly important floodplain environment, which {{have been shown to}} serve as a focal point for the trapping of sediment and associated contaminants. This study evaluates the relative role of extreme events like Tropical Storm Irene in infilling these off-river environments. To meet this objective we compare the magnitude and composition of resultant sedimentation from Irene to that observed following the 2011 and 2013 spring freshets. Tropical Storm Irene deposits were identified as compositionally distinct, grey layers that were relatively inorganic compared to sediments deposited by the annual spring freshet. Sediment within the Irene deposit was enriched in elemental potassium and depleted in zircon, a finding consistent with being enriched by glacigenic lacustrine and till sediments. Decreased mercury levels in the Irene deposits suggest that this event served to cap highly contaminated, industrial era sediment with a layer of relatively clean, fine-grained silt and clay. Resampling of these waterbodies in Fall 2012 revealed preservation of the 2 - 3 cm thick Irene deposit as well as 3 - 4 cm of more recent sediments deposited on top of this event. Sediment contributions from rare events, like Tropical Storm Irene, were found to be less influential than the annual spring freshet in the long-term infilling of waterbodies along the Lower Connecticut River. However, sediments from Irene are compositionally unique and serve to highlight the importance of this event in removing glacially derived fines from the river’s upland catchments...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} discharge {{evolution of}} branches of rivers can potentially {{be derived from}} inactive and fossil river meanders using relations between discharge and channel width and meander dimensions. This evolution is relevant for the understanding of river dynamics and avulsion, and the resulting changes of downstream flooding risks and shipping conveyance. Unfortunately, digitalisation of infilled and overgrown meanders from images or maps is laborious and inaccurate. We developed and demonstrated an automated procedure for the recognition of river meanders from satellite-imagery of the river Ganges. For this automated recognition we used object-based image analysis, which allows including shape and neighbourhood information besides spectral information in the classification procedure. We needed information on both present, i. e. water carrying meanders, and fossil, i. e. partly vegetated meanders. This implies {{a wide range of}} spectral behaviour and hence the selection of meanders should be primarily based on shape. Therefore, we used an image showing the low-flow situation. Results demonstrate that the object-oriented image analysis approach offers detailed meandering metrics. The Gorai channel belt, once the main courses of the Ganges, has a fairly uniform meander size distribution and {{only a small number of}} old meanders, indicating a sudden emergence of the channel with limited dynamic meandering and a short period of activity. The Hooghly channel belt, another previous main course, has many more abandoned <b>meanders</b> and <b>cut-off</b> <b>meanders</b> including many small ones, suggesting a more gradual rise of discharge and a longer period of activity. The lack of small meanders in the present residual channels indicates that both were abandoned so suddenly that meander geometry could not adjust to the waning discharge. Given the importance of shape to recognize the meanders, this study was possible only thanks to the availability of object based image analysis. 1. 1 Ganges delta 1...|$|R

The study focusses on flow and sediment dynamics in the exit of a <b>cut-off</b> <b>meander</b> where the downstream entrance is still connected to the main channel, but the upstream entrance is closed. Two similar field and laboratory cases were investigated using innovative velocimetry techniques (acoustic Doppler profiling, image analysis). Laboratory experiments were conducted with a mobile-bed physical model of the Morava river (Slovakia). Field measurements were performed in the exit of the Port-Galland <b>cut-off</b> <b>meander,</b> Ain river (France). Both cases yielded consistent and complementary results from which a generic scheme for flow patterns and morphological evolution was derived. A simple analogy with flows in rectangular side cavities was used to explain the recirculating flow patterns which developed in the exit. A decelerating inflow deposits bedload in the downstream part of the cavity, while the upstream part is eroded by an accelerating outflow, leading to the retreat of the upstream bank. In the field, strong secondary currents were observed, especially in the inflow, which may enhance the scouring of the downstream corner of the cavity. Also, fine sediment deposits constituted a silt layer in a transitional zone, located between {{the mouth of the}} abandoned channel and the oxbow-lake within the <b>cut-off</b> <b>meander.</b> Attempts at morphological prediction should consider not only the flow and sediment conditions in the cavity, but also the dynamics of the main channel...|$|E

In each region, three cut-off meanders were examined;one in each region was impacted by gravel extraction (upstream deepening) and halieutic improvement (downstream deepening), whereasthe others were left in their natural state having different silt accumulations either almost cut-off from the river or less silted-up andmore open to the river. The sites were monitored for one year for physical and chemical characteristics. Diatom samples collected insummer 2009 were examined along with their associated biocenosis. The two catchments, differing in geology, land-use and water quality,sheltered different diatom communities. Physical and chemical differences were recorded between up- and downstream zones of eachcut-off meander due to both {{the influence of the}} groundwater (buffering the water temperature among others) and the periodic inflowfrom the main channel (increased oxygen saturation concentration in downstream end of the cut-off meanders, except for the impactedupstream zone which contained a lot of macrophytes). In the upstream reach (except for one site), the connection with the groundwaterfrom the surrounding catchment, which acts as a hydro-geological reservoir, might explain the highest mineralization and water hardnessrecorded mainly in the upstream zone of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>meander,</b> and the presence of Pseudostaurosira subsalina (Hustedt) Morales andThalassiosira weissflogii (Grunow) Fryxell & Hasle. For the downstream reach, in addition to up- and downstream differences, otherfactors came into play giving rise to different communities, for example, cattle trampling in the <b>cut-off</b> <b>meander</b> leading to the presence ofhypereutrophic and polysaprobic taxa or the potential local re-emergence of mineral springs associated with brackish taxa. Moreover, theup- or downstream deepening also induced differences: the extraction of sediment nearer to the river created a system in which water inputfrom the main channel flows in through a larger opening, inducing allochthonous processes. This increased the river’s influence, creatinga renewal of earlier morphological and ecological conditions, whereas the gravel extraction that modified the upstream zone increasedthe influence of groundwater from the surrounding catchment on this area of the site and led to water conditions independent of the mainchannel.

Restoration projects carried out in such habitats rarely consider the role of both sexual reproduction (seeds) and vegetative (vegetative propagules or clonal fragments) components of propagule banks in vegetation regeneration. Moreover, changes in the seed bank due to the restoration itself have rarely been studied. The aim {{of this paper is}} to answer the following questions. Does restoration consisting of sediment removal in a <b>cut-off</b> <b>meander</b> lead to a change in the propagule bank (both sexual and vegetative propagules), and does the vegetation regeneration involve vegetative propagules created by plant breakage during the disturbance? Vegetation was visually surveyed three times during a 15 -year period before the restoration and two years afterwards in both the restored zone and an upstream undisturbed zone, The propagule bank was characterized just before and one year after the restoration in the restored zone by sampling of sediment cores and propagule germination in a greenhouse. The impact of restoration on the propagule bank was very pronounced. Sprouting propagules were three times more abundant in post-restoration samples than in pre-restoration samples. The ratio of seeds / vegetative propagules in the bank was lower in the year following restoration. Links between propagule bank and established vegetation were assessed through calculation of correlation and similarity indices. We observed a large difference between established vegetation and the propagule bank before restoration, suggesting that recruitment from the propagule bank was low before restoration. Restoration enhanced the recruitment from rhizomes and vegetative fragments, which were highly correlated with the established vegetation. The pre-eminent role of some vegetative propagules in the recolonization and the increasing abundance of an invasive species are related to the season (June) in which restoration was carried out. Impact of restoration on both the propagule bank composition and environmental conditions (especially those promoting or inhibiting germination or sprouting) thus has to be considered in further vegetation management work...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} Minas Gerais (Brazil) {{exhibits}} several major karst areas located in sandstone and quartzite terrains, that display a complex suite of underground and surface karstic forms. In the Espinhaço Ridge, central Minas Gerais, several caves, up {{to a few}} hundred metres long, occur in the surroundings {{of the town of}} Diamantina. Some of these caves, such as Salitre, represent swallow-holes and show dome pits. Other horizontal caves are characterized by corrosion forms generated into the phreatic zone. In some places, such as in the Rio Preto area, these phreatic forms have been overprinted by ceiling tubes, suggesting a polyphase karst evolution, prior to the draining of the cave. Relicts of passages, with circular cross section up to a metre in diametre, can be found amidst the residual tower-like surface landforms, which constitute a typical scenery in the landscape. Their dissection is due to a generalised karstification in the area, resulting in closed canyons, megakarrens and kamenitzas. In southern Minas Gerais, close to the Mantiqueira Ridge, the caves of the state park of Ibitipoca can extent 2 km in length. These caves are associated with a very large hanging geological syncline. Several of these caves contain active streams, that flow for hundreds of metres before disappearing in sand-choked passages. Keyhole cross sections characterize steeply descending passages in these caves, indicating a change from slow phreatic flow towards a faster vadose flow responsible for the vertical incision of the passage. Such change is probably related to base level lowering and/or to turn {{in the direction of the}} water flow. Several generations of wall-pockets, from a few centimetres to over a metre long, occur into the caves. These features are good indicators of the initial phase of speleogenesis, generating the initial conduits by their coalescence. This mechanism is also responsible for <b>cut-off</b> <b>meanders.</b> The main river in the area, which flows along the syncline axis, cuts through a rock barrier, generating a tunnel-like passage. This cave drains, through resurgences in its walls, part of the water that flows in other caves located in the flank of the syncline. The non-carbonate karst features observed in the state of Minas Gerais demonstrate the complex organisation of polyphase karst systems due to the linkage of underground and surface forms not previously connected. As in carbonate areas, these systems may play an important hydrological role. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Differences in {{the nature}} and {{quantity}} of sediment filling oxbow lakes have significant implications {{for the evolution of}} meandering rivers and the development of floodplains, influencing rates of meander migration and the valley width over which migration takes place. In an effort to identify the controls on the alluviation of oxbow lakes by coarse bed material, this study examined the sedimentary records stored within oxbow lakes of the Sacramento River of California, USA, and found that the volume of gravel in storage correlated negatively with the diversion angle separating flow between the river channel and the entrance into each lake. A method was devised for estimating the original channel bathymetry of the studied lakes and for modelling the hydraulic and sediment-transport effects of the diversion angle within channels recently abandoned by <b>meander</b> <b>cut-off.</b> The diversion angle determines the width of a flow separation within the abandoned-channel entrance, reducing the discharge diverted from the river channel and thus limiting the ability of the abandoned channel to transport bed material. Aggradation rates are faster within entrances to abandoned channels with high diversion angles, resulting in the rapid isolation of lakes that store only a small volume of coarse-grained sediment. Aggradation rates are slower within channel entrances where diversion angles are low, resulting in the slow transitioning of such channels into oxbow lakes with a larger and more extensive accumulation of coarse-grained sediment. These findings compare well with observations in other natural settings and the mechanism which is described for the control of the diversion may explain why some oxbow lakes remain as open-water environments for centuries, whereas others are filled completely within decades of cut-off...|$|R
40|$|Nickpoint {{recession}} in the Buchan karst, southeastern Australia, {{has resulted in the}} formation of an underground <b>meander</b> <b>cut-off</b> system in the Murrindal River valley. Three nickpoints have been stranded in the surface channel abandoned by the subterranean piracy, and these can be correlated with river terraces and epiphreatic cave passages in the nearby Buchan River valley. The presence of palaeomagnetically reversed sediments in the youngest cave passage in the Buchan valley implies that the topographically lowest nickpoint in the Murrindal valley is more than 730 [*]ka old, and the other nickpoints are probably several million years old. The nickpoints are occasionally active during floods, but the diversion of most surface flow underground has slowed down their retreat {{to the extent that they}} have been effectively stationary for several million years. Underground nickpoint migration has been by both incision within major phreatic conduits and their abandonment for lower-level passages. The nickpoints are all present in the upstream part of the cave system, but have not migrated past the sink in the river channel, despite the long period of time available for this to happen. The sink is characterized by collapsed limestone blocks; these filter out the coarse bedload from the river channel. As a result, erosion within the cave passages is dominantly solutional and therefore slower than in the surface channel, where it is mostly mechanical. In addition, to transmit a drop in base level the cave system requires the removal of a larger volume of rock than for the surface migration of a nickpoint, because any roof collapse material in the subsurface system must be removed. These factors have slowed the migration of the base-level changes through the subsurface system, and may be a general feature in caves that have diffuse sinks as their main inputs. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceActively {{incising}} bedrock meanders are an ubiquitous {{feature of}} mountain belts, but the mechanisms leading to their formation and evolution are still poorly understood. As for straight bedrock rivers, {{we expect the}} combination of stochastic discharge, sediment supply and river transport capacity to {{play a key role}} in the partitioning between vertical and lateral incision. But the sinuous planform geometry yields localized high rates of outer bank incision driving localized hillslope mass wasting processes. The resulting deposits may alter patterns of sedimentation and incision leading to a strongly coupled channel-hillslope system. We aim at better understanding this coupling following two approaches : a detailed quantification of channel response to individual floods and mass-wasting events using Terrestrial Laser Scanner surveys and recent historical data; and the integration of this short-term dynamics at longer-timescales through numerical modelling. In particular, we note that many of these rivers exhibits numerous strath terraces abandoned in their inner bend documenting an evolution which is not purely continuous but rather punctuated by rapid changes in the balance between vertical and lateral erosion. Whether these changes can be tied to specific extreme events (floods, landslides, major earthquakes…) or an intrinsic instability is a key question to better understand bedrock meandering dynamics. It also has potentially important implications for the reconstruction of paleo-extremes from dated terraces or for the management of infrastructures located near actively migrating meandering bedrock rivers. This presentation focuses on the use of Terrestrial Laser Scanner to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of bank erosion in the Rangitikei river (New-Zealand) over 3 years. The Rangitikei river is incising weakly consolidated mudstone at an average rate of 5 mm/yr since 15 kyr and has developed a very sinuous meandering pattern with several <b>cut-off</b> bedrock <b>meanders.</b> Lateral undercutting of 100 m high cliffs generates failures of up to hundred of meters. Alluvial material consists of coarse resistant material (D 50 ~ 20 cm) sourced from upstream, and large boulders locally derived from rockfalls. Bedrock exposure is rare on the bed but shows that abrasion, weathering by wetting-drying cycles and plucking are important bank erosion mechanisms. Six TLS surveys were performed at bi-monthly to yearly intervals with a Leica Scanstation 2 in 4 reaches of variable planform curvature. Survey length varies from 300 m to 1200 m and point spacing from 5 mm to 5 cm. We developed field techniques and post-processing tools allowing to detect down to 5 mm change between surveys. These data were augmented by aerial photographs illustrating the decadal dynamics of these rivers, and bathymetric surveys. TLS data show how even cliff failure events of moderate size can significantly alter the pattern of inner and outer bank erosion. We also document complex phases of inner bar deposition and erosion after floods of different magnitude. Overall, these data highlight the importance and episodic nature of the coupling between channel migration and hillslope mass wasting...|$|R
40|$|The Afon Tywi {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic rivers in Wales and sediments stored in its valley floor record a history of erosion, {{deposition}} and flooding dating back to the end of the last glaciation around 16000 years ago. Analysis of floodplain sediments has provided information about how climate and land cover change have affected river behaviour during past millennia. Migration of the Afon Tywi across its floodplain, punctuated by shorter episodes of river down-cutting, has formed a staircase of terraces, the oldest of which probably formed more than 12000 years ago and the most recent in the last 200 years or so. Radiocarbon dating of organic material found in sediments within former river channels indicates that since c. 3000 BC the River Tywi has down-cut by nearly 4 metres and has eroded, swept and sedimented almost its entire valley floor. Periods of rapid river down-cutting and channel straightening at shortly after AD 1220, 1940 BC and 3020 BC would appear to be associated with major floods and climate change. The historical period (c. 1750 to present) has been characterised by renewed channel bed incision and lateral channel migration leading to the development of multiple <b>meander</b> <b>cut-offs.</b> Major changes in river behaviour have influenced human activity and settlement patterns in the Tywi Valley. The history of Late Quaternary valley floor development has significantly influenced the locations where both prehistoric and historical archaeological finds and sites have been preserved. The destruction and replacement of older valley floor sediments as a result of lateral channel migration has undoubtedly led to the loss of archaeological resource in the middle Tywi valley. However, vertical incision and the burial of sites and artefacts on valley floors through the deposition of overbank sediment, although not destroying the archaeological resource has probably significantly reduced the likelihood of discovery of features and artefacts. In spite of this, some of the older terraces preserve remains of occupation dating from as far back as the Bronze Age...|$|R
40|$|International audienceActively {{incising}} and meandering bedrock rivers are an ubiquitous {{feature of}} mountain belts, but the mechanisms leading to their formation and evolution are still poorly understood. Part {{of the problem}} lies in our limited ability to quantify in situ the mechanisms governing the dynamics of straight bedrock rivers (tool-cover effects, stochastic sediment supply and discharge effects, roughness effects, [...] .). But the rapid and spatially variable rates of bank erosion in meanders also lead to potentially more complex hillslope-channel interactions than in straight river. Terrestrial laser scanner {{has the potential to}} shed new light on these interactions and to capture over large surfaces the impact of individual flood and landsliding events. Given the small changes of surface position that must be detected for even the largest rates of bedrock erosion (5 - 10 mm/yr) and the 3 D geometrical complexity of bedrock meanders, specific survey approaches and post-processing algorithms must be developed. To this end, we started to perform repeated Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) surveys of actively incising meanders in the Rangitikei river (New-Zealand) in 2009. The Rangitikei river is incising weakly consolidated mudstone at an average rate of 5 mm/yr since 15 kyr and has developed a very sinuous meandering pattern with several <b>cut-off</b> bedrock <b>meanders.</b> Lateral undercutting of 100 m high cliffs generates failures of up to hundred of meters. Alluvial material consists of coarse resistant material (D 50 20 cm) sourced from upstream, and large boulders locally derived from rockfalls. Exposed bedrock is rare on the bed but shows that abrasion, weathering by wetting-drying cycles and plucking are important incision mechanisms. Six TLS surveys were performed at bi-monthly to yearly intervals with a Leica Scanstation 2 in 5 reaches of variable planform curvature. Survey length varies from 300 m to 1200 m and point spacing from 5 mm to 5 cm. Point clouds were co-registered between surveys with a combination of rock-anchored targets and cloud matching leading to an uncertainty down to 3 mm in the best cases. In many cases, rock anchored targets offered a better registration than cloud matching owing to significant surface roughness. Bathymetric measurements completed the surveys under water, and bedload impact logger were installed to document threshold of sediment transport. Raw point clouds were automatically processed to classify vegetation, intact bedrock surfaces, landslide deposits and gravels with the CANUPO free software (Brodu and Lague, in press). We developed a new algorithm to compute 3 D surface change directly on raw point clouds without a mandatory meshing or gridding phase. It combines large scale calculations for normal estimation and orientation, with small scale surface change measurement. An explicit treatment of surface roughness and registration quality allows to define a local uncertainty at each calculation point.

As reported, many of the water-related elements represented by the map and described in this paper, are suitable to be natural and cultural heritages. The abandoned meander of Pettorazza Grimani and the artificial cutting of Adigetto Canal, that are well represented by the Valle map, are described this way. The Volta Pettorazza artificial <b>meander</b> <b>cut-off</b> is a main example of the cut-offs made along the lower course of the Adige River by the Venice Republic in the eighteenth century. This palaeohydrographic element is of great interest not only geomorphological and geo-historical but also educational. The artificial cutting of Adigetto Canal (1760), included in the broader agenda of river management of the Serenissima Republic, is related to the formation of the Lezze little Lake (Gorgo), already subject of valorization attempt. In this case, a map such as that of Valle (1801), that represents a “diachronic picture” of the territory, could be used to explain, even to a non-specialist public, the “man-water” dynamics of the Venetian government...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the lower course and estuary of the river Ribble (Lancashire, U. K.) during the Holocene {{is the object of}} study, along with the history of sediment fluxes in them and their influence on past human settlements. Investigation of the valley floor geomorphology and terrace fill stratigraphy and sedimentology, as well as palaeoecological analysis and a number of 14 C essays, allowed the reconstruction of Late Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial history and chronology of a reach at the transition point between fluvial and estuarine influences; the archaeological evidence is evaluated in this context. Alluviation and incision cycles {{led to the formation of}} four river terraces. The oldest terrace, rich in coarse-grained materials, seems to be of Pleistocene age. 14 C dating on the second terrace would point to an Earliest Holocene or Younger Dryas age; the fill, however, comprises abundant fine-grained overbank sediments. Large parts of the unit were reworked during a phase of lateral channel activity that occurred prior to ca. 8900 cal BP; between then and ca. 6900 cal BP the river underwent <b>meander</b> <b>cut-offs,</b> after which limited lateral activity occurred. New alluviation occurred around 4700 cal BP, possibly related to the aggradation of the third terrace, though its fill is only certainly known, from archaeological evidence, to be of pre-Roman age. Channel size increase occurred by the time the terrace was deposited. The fill features abundant clayey sediments; it was incised at or after the end of the Roman period. The last terrace was deposited in the late first millennium AD mainly as overbank silts, and has since been incised again. Fluvial response appears mainly related to climate changes, river activity corresponding to shifts to wetter, cooler climate. Human action likely enhanced fluvial response in the historical period, leading to post-Roman incision and deposition. There seems to be a good connection between sediment production in the catchment and deposition downstream. Local factors also show a major importance in determining river response. Early Holocene fluvial history finds no match in other Northern English rivers; a different response to the same climate changes is apparent, possibly related to differences in sediment supply conditions. No clear evidence is found supporting an influence of sea-level change on river processes. On the other hand, it appears plausible river sediment input has a driving influence in enhancing or causing minor regressions recorded on the estuary. The conditions existing in Roman times could have allowed access from the sea to the Roman sites at the upper end of the Ribble estuary and by its North shore; a relative sea-level minimum could have caused a shift of focus in naval traffic from the former to the latter site.

Spontaneous succession, as {{a method}} to restore degraded riverine habitats, was assessed for three different components of the Silvermine River ecosystem over one year. These were {{the state of the}} physical habitats (biotopes) available to aquatic organisms, changes in the community composition of riparian vegetation, and changes to aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages present in the river. Data were collected during two successive summer-sampling periods (200 I and 2002) at three study sites along the river. Site I was situated in the mountain stream zone, while Sites 2 and 3 were situated in the foothills. Changes in the riverine ecosystem and its associated habitats were compared to reference condition data {{for each of the three}} components from each study site. There were no large changes to the macro-channel banks of the river over the one year study, other than where a <b>meander</b> <b>cut-off</b> occurred at Site 2. Changes over the year in the proportions of flow at the three sites revealed a lack of faster-flow types, which would normally characterise mountain stream and foothill reaches, at all three study sites. Measurements of the proportions of substratum types at the three sites revealed there was an unusually high proportion of fine substratum types present. In the foothills, this was attributed to erosion of the unstable bank at Site 2, which continued to deposit an excess of fine sediment that was transported downstream. In the vegetation study, most species that came to dominate the mountain stream (Site I) and the foothill (Sites 2 and 3) riparian communities emerged from the seed bank within the first two years after the fire. Thus, using the presence or absence of characteristic riparian vegetation species it is possible to determine whether there is a need to augment the recovery process after two years. The aquatic macroinvertebrate communities of the mountain stream differed clearly from those in the foothill. The differences were attributed to a combination of the channel type and the longitudinal position of the sites along the river, both of which dictated the physical habitats available. There were clear differences in the potential for recovery at each of the three study sites. It was shown that non-intervention will not support successful recovery in the short to medium term for any of the measured three components of this river. A blanket policy of non-intervention cannot address site-specific differences, be they natural or artificial, which pose different challenges to restoration. There were zonal differences in the availability of substrata and flow types. There were also other differences that were attributed to water abstraction and the presence of different woody exotic trees. Recovery of the mountain stream was being hampered by the presence of the reservoir and the history of water abstraction while recovery of the foothill was being retarded by erosion from the massive sediment deposit at Site 2. Plans to restore the river, that took into account these inter-site differences, were proposed...|$|R
40|$|On 3 August 1829, {{north-east}} Scotland recorded one of {{the most}} severe catastrophic floods in modern UK history. Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's An account of the great floods of August 1829 in the province of Moray and adjoining districts (1830) provides a detailed eyewitness account {{that can be used to}} reconstruct the flood. This paper reconstructs the hydrometeorology of the flood, assesses its geomorphological and societal impacts and provides a context for assessing present-day flood risk management. The flood was generated by a slow-moving depression in the Moray Firth, which produced an unstable northerly airflow over the NE Grampian Mountains and a minimum 24 hour rainfall of 95 mm. The River Findhorn, {{one of the}} most severely affected drainage basins, was subject to detailed analysis by Lauder, including the reporting of numerous flood levels on bridges and within bedrock gorges. Reconstruction of flood flows at five of these sites using Manning's equation and moving successively downstream yields peak flows of 711 m 3 /s (drainage area 322. 2 km 2), 1042 m 3 /s (515. 4 km 2), 1262 m 3 /s (568. 1 km 2) and 1484 m 3 /s (599. 6 km 2) on the main stem of the Findhorn, with 451 m 3 /s (171. 9 km 2) on a major tributary. Each peak flow based on a Manning's n of 0. 04 – 0. 08 represents the optimal value within limits which vary between − 25 % to + 33 % and all lie just within the upper boundary when plotted in relation to the envelope curve for catastrophic floods within the UK. Lauder also provides a detailed account of the geomorphic impacts of the flood in the Findhorn valley. Bedrock reaches and ‘mixed’ alluvial/bedrock-controlled reaches proved to be robust and registered minimal change, but alluvial reaches reported widespread bank erosion and slope failures with extensive sheets of sand and gravel deposited downstream on valuable agricultural land. <b>Meander</b> <b>cut-offs</b> occurred and many new channels were excavated, especially in the coastal lowlands where the present-day channel broadly follows that excavated in 1829, attesting to the longevity of the flood's impacts. The immediate societal impact included eight fatalities, destitution for at least 289 families, large-scale destruction of roads and bridges, losses for estate owners approaching £ 2. 83 million (2005 prices) and a major shock to a relatively prosperous rural economy. Human response and mitigation took the form of fatalistic acceptance, bearing the loss and dependence on local charitable relief. The reconstruction of the 1829 ‘Muckle Spate’ has a significance far beyond its immediate setting in terms of hydrology (confirming the shape of the envelope curve for Britain's most extreme floods), geomorphology (reporting significant and long-lasting imprints on the riverscape, and confirming the primacy of water-based erosion early in the nineteenth century) and societal impact (contrasting individual bearing of loss mitigated by charitable relief with the present-day reliance on flood protection largely provided by the state). The reconstruction also demonstrates the value of reliable historical sources in placing recent catastrophic floods within their longer-term context...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the morphological {{changes of the}} River Panaro from the 19 th century to date and provides the relationships between human activity and stream geomorphology. The {{studies were carried out}} using historical documents and maps, aerial and satellite imagery taken on various dates, digital treatment of maps and orthophotographs and field surveys. The River Panaro has a catchment basin of 1, 784 km 2 and collects waters from the central section of the Northern Apennines. It starts from the confluence of the Scoltenna and Leo torrents and flows down through Modena Apennines for some 63 km. It then makes its way across the Po Plain for 85 km until it joins the River Po. In the Po Plain it flows across two distinct sectors with different morphological characteristics: in the upper sector the river runs deep in the alluvial plain, whereas in the mid-lower part it is elevated above the level of the plain, contained within artificial embankments. In the Panaro valley, from the 1930 s to the 1950 s, the river showed a braided pattern which occupied almost the entire flat valley floor. Important changes occurred later, due to the downcutting and narrowing of the active channel, which have continued until the present day. In {{the upper part of the}} plain., the river occupied a large depression with a braided riverbed at the beginning of the 19 th century. In the following periods there was an increase of human interventions along the river (construction of embankments, walls and groynes), in order to reclaim surrounding areas from flooding and turn highwater beds into farming land. This led to narrowing in several stretches of the riverbed, although it still maintained a braided pattern until the 1930 s. Subsequently, after the 1950 s, the braided pattern became canalised and deepened and the shape of the longitudinal profile changed from a hyperbola-type curve to a step-type one. The channel changes in the Apennines and in the upper part of the plain were mainly due to gravel excavation along the riverbed. Quarrying activities stopped after a law was passed in the early 1980 s and, at the same time, fluvial barrages were constructed. On the whole, these hydraulic works reduced the bed load, increasing water erosion power downstream. As a result, the deepening process has continued and a new terrace level has formed in the past 30 years. Channel adjustments have led to the change from a braided channel pattern to a transitional one. In the mid-lower part of the plain, the river length has been reduced by 10 - 11 km (which corresponds to about 13 % of its length in this plain sector) by artificial <b>meander</b> <b>cut-offs</b> carried out since the 19 th century to reduce flood hazard. In this way, along long stretches of its course, the River Panaro has assumed the aspect of an artificial watercourse. Since the cut-offs did not adequately reduce flood hazard, “flow regulation systems” were constructed in the area east of Modena. It can therefore be stated that the morphology and evolution trend of the River Panaro have been conditioned by direct and indirect human activities over the past two centuries, especially after the 1950 s, and that its evolution is similar to what has been recorded in other Italian rivers...|$|R
