50|$|A harness is {{commonly}} worn {{in conjunction with}} a collar and used as an alternative for leash attachment. While a collar only encircles the neck, harnesses have a loop that surrounds the torso as well, with <b>connecting</b> <b>straps</b> between them for reinforcement. This design allows for distribution of force which may prevent choking and a lower chance of slipping out than may be possible with only a collar. Harness usage is growing in popularity among many pet owners- especially for those with smaller breed dogs. Recently, pet clothing frequently sports a properly-placed buttonhole for hooking a leash to the harness worn under the garment.|$|E
40|$|A {{battery testing}} device is {{described}} for testing {{the cells of}} a multiple-cell battery, the battery having a cover plate with access holes {{to provide access to}} the <b>connecting</b> <b>straps</b> between cells. A panel of probe assembly receiving holes is located to correspond to the location of the access holes when the panel is positioned on top of the battery. A probe assembly is positioned within each probe assembly receiving hole, with a spring biased electrically conductive plunger to make electrical contact with the connecting strap through the corresponding access hole when the panel is pushed towards the top of the battery...|$|E

2500|$|The Air Force 1 (or AF1 or AF-1) was {{originally}} called simply the Air Force. The {{name is a}} reference to Air Force One, the plane that carries the President of the United States. The shoes are sold in three different styles, low, mid and high. The mid comes with a <b>connected</b> <b>strap.</b> The high-top Air Force 1s come with a velcro-securable strap; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high-top's strap is movable and removable on some versions. Although the shoe comes in different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1s sold are solid white (also referred to as [...] "white on white"), {{the second most common}} being solid black ("black on black").|$|R
50|$|The Goodnight western sidesaddle {{that was}} {{developed}} in the 1870s by Charles Goodnight for his wife was a double rigged design. Goodnight developed this sidesaddle because there was a need to produce a woman's saddle for daily riding and work on the range. The saddle also had to fit a variety of horses on a day-to-day basis. it required two cinches. The cinches have a <b>connecting</b> <b>strap,</b> called a cinch hobble, to keep the rear girth from slipping back, which would cause the horse to buck. The girthing system still produced a shimmy in the rear, even though the rear cinch was brought up snugly against the horse. The double girthing system was not as secure as the balance strap seen on many modern sidesaddles.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{proprietary}} systems {{that seek to}} combine the convenience of step-in systems with the control levels attainable with strap-ins. An example is the Flow binding system, {{which is similar to}} a strap-in binding, except that the foot enters the binding through the back. [...] The back flips down and allows the boot to slide in; it's then flipped up and locked into place with a clamp, eliminating the need to loosen and then re-tighten straps every time the rider frees and then re-secures their rear foot. The rider's boot is held down by an adjustable webbing that covers most of the foot. Newer Flow models have <b>connected</b> <b>straps</b> in place of the webbing found on older models; these straps are also micro adjustable. In 2004, K2 released the Cinch series, a similar rear-entry binding; riders slip their foot in as they would a Flow binding, however rather than webbing, the foot is held down by straps.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel <b>straps</b> <b>connecting</b> the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|R
25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of the appliance to be indirectly grounded via a <b>strap</b> <b>connecting</b> to the neutral blade. Safe operation relied on the neutral conductor in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit breaker or fuse box. If the neutral conductor were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, the appliance frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety grounding conductor whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|R
5000|$|A T-top {{is a type}} of top for {{center console}} boats that is built with a [...] "T" [...] shaped {{structure}} when viewed from the side. The top is tall enough to stand under, and provides shade and rain protection for 2 or more passengers at the boat's helm. The T-Top is distinguished from other boat tops in that the entire structure is attached to the center console area, with no support brackets or <b>straps</b> <b>connected</b> to the outside of the boat, thereby providing 360-degree access around the boat for fishing and water activities.|$|R
50|$|Torture and humiliation, or dedovshchina, {{are also}} {{widespread}} in Russian's military, according to Human Rights Watch. This {{is essentially the}} Russian version of bullying or hazing that is practiced in the American military, however it is often much more brutal. Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of it. Amnesty International reported on allegations of Chechen locals, that Russian military forces in Chechnya rape and torture local women with electric shocks, when electric wires are <b>connected</b> to the <b>straps</b> of their bra on their chest.|$|R
5000|$|One boot {{designed}} {{to use the}} GSB system was the (now discontinued) Scarpa Mirage GTX, a Gore-Tex lined 3-4 season mountaineering boot. A recess {{was created in the}} front of the sole unit which could accept a specially designed peg on the Grivel AirTech GSB [...] crampon. This crampon did away with the plastic toe covering commonly found on C1 and C2 crampons, and the <b>strap</b> <b>connecting</b> it. This left users with only an ankle strap to do up, with the aim being to make the crampon lighter and easier to put on the boot.|$|R

5000|$|Shoulder {{holsters}} {{consist of}} two <b>straps</b> <b>connected</b> {{in a manner}} similar to a backpack, with the actual holster mounted to a strap on the right or the left side. Shoulder holsters are designed to position the handgun in one of three ways: a vertical position with the barrel pointed generally toward the ground, a vertical position with the barrel pointed generally upward, or a horizontal position with the barrel pointed generally behind the wearer. Shoulder holsters are typically comfortable for the wearer, as they distribute the weight across the shoulders instead of directly on the belt.|$|R
25|$|Martingales {{are very}} common, {{especially}} on horses {{used at the}} Grand Prix level. The majority of jumpers are ridden in running martingales since these provide the most freedom over fences. Although a standing martingale (a <b>strap</b> <b>connecting</b> directly to the horse's noseband) is commonly seen on show hunters and may be helpful in keeping a horse from throwing its head up, it also may be quite dangerous {{in the event of}} a stumble, restricting a horse from using its head to regain its balance. For this reason, standing martingales are not used in show jumping or eventing. Breastplates also are common, used to keep the saddle in place as the horse goes over large fences.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} models of helmets designed to hold the drivers head in place. A helmet restraint is equipped in some five-point harness seats to prevent brain and neck injury. For example, in NASCAR, it protects the driver {{in case of a}} car crash or an immediate change of velocity where the driver has limited control of his momentum. The apparatus consists of a strap that runs from both of the sides of the helmet to the vehicle; or a <b>strap</b> <b>connected</b> to the vehicle {{from both sides of the}} driver that runs across the front of the helmet, instead of two independent straps on each side attached to the helmet.|$|R
50|$|Pacing races {{constitute}} 80% to 90% of {{the harness}} races conducted in North America. Pacing horses are faster and (most {{important to the}} bettor) less likely to break stride (a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing). One of the reasons pacers {{are less likely to}} break stride is that they often wear hobbles (<b>straps</b> <b>connecting</b> the legs on each of the horse's sides). The belief that hobbles are used to create this gait is a common misunderstanding. The pace is a natural gait for many horses, and hobbles are an aid in supporting the gait at top speed; trotting hobbles (which employ a different design, due to the difference in the gait) are becoming increasingly popular for the same reason.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, she started an {{on-screen}} relationship with Benoit, {{who at the}} time was involved in a feud with her real-life husband, Kevin Sullivan. On December 7, on WCW Saturday Night, during a post-match interview with Sullivan, a home movie of the couple canoodling in a kitchen was played in front of him. Woman taunted Sullivan by saying, [...] "You can't find me" [...] and [...] "I'm my own woman," [...] while Benoit added: [...] "You consider yourself the master of human chess. Well, my bishop just took your queen". After the video, Sullivan stood there speechless, and his manager Jimmy Hart led him off stage. This feud between Benoit and Sullivan saw Woman clashing with Sullivan's then-valet Jacquelyn at ringside. In one match, the two ladies were strapped together, took shots at each other, and used the <b>strap</b> <b>connecting</b> them as a weapon against the men.|$|R
