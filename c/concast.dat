40|$|<b>Concast</b> {{is a new}} network service, the “dual ” of multicast. With <b>concast,</b> {{messages}} from different senders addressed to the same receiver are merged by the network into a single message for delivery to that receiver.

40|$|The {{next step}} in the {{evolution}} of active networks — one that will support radical new uses of the network and increased scalability — is packaging the power of a programmable network platform into customizable active services that are easy for applications to use. The Activecast project has been developing and evaluating a set of active services that will not only enhance the “applicationfriendliness” of active networks, but will also improve the scalability and usability of networks in general. This paper discusses the challanges of programming active networks and then presents four new active network services, PAMcast, <b>Concast,</b> ESP, and LWP, that simplify the task of programming active networks. PAMcast services allow messages to be sent to any node(s) satisfying a set of user-supplied selection criteria.

This paper shows how <b>concast,</b> a network-layer aggregation service, can be used in conjunction with a standard (unmodified) TCP implementation to support reliable multicast while avoiding ACK implosion and offloading ACK processing.

40|$|Abstract—In data aggregation, {{multiple}} source nodes send their data to a sink along a <b>concast</b> tree with aggregation done en route {{so that the}} sink can obtain the aggregate (which could be the sum, average, etc.) of all these data. End-to-end privacy and aggregate integrity are the two main goals of secure data aggregation. While the privacy goal has been widely studied, providing end-to-end aggregate integrity {{in the presence of}} possibly compromised aggregating nodes remains largely an open problem. Message Authentication Codes (MAC) are commonly used to provide end-to-end data integrity in two party settings. Natural extensions of MAC for the data aggregation scenario are considered.

Example uses of such a service include peer-to-peer applications that want to group machines that are “near ” each other, and reliable multicast services that need to assign receivers to repair groups. Our generic grouping framework relies on concast’s many-to-one transport service to efficiently collect and apply the applicationspecific grouping criteria to the group members ’ information, and it relies on single-source multicast (i. e., one-to-many communication) to distribute the results to the nodes being grouped. The service can easily be customized to meet the grouping requirements of the application.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{distributed}} applications which require a reliable multicast service, we could point out among others the following ones: whiteboards, distributed interactive simulation, distributed data base systems and software distri-bution. The majority of solutions given {{in order to}} provide reliable multicast service consist on extending to the multicast environment the solutions used in the unicast environment, this is, to use end-to-end protocols. Most end-to-end proto-cols have problems of scalability, performing poorly in terms of throughput, network resources and distribution mean delay. In large internets transit delay and loss probability increase, making end-to-end protocols not suitable. For large multicast groups sender-based protocols cannot be used, and as loss probability increases with the size of the group, receiver-based protocols cannot be used either. In this paper we present a novel reliable multicast protocol that follows a network-based approach to avoid the problems of end-to-end protocols. RMNP (Reliable Multicast Network Protocol) provides a reliable multicast service on top of an unreliable multicast datagram service. Our proposal is based on recovering lost packets from intermediate routers which are always closer to the member(s) than the source. This has two important consequences, distribution mean delay and retransmission overhead are reduced. Furthermore, the network-based approach of RMNP allows that the routers perform an aggregation of <b>concast</b> packets, mainly acknowledgments, that flow from the members towards the source. Because of this, large groups are better supported by saving bandwidth and avoiding the implosion problems found on sender-approach protocols...|$|E

The numerical solution of the respective models for mass, energy, momentum ans species transfer on the macroscopic and on the microscopic scales are based on the recently developed meshless technology. The options of simulation system, which enable the technologist automatic setup of process parameters, are described. The regulation coefficients were calculated based on this simulation system and installed into the casting machine control system. Regulation coefficients are used for compensation of the changes of process parameters that are difficult to control (casting temperature, temperature of cooling water, heat transfer in the mold) with the easily controlled parameters (coolant water flow, casting speed) in such way that the surface temperature and liquid pool depth remain invariant.

For this reason, the initial disadvantage can become an opportunity for the traditional dairy systems. This study was conducted on 473 dairy farms of the Trento province with the aim to verify the effect of farm management (environment) on the variability of the milk yield and quality due to the breed effect (genotype). In particular, the differences between breeds were estimated in mixed farms with different management and feeding strategies. For each farm we collected the following data: number of cow per breed, housing condition (free vs tie stalls), diet administration (Total Mixed Rations vs separate feeding) and quality (percentage of starch, NDF and Crude Protein). Milk production and quality data were collected from test day recording and Consortium of Cooperative Dairies of the Trento Province (<b>CONCAST),</b> for a total of 110, 711 milk analysis. A multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the genetic contribution corrected for the structural and nutritional sources of variation. At national level, Brown Swiss (BS), Italian Simmental (IS) and two northeastern autochthonous breeds (Rendena – Re – and Alpine Grey – AG) produce much less milk than Italian Friesian (IF) : - 23. 4 %, - 28. 5 %, - 45. 1 % and - 45. 3 %, respectively. These differences reflect both genetic and environmental effects on milk production. The estimates obtained in mixed breed farms of Trento Province, after having taken into account the main structural (herd size, housing condition) and nutritional (TMR, use of silages, NDF%, CP%) sources of variation, shows further lower differences among breeds (BS - 13. 0 %, IS - 13. 4 %, Re - 30. 6 % and AG - 30. 7 %, respect to IF), that reflect more the genetic contribution to phenotype. Taking into account the milk composition, the differences among breeds in terms of daily fat + protein yield (BS - 6. 7 %, IS - 10. 7 %, Re - 33. 4 %, and AG - 29. 9 %, respect to IF) are even smaller than for milk yield. In conclusion, farm management significantly affects milk yield and quality in mountainous dairy farms and it can strongly reduce the estimates of the differences among the breed of cows...|$|E
