Considering the analyses and forecasts available before enlargement, it presents the real consequences of the process, as well as challenges the EU has faced after the accession of new members from East-Central Europe. The article analyses the most important consequences, including problems in the area of decision-making and management in the EU, social consequences of the enlargement, as well as the effect of the accession of East-Central European members on the international position of the EU. Considering the opportunities, chances, and dangers of the Eastern enlargement for the future of European integration, the article seeks to address the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>globality</b> in its regional European context...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays-world {{is under}} {{the sign of the}} triadic <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>globality,</b> {{globalization}} and postmodernity. While the first concept refers to an entire system of socio-political and ethical-theoretical relations, which, in their dynamism, lead to the appearance of new knowledge, globalization is the practical phenomenon of manifestation of the relations inside the globaliy, aiming for the economic and utilitarian domain. The domain of the practical globalization is moved by the mechanism of the new informatics technological revolutions, stimulating the production and the consumption, by cohabitating in its civilizational demarche, questioning al the former historical stages, through the encouragement of the perfidious triad of Profit, Consumption and Entertainment a show. In this context, the world tends to shape as a global universal village (Marshall McLuhan), continuously celebrating, in a climate of moral and metaphysical incertitude, with a flatten and flattening consciousness, not interested, even abandoning, in the spiritual values, proposing and launching in the first rows only the utilitarian-values (Dumitru Popescu, 2005). We discuss in the present study this real utopia of horrors (Joseph Ratzinger, 2005), with continuously moving ideas, where the most radical and profound mutation is on the ontological level, the man and the religion being reduced in a nihilist manner to the stage of object merchandise value...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on French {{anthropologist}} Marc Augé and his seminal book Non-Places (1995) {{the author}} {{pays attention to}} the transformation of contemporary urban landscapes. In thinking trough the dialectic of place and non-place, this paper aims {{to account for the}} apparent sense of placelesness in our cultural landscapes and in increasingly globalised world. If we want to ask fundamental questions about what has happened to our urban landscape and to the spirit of cities during the last decades then the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> place and non-place help us to describe the actual changes. Besides, Augé’s work gives us the methodological tools to address philosophical questions about the nature of supermodernity and the relationship between modernity and postmodernity moving toward new conditions <b>of</b> <b>globality.</b> This article will attempt to apply anthropological and philosophical <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> place and space to the context of Lithuania, comparing the ways of spreading of non-places (non-lieu) in the Soviet modernity and contemporary global, hyper-visual and liquid cultural landscape...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{the traditions of the}} social {{sciences}} are struggling to understand global change. It offers a critique of attempts to bring historical sociology into international relations, which has resulted in the import of a tradition that has been focused on earlier modern transformations, and underestimates global change. At the same time, it argues that conceptions <b>of</b> <b>globality</b> in international relations have understated the transformation of state relations and forms in the modern world. The paper argues that we need a historical‐sociological conception of the political changes that constitute the core <b>of</b> <b>globality.</b> It attempts to supply a key element of this by examining global politics as the product of struggle between a globalised democratic revolution and authoritarian counter‐revolution, leading to genocidal wars.

40|$|Let T be an {{underlying}} {{space with a}} non-atomic measure σ on it. In [Comm. Math. Phys. 292 (2009), 99 [...] 129] the Meixner class of non-commutative generalized stochastic processes with freely independent values, ω=(ω(t)) _t∈ T, was characterized through {{the continuity of the}} corresponding orthogonal polynomials. In this paper, we derive a generating function for these orthogonal polynomials. The first question we have to answer is: What should serve as a generating function for a system of polynomials of infinitely many non-commuting variables? We construct a class of operator-valued functions Z=(Z(t)) _t∈ T such that Z(t) commutes with ω(s) for any s,t∈ T. Then a generating function can be understood as G(Z,ω) =∑_n= 0 ^∞∫_T^nP^(n) (ω(t_ 1), [...] .,ω(t_n)) Z(t_ 1) [...] . Z(t_n) σ(dt_ 1) [...] . σ(dt_n), where P^(n) (ω(t_ 1), [...] .,ω(t_n)) is (the kernel of the) n-th orthogonal polynomial. We derive an explicit form of G(Z,ω), which has a resolvent form and resembles the generating function in the classical case, albeit it involves integrals of non-commuting operators. We finally discuss a related problem of the action of the annihilation operators ∂_t, t∈ T. In contrast to the classical case, we prove that the operators _t related to the free Gaussian and Poisson processes have a property <b>of</b> <b>globality.</b> This result is genuinely infinite-dimensional, since in one dimension one loses the notion <b>of</b> <b>globality...</b>|$|R
40|$|Upon {{the dawn}} of postmodernity, in the twenty-first century, we witness the {{emergence}} of a new way of thinking and of new forms of culture and life, under the ideology of globalism, whose dominance is given by the practicality and utility related to civilization, and under globality, which is the cultural aspect of globalization, pertaining to the field of culture. The two dimensions <b>of</b> globalization and <b>globality,</b> civilizational and cultural, will (re) question the principle relationship between Christianity and the new postmodern globalizing utopia, requiring to (re) consider the sense and presence of Christianity within the world, and the appropriate sociological figure of the Church, within the new reality of global and globalized humanity, in the postmodern public space.

40|$|Africa Big Change Big Chance is an {{exhibition}} of Africa’s architecture and the transformations taking place on the continent. Changes involve the control of large numbers and show huge shifts of people, pressures brought to bear by urbanization, the inappropriate use {{of natural resources and}} territories.

The continent will be the theatre of a new modernity, where a different global and cosmopolitan culture may be developed. The huge change in Africa’s physical environment shows the traces – some problematic – of new infrastructure, the impact of large dams, and solar and wind power plants.
