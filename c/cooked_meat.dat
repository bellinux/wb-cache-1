The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and <b>cooked</b> <b>meat.</b> There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E

25|$|Some animal products, {{including}} liver, Muktuk (whale skin), oysters, {{and parts}} of the central nervous system, including the adrenal medulla, brain, and spinal cord, contain large amounts of vitamin C, and can even be used to treat scurvy. Fresh meat from animals which make their own vitamin C (which most animals do) contains enough vitamin C to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. In some cases (notably French soldiers eating fresh horse meat), it was discovered that meat alone, even partly <b>cooked</b> <b>meat,</b> could alleviate scurvy. Conversely, in other cases, a meat-only diet could cause scurvy.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of raw feeding {{believe that}} the natural diet of raw meat, bones, and organs is nutritionally {{superior}} to <b>cooked</b> <b>meat</b> and commercial pet food. They argue that a careful plan of a raw diet gives the animal numerous health benefits, including a healthier coat and cleaner teeth and elimination of bad breath. Critics of raw feeding assert {{that the risk of}} nutritional imbalance, intestinal perforations and foodborne illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meat and bones outweigh any benefits. The assertion that raw feeding is inherently better because it is natural has also been criticized by proponents of commercial pet foods.|$|E

40|$|Samples (n = 340) of Irish {{meat and}} meat {{products}} were examined {{to determine the}} incidence and initial numbers of Yersinia spp. present. In cases where no typical Yersinia colonies were observed, samples were cold enriched up to 21 days at 4 degrees C and streaked out on CIN agar with and without post-enrichment alkali treatment. The highest isolation rates of Yersinia were found using post-enrichment alkali treatment and an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C. All Yersinia isolates were identified to species level and Y. enterocolitica isolates were biotyped and serotyped. Pathogenic isolates (biotypes 1 B- 5) were examined {{for the presence of}} a virulence plasmid using dye binding reactions and agglutination tests. The incidence of Yersinia spp. was high on raw (89 %) and <b>cooked</b> <b>meats</b> (49 %) obtained from delicatessen counters but lower in pre-packaged <b>cooked</b> <b>meats</b> (18. 8 %).

25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked {{at the center of}} the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. The <b>cooked</b> <b>meat</b> is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui.|$|E
25|$|The function, is the {{gathering}} of neighbors, family and friends for a ritualized meal that includes invited guests of the principal who took on a promise to the Holy Spirit. The meal consists of the Holy Spirit Soup, a meat broth that is applied to buttered bread and tempered with mint leaves, either accompanied with the <b>cooked</b> <b>meat</b> used in its preparation, Portuguese sweet bread and sweet rice puree sprinkled with cinnamon. There are many variations on the meat broth recipe that includes the methods of preparing the soup, the availability of side dishes or {{the consistency of the}} soup. On the island of Terceira, for example, the Holy Spirit Soup is accompanied by an alcatra, a plate of meat cooked in red wine in an earthen pot. The functionsymbolizes community sharing, and occurs {{in the presence of the}} crowns and flag, accompanied by hymns to the Holy Spirit, normally led by the Foliões.|$|E
25|$|The high {{production}} and consumption of beef cattle in the United States made the meat industry increasingly powerful {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Corruption problems soon arose in the meat industry, problems that endangered both quality and hygiene. At the beginning of the 20th century, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, a novel about conspiracies and corruption in the American meat industry, intended as a veiled criticism of the industry itself. The book raised popular awareness about the safety of meat processing and helped lead to the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which was sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration. The Jungle was a milestone in the subsequent history of the hamburger, as it led the American public to force restaurant chains to prove the safety of their <b>cooked</b> <b>meat.</b> In 1933, Arthur Kallett published a similar book, entitled 100 million guinea pigs; Dangers in Everyday foods, drugs, and cosmetics, which warned consumers specifically about the content preservatives in hamburgers.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} antiscorbutic {{substance}} was identified, there were indications {{that it was}} present in amounts sufficient to prevent scurvy in nearly all fresh (uncooked and uncured) foods, including raw animal-derived foods. In 1928, the Arctic anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson attempted to prove his theory of how the Inuit are able to avoid scurvy with almost no plant food in their diet despite the disease's striking European Arctic explorers living on similar high cooked-meat diets. Stefansson theorised that the natives get their vitamin C from fresh meat that is minimally cooked. Starting in February 1928, for one year, he and a colleague lived on an exclusively minimally <b>cooked</b> <b>meat</b> diet while under medical supervision; they remained healthy. Later studies done after vitamin C could be quantified in mostly raw traditional food diets of the Yukon First Nations, Dene, Inuit, and Métis of Northern Canada showed that their daily intake of vitamin C averaged between 52 and 62mg/day, an amount of approximately the dietary reference intake (DRI), even at {{times of the year}} when little plant-based food was eaten.|$|E
500|$|Shawarma, (from çevirme, meaning [...] "{{rotating}}" [...] in Turkish) {{is usually}} made in Israel with turkey, with lamb fat added.

500|$|When {{an animal}} is ritually {{slaughtered}} (shechted) the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and salted, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out {{the blood that}} lodges on the inner surface of the meat. Salting is made with any coarse grain of salt, while the meat is laid over a grating or colander to allow for drainage, and where the salt is allowed {{to remain on the}} meat for the duration of time that it takes to walk one biblical mile (appx. 18– 24 minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat <b>cooked.</b> <b>Meat</b> that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood.|$|E
500|$|In {{the preface}} to the book, Villas states that vegetarians {{and those that do}} not eat pork for {{religious}} reasons are [...] "haunted instinctively by the sensuous, irresistible enticement".

[...] Villas asks, [...] "Who, under any circumstances, is not rendered almost helpless by the tantalizing sound of bacon sizzling slowly in a skillet, by the taunting backwoods aroma that permeates the air ...?" [...] He notes that [...] "the greatest and most beloved food on earth" [...] is one of the worlds oldest forms of <b>cooked</b> <b>meat.</b> The author comments on the surge in interest in bacon products in the years prior to the book's publication, [...] "Just the 40 percent increase in bacon consumption in the United States {{over the past five years}} might have justified my writing this book."
