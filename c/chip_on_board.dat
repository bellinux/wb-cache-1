40|$|The Big Viterbi Decoder (BVD) is a {{powerful}} error-correcting hardware device for the Deep Space Network (DSN), {{in support of the}} Galileo and Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) /Cassini Missions. Recently, a prototype was completed and run successfully at 400, 000 or more decoded bits per second. This prototype is a complex digital system whose core arithmetic unit consists of 256 identical very large scale integration (VLSI) gate-array <b>chips,</b> 16 <b>on</b> each of 16 identical boards which are connected through a 28 -layer, printed-circuit backplane using 4416 wires. Special techniques were developed for debugging, testing, and locating faults inside individual <b>chips,</b> <b>on</b> <b>boards,</b> and within the entire decoder. The methods are based upon hierarchical structure in the decoder, and require that chips or boards be wired themselves as Viterbi decoders. The basic procedure consists of sending a small set of known, very noisy channel symbols through a decoder, and matching observables against values computed by a software simulation. Also, tests were devised for finding open and short-circuited wires which connect VLSI <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> the <b>boards</b> and through the backplane...|$|R

40|$|Environmental stress tests, or {{accelerated}} life tests, apply stresses {{to electronic}} packages that exceed the stress levels {{experienced in the}} field. In theory, these elevated stress levels are used to generate the same failure mechanisms that are seen in the field, only at an accelerated rate. The methods of assessing reliability of electronic packages can be classified into two categories: a statistical failure based approach and a physics of failure based approach. This research uses a statistical based methodology to identify the critical factors in reliability performance of a flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> component level assembly and a physics of failure based approach to develop a low cycle strain based fatigue equation for flip chip component level assemblies. The critical factors in determining reliability performance were established via experimental investigation and their influence quantified via regression analysis. This methodology differs from other strain based fatigue approaches {{because it is not}} an empirical fit to experimental data; it utilizes regression analysis and least squares to obtain correction factors, or correction functions, and constants for a strain based fatigue equation, where the total inelastic strain is determined analytically. The end product is a general flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> equation rather than one that is specific to a certain test vehicle or material set. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Daniel F.
