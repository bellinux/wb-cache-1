5000|$|The Army Chaplains' Department (AChD) {{was formed}} by Royal Warrant of 23 September 1796. Previously <b>chaplains</b> {{had been part of}} {{individual}} regiments, but not on the central establishment. Only Anglican <b>chaplains</b> were recruited until 1827, when Presbyterians were recognised. Roman Catholic <b>chaplains</b> were recruited from 1836, Methodist <b>chaplains</b> from 1881, and Jewish <b>chaplains</b> from 1892. During the First World War some 4,400 Army <b>Chaplains</b> were recruited and 179 lost their lives on active service. The Department received the [...] "Royal" [...] prefix in February 1919.

5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the time they {{reached the top of the}} mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and <b>Chaplain</b> Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white Latin cross brassard, identifying him as a military <b>chaplain</b> in the U.S. Army <b>Chaplain</b> Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as they carried no weapons.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alvin Kass {{served as}} Rabbi from 1976-2014. Kass {{has also been}} a New York City Police Department <b>chaplain</b> for over 40 years, and had {{previously}} served as a United States Air Force <b>chaplain</b> for two years. At one point during his service as Police Department <b>chaplain</b> he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli. Kass, who teaches ethics at the Police Academy, was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath. He also convinced the NYPD Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department) to admit David Durk. Durk, along with the more famous Frank Serpico, had been the source of the allegations of police corruption that {{led to the formation of}} the Knapp Commission. In 2014, Rabbi Kass retired from the position of Rabbi at East Midwood Jewish Center and currently serves as Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E

5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as <b>chaplain.</b> His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army <b>chaplain</b> on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a <b>chaplain,</b> with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|E

Like other <b>chaplains</b> in the ADF, Navy <b>chaplains</b> have five divisions of seniority. Interestingly, whilst Australian Navy <b>chaplains</b> do not wear rank, they are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy <b>chaplains</b> are accorded the rank and status as Commander (Lieutenant Colonel equivalent in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy <b>chaplains</b> are accorded the rank and status of Captain (equiv. of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy <b>chaplains</b> are [...] "principal chaplains," [...] and these three <b>chaplains,</b> representing the three major Christian denominations: Catholic, Anglican and Protestant, are accorded the rank and status of commodore. The title [...] "Padre" [...] for <b>chaplains</b> is less common and not officially encouraged in the Royal Australian Navy, although it is known to be used by some sailors and Navy <b>chaplains</b> in preference to the more formal title of [...] "chaplain" [...] or form of address towards an officer such as [...] "sir."
