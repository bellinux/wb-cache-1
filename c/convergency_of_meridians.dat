This leads to the definition of a dynamic relaxation scheme applied to computer graphics KEY WORDS : Iterative processes, convergency, relaxation, equations, graphics 1 Introduction The behavior of a system evaluated at a finite order (generally 1) can be described although the corresponding equation have an unknown analytic solution; numerical solutions with iterative character are obtained. Theoretically these algorithms converge and their precision is only limited by number of iterations. In practice these algorithms behavior varies a lot from a case of calculation to the other. If the Newton method [2] is used as an archetype of these algorithms, one observes generally an extremely rapid convergence from an initial value "reasonably" close to t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMeridian {{theory is}} {{a major part of}} Chinese {{medicine}} and has guided acupuncture and clinical practice for thousands <b>of</b> years. <b>Meridian</b> theory describes many important concepts about the rules of human body function and regulation, but has comparatively huge differences with the basic concepts of modern medicine. These differences have caused deep concern and attracted attention from scholars, both inside and outside of China. The interest in meridian theory lies in determining the structural nature <b>of</b> <b>meridians.</b> Not only is this information still unclear, {{it is very difficult to}} achieve clear results in a short period of time. Despite this, the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> can be used as the entry point for meridian studies. After many years of effort, although the physical structure <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> has not been found, the existence <b>of</b> the <b>meridian</b> phenomena has been fully confirmed. Although there is a lack of morphological evidence for the existence <b>of</b> the <b>meridian,</b> concluding non-existence may be incorrect as morphology techniques develop and structures previously not determined are being found. Since the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> exists, some biological basis behind its occurrence must be present. This implies that research on meridians needs to continue as research techniques advance and may eventually reveal the biological basis <b>of</b> the <b>meridian</b> phenomenon. In the present review, we analyze the history <b>of</b> <b>meridian</b> studies in China...|$|R

The 12 meridian systems were naturally presupposed in the conventional study <b>of</b> the <b>meridians</b> and acupuncture. But the excavations of Mawang-tui old documents and Sichuan Mianyang wooden puppet revealed the primordial concepts <b>of</b> <b>meridians</b> uncolored by the numerological cosmology of Han era. Further, the <b>meridian</b> map <b>of</b> horse, cow and hawk show another resemblance to the primordial type <b>of</b> <b>meridians.</b> Modern meridian theory has been challenged by the material based scientific theory and the primo vascular theory presents the most radical answer for it. It aims to reveal the anatomical entity <b>of</b> <b>meridians.</b> However, the study of primo vascular system is unexpectedly opening the new horizon of scientific integration of East and West beyond the mere searching for anatomical entity <b>of</b> <b>meridians.</b> Conclusions we have drawn from the historical reviews are, (1) the surface structure of the body reflects the physiopathological changes of inside the body, (2) by stimulating specific sites on the surface, it is possible to acquire therapeutic effects of certain symptoms, and (3) numbers and locations <b>of</b> <b>meridian</b> acupoints are variable among traditional meridian theories...|$|R
