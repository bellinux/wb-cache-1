40|$|Since the {{earliest}} days of like-kind exchanges, 1 the line between real property and depreciable tangible <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> has been indistinct, at best. 2 Interestingly, the dichotomy between real and <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> is a creature of the Treasury regulations, 3 not of the statute. The statute merely refers to “property” 4 other than for separate provisions for real <b>property</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> indicating that foreign property is not “like-kind” to property located in the United States. 5 Actually, the relevant authority has identified three classes of property eligible for like-kind exchange treatment – (1) real property, 6 (2) depreciable tangible <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> 7 and (3) other <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> including intangible <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|All real <b>property</b> and <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> {{is subject}} to tax unless {{specifically}} exempted by law. <b>Personal</b> <b>property</b> also is taxed, although most <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> owned by individuals is exempt. <b>Personal</b> <b>property</b> tax applies to <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> used when conducting business or to other <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts, stocks or bonds. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes; however, the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax.|$|R

5000|$|In turn, {{international}} development experts {{recognized in the}} mid-1990s that reform {{of the law of}} security interests was a major reason for the prosperity of both Canada and United States, in that it had enabled their businesses to finance growth through forms of secured lending which simply did not exist elsewhere. [...] The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international lenders began to encourage other countries to follow Canada's example as part of the structural adjustment process (a consultation process often required as a condition of their loans). The Canadian PPSAs were subsequently followed by the New Zealand <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Securities Act 1999, the Vanuatu <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Securities Act 2008, the Australia <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Securities Act 2009, the Papua New Guinea <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Security Act 2012, the Jersey Security Interests Law 2012 (covering intangible <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> only), the Samoa <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Securities Act 2013, and the Jamaica Security Interests in <b>Personal</b> <b>Property</b> Act 2013.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, detinue is a {{possessory action}} having for its object the {{recovery}} of specific <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> and damages for its detention.

Detinue differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of <b>personal</b> <b>property</b> which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property.
