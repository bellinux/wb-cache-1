50|$|In contrast, <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> is a {{strategy}} that groups workplace risks into <b>control</b> categories or <b>bands</b> based on combinations of both hazard and exposure information. <b>Control</b> <b>banding</b> combines hazard banding with exposure risk management and exposure management to directly link hazard to specific control measures.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of OELs, a <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> scheme may be used. <b>Control</b> <b>banding</b> is a {{qualitative}} strategy that uses a rubric to place hazards into one of four categories, or [...] "bands", and {{each of which has}} a recommended level of hazard controls. Organizations including GoodNanoGuide, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Safe Work Australia have developed <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> tools that are specific for nanomaterials. The GoodNanoGuide <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> scheme is based only on exposure duration, whether the material is bound, and the extent of knowledge of the hazards. [...] The LANL scheme assigns points for 15 different hazard parameters and 5 exposure potential factors. [...] Alternatively, the [...] "As Low As Reasonably Achievable" [...] concept may be used.|$|R

In {{the absence of}} established OELs, employers and workers often lack the necessary guidance {{on the extent to}} which occupational exposures should be controlled. A strategy to control occupational exposures that may have value when there are no relevant OELs is known as <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> (CB). CB is a qualitative strategy for assessing and managing hazards associated with chemical exposures in the workplace.

40|$|Stoffenmanager is an {{exposure}} and risk assessment tool {{that has a}} <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> part, with risk bands as outcome and a quantitative exposure assessment part, with the 90 th percentile of the predicted exposure as a default outcome. The main aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether multiple users of Stoffenmanager came to the same result when modelling the same scenarios. Other aims were to investigate the differences between outcomes of the <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> part with the measured risk quota and to evaluate the conservatism of the tool by testing whether the 90 th percentiles are above the measured median exposures. We investigated airborne exposures at companies in four different types of industry: wood, printing, metal foundry, and spray painting. Three scenarios were modelled and measured, when possible, at each company. When modelled, 13 users visited each company on the same occasion creating individual assessments. Consensus assessments were also modelled for each scenario by six occupational hygienists. The multiple users' outcomes were often spread over two risk <b>bands</b> in the <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> part, and the differences in the quantitative exposure outcomes for the highest and lowest assessments per scenario varied between a factor 2 and 100. Four parameters were difficult for the users to assess and had a large impact on the outcome: type of task, breathing zone, personal protection, and control measures. Only two scenarios had a higher measured risk quota than predicted by the <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> part, also two scenarios had slightly higher measured median exposure value than modelled consensus in the quantitative exposure assessment part.

The proof of the change of orientation in the machinery and final objectives is the fact that, although the reading desks remain a regular part of the system; however it is already perfectly possible to perform a performance without using, at all, the reading desks (only with the capacity of the central distributor, and the connected sound devices).

50|$|VCHPs {{have two}} {{additions}} {{compared to a}} standard heat pipe: 1. A reservoir, and 2. A Non-Condensable Gas (NCG) added to the heat pipe, {{in addition to the}} working fluid; see the picture in the Spacecraft section below. This NCG is typically argon for standard VCHPs, and helium for thermosyphons. When the heat pipe is not operating, the NCG and working fluid vapor are mixed throughout the heat pipe vapor space. When the VCHP is operating, the NCG is swept toward the condenser end of the heat pipe by the flow of the working fluid vapor. Most of the NCG is located in the reservoir, while the remainder blocks a portion of the heat pipe condenser. The VCHP works by varying the active length of the condenser. When the power or heat sink temperature is increased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure increase. The increased vapor pressure forces more of the NCG into the reservoir, increasing the active condenser length and the heat pipe conductance. Conversely, when the power or heat sink temperature is decreased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure decrease, and the NCG expands, reducing the active condenser length and heat pipe conductance. The addition of a small heater on the reservoir, with the power controlled by the evaporator temperature, will allow thermal control of roughly ±1-2 °C. In one example, the evaporator temperature was maintained in a ±1.65 °C <b>control</b> <b>band,</b> as power was varied from 72 to 150 W, and heat sink temperature varied from +15 °C to -65 °C.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{analysts are}} often {{hampered}} in communicating {{the risks of}} environmental contaminants due to the myriad of regulatory requirements that are applicable. The use of a qualitative, risk-based <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> strategy for assessment and control of potential environmental contaminants provides a standardized approach to improve risk communication.

The model is designed for integration within an occupational health and safety management system to provide a multidisciplinary environmental and occupational risk management approach. This environmental model, which utilizes multidisciplinary <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> strategies for delineating risk, complements the existing Risk Level Based Management System, a proven method in a highly regulated facility for occupational health and safety. A simplified environmental risk matrix is presented that is stratified over four risk levels. Examples of qualitative environmental <b>control</b> <b>banding</b> strategies are presented as they apply to United States regulations for construction, research activities, facility maintenance, and spill remediation that affect air, water, soil, and waste disposal.

40|$|We {{consider}} an inventory {{system in which}} inventory level fluctuates as a Brownian motion {{in the absence of}} control. The inventory continuously accumulates cost at a rate that is a general convex function of the inventory level, which can be negative when there is a backlog. At any time, the inventory level can be adjusted by a positive or negative amount, which incurs a fixed cost and a proportional cost. The challenge is to find an adjustment policy that balances the holding cost and adjustment cost to minimize the long-run average cost. When both upward and downward fixed costs are positive, our model is an impulse control problem. When both fixed costs are zero, our model is a singular or instantaneous control problem. For the impulse control problem, we prove that a four-parameter <b>control</b> <b>band</b> policy is optimal among all feasible policies. For the singular control problem, we prove that a two-parameter <b>control</b> <b>band</b> policy is optimal. We use a lower-bound approach, widely known as "the verification theorem", to prove the optimality of a <b>control</b> <b>band</b> policy for both the impulse and singular control problems. Our major contribution is to prove the existence of a "smooth" solution to the free boundary problem under some mild assumptions on the holding cost function. The existence proof leads naturally to numerical algorithms to compute the optimal <b>control</b> <b>band</b> parameters. We demonstrate that the lower-bound approach also works for Brownian inventory model in which no inventory backlog is allowed. In a companion paper, we will show how the lower-bound approach can be adapted to study a Brownian inventory model under a discounted cost criterion...|$|E
