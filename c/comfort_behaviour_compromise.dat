5000|$|<b>Comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> are {{performed}} {{from an early}} age and change little during development. Several <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> are associated with the beginning of a rest period (e.g. grooming), whereas others are associated with the end of a rest period (e.g. stretching), possibly to prepare the body for escape or hunting. Others, (e.g. dust bathing) will be performed only when the appropriate internal and external stimuli are present (see also sham dustbathing). Animals generally perform <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> only when they are not engaged in essential activities (e.g. feeding, drinking, hunting, escape); these behaviours are therefore sometimes categorised as luxury activities. However, animals can be highly motivated to perform some <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> (e.g. dust bathing in hens), and conditions that thwart these behaviours (e.g. battery cages) are considered to have a negative influence on animal welfare. Furthermore, some <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> show a rebound increase in intensity or frequency after they have been prevented {{for a period of time}} (e.g. wing flapping after releasing caged hens).|$|R
50|$|The {{binturong}} {{uses the}} tail to communicate.It moves about gently, often {{coming to a}} stop, and often using the tail to keep balance, clinging to a branch. It shows a pronounced <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> associated with grooming the fur, shaking and licking the hair, and scratching.

50|$|<b>Comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{may have}} several functions, {{including}} the extraction or removal of foreign {{objects such as}} ectoparasites, insects, leaves, dirt and twigs. Felidae cats are well known for their extensive grooming; one possible reason for such grooming is to remove all traces of blood and other organic matter {{so as not to}} alert prey with the scent. Flying and gliding animals preen and groom to keep their feathers or wings in good aerodynamic condition. Some animals waterproof themselves during <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours,</b> while others groom their fur to maintain its insulative properties. Many social animals adapt preening and grooming behaviours for other social purposes, such as bonding and social structure maintenance.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the grazing, social and <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the {{indigenous}} purebred Ankole cattle breed and crossbred (Holstein × Ankole) animals under typical management conditions in south western Uganda. Twelve focal animals in each of four groups (two groups per genotype) were observed regarding their grazing, social and <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> on pasture. No significant differences in grazing behaviour patterns (eating, walking, standing) were found between the genotypes. Resting occurred only very rarely in both genotypes. Walking distances of Ankole and Ankole × Holstein crosses were also similar. There was no difference in the occurrence of agonistic interactions between the two genotypes. However, Ankole cattle engaged in more non-agonistic social interactions than their crossbred counterparts. Individual distances were lower in Ankole heifers and more herd mates were found within a radius of 5 m around the Ankole animals. The most important <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> pattern in both genotypes was self-licking, which occurred to similar frequency in Ankole and crossbred heifer groups. Crossbred animals scratched themselves and rubbed on objects more often than Ankole heifers. Although Ankole cattle and their Holstein crosses did not differ in grazing, distances walked and agonistic behaviours, the significant differences between the two genotypes in herd cohesion and <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> may pose challenges on the management of crossbred animals under extensive open grazing conditions as present in south western Uganda. Thus, apart from (re) productive performance traits, behavioural traits of both genotypes may also be taken into account for breeding decisions and management under current production conditions...|$|R

40|$|Underlying {{the study}} of animal welfare is the {{assumption}} that animals experience emotional states. Although there has been a bias towards studying negative emotions, research into positive emotions is necessary for an overall welfare assessment. The aim of the current study was to find behavioural expressions specific for anticipation of different events in domestic fowl, Gallus gallus omesticus. To this aim, we used a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm by which we induced anticipation of a positive, neutral and negative event. We investigated whether birds were able to discriminate between sound cues signalling these events with different valences and, if so, whether anticipation of different events is reflected in different behavioural responses. The birds showed a response of increased attention to all sound cues. In anticipation of the negative event, the birds showed more head movements and locomotion than in anticipation of both the neutral and positive event, possibly reflecting the aversive nature of the negative event. In anticipation of the positive event, the birds showed more <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours,</b> such as preening and wing flapping, which have been associated with a state of relaxation. Our study shows that laying hens are able to anticipate differentially a positive, neutral and negative event announced by different sound cues. It is also the first study to identify <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> as specifically associated with anticipation of a positive event in domestic fowl. <b>Comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> may therefore be associated with a positive emotional state in domestic fowl...|$|R

New Zealand Whites, Lop Crosses, and Dutch breeds, both female and castrated males, were observed. Locomotory behaviour accounted for 19 % of penned rabbit behaviours and 23. 2 % of caged rabbit behaviours. Maintenance behaviours were more commonly observed in caged rabbits (44. 5 % of observed behaviours) than in penned rabbits (25. 3 %).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{drive power}} in motor vehicles requires an improved performance of friction linings and counterpart material in clutches. The most important criteria are {{the coefficient of}} friction, the wear rate, the specific weight, the judder and noise inclination. The frictional heat developing during the engagement process leads to a high temperature load of the lining surface. So far organic friction linings are used preferentially because of their good <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> and low price. Their properties were improved continually over the last years. However their performance is limited especially by the transferable specific friction energy. Thus the evaluation of alternative friction materials is an important goal of the clutch manufacturers. For the investigations pin-on-disc tests with inertia simulation on different material couples were accomplished. The adjustable mass inertia of the system ensures a defined friction energy per clutch procedure. This permits {{the evaluation of the}} friction value as a function of running speed and cycle number as well as the determination of the wear rate related to the performed friction energy. Additionally the noise emission was measured for the evaluation of the <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The results of the pin-on-disc tests showed a good correlation to the accomplished component tests...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the many}} {{properties}} suggested for action-selection mechanisms, a prominent {{one is the}} ability to select compromise actions, i. e. actions that are not the best to satisfy any active goal in isolation, but rather compromise between multiple goals.

It concludes that optimal <b>compromise</b> <b>behaviour</b> has a surprisingly small benefit over non-compromise behaviour in the experiments performed, and presents some reasons why this may be true and hypothesizes cases where <b>compromise</b> <b>behaviour</b> is truly useful. In particular, it hypothesizes that a crucial factor is the level at which an action is taken (low-level actions are specific, such as ‘move left leg’; high-level actions are vague, such as ‘forage for food’).

The experimental group was formed by three males (one of them was a dominant alfa male) and four females who were in the reproductive cycle at the observation period. The behavioural study included five recurrent observations which took place in March 2014. The observations revealed that geladas spent most of the time feeding (44. 1 %) and performing <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> (24. 6 %). About 7. 7 – 10. 4 % of the total time the geladas spent moving, resting and observing the neighbourhoods. The settled and stable social hierarchy within the group prevented greater incidence (0. 7 %) of aggressive behaviour. Occurrence of other types of activities was low – play (1. 7 %), climbing the trees (0. 5 %) and sexual behaviour (2. 3 %). The work also studied how the incidence of a particular type of behaviour changed over time within the day. A certain pattern in behavioural activities was apparent because their incidence tended to be similar on all observation days.

40|$|Group-housing of rabbit does may be {{preferred}} {{from welfare}} point of view. However, group-housing causes agonistic behaviour which may cause severe injuries. Severe injuries may be prevented by offering hiding places for attacked does. Providing enrichment (straw) may reduce agonistic behaviour by attracting attention from fighting. In contrast, {{acquisition of a}} territory within a group may evoke aggression. An experiment was conducted in which the effect of hiding places, straw and territory on aggression in intermittent group-housed rabbit does was studied. The group-housing system consisted of four adjacent enriched individual cages that had been transformed into one group pen for four does by taking out three side walls. Group pens were 1. 0 m × 1. 5 m × 0. 6 m (length × width × height). Does were housed individually until 18 days of lactation. As of day 18 of lactation, four multiparous hybrid does (Hycole) with their kits were housed in a group until 35 days of lactation. All combinations of the following factors were randomly assigned: hiding places (platform and PVC pipe), straw and territory (i. e. familiarity with the cage before grouping) (8 treatments). Sixteen pens were used during 5 successive lactations of 35 days (n = 10 /treatment). Behavioural observations were performed at two afternoons at the start {{and end of the}} group-housing period of each lactation and skin injuries were registered on 4, 7, 10, 14 and 17 days after being group-housed. Does were resting 70 % of the observed time. Does with territory showed significantly more <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> than does without territory (13 % vs. 9 % of the observed time, respectively; P < 0. 05). At start does showed less <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> and more locomotion than {{at the end of the}} group-housing period (7 % vs. 15 % and 2 % vs. 1 % of the observed time, respectively; P < 0. 05). Occupation with straw, stereotyped behaviour and fights were only observed in 4 %, 3 % and 0. 3 % of the does, respectively. There were no differences in skin injuries between treatments. Overall 52 % of the does had injuries. The percentage of does that had severe injuries ranged between 13 % and 39 %. Treatments with hiding places had the lowest numerical percentage of severe injuries and there was a tendency (P < 0. 1) for less culled does in this treatment. In conclusion, does do not defend a territory within a group pen. Hiding places can help to reduce severe skin injuries.

This paper reports on an experimental investigation on the effects of garment design in thermo-physiological body comfort, measured in terms of clothing insulation for a specific outdoor sport - rowing. The thermal manikins have been used to measure clothing insulation and to evaluate the thermal comfort. Thermal manikins provide a good estimate of the total dry heat loss from the body and the distribution of heat flow over the body surface. In a standard environment, these measurements can be used to describe the thermal characteristics of clothing. Testing of sportswear clothing made of different fibers and garment designs, namely by varying knitting structures, show the possibilities of influencing thermal comfort, especially thermal insulation. The evaluation and understanding of the thermal effects of garment design and fabric materials is important for the development and optimization of functional garments. Therefore, the final aim {{of this paper is to}} study and validate the thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> of active sportswear for rowing using single and multiple knitted zones in the garment design and considering also differences in material composition through thermal manikin measurements...|$|R
