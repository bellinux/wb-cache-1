500|$|In 1989, Deal and Donelly {{recorded}} a demo with violinist Carrie Bradley of Ed's Redeeming Qualities, bassist Ray Holiday, and four different drummers. The demo had a country music feel. Paul Kolderie engineered several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs, but Deal felt they sounded [...] "too clean"; she asked Joe Harvard (of Fort Apache Studios) to remix the tracks to sound rougher. Deal called the project [...] "the Breeders", {{a name that}} she and her sister Kelley had used when performing as teenagers; this was a slang expression—used by homosexuals to refer to heterosexuals—that Deal found amusing. Around the time the Breeders recorded the demo, the group performed a concert at the Rat music venue in Boston; in the city's Phoenix newspaper, the band was described as a female supergroup. Ivo Watts-Russell—the <b>cofounder</b> <b>of</b> 4AD, <b>the</b> record label <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pixies and Throwing Muses—heard the Breeders' demo, and was very enthusiastic about it. Watts-Russell offered funding to rerecord the songs for an album release, and the band received an $11,000 budget.|$|R
25|$|Women were {{generally}} confined to underground {{roles in the}} French Resistance network. Lucie Aubrac, who {{has become a symbol}} of the French Resistance within France, never had a clearly defined role in the hierarchy of the movement, which in her case involved the regional Southern Liberation. Hélène Viannay, more highly educated than her husband Philippe Viannay, the founder of the Défense de la France, did not write one single article for the clandestine newspaper of the same name, nor did the other companions of the chiefs of the Défense de la France, although they did take part in meetings to edit the newspaper. On the other hand, Suzanne Buisson, <b>cofounder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comité d'action socialiste (CAS) was the treasurer until her arrest. Only one woman, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, was a head of a network (by leading the British to believe that the true head of the Alliance network was actually a man). No woman ever led a movement, or a maquis (guerilla group) or a Liberation Committee, none was installed as a Commissioner within the Provisional Government of the Republic of France or a Minister of the Liberation.|$|E
500|$|The 12th century Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi, <b>cofounder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cheng–Zhu school, {{rejected}} {{both of the}} Han dynasty {{lines of}} commentary on the I Ching, proposing that the text was a work of divination, not philosophy. However, he still considered it useful for understanding the moral practices of the ancients, called [...] "rectification of the mind" [...] in the Great Learning.

500|$|In 1965 Murray {{published}} her landmark article (coauthored by Mary Eastwood), [...] "Jane Crow and the Law: Sex Discrimination and Title VII", in the George Washington Law Review. The article discussed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as it {{applied to}} women, and drew comparisons between discriminatory laws {{against women and}} Jim Crow laws. In 1966 she was a <b>cofounder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Organization for Women (NOW), which she hoped could act as an NAACP for women's rights. In March of that year, Murray wrote to Commissioner Richard Alton Graham that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was not fulfilling its duty in upholding the gendered portion of its mission, leaving only half the black population protected. Later, she and Dorothy Kenyon successfully argued White v. Crook, {{a case in which}} the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that women have an equal right to serve on juries. When lawyer and future supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote her brief for Reed v. Reed—a 1971 supreme court case that, for the first time extended the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause to women—she added Murray and Kenyon as coauthors in recognition of her debt to their work.|$|E

500|$|The chief {{transportation}} {{routes in}} 1701 were the Indian footpaths that crossed <b>the</b> future state <b>of</b> Michigan; <b>the</b> Grand River Trail {{was one of}} these thirteen trails at the time.

This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit. A ten-year project to construct a plank road between Detroit and Howell was authorized in 1820 along the Grand River Trail. Grand River Avenue was included as one of Five Great Military Roads by Governor Lewis Cass in 1825, along with the River Road, Michigan Avenue, Woodward Avenue and Gratiot Avenue. The Grand River Road, precursor to the modern Grand River Avenue was named by Benjamin Williams, <b>cofounder</b> <b>of</b> Owosso. <b>The</b> original Native American name for the river was [...] meaning [...] "the river that extends far off", or [...] "far into the interior", which was translated as , the French name for the river; this name was then applied to <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trail that paralleled at least half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river's length.|$|R
