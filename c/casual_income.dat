40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySelf {{assessment}} for individual taxpayers {{was first introduced}} in Malaysia for the 2004 year of assessment. This change from the previous official assessment system to self assessment has redefined the roles and responsibilities of both taxpayers and tax administrators in Malaysia. In particular, self assessment has placed the onus on individual taxpayers, both salary and wage earners and the self-employed, to voluntarily and correctly determine their own tax liabilities. The level of voluntary compliance achieved under self assessment {{was expected to be}} influenced not only by taxpayers’ ability to understand the compliance requirements of the income tax law, but also by their behaviour in relation to a range of economic, fiscal, psychological and sociological factors. In this context, the main objective of this research was to investigate the influence of the introduction of self assessment on the compliance behaviour of individual taxpayers in Malaysia. In addition, the research sought to identify the causes (such as ‘tax knowledge’, ‘tax structure features’, ‘financial constraints’ and ‘attitudes towards tax’) that may influence taxpayers’ compliance behaviour; and the nature of their influence, in relation to the introduction of self assessment in Malaysia. Demographic variables (such as age, gender, level of education and ethnic background) were also investigated to provide another dimension (as moderating variables) to the analysis of compliance behaviour. Six research questions were developed to address the objectives of the research. A mixed method design comprising two quantitative research methods (survey and experiment) and one qualitative research method (case study) was conducted concurrently in three phases. The findings derived were triangulated via a cross-method analysis to address the six research questions. The findings revealed that the introduction of self assessment had had a positive influence on individual taxpayers’ compliance behaviour. This was attributed to individual taxpayers having a greater awareness of the change in their responsibilities as a result of self assessment, and that this in turn led to an improvement in their tax knowledge. As there was no prior comparable empirical evidence available in relation to the impact of the introduction of self assessment on tax compliance behaviour, this research finding is an important contribution to existing knowledge on the compliance behaviour of individual taxpayers. Based on the findings of the research, it was found that tax knowledge had significant effects on the compliance behaviour of individual taxpayers. The lack of tax knowledge did cause numerous errors in tax returns prepared and furnished by individual taxpayers, resulting in unintentional non-compliance by some and over compliance by others. Tax structure features showed reasonably strong effects on taxpayers’ compliance behaviour. Empirical evidence revealed that fear of being tax audited and penalised had also indirectly influenced individual taxpayers’ compliance decisions. Thus it is concluded that individual taxpayers were sensitive to the two tax structure features, namely tax audit and penalty, while the effect of the tax rates on their compliance behaviour was marginally less significant. Financial constraints were found to have more direct and strong influence on the compliance behaviour of self-employed taxpayers. The issue of financial constraints was not of major concern among the salary and wage earners under the self assessment regime. However, as the tax rates imposed on individual taxpayers in Malaysia are relatively low as compared to some other countries (such as those in Australia and New Zealand), and coupled with relief and rebates available, individual taxpayers could be paying very minimal taxes. In terms of attitudes towards tax, two prominent findings emerged from the survey and the case study. Firstly, taxpayers’ attitudes, in terms of confidence in handling their tax affairs, did {{have a positive impact on}} their compliance behaviour. Secondly, taxpayers’ attitudes towards the tax system, the tax administration and tax officers had negative effects on their compliance decisions. In contrast to the effects of financial constraints, these findings on attitudes towards tax appeared to be only affecting the compliance behaviour of individuals who were salary and wage earners. Finally, in the multi-ethnic society of Malaysia, this research revealed evidence of the different needs of ethnic groups in relation to tax education, how they manage their tax affairs, how the tax structure features as well as how their attitudes towards tax had affected their decision to comply. This research also revealed evidence of the different compliance behaviour of the two categories of taxpayers (i. e. the salary and wage earners and the self-employed) in respect of the reporting compliance pertaining to three different types of income (i. e. taxable income, exempted income and <b>casual</b> <b>income).</b> Arising from the findings of this research, several policy implications were identified. The findings demonstrated that in formulating strategies to enhance voluntary compliance, it is important for the relevant authorities to be aware of, understand and appreciate individual taxpayers’ compliance behaviour and the need to render tax education services...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{income distribution}} types, {{both individual and}} functional, {{in terms of the}} first and the last quintiles in Turkey from 2006 to 2015. In this respect, the study first reveals how income types represented by functional income distribution are distributed for the first and last quintiles. Secondly, the inequalities arising within different income types obtained by the respective income quintiles are involved to the analysis. TURKSTAT Income and Living Conditions Survey dataset has been used in the study. With regards to methodology, first the variations that occurred in the shares obtained by households in different income categories for the first and last income quintiles have been used from 2006 to 2015. The improving or deteriorating effects of the relevant income quintiles on income inequality have been put forth for these variations. Then, the Lorenz curves and the Gini coefficients have been used to assess the distribution within each income category. According to the findings of the study, items that increase income equality for the first quintile are salaries and wages, pensions and survivors’ benefits, property income and other social transfers. On the other hand, <b>casual</b> <b>incomes,</b> entrepreneurial incomes, household transfers and rental incomes are the income categories that deteriorate income equality against the first income quintile. While wages and salaries {{have a positive effect on}} establishing income equality within this category, rental and property income are the types of income that reveal the most unequal distribution within themselves...|$|R

40|$|A {{household}} {{survey of}} Helenvale Township in Port Elizabeth {{was conducted in}} order to gain an understanding of the strategies and activities that people in this poor community employ to sustain their livelihoods. The household profile, which entailed a survey of the household size, education levels and employment status was conducted. Dwelling units in terms of ownership, type, size, quality and building materials were also assessed. The income and expenditure of the Helenvale residents and community assets, as well as access to basic services were also assessed. The study found that the household size varied between 5 and 7 members. A more or less even distribution of the gender of household heads was noted, with 48 percent and 50 percent female male respectively. Among the HHs surveyed, no member had a higher qualification than Matric and quite a number were illiterate. Unemployment which stands at 54 percent was identified as the most serious problem plaguing Helenvale. A high level of home ownership (84 percent) was noted; of which 79 percent are formal dwellings and typically two-room structures of poor quality. Helenvale residents are largely dependent on child support grants as the major source of <b>income.</b> <b>Casual</b> jobs and disability grants are the other important sources of income identified. Human assets in the form of labour power are the most important assets that the community possesses. Physical assets are negligible, while financial ones are non-existent among all the respondents. Television and electric kettles are the most commonly owned appliances in the households. Basic services are readily accessible to the community, particularly water, health, refuse removal and sewage. Among the threats that the respondents identified, unemployment came to the fore as the biggest and major threat to households. Crime, teenage pregnancy and overcrowding are also considered as major threats, as are gangsterism and gambling violence. The study recommends the development of a long term plan for poverty alleviation. The creation of employment opportunities in the form of financing of small community projects which empower women and the youth is also recommended. All this should be underpinned by the expeditious delivery of housing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the current debate on how to balance conservation and development objectives. The extent of land under protection globally has increased enormously over the last 30 years, {{and there are still}} plans to expand the current protected areas (PAs) and create new ones. Their establishment is associated with impacts on local communities who live in the proximity of such areas. Different actors have proposed local participation and benefit sharing for people affected by these conservation initiatives. Despite their implementation over three decades, the social, economic, and political impacts of establishing and maintaining PAs remain debatable. It is in this context that this study was conducted in the Enduimet Wildlife Management Area (WMA), the Kilimanjaro National Park, and the West Kilimanjaro Forest Plantation in Tanzania. The specific research questions of the study are: i. What are the social and economic impacts of the expansion and establishment of conservation areas on local people in West Kilimanjaro; and how are the impacts distributed along gender lines? ii. How are the conservation benefits shared with local communities in West Kilimanjaro? iii. How do the conservation benefits and costs affect local peoples‟ attitudes towards and perceptions of conservation? iv. What are the factors that drive human-wildlife conflicts? Data were collected using qualitative methods through the combination of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, informal interviews, and participant observation. Secondary data in the form of written sources on the study area were used in addition to the primary data gathered. The research results are presented in four separate but interrelated papers. [ [...] . ] All areas studied (Enduimet WMA, Kilimanjaro National Park, and West Kilimanjaro Forest Plantation) share a centralised structure in terms of decision making on the management of natural resources and benefit sharing. Local people are not able to participate in decision making in the management of the areas, and it is difficult for communities to influence or challenge the way the structure operates. In Enduimet, the WMA was proposed as community-run conservation area. In practice, the communities do not have the power to collect revenues, decide on shares, or to verify whether they receive the income they are entitled to receive. The central government collects the revenues and channels the percentage to local people. The Kilimanjaro National Park was found to involve local people only when there is a fire outbreak; thus local people claimed to be used as „tools‟. The park management system does not allow space for local people‟s opinions. Most of the collected revenues are retained by the national parks headquarters and local people do not have any power or influence over the revenues. In practice, the park operates under a strict „fences and fines‟ or „fortress conservation‟ strategy. In the West Kilimanjaro Forest Plantation, local people do not have any power or share of the revenues collected from the sale of logs and poles, apart from payment received from <b>casual</b> labour. The <b>income</b> from logs sold is remitted to the central government. In all three areas, participation is used as „means‟ to improve environmental conservation and a way to accrue more revenue for the government...|$|R

Background and motivation: This thesis was {{prompted}} by the deteriorating health and economic status in Lesotho. The country is experiencing the double burden of disease including HIVIAIDS, communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as micronutrient deficiencies. The situation {{is compounded by the}} prevailing food insecurity due to climatic shocks and stresses surging through Southern Africa. The deteriorating health burden is drawing heavily on limited resources in the country. As a medium term measure towards realisation of the longer-term vision 2020, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) has recently developed the national Poverty Reduction Strategy Programme (PRSP). Health is the fifth of the eight priority areas of the PRSP. One of the proposed strategies is reduction of nutrition related illness to be achieved through the development of a coherent nutrition policy. The aim: This thesis has attempted to produce a framework towards development of an integrated nutrition policy. The approach used follows standard procedures towards development of a policy. The specific objectives to be fulfilled by this thesis include problem identification and definition; analysing the magnitude of the problem and population groups affected; existing systems for reducing the impact of the problem among vulnerable groups; defining a framework that will articulate the desired output to be achieved by the proposed policy; a strategy articulating mechanisms to be implemented to achieve the output and a system for monitoring and evaluating the desired impact. The methods: Permission to proceed in defining the integrated national nutrition policy framework for Lesotho was obtained from relevant authorities in the country. A consultative process to define the process and solicit support from stakeholders within nutrition in Lesotho was engaged throughout the development of this thesis. The United Nations Children's fund's (UNICEF) conceptual framework depicting the causality of malnutrition was used to describe the nutrition related problems and their causes in Lesotho. In this thesis only the immediate causal factors of malnutrition are addressed. Other underlying causal factors contributing to these immediate causes can be pursued elsewhere when designing relevant specific interventions. This thesis describes the magnitude of disease experienced in Lesotho using secondary data generated from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Existing information on food security was obtained from studies undertaken in Lesotho, including the inter-agency assessment of the prevailing food shortage humanitarian crisis currently facing Southern African, vulnerability assessments, dietary intake and micronutrient deficiency studies. Selected elements of the existing national nutrition programme have been used in this thesis, taking cognizance of the problem, its size and location. The framework for developing a suitable nutrition policy for Lesotho is suggested. The suggested process will be participatory to include all stakeholders in an attempt to build components of sustainability. Results: Analysis of the prevailing situation confirms the double burden of disease, where infectious diseases are more prevalent in the younger age groups. In the older population, chronic illnesses are more prevalent. Both data sets used reflect that the burden of disease is a result of higher mortality rates compared to morbidity. HIVIAIDS, respiratory and other infections are causing a major proportion of the disease burden. The male population is more affected relative to the females, with the exception of females at the age of 15 to 29 years, probably because of maternal related complications. Analysis by age indicates the population group from 5 to 14 years old has lower rates of morbidity and mortality. This age group is the window of hope for correcting nutrition-related diseases. If the right interventions are targeted at this group, there is hope of attaining the national goal for vision 2020. It should be appreciated that this information reflects the burden of disease of those who seek health care within the health service delivery facilities. Both the exact magnitude of diseases and their causal factors can he confirmed by undertaking relevant research covering representative samples of the total population in Lesotho. The food security situation in Lesotho is far from optimal. Poor breastfeeding and infant feeding practices, such as early introduction of other foods besides breastfeeding, early cessation of breastfeeding, low nutrient (including energy) dense weaning foods and reduced feeding during illness and recuperation are ascertained as causal factors contributing to malnutrition amongst children in Lesotho. The mountain areas are identified as highly susceptible areas to food insecurity, followed by the southern districts. The vulnerability and high risk factors of populations in these locations are further confirmed by the high prevalence of chronic malnutrition and under-weights compared {{to the rest of the}} country. Indicators that were associated with vulnerability to food insecurity were households that were either widow or elderly headed, those engaging in multiple income earning mechanisms or relying on farming, herding, informal business or/and <b>casual</b> labour for <b>income</b> and those with a high ratio of dependents. The Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Food Programme (FAOIWFP) cereal production forecast for the 2003 / 04 period predicted that 45 % of the total population in Lesotho would require food assistance in varying quantities. The livelihoods vulnerability assessment undertaken in 2003 estimated a nationwide food/income deficit ranging from 10 to 47 %. The FAONFP report suggested improved soil husbandry and extension practices. The vulnerability assessment report suggested livelihood-based interventions, together with direct food and income transfers as relevant interventions. Analysis of the existing food and nutrition programme in Lesotho looked at main components that would strongly influence the integrated nutrition policy. The approach was borrowed from the European Union nutrition programme. In this thesis only the three elements of the national nutrition programme that would directly influence the nutritional outcomes were studied. These were nutrition security, food security and trade issues. On analysis, these elements reveal a fragmented implementation of nutrition interventions. This situation exists despite efforts by the GOL to establish a coordination office mandated with synchronizing all nutrition stakeholders countrywide on policy, programme, monitoring, evaluation and research issues. As a result of the fragmented non-cohesive approach and inefficient utilisation of resources, especially the scanty human resource, the national nutrition programme has not realised a positive impact on the prevalence of malnutrition in Lesotho. The main elements to constitute the policy will consider core values and principles of the nutrition profession and programme in Lesotho. This thesis assumes the national nutrition programme will embrace the common national vision 2020 and will share the similar mission reiterated by the Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office (FNCO) in the poverty reduction thematic nutrition paper. The nutrition policy advisory committee in Lesotho would, however, confirm this assumption or design alternative statements. The processes towards identifying relevant objectives and strategies have been defined in this thesis and will have to be undertaken by the committee, which will also define implementation mechanisms including financing, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The national nutrition programme has identified the need for technical support in some areas. The author, therefore, suggests that the WHO and the United Nations 1 Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNISCN) can be approached for this support. Conclusions: The GOL demonstrated commitment towards the nutrition policy. The process toward defining the integrated nutrition policy for Lesotho should be completely participatory. This thesis has addressed the first component of the framework, which is the situation analysis and description of the main policy components. The situation analysis has portrayed a need for an integrated nutrition policy to address the double burden of disease compounded by HIVIAIDS and chronic food shortage. This adverse situation can be curbed through a coherent cost-effective food and nutrition programme. The FNCO, mandated with nutrition policy design, therefore, has to revitalize the policy advisory committee to carry the policy defining processes forward. A framework to be used in this process has been developed and presented in this thesis. Recommendations The stakeholders in nutrition should agree on systemic issues to be changed or maintained. The process for policy definition should state the institutional arrangements, such as stakeholders' analysis, financial mechanisms and management and coordination. The programme implementation arrangements should define the beneficiaries, realistic objectives aligned with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), strategies, prioritize cost-effective nutrition interventions and agree on coordination, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The nutrition policy will mainstream the cross-cutting issues such as HIVIAIDS, gender, environment and governance. On completion of this thesis the author will present it to the relevant authorities in Lesotho for the policy development processes to continue in line with the proposed time frame and implementation plan given in Chapter 5.
