There is Halloween influence as well, with items made to resemble witches, ghosts, Jack-o'-lanterns, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{activities}} of the company have changed {{a number of times}} during its existence, frequently incorporating the disparate business interests of the founding Bunzl family, which trace their history back to a haberdashery opened in Pozsony in 1854. The current company was established in London in 1940 as a manufacturer of cigarette filters, <b>crêpe</b> and tissue <b>paper,</b> and the production of fibres, pulp, paper, building materials and plastics were all brought into the firm - and subsequently sold - over the following decades. Bunzl restructured itself as a company purely focused on distribution through a divestment process which began in the early 1990s and ended with the 2005 spin out of Filtrona.|$|R
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder dryer are key factors in a tissue paper mill, and they therefore need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. To this end it would be valuable {{to be able to make}} on-line measurements of Yankee coating thickness as well as the crepe structure of the tissue paper. The adhesion of paper to the cylinder affects the creping process and more information about the parameters that affect the adhesion is therefore of interest. To perform trials on a full scale or in a pilot plant is very costly and laboratory creping equipment is therefore sought after in order to be able to measure the adhesion force. The coating layer for use on the cylinder was analysed. It contained a large amount of carbohydrates and could not be considered transparent. The thickness of the coating layer was measured on a laboratory cylinder with a method based on fluorescence. An optical brightener was added to the coating chemicals and the coating layer was subjected to UV-radiation. The intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener was measured and gave an indication of the thickness of the coating layer. The equipment has to be further investigated before it is possible to implement the new sensor on-line. New creping equipment and an adhesion method were developed for use on a laboratory scale. The equipment can operate with different creping angles and the force needed to <b>crepe</b> the <b>paper</b> can be measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers of high grammage, low dryness at adhesion, high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. A more direct method is to analyse the structure of the produced paper. Measurements were made on a tissue paper with an optical fibre sensor while the paper was travelling at low speed. The collected signal was mathematically analysed and the characteristic wavelength was calculated for different paper samples. These values were close to the wavelengths measured with an off line method by a commercial crepe analyser. Baksidestext The creping process is the heart of tissue paper manufacture. To control the process better, on-line measurements of paper structure and coating thickness are sought after. The creping is highly dependent on the adhesion of the paper to the Yankee dryer. To be able to measure the adhesion, laboratory creping equipment was also required. Different pulp parameters affect the adhesion and some of them have been investigated in this work. The coating on the Yankee cylinder consisted mainly of fiber fragments and could not be considered as transparent, which had to be considered when choosing a method to measure coating thickness. A method based on the light emitted from an optical brightener in the coating when subjected to UV-irradiation was used, but has to be further improved before it can be used on-line. A new laboratory creping method was developed to determine the adhesion between paper and metal, and the force needed to scrape off the paper with a doctor blade was measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers made of pulp with a high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. An optical method using reflected light to measure crepe wavelength on-line was developed. The paper travelled under a sensor and the light collected was mathematically analyzed to determine the most common wavelength...|$|R
25|$|Crafts {{based on}} paper {{products}} {{can be found}} in Acolman, Metepec, Toluca, Huixquilcan, Nezahualcoyotl and Otumba. The making of paper in this region dates back well into the pre Hispanic period, when it was mostly used in the making of codices. Today the most common product is papel picado (lit. pricked paper), where holes are cut into <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> to make designs and hung as decorations for special occasions.|$|E
25|$|The {{making of}} piñatas, {{decorative}} cut outs {{and other objects}} from paper and/or cardboard is known in Acolman, Metepec, Toluca, Huixquilucan, Nezahualcoyotl and Otumba. This tradition dates back to pre-Hispanic times with bark paper, but newer materials have been incorporated since then. For example, paper cut out banner or papel picado was originally done with <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> (called “papel chino” in Spanish) but today {{it can be seen}} done on thin plastic sheets.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a section}} {{dedicated}} to piñatas, most made with cardboard {{and covered in}} <b>crepe</b> <b>paper,</b> although more traditional ones with a clay pot in the center can still be found. Designs range from traditional stars to those based on recent figures from popular movies and television shows. The busiest time of year for {{this section of the}} market is December, before Christmas, when a tradition called “Las Posadas” often involves the breaking of one or more piñatas. While traditional to that season, the breaking of piñatas is no longer confined to December and can be found at various types of celebrations year round, which helps to support this section’s permanent presence.|$|E
25|$|Papier-mâché was {{introduced}} into Mexico around the 17th {{century as a}} way to make objects for churches with its use most developed in central Mexico. In Celaya, the creation of these figures became a trade much the way metalwork and pottery did, with the work dominated by certain families. Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of objects for both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The paper and cardboard used is mostly waste paper, such as old newspapers and boxes, with decorative elements, such as <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{believed}} that on June 12, 1892, Antonio Vélez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he stared at a Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then {{took a look at}} the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vélez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited José Martí as a guest.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January in the Pueblo de los Reyes, {{the main}} {{square of the}} {{community}} is decorated with flower portals and “carpets” made by carefully arranging colored sawdust on the ground. There are also processions and a ceremony called the “vítor” used to announce coming of the festival. Reeds are cut and decorated with multicolored <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> and half inflated balloons and then are given to children as they pass by on the streets. There is also a parade that features “mojigangas” which are large structures made of cardboard and paper {{in the shape of}} human figures. These are hollow and placed on the shoulders of parade participants. An image of the Nativity and the Three Wise Men is carried through the town on a truck from which bags of candies are tossed to children.|$|E

2500|$|While piñatas {{are found}} at parties year round, {{they are most}} {{traditional}} for the Christmas season, especially during the weeks prior when [...] "posadas" [...] are celebrated. These posadas reenact the search of Joseph and Mary {{for a place to}} stay before giving birth to Jesus. The piñata came to Mexico from Europe during the colonial period, although the practice of breaking a container with treats inside originated in Asia. In Mexico, the tradition is that of an old pot with decorations with seasonal fruit, candy and other prizes for children, with these children taking turns to try and break the piñatas while blindfolded. Today, most piñatas are made with cartonería and decorated with <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> and other items. The most traditional shape is that of a star with five to nine points. However, for other occasions, such as birthdays, piñatas often are the shape of animals, clowns and figures from popular culture.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} 20th century, {{a number of}} artists tried {{to bring back the}} {{technique}} as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers. Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the Academy of San Carlos with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> cut outs and colored feathers. [...] However, she, too, no longer works with this technique. Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|There are two widely {{practice}} paper crafts in Puebla. The {{making of}} bark paper or amate {{was known in}} pre-Hispanic times when such was reserved for special ceremonies and the recording of important information. It had an almost magical quality to it and was used for spells, clothing of idols and other ceremonial purposes. Today, the paper is still made {{as an art form}} and often painted with elaborate designs. In Puebla, the paper is still made by hand and often it is hand-painted with pre-Hispanic designs. One area noted for this craft is San Salvador Huixcolotla [...] Another is San Pablito Pahuatlán in the Sierra Norte. One notable amate paper artist is curandero Alfonso García Téllez, who narrates stories and ceremonies in his works. Another paper craft is papel picado, or “chopped paper.” This craft began with the introduction of <b>crepe</b> <b>paper</b> from Asia. This paper is elaborately cut to form figures and scenes which are then hung for decorative purposes for holidays such as Day of the Dead. This most traditional of these are laborious cut by hand, but most are done today by machine.
