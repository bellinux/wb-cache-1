40|$|The Alaska {{recreational}} charter boat {{sector has}} undergone {{significant change in}} recent years {{due in part to}} several regulatory changes in the management of the Pacific halibut sport fishery, including a limited entry program, harvest controls specific to the <b>charter</b> <b>sector,</b> and a Catch Sharing Plan (CSP) implemented during 2014. In the face of these regulatory changes, the number of active charter businesses declined from over 1, 000 in the mid- 2000 s to less than 600 in recent years. To understand the economic conditions of this sector prior to implementation of the CSP, a survey was undertaken to collect costs, earnings, and employment information from charter businesses. Sample data for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fishing seasons were used to generate population-level estimates of fixed and variable costs, fishing and non-fishing revenues, and offshore and onshore employment. These estimates are adjusted to reflect missing data using sample weighting and nearest neighbor data imputation approaches. The adjusted population-level results suggest that in 2011 the Alaska saltwater sport fishing <b>charter</b> <b>sector</b> as a whole operated at a loss, but in 2012 and 2013, as the population of charter businesses shrank, the sector yielded an overall profit. Overall, the 3 -year period saw slight changes in employment and spending patterns by charter businesses that remained in the fishery, including a shift to using proportionately more part-time employees for on-shore work and decreasing the amount spent on charter trip expenses and cash investments in vehicles, machinery, equipment, buildings and real estate...|$|E
40|$|Charter {{schools have}} become a very popular {{instrument}} for reforming public schools, because they expand choices, facilitate local innovation, and provide incentives for the regular public schools while remaining under public control. Despite their conceptual appeal, evaluating their performance has been hindered by the selective nature of their student populations. This paper investigates the quality of charter schools in Texas in terms of mathematics and reading achievement and finds that, after an initial start-up period, average school quality in the <b>charter</b> <b>sector</b> is {{not significantly different from}} that in regular public schools. Perhaps most important, the parental decision to exit a charter school is much more sensitive to education quality than the decision to exit a regular public school, consistent with the notion that the introduction of charter schools substantially reduces the transactions costs of switching schools. Low income charter school families are, however, less sensitive to school quality than higher income families. ...|$|E

I use a 1997 - 2007 panel of all North Carolina {{public school teachers}} to examine the qualifications and classroom performance of mainstream teachers moving to the <b>charter</b> <b>sector.</b> High rates of inexperienced and uncertified teachers moved to charter schools, but among certified teachers changing schools, the on-paper qualifications of charter movers were better or not statistically different than the qualifications of teachers moving between comparable mainstream schools. Grade 3 - 5 teachers moving to charter schools had lower estimated fixed effects on end-of-grade math exams, but I find statistically weak evidence that charter movers had relatively high fixed effects within the schools they were leaving. Taken together, these findings re-veal nuanced patterns of teacher quality flowing into charter schools. Charters drew certified, highly qualified, and perhaps locally effective teachers from mainstream schools, but they also attracted uncertified and less qualified teachers. The distribution of persistent teacher qual-ity among charter participants was significantly lower than, but largely overlapped with, the quality distribution of exclusively mainstream teachers...|$|E
40|$|In 2005 Hawaii’s {{commercial}} catch fishery’s sector total output was approximately $ 74 million dollars. Additionally, the onshore/offshore recreational sector and <b>charter</b> <b>sector</b> generated another $ 500 million dollars. Hawaii’s fishery resources {{are an important}} source of income for Islanders directly and indirectly dependent upon these resources. However the use of these resources also raises environmental concerns. The impact of the commercial longline industry on endangered species, namely the leatherback turtle, was considered by the courts to be devastating to the species while the bottomfish fishery has been heavily monitored for overfishing concerns. Decision-making in fishery management often relies on knowledge about the economic contribution, linkages, and impacts of the fisheries sector on the overall economy. For example, a key factor concerning recent regulations over longline fishing in Hawaii is their economy-wide impacts (Leung and Pooley, 2002). Quantitative assessment of the fisheries sector’s social and economic contribution is crucial for policymakers to assess the sector’s importance. The impacts of fisheries development are not contained within the sector but are transmitted {{to the rest of the}} economy. On th...|$|E

40|$|Regardless {{whether the}} American charter school can improve {{academic}} performance and provide effective alternatives to traditional public schools, its steady entrenchment as an institution portends significant, destabilizing changes across education law. In no area will its impact be more profound than the law of religion and schooling. Despite the general view that charter schools are public schools, charters’ neoliberal character — they are privately created and managed, and chosen by consumers in a marketplace — makes them private schools for Establishment Clause purposes, notwithstanding their public subsidy. This conclusion, which rests in substantial part on the Zelman v. Simmons-Harris vouchers case, implies that very substantial amounts of government money could be directed towards religious institutions as the <b>charter</b> <b>sector</b> expands. State decisions to permit or forbid religious chartering will determine {{the magnitude of this}} shift. But even states seeking to forbid religious chartering will find that the bottom-up, market-oriented structure of chartering invites religiously oriented educational entrepreneurs and parents to exploit the fuzziness of the categories “religion” and “school” in order to undermine such a ban. Practical and constitutional constraints upon the regulatory tools that the neoliberal paradigm makes available to states — rulemaking and exercising bureaucratic discretion when approving and renewing charters — ensure that efforts to abolish religion in charters will enjoy only partial success...|$|E
40|$|Ohio's charter-closure law is {{touted as}} one of the toughest in the nation because it {{requires}} the automatic closure of charter schools that consistently fail to meet academic standards. The law has been showcased by the National Association of Charter School Authorizers (NACSA) in its "One Million Lives" campaign, which calls for tougher state laws to close failing charter schools. The widespread attention and support of the NACSA campaign has pushed Ohio's closure law into the spotlight as a model of accountability for low-performing charter schools. However, The Plain Dealer's editorial board, in a commentary on NACSA's praise of Ohio's charter school accountability standards, pointed out what NACSA did not: Ohio's charter school laws, while they may have stronger mandates for closure than those of other states, are still replete with loopholes. Since the charter-closure law went into effect in 2008, 20 schools across the state have met closure criteria, and all are currently listed as closed by the Ohio Department of Education (ODE). But an investigation of the schools by Policy Matters revealed that eight schools [...] and the management companies that run them [...] have found ways to skirt the closure law and remain open, severely undermining the law's effectiveness and highlighting the lax accountability that prevails in Ohio's <b>charter</b> <b>sector.</b> For-profit managers [...] the Leona Group, Mosaica Education and White Hat Management [...] operate six of the reopened schools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{analysis}} examines {{proposed changes}} to the management of Pacific halibut in the charter fisheries and commercial setline fisheries in International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Regulatory Areas 2 C and 3 A in the Gulf of Alaska. The preferred alternative would implement a catch sharing plan for the charter and commercial sectors in these areas to resolve conservation and allocation concerns that have resulted from increased harvests in the charter halibut fishery in both areas, and decreased catch limits in the commercial setline fisheries in Area 2 C. The plan would (1) replace the current guideline harvest levels (GHLs); (2) set initial allocations for each sector; (3) implement management measures to limit charter harvests to the allocations; and (4) allow charter halibut limited entry permit (LEP) holders to lease halibut individual fishing quota from commercial quota share holders, to increase their seasonal allocations for use by their clients. The plan would require pre-season notice of upcoming management measures to allow an uninterrupted charter season. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) intends that the allocations to both sectors vary with halibut abundance; hence, its preferred alternative includes a fixed percentage allocation. The initial <b>charter</b> <b>sector</b> allocation would be 17. 3 percent of the Area 2 C combined commercial and charter catch limit when it {{is determined by the}} IPHC to be less than 5 Mlb; the allocation would be 15. 1 percent when the combined catch limit is 5 Mlb or more.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{estimates}} {{rates of}} shark depredation in the charter boat fishery on Protea Banks, KwaZulu-Natal. Previous estimates based on fisher surveys suggested that shark depredation {{is a concern}} locally and may distort fishing mortality estimates. Methods involved quantitative data collection by an onboard observer from November 2013 to January 2014. Catch composition data were collected to enable comparisons with the commercial and recreational catch returns used in monitoring and assessment. Results revealed an average depredation rate of 8. 4 % that varied depending on the species fishers targeted. Depredation was highest when catching pelagic species (18. 6 %) and lowest when catching reef species (1. 9 %). Depredation rates were highest in November (19. 6 %) and lowest in January (5. 3 %). Observed rates were highest on the Banks itself and immediately offshore (9. 9 %), but no depredation was observed inshore of the Banks. The most commonly identified sharks involved in depredation incidents were the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus). Multi-dimensional scaling showed commercial catch composition to be significantly different from recreational and charter catch composition, mainly due to abundance of tuna in the recreational and <b>charter</b> <b>sectors.</b> No significant relationship was found between catch composition and shark depredation. Depredation is estimated to cost charter fishing operators 8 % of their revenue.

Annual amendments to federal regulations have been required in Area 2 C to match the management measure(s) to constrain charter halibut harvests to the GHL.
