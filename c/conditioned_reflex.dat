Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina, and is attributed to several vaginal diseases, while vaginismus is an involuntary tightening of the vagina muscles caused by a <b>conditioned</b> <b>reflex,</b> or disease, during vaginal penetration. HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital herpes and trichomoniasis {{are some of the}} STIs that may affect the vagina, and health sources recommend safe sex (or barrier method) practices to prevent the transmission of these and other STIs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined <b>conditioned</b> <b>reflex</b> and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} neural actions underlying Pavlovian conditioning {{are entirely}} unknown. Likely {{to play an}} important role in the future elucidation of such neural correlates is the recording of the electrical activity of the brain during the formation and performance of various <b>conditioned</b> <b>reflexes</b> (CR). Evidence that blocking of the alpha rhythm can be "conditioned " has been recently reviewed and greatly extended by Morrell and Jasper (1956) and summarized by Ellingson (1956). Gastaut et al. (1957) have demonstrated localized electroencephalographic effects cor-related with anticipatory motor reactions in man. There are also brief reports (Galambos, Sheatz and Vernier 1956; Jouvet, Benoit and Courjon 1956) that potentials evoked by au-ditory stimnli increase in amplitude and dis-tribution after pairing with nociceptive stim-ulation. Both the EEG blocking and evoked potential reactions have features similar to more usual forms of <b>conditioned</b> <b>reflexes</b> in showing extinction, differentiation, etc., and may ultimately prove to be of interest in studying mechanisms of behavioral condition-ing.

40|$|The {{possibility}} was explored {{that certain}} central brain-stem areas might be {{critical for the}} performance of <b>conditioned</b> <b>reflexes.</b> In 6 cats, large bilateral electrolytic lesions were placed in the medial diencephalon or mesencephalon and subsequently defined by histology. A tone served as conditional stimulus and foot-shock as unconditional stimulus. The EEG, respiration, and the EMG of the conditioned limb were recorded. Persistent low voltage, fast activity consistently reappeared in the EEG in 7 to 10 days and was seen even after destruction of over 100 mm 3 of the mesencephalon, including the reticular formation. <b>Conditioned</b> <b>reflexes</b> usually appeared only when such faster EEG patterns were present. <b>Conditioned</b> <b>reflexes</b> and discrimination between tones could occur, however, during relatively high voltage, slow activity in the cortical areas sampled. Extensive lesions essentially transecting the ascending reticular system or destroying the posterior hypothalamus did not preclude conditioning. In contrast, one animal could not be retrained when lesions were in the mamillary area. It is concluded that the medial mesencephalic systems are not essential for this type of conditioning and that, if any essential system does exist, it is located in the region of the mamillary bodies, field H 1 of Forel, center median, and the habenulopeduncular tract...|$|R
