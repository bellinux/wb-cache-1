5|$|The Association {{itself has}} a long history, and in fact predates Manor Hall being {{originally}} formed in 1925 as the ‘Elton House Old Students’ Association’ by Winifred Armstead. In 1932, when the ladies from Elton House relocated to the newly built Manor Hall, the Association was renamed accordingly. The Association {{is run by a}} committee of volunteers and was wound up pro tem in 2005 due to incumbent committee growing too old to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> work with members being transferred to the Wills Hall Association until such a time as new officers could be found to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> work.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Kennedy Martin {{had written}} {{the first draft of}} what would {{eventually}} become Edge of Darkness – at this stage it was called Magnox (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in the nuclear industry. The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> development. The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{committee}} investigated in private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain, as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E

5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} {{dominate}} the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suffering}} numerous tactical reverses, operationally the Germans diverted the Allied First Army Group {{from the}} lower Ardennes area. In the process his forces, along with the Luftwaffe depleted Prioux' Cavalry Corps. When news of the German breakthrough at Sedan reached Prioux, he withdrew from Gembloux. With the Gembloux gap breached, the German Panzer Corps, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, were no longer required by Army Group B and were handed over to Army Group A. Army Group B would <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> own offensive to force {{the collapse of the}} Meuse front. The Army Group {{was in a position to}} advance westward to Mons, outflank the BEF and Belgian Army protecting the Dyle–Brussels sector, or turn south to outflank the French 9th Army.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball, deep inside Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> drive. Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{resistance}} was encountered that {{day as the}} 2/2nd Infantry Battalion advanced towards the high ground around Oivi. They were held up {{for a number of}} days until outflanking moves by the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, temporarily detached to the 25th Brigade, pushed the Japanese back and enabled the brigade to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> advance. Gorari was taken and by mid-November the brigade, having suffered 471 battle casualties since the being committed to the fighting around Kokoda, finally reached Wairopi, where the swollen Kumusi River was forded.|$|E
5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had {{apparently}} ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had already turned gray.|$|E
5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal candidates. On 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election to the Conservative candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; the women were beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting to the goal of women's suffrage and criticised other organisations for putting party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E

Two weeks later, Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist emails intended for the alleged downloaders. The company did not obtain subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their subscribers. Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E
5|$|The deep-level {{station was}} opened by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS, later the Bakerloo line) on 1 December 1913 as the {{temporary}} terminus of its extension from Edgware Road. To enable the BS to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> {{route to the}} north-west of Paddington, the station platforms were constructed in a tight curve. A cross-over between tracks and reversing tunnels were provide beyond the new station. Construction work continued beyond the station to extend the line further to Queen's Park where it met the mainline tracks of the London and North Western Railway. The extension opened in stages, with the first trains running to and from Warwick Avenue on 31 January 1915.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} changes of driver before the race. Red Bull Racing Team {{announced}} regular driver A. J. Allmendinger {{would be replaced}} by Mike Skinner who would drive at Talladega, and by former Scuderia Torro Rosso, Formula One driver Scott Speed who would drive in the seven remaining races of the season. Red Bull Racing {{vice president and general}} manager Jay Frye said this change would allow the Red Bull Racing Team to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> development for the future. Kenny Wallace took over from Michael McDowell in the No. 00 Michael Waltrip Racing car at Talladega, because the team decided to regroup after he failed to qualify the previous race weekend at Kansas Speedway. Richard Childress Racing fielded a fourth car driven by Nationwide Series driver Mike Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the outcome}} of the Holbrooke–Tuđman meeting and the {{assessment}} of the HV General Staff that the VRS 2nd Corps was completely destroyed, a decision was made to deploy the HV to the area with virtually no preparation and planning. The assessment of the HV General Staff was based on ARBiH gains in western Bosnia and Herzegovina over the previous four days. The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> rapid advance towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila {{for failing to}} suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the International Criminal Court in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E
