5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E

The amount of naphthalene produced on the pyrolysis varied largely from chondrite to <b>chondrite,</b> and the <b>carbonaceous</b> matter in these chondrites could {{be divided into}} five groups by the efficiency of formation of pyrolysis products. The groups did not accord with any conventional subdivisions of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites.</b> The grouping based on the pyrolytic nature of the major carbonaceous matter may give additional information about secondary metamorphism in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hydrous <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> {{experienced}} hydration {{and subsequent}} dehydration by heating, {{which resulted in}} a variety of mineralogical and spectral features [e. g., 1 - 6]. The degree of heating is classified according to heating stage (HS) II to IV based on mineralogy of phyllosilicates [2], because they change, with elevating temperature, to poorly crystal-line phases and subsequently to aggregates of small secondary anhydrous silicates of mainly olivine. Heating of hydrous <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> also causes spectral changes and volatile loss [3 - 6]. Experimental heating of Murchison CM chondrite showed flattening of whole visible-near infrared spectra, especially weakening of the 3 m band strength [1, 4, 7]. In order to understand mineralogical, spectral, and compositional changes during heating of hydrous <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites,</b> we have carried out systematic investigation of mineralogy, reflectance spectra, and volatile composition of hydrated and dehydrated <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> as well as experimentally-heated hydrous <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites.</b> In addition, we investigated reflectance spectra of tochilinite that is a major phase of CM chondrites and has a low dehydration temperature (~ 250 degC) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> {{composition}} have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early {{in the history of}} Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|While rare on Earth, {{silicon carbide}} is remarkably common in space. It {{is a common}} form of {{stardust}} found around carbon-rich stars, and examples of this stardust {{have been found in}} pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E

5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite,</b> which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{exposure}} {{histories of}} <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> {{have been investigated}} using cosmogenic radionuclides. Our results may indicate a clustering of exposure ages of C 1 and C 2 chondrites into two peaks, 0. 2 My and 0. 6 My, perhaps implying two collisional events of Earth-crossing parent bodies. Among <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> are some having short exposure ages which Mazor et al. hypothesized cluster into {{a small number of}} families. This hypothesis is based on spallogenic Ne- 21 exposure ages, which in some instances are difficult to determine owing to the large amounts of trapped noble gases in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites.</b> Also, since Ne- 21 is stable, it integrates a sample's entire exposure history, so meteorites with complex exposure histories are difficult to understand using exclusively Ne- 21. Cosmogenic radionuclides provide an alternative means of determining the recent cosmic ray exposure duration. To test the hypothesis of Mazor et al. we have begun a systematic investigation of exposure histories of Antarctic and non-Antarctic <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> especially C 2 s...|$|R

25|$|The surface {{composition}} of Ceres is broadly {{similar to that}} of C-type asteroids. Some differences do exist. The ubiquitous features of the Cererian IR spectra are those of hydrated materials, which indicate the presence of significant amounts of water in the interior. Other possible surface constituents include iron-rich clay minerals (cronstedtite) and carbonate minerals (dolomite and siderite), which are common minerals in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> meteorites. The spectral features of carbonates and clay minerals are usually absent in the spectra of other C-type asteroids. Sometimes Ceres is classified as a G-type asteroid.|$|E
25|$|The Rosetta probe {{actually}} {{found that the}} asteroid has a moderately red spectrum in the visible light and essentially flat spectrum in the near infrared. No absorption features were detected in the range covered by observations, 0.4–3.5μm. Thus previous reports of hydrated minerals and organic compounds {{on the surface of}} Lutetia have been disproven. The surface also does not contain any olivine. Together with the high density of Lutetia these results indicate that it is either made of the enstatite chondrite material or may be related to metal-rich and water-poor <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> of classes like CB, CH, or CR.|$|E
30|$|The abundances {{of major}} and minor {{elements}} of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> are summarized in Fig. 2 (b).

Presolar dust grains extracted from the <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> provide direct information on the previous generations of stars that provided the materials present for planet formation. The organic material found in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> consist of amino acids, carboxylic acids and sugar derivatives.

25|$|The {{physical}} {{composition of}} asteroids is varied {{and in most}} cases poorly understood.

Most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though the largest are probably solid. Some asteroids have moons or are co-orbiting binaries: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered asteroid families are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid.|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{difficulty}} in the asteroid {{hypothesis is that}} a stony object should have produced a large crater where it struck the ground, but no such crater has been found. It has been hypothesised that {{the passage of the}} asteroid through the atmosphere caused pressures and temperatures to build up to a point where the asteroid abruptly disintegrated in a huge explosion. The destruction would have to have been so complete that no remnants of substantial size survived, and the material scattered into the upper atmosphere during the explosion would have caused the skyglows. Models published in 1993 suggested that the stony body would have been about [...] across, with physical properties somewhere between an ordinary chondrite and a <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite.</b> Typical <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrite</b> substance tends to be dissolved with water rather quickly unless it is frozen.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} parent body processes on the abundance, distribution, and enantiomeric composition of amino acids in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites,</b> the water extracts from nine different powdered Cl, CM, and CR <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> were analyzed for amino acids by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-FD/ToF-MS). Four aqueously altered type 1 <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> including Orgueil (C 11), Meteorite Hills (MET) 01070 (CM 1), Scott Glacier (SCO) 06043 (CM 1), and Grosvenor Mountains (GRO) 95577 (CR 1) were analyzed using this technique for the first time. Analyses of these meteorites revealed low levels of two- to five-carbon acyclic amino alkanoic acids with concentrations ranging from - 1 to 2, 700 parts-per-billion (ppb). The type 1 <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> have a distinct distribution of the five-carbon (C 5) amino acids with much higher relative abundances of the gamma- and delta-amino acids compared to the type 2 and type 3 <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites,</b> which are dominated by a-amino acids. Much higher amino acid abundances {{were found in the}} CM 2 chondrites Murchison, Lonewolf Nunataks (LON) 94102, and Lewis Cliffs (LEW) 90500, the CR 2 Elephant Moraine (EET) 92042, and the CR 3 Queen Alexandra Range (QUE) 99177. For example, a-aminoisobutyric acid ((alpha-AIB) and isovaline were approximately 100 to 1000 times more abundant in the type 2 and 3 chondrites compared to the more aqueously altered type 1 chondrites. Most of the chiral amino acids identified in these meteorites were racemic, indicating an extraterrestrial abiotic origin. However, non-racemic isovaline was observed in the aqueously altered <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> Murchison, Orgueil, SCO 06043, and GRO 95577 with L-isovaline excesses ranging from approximately 11 to 19 %, whereas the most pristine, unaltered <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> analyzed in this study had no detectable L-isovaline excesses. These results are consistent with the theory that aqueous alteration {{played an important role in}} amplification of small initial left handed isovaline excesses on the parent bodies...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the results}} of the present analysis, <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>chondrites</b> are {{obviously}} not pristine samples of proto-solar-system condensates. In terms of chemistry, however, these chondrites may represent the most primitive solar system materials known.
