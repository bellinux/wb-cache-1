The school, a nonsectarian nonprofit college preparatory day school, taught students at pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade levels and had small <b>class</b> <b>sizes,</b> with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students. Since 1980, the buildings and property have been owned by The Clear View School, which runs a day treatment program for 83 students.

5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates {{the needs of students}} with smaller <b>class</b> <b>sizes,</b> staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, more predictable environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] When we {{ask whether}} <b>class</b> <b>size</b> matters for achievement, it is {{essential}} to ask also, how <b>class</b> <b>size</b> matters. This is important for three reasons. First, if we can observe not only achievement differences, but also the mechanisms through which the differences are produced, this will increase our confidence that the differences are real, and not an artifact of some unmeasured or inadequately controlled condition. Second, the effects of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> may vary in different circumstances, and identifying how <b>class</b> <b>size</b> affects achievement will help us to understand why the effects of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> are variable. Third, the potential benefits of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> reduction may be greater than what we observe. For example, suppose <b>class</b> <b>size</b> reductions aid achievement, but only when teachers modify instructional practices {{to take advantage of the}} smaller classes. If a few teachers make such modifications, but most do not, then understanding how <b>class</b> <b>size</b> affects achievement in some cases will help reveal its potential effects, even if the potential is generally unrealized...|$|R

50|$|To {{differentiate}} {{student-teacher ratio}} and <b>class</b> <b>size,</b> {{it is important}} to know several key distinctions. <b>Class</b> <b>size,</b> generally speaking, refers to the average <b>class</b> <b>size</b> in a given grade level of a given school. Student-teacher ratios, normally, are calculated by taking the total number of teachers at a given school divided by the complete enrollment of that school. This distinction is significant, because the ratio will not always match up with the <b>class</b> <b>size</b> figure (or vice versa). For example, a student-teacher ratio may be small but a <b>class</b> <b>size</b> may be larger than what the student-teacher ratio leads one to believe.|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{the effect}} of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> on student {{achievement}} typically find that disadvantaged students benefit more from reduced <b>class</b> <b>size</b> than others. To better understand this differential impact, we analyze changes in the learning environment due to <b>class</b> <b>size,</b> and behavioral responses to <b>class</b> <b>size</b> among parents, schools, teachers and students. The variation in <b>class</b> <b>size</b> is induced by a maximum <b>class</b> <b>size</b> rule applying to upper primary schools in Sweden. We find that in response to an increase in class size: i) teachers seem to assign more responsibility to students; ii) low-income students find their teachers hard to follow when taught in full-class iii) high-income parents help their children more with homework; iv) parents are more likely to change schools; and v) other school inputs and student effort adjust very little. These findings help explain why we find that the negative effect of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> on achievement in our data is concentrated among low-income students...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>class</b> <b>size</b> on student {{achievement}} has long been of concern to educators, parents, and scholars. In Israeli public schools today, <b>class</b> <b>size</b> is partly determined using a rule proposed by Maimonides in the 12 th century. This rule induces a nonlinear and non-monotonic relationship between enroll- ment <b>size</b> and <b>class</b> <b>size.</b> We use this relationship to construct instrumental variables estimates {{of the effect of}} <b>class</b> <b>size</b> on the test scores of Israeli 4 th and 5 th graders in 1991 and 3 rd graders in 1992. Because the up-and-down pattern in <b>class</b> <b>size</b> induced by Maimonides' rule matches a similar pattern in test scores, the rule provides a credible source of exogenous variation for investigation of the causal effect of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> {{on student achievement}}. Our use of Maimonides' rule can be viewed as an application of Campbell's (1969) regression-discontinuity design to the <b>class</b> <b>size</b> question. The results of this application show that reductions in <b>class</b> <b>size</b> induce a significant increase in reading and math scores for 5 th graders and a smaller increase in reading scores for 4 th graders. In contrast, there is little evidence of any association between <b>class</b> <b>size</b> and the test scores of 3 rd graders, although this finding may result from problems with the 1992 wave of the testing program. The estimates also suggest that the gains from small classes are largest for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Besides being of metho- dological interest and providing new evidence on the <b>class</b> <b>size</b> question, these findings are of immediate policy interest in Israel where legislation to reduce the maximum <b>class</b> <b>size</b> is pending. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of a considerable and current educational literature concerned with the effect of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> on student achievement, the results of attempts to empirically identify the relationship between the variables <b>class</b> <b>size</b> and student achievement are mixed at best. These attempts have typically been hindered, however, by {{the existence}}, at least, of one of four factors: (1) the use of a student/teacher ratio as the measure of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> resulting in measurement error; (2) the estimation of a mis-specified model resulting from the failure to control for family effects (i. e., student innate ability); (3) the general failure {{to take into account the}} endogeneity of <b>class</b> <b>size</b> with respect to student achievement; and (4) the employment of an incorrect functional form when specifying the relationship between <b>class</b> <b>size</b> and student achievement.
