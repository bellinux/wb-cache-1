25|$|As part of {{the peace}} {{settlement}} of the War of the Spanish succession, Britain obtained the asiento, a Spanish government contract, to supply slaves to Spain's new world colonies, providing British traders and smugglers more access to the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America. This arrangement also contributed heavily {{to the spread of}} piracy across the western Atlantic at this time. Shipping to the colonies boomed simultaneously with the flood of skilled mariners after the war. Merchant shippers used the surplus of sailors' labor to drive wages down, <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> to maximize their profits, and creating unsavory conditions aboard their vessels. Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported (Rediker, 2004). Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a pirate. The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it. Among the most infamous Caribbean pirates of the time, was Edward Teach or Blackbeard, Calico Jack Rackham and Bartholomew Roberts. Most of these pirates were eventually hunted down by the Royal Navy and killed or captured; several battles were fought between the brigands and the colonial powers on both land and sea.|$|E

2500|$|Paula Jefferson, head of Beachcroft LLP's Disease Group, said: [...] "Any {{organisation}} {{involved in}} any activity in the future, where there {{is the potential for}} release of harmful substances in to the atmosphere, should ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to identify the potential contamination and to then ensure that they either employ, or have themselves the necessary skills, to deal with that contamination. The principles in the judgment apply not just when there is demolition in progress, but to any activity where there is potential for exposure in to the atmosphere. Where there is any known potential for such exposure, then regard should be had to not just the onsite workforce but also to those living and working in the surrounding area. In the Corby case the area of risk was 4km from the demolition site. The area for potential exposure will clearly vary depending on the circumstances of each case. In essence, the message remains the same - proper risk assessment is key and must include identifying the appropriate people to do the job and not <b>cutting</b> <b>corners,</b> which, as has been proved for Corby Borough Council, is likely to be false economy." ...|$|E
60|$|Insensibly Mr. Brumley {{moved with}} his times. It is the {{necessary}} first {{phase in the}} break-up of any system of unsound assumptions {{that a number of}} its votaries should presently set about padding its <b>cutting</b> <b>corners</b> and relieving the harsh pressure of its injustices by exuberances of humour and sentimentality. Mr. Brumley became charitable and romantic,--orthodox still but charitable and romantic. He was all for smashing with the generalization, but now in the particular instance he was more and more for forgiveness. One finds creeping into the later Euphemia books a Bret-Harte-like doctrine that a great number of bad women are really good and a persuasion in the 'Raffles' key that a large proportion of criminals are really very picturesque and admirable fellows. One wonders how far Mr. Brumley's less ostensible life was softening in harmony with this exterior change, this tender twilight of principle. He wouldn't as yet face the sterner fact that most people who are condemned by society, whether they are condemned justly or not, are by the very gregariousness of man's nature debased, and that a law or custom that stamps you as bad makes you bad. A great state should have high and humane and considerate laws nobly planned, nobly administered and needing none of these shabby little qualifications sotto voce. To find goodness in the sinner and justification in the outcast is to condemn the law, but as yet Mr. Brumley's heart failed where his intelligence pointed towards that conclusion. He hadn't the courage to revise his assumptions about right and wrong to that extent; he just allowed them to get soft and sloppy. He waded, where there should be firm ground. He waded toward wallowing. This is a perilous way of living and the sad little end of Euphemia, flushed and coughing, left him no doubt in many ways still more exposed to the temptations of the sentimental byway and the emotional gloss. Happily this is a book about Lady Harman and not an exhaustive monograph upon Mr. Brumley. We will at least leave him the refuge of a few shadows.|$|E

We also discover the geometric meaning of the auxiliary control points during the <b>corner</b> <b>cutting.</b> Our main idea is to gradually elevate the degree of B-spline curves one knot interval by one knot interval. To this end, a new class of basis functions, to be called bi-degree B-spline basis functions, is constructed and discussed by the integral definition of spline. The transformation formulas between usual and bi-degree B-spline basis functions leads to the <b>corner</b> <b>cutting</b> for degree elevation of B-spline curves. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Old age is {{associated}} with poorer movement skill, as indexed by reduced speed and accuracy. Nevertheless, reductions in speed and accuracy can also reflect compensation as well as deficit. We used a manual tracing and a driving task to identify generalized spatial and temporal compensations and deficits associated with old age. In Experiment 1, participants used a hand-held stylus to trace a path. In Experiment 2, participants steered along paths in a virtual reality driving simulator. In both experiments, participants were required {{to stay within the}} boundaries while we manipulated task difficulty by changing path width or movement speed. The older group showed worse performance in the highly constrained conditions. <b>Corner</b> <b>cutting</b> effectively reduces the curvature of bends but yields a greater risk of error (i. e., clipping the path or road edge). <b>Corner</b> <b>cutting</b> is thus less risky on wider paths, and we found that <b>corner</b> <b>cutting</b> increased for both age groups in both tasks when paths were wider. Crucially, we observed a greater degree of <b>corner</b> <b>cutting</b> in the young group compared with the old, suggesting the old group compensated for decreased motor skill with “middle-of-the-road” behavior. Enforcing increased speed caused all participants to increase <b>corner</b> <b>cutting.</b> Thus, older participants showed spatial compensation for decreased skill by biasing their position toward the middle of the path in both a manual and steering task. External constraints (narrow paths and fast speeds) prevented this strategy and revealed age-related declines in skills central to manual control and driving...|$|R

40|$|In {{experiments}} of machining hardened {{tool steels}} (such as AISI H 11, H 13, and D 2, up to 56 HRC) by commercial Ø 0. 5 mm square endmills, {{it is observed}} that the tested micro endmills showed severe wear at an early stage of the process due to chipping off around <b>cutting</b> edge <b>corners,</b> resulting in unsatisfactory tool life and product appearance (burr formation). Detailed examination of current tool geometry shows that it is mainly inherited from that of macro endmills, making the <b>cutting</b> edge <b>corners</b> the weakest part on the tool. As the micromilling process is characterized by small values of machining parameters, the <b>cutting</b> edge <b>corners</b> of the micro endmill are the most loaded part of the cutting edges. New design rules are studied for improving the stiffness and strength of micro endmills used in micro hard milling applications. Analytical modelling and finite element method analysis are used to aid the design of tool geometry. By using a larger neck angle, optimizing tool core geometry, and choosing a negative rake angle, tool stiffness and cutting edge strength are improved. The new endmill designs, both two-flute and four-flute, are tested in experiments on hardened tool steels and showed considerable lower tool wear and increased tool life. Furthermore, the geometrical accuracy and appearance of the workpiece (burr formation) has been improved drastically. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R
