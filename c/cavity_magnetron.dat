In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV {{was used}} in the front lines for only a short period. The {{introduction}} of the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> in 1940 led to rapid progress in microwave-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the AI Mk. VIII largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a television receiver, was used as the basis of the ASV Mk. II radar, Chain Home Low, AMES Type 7, and many other radar systems throughout the war.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, {{which saw}} the {{development}} of high-power microwave emitters known as <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons,</b> {{the idea of using}} microwaves to transfer power was researched. By 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrated.|$|R
25|$|Since then, many {{millions}} of <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons</b> have been manufactured; while some have been for radar the vast majority have been for microwave ovens. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to klystron and traveling-wave tube systems for these needs.|$|R
50|$|Research on <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons</b> was {{conducted}} by another institute at Kharkov in Ukraine. In 1936, one of these magnetrons {{was used by the}} NII-9 in building a radioiskatel (radio-seeker) called Burya (Storm). Although he had earlier used pulsed transmission in ionospheres experiments, Bonch-Bruevich strongly believed in the potential of continuous-wave (CW) transmission for radio-location, and led the use of this technology in Burya.|$|R
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron,</b> a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC {{was told}} {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design. They {{introduced}} new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Following World War II, {{which saw}} the {{development}} of high-power microwave emitters known as <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons,</b> {{the idea of using}} microwaves to transmit power was researched. In 1964, William C. Brown demonstrated a miniature helicopter equipped with a combination antenna and rectifier device called a rectenna. The rectenna converted microwave power into electricity, allowing the helicopter to fly. In principle, the rectenna is capable of very high conversion efficiencies - over 90% in optimal circumstances.|$|R
50|$|A {{microwave}} oven passes microwave radiation at a frequency near 2.45 GHz cm through food, causing dielectric heating primarily by absorption {{of the energy}} in water. Microwave ovens became common kitchen appliances in Western countries in the late 1970s, following the development of less expensive <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons.</b> Water in the liquid state possesses many molecular interactions that broaden the absorption peak. In the vapor phase, isolated water molecules absorb at around 22 GHz, almost ten times {{the frequency of the}} {{microwave oven}}.|$|R
5000|$|Edward George Bowen had {{prepared}} for just this moment, {{and with a}} flourish reached into his locked box and pulled {{one of the earliest}} <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons</b> and presented it to the assembled researchers. He explained that it also worked at 10 cm wavelength, but offered dramatically higher power - not just than the Navy klystrons, but even the US's existing long wave radars. One US historian later described it as the [...] "most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores".|$|R
5|$|Oliphant {{secured the}} {{services}} of fellow Australian physicist Harrie Massey, {{who had been working}} for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron.</b> This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of the}} Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. Although based in Berkeley, he often visited Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the separation plant was, and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos. He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in the project, and had Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project. He briefed Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, on the project, and urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant's {{group at}} Birmingham worked on {{developing}} two promising devices, the klystron and the magnetron. Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed {{to produce an}} improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron.</b> By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , {{just the kind of}} short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron.</b> In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{topics in}} the Secondary School at NATTC Ward Island were {{advanced}} electronic circuits, advanced radio receivers and transmitters, antennas and arrays, synchros and servomechanisms, waveguides and microwave transmission, and <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons.</b> Laboratory efforts centered on aircraft communication systems, high-frequency and microwave radar systems, radar altimeter systems, identification, friend or foe (IFF) systems, and long-range navigation (LORAN) systems. In {{addition to the}} regular curriculum, there were special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight and the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), both highly classified at that time, and the Navy's first drone aircraft, the Target Drone Denny 1 (TDD-1).|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{radiation}} burn is a sunburn caused by UV radiation. High exposure to X-rays during diagnostic medical imaging or radiotherapy can also result in radiation burns. As the ionizing radiation interacts with cells within the body—damaging them—the body responds to this damage, typically resulting in erythema—that is, redness around the damaged area. Radiation burns are often associated with radiation-induced cancer due to the ability of ionizing radiation to interact with and damage DNA, occasionally inducing a cell to become cancerous. <b>Cavity</b> <b>magnetrons</b> can be improperly used to create surface and internal burning. Depending on the photon energy, gamma radiation can cause very deep gamma burns, with 60Co internal burns are common. Beta burns tend to be shallow as beta particles are not able to penetrate deep into the person; these burns can be similar to sunburn.|$|R
5|$|Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington, D.C., on 18 September 1943, {{and they}} {{attempted}} {{to persuade him to}} join the Los Alamos Laboratory, but Oliphant felt that he would be of more use assisting Lawrence on the electromagnetic project. Accordingly, the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley, and later move on to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had quite different designs, and that the American one was frozen, but Lawrence, who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942, was eager for Oliphant's assistance. Oliphant secured the services of a fellow Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron.</b> This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills, particularly physicists, chemists and engineers. He prevailed on Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to release Eric Burhop to work on the project. His requests for personnel were met, and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35, two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> tube was {{significantly}} improved by John Randall and Harry Boot in 1940 at the University of Birmingham, England. They invented a valve that could produce multi-kilowatt pulses at 10cm wavelength, an unprecedented discovery. The high power of pulses from their device made centimeter-band radar practical for the Allies of World War II, with shorter wavelength radars allowing detection of smaller objects from smaller antennas. The compact <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> tube drastically reduced {{the size of}} radar sets {{so that they could}} be more easily installed in night-fighter aircraft, anti-submarine aircraft and escort ships.|$|E
25|$|A key {{development}} was the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> in the UK, which allowed {{the creation of}} relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. Britain shared the technology with the U.S. during the 1940 Tizard Mission.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} the characterization of an 8 slots resonant <b>cavities</b> <b>Magnetron,</b> which undergoes the thermal-structural effects due to the cathode heating. The proposed study involves Thermal Stress (TS), Eigen-frequency (EF) and Particle Tracing (PT) analysis based on a COMSOL Multiphysics (MP) simulation. Magnetrons are well known and more utilized High Power (HP) Radiofrequency (RF) Vacuum Tube (VT) oscillators. In order to generate high power signals, they employ thermoelectric cathodes which can reach very high temperatures, necessary to produce the enough surface charge density [1]. Since device efficiency depends critically to the operating temperature, a Multiphysics (MP) approach has been adopted. A PT and an EF analysis with a computation of the power density distribution of the electric field resonant modes and particle trajectories and velocities have been performed, considering the thermal-structural modifications induced by the cathode heating to the entire structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} an X-Band Magnetron to Linear Accelerator (LINAC) High Power Transfer System consisting in an 8 resonant <b>cavities</b> <b>Magnetron</b> connected to a dedicated vacuum Dielectric Window (DW). A main analytical design of devices is shown with compact formulas and is followed by numerical optimization. Electromagnetic and Thermomechanical coupling between these devices is described, particular {{attention has been given}} to the Magnetron power coupling and DW matching. A Multiphysics modeling is proposed to consider thermal-structural effects due to the cathode heating for the Magnetron and the Joule effect for the DW. Thermal induced degradation of the device performances are estimated and proper materials and shapes are chosen in order to ensure the desired behavior of the system in operative conditions. The proposed study provided the evaluation of the Magnetron Working Points and DW Scattering parameters in Thermo-mechanical operative conditions.

25|$|All <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetrons</b> {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) {{negative}} potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|R
25|$|The great {{advance in}} {{magnetron}} design was the resonant <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> or electron-resonance magnetron, which works on entirely different principles.

25|$|As the Halifax was {{carrying}} a highly-secret <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> {{as part of the}} H2S test system the immediate recovery of the device was essential, and a team led by Bernard Lovell arrived at the crash scene that same night, and the magnetron was quickly recovered.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, the Axis powers relied {{mostly on}} (then low-powered and long wavelength) {{klystron}} technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used {{the far more}} powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> for much shorter-wavelength one centimeter microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as synchrotrons and radar systems, have since been developed.|$|E

In order to further optimize the production process of these <b>cavities</b> the <b>magnetron</b> sputtering technique has been further investigated and continued {{as an alternative to the}} already successfully operational DC bias diode sputtering method. The purpose of this poster is to present the results obtained with this technique. The Nb thickness profile along the cavity and its correlation with the electro-magnetic field distribution inside the cavity are discussed.

Finally these results will be compared with RF measurement of a production-like magnetron-coated cavity...|$|R
25|$|Late in 1940, {{as part of}} the Tizard Mission, Taffy Bowen had {{introduced}} US scientists to the British work on microwave radar using the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron.</b> After returning to the UK, Bowen's earlier observation about differences in ground returns noticed in early experiments led Philip Dee to develop a prototype ground mapping system in March of 1941, a development that would evolve into the H2S radar.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron</b> in 1940 led to a new design effort using highly directional parabolic antennas to allow both ranging and accurate bearing measurements while being much more compact. These GL Mk. III radar units were produced in the UK as the Mk. IIIB (for British), and a locally designed model from Canada as the Mk. IIIC. Both were generally replaced starting in 1944 by the superior SCR-584.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} the magnetron concept with resonator loops created by drilling holes in solid copper, an idea from W. W. Hansen's work on klystrons, the two constructed a model {{version of what}} they called the resonant <b>cavity</b> <b>magnetron.</b> They placed it inside a glass enclosure evacuated with an external vacuum pump, and placed the entire assembly between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet, which caused the electrons to bend around into a circular path.|$|E
40|$|A {{concept of}} a {{high-power}} magnetron transmitter for operation within a wideband control feedback loop in phase and amplitude is presented. This transmitter is proposed to drive Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities for intensity-frontier GeV-scale proton/ion linacs. The transmitter performance at the dynamic control was verified in experiments with CW, S-Band, 1 kW magnetrons. The wideband control of magnetrons, required for the superconducting linacs, was realized using the magnetrons, injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals. The capabilities of the magnetrons injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals and adequateness for feeding of SRF cavities were verified by measurements of the transfer function magnitude characteristics of single and 2 -cascade magnetrons, by measurements the magnetrons phase performance and by measurements of spectra of the carrier frequency. At the ratio of power of locking signal to output power less than - 13 dB (in 2 -cascade scheme per magnetron, respectively) we demonstrated a phase modulation bandwidth of over 1. 0 MHz. The carrier frequency spectrum width about of 1 Hz at the level less than - 60 dBc did not demonstrate broadening at wide range of magnitude and frequency of the phase modulation of the injection-locking signal. The wideband dynamic control of output power of the transmitter model was first experimentally demonstrated using two magnetrons, combined in power and injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals. The experiments with the injection-locked magnetrons adequately emulated the wideband dynamic control with a feedback control system, which will allow suppressing all known parasitic modulation of the accelerating field in the SRF <b>cavities.</b> The <b>magnetron</b> transmitter concept, tests of the setups and injection-locking of magnetrons by phase-modulated signals are discussed in this work.

40|$|This work is {{an attempt}} to {{elucidate}} effects that may limit efficiency in magnetrons operated at relativistic voltages (V {approximately} 500 kV). Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation is used to investigate the behavior of 14 and 22 <b>cavity,</b> cylindrical, rising-sun <b>magnetrons.</b> Power is extracted radially through a single iris located {{at the end of every}} other cavity. Numerical results show that in general output power and efficiency increase approximately linearly with increasing iris width (decreasing vacuum Q) until the total Q becomes too low for stable oscillation in the n-mode to be maintained. Beyond this point mode competition and/or switching occur and efficiency decreases. Results reveal that the minimum value of Q (maximum efficiency) that can be achieved prior to the onset of mode competition is significantly affected by the magnitude of the 0 -space-harmonic of the {pi}-mode, a unique characteristic of rising-suns, and by the magnitude of the electron current density (space-charge effects).

40|$|The beam breakup (BBU) {{instability}} {{has been}} investigated in high‐current, long‐pulse electron beams propagating through microwave cavities. Experiments are performed using a relativistic electron‐beam generator with diode parameters: 0. 7 – 0. 8 MV, 1 – 15 kA, and 0. 5 – 1. 5 μs. The magnitude of the solenoidal magnetic field places these experiments in an intermediate regime between strong focusing and weak focusing. The electron‐beam transport system consists of ten identical pillbox cavities each containing a small microwave loop antenna designed to detect the TM 110 beam breakup mode. The TM 110 microwave mode is primed in the first <b>cavity</b> by a <b>magnetron</b> tuned to the resonance frequency of 2. 5 GHz. The BBU instability growth is measured through the amplification of the 2. 5 GHz microwaves between the second and tenth cavities.
