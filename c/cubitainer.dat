40|$|By {{identifying}} {{the relationships between}} abundance and metabolic activity in a bacterial community, we advance {{our knowledge of the}} marine carbon cycle. In the present study, our goal was to examine the role of protist grazing on the metabolic activity of γ- Proteobacteria in the upwelling system off the Oregon coast. Metabolically active γ- Proteobacteria were identified and quantified by a technique which combines microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The experiment consisted of three treatments: a control, a <b>cubitainer</b> filtered to enhance the effects of grazing, and a <b>cubitainer</b> filtered to reduce the grazing pressure on heterotrophic cells. In the three treatments, changes in the γ-Proteobacteria population were independent of the entire bacterial community. We found different γ-Proteobacteria population patterns in each experimental treatment at the beginning and {{over the course of a}} 2 day incubation. In the reduced grazing environment, the increase in γ-Proteobacteria abundance was 11 times greater than the increase in the enhanced grazing environment. This suggests that γ-Proteobacteria are vulnerable to grazing pressures. Additionally, our data suggest that metabolically active γ-Proteobacteria were targeted by grazing protists. Understanding the marine microbial communities through which carbon flows depends upon further defining the relationships between grazers and specific phylogenetic bacterial groups...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} use of short-term closed-container (<b>cubitainer)</b> tests to indicate limestone dissolution rates and the corresponding alkalinity of effluent {{as a function of}} detention time in a limestone bed for passive neutralization of acidic mine drainage (AMD). Various test configurations can simulate conditions closed to the atmosphere (underground system) or open to the atmosphere (above-ground system) and the effects of limestone purity, secondary coatings, and particle size on dissolution rate. Coupled with data on the average flow rate and acidity concentration of the tested AMD, the <b>cubitainer</b> rate data can be used to estimate the long-term performance and minimum effective size of a limestone bed in an anoxic limestone drain (ALD) or comparable system. Construction characteristics and data on influent and effluent composition were collected for 5 to 11 years at five limestone drains in Pennsylvania. Influent at the Morrison and Howe Bridge discharges in the Bituminous Coalfield had average pH of 5. 3 and 5. 8 and net acidity (= computed acidity – alkalinity) of 434 and 495 mg/L as CaCO 3, respectively. Influents at the Orchard, Buck Mtn., and Hegins discharges in the Southern Anthracite Coalfield were characterized by lower pH and acidity, with average pH of 3. 5, 4. 6, and 3. 5 and net acidity of 30, 28, and 47 mg/L as CaCO 3, respectively. Effluent from each drain had higher pH, alkalinity, and Ca, and lower acidity, Fe, and Al concentrations than the influent. Although estimated detention time averaged 56 hour...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} using first-order decay equations {{with data from}} short-term closed-container (<b>cubitainer)</b> tests previously described by Watzlaf and Hedin (1993) to estimate the mass of a limestone bed for anoxic treatment of acidic mine drainage (AMD) and the expected alkalinity concentration at the outflow or intermediate points within the limestone bed. The longevity of an anoxic limestone drain (ALD) or the remaining mass of limestone (M t) at any time (t) is determined {{as a function of}} the initial mass of limestone (M 0) and decay constant (k), with units of 1 /year: M t = M 0 ·exp{-k·t}. (1) Detention time (t d) within the limestone bed is estimated {{as a function of the}} estimated mass of limestone and associated estimates of flow rate (Q), porosity (φ), and limestone density (ρ S) : t d = M t /[ρ S ·Q·(1 -φ) /φ]. (2) The concentration of alkalinity at the outflow or intermediate points within the limestone bed is determined as a function of the detention time, the influent alkalinity (C 0), the maximum or steady-state alkalinity (C M), and the rate constant (k'), with units of 1 /hour: C t = C M-[(C M-C 0) ·exp{-k'·t d}].

30|$|Live {{zooplankton}} (mainly copepods) {{were collected}} using two separate Norpac zooplankton nets (50 - and 100 -μm mesh, respectively, and {{each with a}} ring diameter of 45 cm; General Oceanics, Miami, FL, USA). At each station, nets were set to 10 m in depth and allowed to drift with the ship for 5 to 10 min. The contents of each net were carefully resuspended in buckets filled with prescreened incubation seawater. After gentle mixing, {{the contents of the}} 50 -μm net were reverse filtered through an 80 -μm mesh and siphoned (approximately 2 L) into cubitainers for the 50 - to 80 -μm AC incubations. Another subsample from the 80 -μm-mesh reverse filtrate, representing the biomass distribution {{at the start of the}} incubation (i.e., time 0), was preserved with 5 % formalin-buffered seawater. The process was repeated using the contents of the 100 -μm-mesh net and reverse filtered with a 150 -μm mesh to establish a 100 - to 150 -μm AC. All cubitainers were incubated in dark black tanks (of about 200 L in volume) filled with circulating seawater pumped constantly from the surface during each cruise. Incubation periods were 24 h for the 50 - to 80 -μm size fraction and 48 h for the 100 - to 150 -μm size fraction in order to allow sufficient time for measurable growth to occur. The lengths of the incubation periods were also carefully considered; therefore, we assumed no container effects (e.g., food limitation) for the organisms in the cubitainers during these periods. After incubation, the contents of each <b>cubitainer</b> were concentrated onto a 50 -μm mesh and preserved with 5 % formalin-buffered seawater.|$|E
