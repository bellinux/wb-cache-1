40|$|The present {{clinical}} trial {{was designed to}} evaluate the possible pharmacokinetic and electrocardiographic interactions of the gas-troenteric prokinetic drug <b>cinitapride</b> with ketoconazole. The safety and tolerability of the study treatments were also evaluated. After a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design, 16 healthy male (n 8) and female (n 8) volunteers were random-ized into four treatment groups of four subjects (two males and two females) : <b>cinitapride</b> (CTP; 1 mg t. i. d.) ketoconazole (KET; 200 mg b. i. d.), CTP placebo (PL), PLKET, and PLPL. Treat-ments were given for 7 days with a washout period of 14 days between crossover treatments. <b>Cinitapride</b> is rapidly absorbed af-ter oral administration and is metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 8 isozymes. At steady state, coadministration with ketoconazole, a potent CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor, increased mean Cmax,ss and AUC by 1. 63 - and 1. 98 -fold, respectively. Measure-ment of mean QTc interval or baseline-corrected QTc intervals on day 7 showed small increases that were due {{to the effects of}} ketoconazole alone. Comparing CTPKET versus PLKET, the differences between mean increases in the QTc parameters were always less than 2 ms. Finally, no outlier increase of the QTc interval versus baseline> 60 ms was identified after any treatment.
