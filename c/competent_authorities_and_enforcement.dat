40|$|Pharmacovigilance: Spontaneous {{reporting}} systems Srba J. Abstract Introduction: Pharmacovigilance system is consisted of several approaches used for drug safety surveillance. Spontaneous {{reporting systems}} in European {{countries have been}} established {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century. Originally, spontaneous collection of adverse drug reactions was designed for healthcare professionals. Under-reporting was in general considered as the main weakness of spontaneous reporting system. To increase the reporting activity, direct patient reporting has been included in spontaneous reporting system at national <b>competent</b> <b>authorities.</b> Aims: The aim of this work was to characterize spontaneous reporting system. Subsequently, we focused on the evaluation of position of patient-reported outcomes of adverse events (PRO-AE) in established systems of the European countries. In particular, we i) characterized reporting activity within European countries, ii) evaluated the position of adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports directly submitted by patients to national <b>competent</b> <b>authorities,</b> <b>and</b> iii) overviewed of the processing of PRO- AEs. Methodology: Practical part was based on questionnaires distributed to national <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> literature search of electronic databases with relevant published articles. Results: [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Strengthening CBRNE {{security}} in the European Union reduces the threat of and damage from CBRNE incidents. One of the main issues facing the EU {{security in}}dustry is its highly fragmented nature, exhibiting a lack of standardization and harmonised certification procedures. The need for standardised information exchange between <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> international bodies regarding radiation measurements and data analysis has been recognised by several experts in response to Commission mandate M/ 487 {{for the establishment of}} European security standards. This report will suggest a way forward to develop protocols for more efficient cooperation between <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> reachback centres at the national and international level. Not all EU Member States have the capabilities to process data provided by nuclear security instruments, and thus should consider instigating a coordinated capability yielding a more efficient and comprehensive approach in responding to future nuclear emergencies. This could be achieved by reachback centres across Europe (built upon existing national facilities and expertise) and would provide analysis services for alarm adjudication. Efficient data sharing and processing across EU Member States requires the use of standard data formats and protocols. JRC. G. 5 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R
