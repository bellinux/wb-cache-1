According to data obtained from tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000-2,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>colder</b> <b>climate,</b> ectothermic {{reptiles}} {{are all but}} absent, {{with two}} species of garter snake and the western painted turtle being the only three reptile species proven to exist. Similarly, only six species of amphibians are documented, although those species exist in large numbers. After a forest fire in 2001, a few park roads were temporarily closed the following year to allow thousands of western toads to migrate to other areas.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E

5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the <b>colder</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge visited Kentucky in May 1843. His {{efforts to}} mediate between {{his mother and}} the Breckinridges {{extended}} his visit and after he contracted influenza, he decided to remain for the summer rather than returning to Iowa's <b>colder</b> <b>climate.</b> While at home, he met Bullock's cousin, Mary Cyrene Burch, and by September, they were engaged. In October, Breckinridge went to Iowa to close out his business, then returned to Kentucky and formed a law partnership with Samuel Bullock, Thomas's cousin. He married on December 12, 1843, and settled in Georgetown, Kentucky. The couple had six children – Joseph Cabell (b. 1844), Clifton Rodes (b. 1846; later a Congressman from Arkansas), Frances (b. 1848), John Milton (b. 1849), John Witherspoon (b. 1850) and Mary Desha (b. 1854). Gaining confidence in his ability as a lawyer, Breckinridge moved his family back to Lexington in 1845 and formed a partnership with future U.S. Senator James B. Beck.|$|E
5|$|England had {{a diverse}} {{geography}} {{in the medieval}} period, from the Fenlands of East Anglia or the heavily wooded Weald, through to the upland moors of Yorkshire. Despite this, medieval England broadly formed two zones, roughly divided by the rivers Exe and Tees: {{the south and east}} of England had lighter, richer soils, able to support both arable and pastoral agriculture, while the poorer soils and <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> of the north and west produced a predominantly pastoral economy. Slightly more land was covered by trees than in the 20th century, and bears, beavers and wolves lived wild in England, bears being hunted to extinction by the 11th century and beavers by the 12th. Of the 10,000 miles of roads that had been built by the Romans, many remained in use and four were of particular strategic importance—the Icknield Way, the Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street—which criss-crossed the entire country. The road system was adequate for the needs of the period, although it was significantly cheaper to transport goods by water. The major river networks formed key transport routes, while many English towns formed navigable inland ports.|$|E

25|$|The Nordic Bronze Age was {{initially}} {{characterized by a}} warm climate that began with a climate change around 2700 BC. The climate was {{comparable to that of}} present-day central Germany and northern France and permitted a relatively dense population and good opportunities for farming; for example, grapes were grown in Scandinavia at this time. A minor change in climate occurred between 850 BC and 760 BC, introducing a wetter, <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> and a more radical climate change began around 650 BC.|$|E
25|$|During {{the three}} {{phases of the}} Jōmon period the {{population}} was primarily hunter-gatherer with some primitive agriculture skills and their behaviour was predominantly determined by changes in climatic conditions and other natural stimulants. Early dwellings were pit houses consisting of shallow pits with tamped earth floors and grass roofs designed to collect rainwater {{with the aid of}} storage jars. Later in the period, a <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> with greater rainfall led to a decline in population, which contributed to an interest in ritual. Concentric stone circles first appeared during this time.|$|E

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 25 % of the remaining oil and gas reserves worldwide are held in Arctic regions. The combined effects of a global resource depletion, climate change and technological progress, mean that this natural resource area is now increasingly interesting and commercially attractive. However, numerous challenges are present {{when it comes to}} hydrocarbon production in <b>cold</b> <b>climate,</b> not only related to suitable technology, but also to social and environmental issues. Any hydrocarbon development in the Arctic represents, thus, a balance between opportunity and risk. This thesis analyzes a broad range of aspects influencing offshore hydrocarbon field development scenarios in <b>cold</b> <b>climate,</b> emphasizing on terminals as a major building block necessary {{in the development of a}} petroleum field. Feasible, safe and cost effective terminal concepts for <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> areas, face challenges that need specific assessment of technical solutions and operational aspects. Many of these challenges can be managed, though at additional cost, through the application of customised solutions. After having presented and gained the necessary knowledge and insight in the main issues influencing a <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> terminal, an assessment of different development schemes is carried out, using for this purpose three case studies located in the Barents Sea: Johan Castberg, Sn&# 248;hvit and Goliat fields. In this context, a quantitative assessment of breakwater stability in <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> environments has been an important part of the discussions. Finally, given the complex and often unique risk challenges present in <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> regions, risk assessment arise as an important part of the decision making process, and thus, has been used to understand the sensitivity of different development schemes. The Master thesis, therefore, provides an insight in the following aspects:- Aspects influencing offshore hydrocarbon field development scenarios in <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b> - Technical issues influencing a <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> terminal, with a thorough quantitative discussion of breakwater stability and design in <b>cold</b> <b>climate.</b> - Operational issues influencing a <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> terminal. - Assessment of the sensitivity of different schemes through case studies analysis. - Risk assessment for identification and evaluation of the main risks involved, applied to the case studies. </p...|$|R

25|$|The violin maker Antonio Stradivari {{produced}} his instruments {{during the}} Little Ice Age. The <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> is proposed to {{have caused the}} wood used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods, contributing to {{the tone of his}} instruments. According to the science historian James Burke, the period inspired such novelties in everyday life as the widespread use of buttons and button-holes, knitting of custom-made undergarments to better cover and insulate the body. Fireplace hoods were installed to make more efficient use of fires for indoor heating, and enclosed stoves were developed, with early versions often covered with ceramic tiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{ice sheet}} escapes {{much of the}} influence of heat transfer from the ocean or from cyclones, and its high elevation also acts to give it a <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> since temperatures tend to decrease with elevation. The result is winter temperatures that are lower {{than anywhere else in the}} Arctic, with average January temperatures of −45°C to −30°C (−49°F to −22°F), depending on location and on which data set is viewed. Minimum temperatures in winter over the higher parts of the ice sheet can drop below −60°C (−76°F; CIA, 1978). In the station climatology figure above, the Centrale plot is representative of the high Greenland Ice Sheet.|$|E
25|$|The {{high rates}} of {{mortality}} were not all due to combat. As was common before antibiotics were developed, disease caused more deaths than war wounds. Bad food and poor sanitation contributed to disease among troops and civilians. Among the Brazilians, two-thirds of the dead died either in a hospital or on the march. At {{the beginning of the}} conflict, most Brazilian soldiers came from the north and northeast regions; the change from a hot to a <b>colder</b> <b>climate,</b> combined with restricted food rations, may have weakened their resistance. Entire battalions of Brazilians were recorded as dying after drinking water from rivers. Therefore, some historians believe cholera, transmitted in the water, was a leading cause of death during the war.|$|E

25|$|Unsupported, Sinclair {{abandoned}} the mission in 1851 and continued his work elsewhere; the structures were inhabited again by Rundle's Methodist successors, Rev. Thomas Woolsey and Henry Steinhauer from 1856–8. Woolsey found {{the area was}} prone to a poor growing season to due a <b>colder</b> <b>climate,</b> had poor soil conditions, and due to a shrinking Bison population, there was violence amongst the native tribes in the area who relied on it for food. Thus, Woolsey eventually opened a new mission near Smoky Lake in 1861. Sinclair and Woolsey maintained Rundle's remaining followers, and the Methodist church in central Alberta survived and grew into the 20th century. Eventually the Methodists joined with the Presbyterians and Congregationalists to form the United Church of Canada in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Around 1300–1350 the Medieval Warm Period {{gave way}} to the Little Ice Age. The <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> {{resulted}} in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317. The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by this epidemic range from one third to as much as sixty percent. By around 1420, the accumulated effect of recurring plagues and famines had reduced the population of Europe to perhaps no {{more than a third of}} what it was a century earlier. The effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in France during the Hundred Years' War.|$|E

The fluctuations in climate in the Eastern Colombian Andes {{have been studied}} around Lake Fúquene {{at an altitude of}} , {{to the north of the}} Bogotá savanna. During the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene, the paleoecology of the region varied drastically, marking movements of the upper tree line and the types of vegetation. Pollen analysis shows that páramo vegetation was abundant from 30 ka to 17,500 years ago, with an increase in Andean forest frequency dated at 15.6 ka. Between 13,000 and 11,000 years BP, a decrease in Andean forest percentage is observed, indicative of a <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> than before. This period has been named the Fúquene stadial. The stadial is followed by an interstadial (Guantivá), with an increase in lake levels of Lake Fúquene. The wetter periods of the interstadial covered earlier paleotopography with humic sediments.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northern}} part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. For instance, Puerto Aisén, at 45°24' south latitude, receives 2,973.3 millimeters of rain per year. However, unlike in Valdivia, the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Aisén. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average 13.6°C in the summer months and 4.7°C in the winter months. Although the area generally is chilly and wet, the combination of channels, fjords, snowcapped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within such a narrow space makes for breathtaking views. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country have given way to others better adapted to a generally <b>colder</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
