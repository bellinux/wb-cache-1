In detail, for a PAN precursor fiber the viscosity of a spinning dope and the draw ratio during the spinning process needs to be considered. Through wet spinning, different types of PAN precursor fibers with defined spinning parameters, including solid content, solvent content in a bath, and especially draw ratio resulting in defined <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>diameters,</b> were fabricated and analyzed with tensile tests, density investigations, SEM, TGA-MS, FTIR, and XRD.

40|$|Steroidal {{surfactants}} like {{bile salts}} have a rigid amphiphilic structure {{significantly different from}} the typical head–tail one. As a result, these molecules show peculiar features in their self-assembly behavior and solubilization and permeation abilities. Bile salts are widely used as starting materials in the preparation of synthetic derivatives by changing their amphiphilic structure and by introducing specific functionalities. Due to the steroid rigidity and the peculiar distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, these molecules self-organize in ordered supramolecular assemblies and are particularly attractive for the bottom up construction of complex nanostructures. They often self-assemble in 1 D structures such as tubes or fibers and show low molecular weight gelator features. Their tubular nanoscale structures have <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>diameters</b> spanning a wide range of values (inner diameter 3 – 450 nm) and are sometimes formed through appealing pH or temperature responsive aggregations. Moreover, mixtures of these surfactants allow in some cases the preparation of mixed tubes with tunable composition and related features such as charge and sizes. The unconventional amphiphilic molecular structure of BSs dictates also remarkable abilities as carriers across tissues and membranes of many compounds (e. g. drugs, carbohydrates and ions).

For that task, a coordinated systematic experimental&-numerical work on the dynamic tensile test has been conducted. Experiments were performed using a tensile Kolsky apparatus for impact velocities ranging from 10 to 40 m/s. Three different sample-gauge lengths &- 7, 30 and 50 mm &- were considered for which the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>diameter</b> is 3. 4 mm. The experiments revealed that the specimens' ductility to fracture depends on strain rate and sample length. Furthermore it was observed that, for those specimens having gauge lengths of 30 and 50 mm, the necking location varies with impact velocity. Numerical simulations of the dynamic tensile tests were carried out in order to characterize the dynamics of neck inception and development. For each specimen calculated, three types of boundary conditions were used, all of which match the experimentally measured strain-rate. It was pointed out that, while boundary conditions hardly affect the calculated stress&-strain characteristics, they strongly affect the wave propagation dynamics in the specimen thus dictating the necking location.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system is to measure the beam orbit in the accelerator. The BPM data {{will be used for}} {{correcting}} closed orbit distortions (COD), and to optimize the operation of the rings. At KEKB the data are also used for analyzing the alignment and strength errors of magnetic components in the rings. The latter purpose requires a BPM system with good stability and high precision. This cannot be easily realized with a “fast ” system where the beam positions are measured every turn. Therefore, the system adopted at KEKB is a “slow ” system, where measurements are performed for the beam positions averaged over many turns. A similar system has been used at TRISTAN for several years, and its operation has been well proven. An electrostatic pickup unit at KEKB consists of four disk electrodes. A pickup unit will be installed near every quadrupole magnet in the two rings. There will be about 450 BPMs to be installed in each ring; in total there will be 900 pickup units for the entire KEKB.
