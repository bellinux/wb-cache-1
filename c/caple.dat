In 2006 Staples {{and his family had}} relocated to Limousin in France, and {{during the first half of}} 2007 the band built their own studio, Le Chien Chanceaux, in a barn in his garden. Most of the recording for The Hungry Saw, the first new Tindersticks material in five years, took place over an eight-day period in June 2007 in the new studio. Dan McKinna and Thomas Belhom, who later became full-time members of the group, were recruited to play bass and drums respectively, and long-time collaborators Ian <b>Caple,</b> Terry Edwards, Lucy Wilkins and Calina de la Mare helped with the recording and the arrangements. Following further recording sessions at Eastcote Studios and Olympic Studios in London, the album was produced and mixed at Le Chien Chanceaux by Stuart Staples.|$|E

40|$|Rb-Sr {{isochron}} {{ages and}} associated initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of metasedimentary rocks of <b>Caples</b> Group in Southland and Otago, Pelorus Group in Nelson and Marlborough, and their minor North Island correlates in Northland and King Country, reveal the essential continuity {{of a long}} <b>Caples</b> Terrane throughout New Zealand. The Rb-Sr ages, in the range 251 - 117 Ma, record post-metamorphic, Early Triassic to Early Cretaceous uplift and cooling, whilst their associated range of initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, 0. 7039 - 0. 7053, allows a discrimination from analogous datasets of neighbouring Torlesse and Waipapa Terranes. Some petrographically and geochemically anomalous <b>Caples</b> Terrane rocks in East Otago, and Otago Schists of the Aspiring Terrane, all with initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios > 0. 7055, compare best with datasets of Waipapa Terrane of the North Island. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of greywackes from <b>Caples</b> Terrane metasediments have youngest zircon age components from 251 to 215 Ma, and a comparison of dataset patterns from fossiliferous examples suggests that these probably originate from contemporary volcanic sources. <b>Caples</b> volcanism and associated depocentres thus span much of the Triassic. However, their major zircon component, invariably in the range Early Triassic to latest Permian, is most persistent, and constitutes an enormous and enduring zircon source thought {{to be in the}} New England Orogen of eastern Australia. Minor, late Paleozoic (295 - 340 Ma) zircon components are restricted to (Early-Middle Triassic) <b>Caples</b> Terrane metasediments with older, minimum zircon age components, perhaps originating in nearby primary sources in the northeasternmost Lachlan Fold Belt and southern part of the New England Orogen. More scattered early Paleozoic-Precambrian zircons are present throughout the <b>Caples</b> Terrane and reflect reworking of zircons from Paleozoic metasediments and plutonic rocks within the New England Orogen (and its immediate hinterland). <b>Caples</b> Terrane metasediments thus represent an offshore, Triassic component of the accretionary prism terranes (Late Carboniferous to Early Cretaceous) of the Eastern Province of New Zealand. Their depocentres were more isolated from the Gondwanaland continental margin than Torlesse and Waipapa Terrane counterparts, and more influenced by substantial contemporary volcanic centres, perhaps located along the Lord Howe Rise. 23 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|ESPN.com writer Jim <b>Caple</b> {{wrote that}} closers' saves {{in the ninth}} [...] "merely {{conclude}} what is usually a foregone conclusion." [...] Dave Smith of Retrosheet researched the seasons 19302003 {{and found that the}} winning percentage for teams who enter the ninth inning with a lead has remained virtually unchanged over the decades. One-run leads after eight innings have been won roughly 85 percent of the time, two-run leads 94 percent of the time, and three-run leads about 96 percent of the time. Baseball Prospectus projects that teams could gain as much as four extra wins a year by focusing on bringing their ace reliever into the game earlier in more critical situations with runners on base instead of holding them out to accumulate easier ninth inning saves. In The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball, Tom Tango et al. wrote that there was more value to having the ace reliever enter in the eighth inning with a one- or a two-run lead instead of the ninth with a three-run lead. [...] "Managers feel the need to please their closersand their closers' agentsby getting them cheap saves to pad their stats and their bank accounts", wrote <b>Caple.</b> Tango et al. projected that using a great reliever over an average one to start the ninth with a three-run lead resulted in a two percent increase in wins, versus four percent for a two-run lead or six percent for a one-run lead. Former Baltimore Orioles manager Johnny Oates once told Jerome Holtzman, the inventor of the save statistic, that he created the ninth-inning pitcher by inventing the save. Holtzman disagreed, saying it was baseball managers who were responsible for not bringing in their top reliever when the game was on the line, in the seventh or eighth inning, which had been the practice in the past. He noted that managers' usage of closers can [...] "abuse the pitching save ... to favor the closer." ...|$|E
