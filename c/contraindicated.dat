5|$|USFDA-commissioned {{studies from}} 2011 {{indicate}} that in children, young adults, and adults {{there is no}} association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are <b>contraindicated</b> in individuals with cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or <b>contraindicated.</b> Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is <b>contraindicated</b> in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} <b>contraindicated</b> {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are <b>contraindicated</b> {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is <b>contraindicated</b> {{in people}} with any {{condition}} that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E

5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s are <b>contraindicated</b> during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is <b>contraindicated</b> in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause {{bleeding}} in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids <b>contraindicated</b> for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively <b>contraindicated</b> for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

5|$|At {{the initial}} consultation, {{patients}} are screened for conditions that may <b>contraindicate</b> the diet. A dietary history is obtained and {{the parameters of}} the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely <b>contraindicated</b> {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is <b>contraindicated</b> in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is <b>contraindicated,</b> and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E

5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is <b>contraindicated</b> in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are <b>contraindicated</b> during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E

25|$|Quinolones are <b>contraindicated</b> if {{a patient}} has epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, QT prolongation, {{pre-existing}} CNS lesions, or CNS inflammation, or the patient has suffered a stroke. They are best avoided in the athlete population. Safety concerns exist for fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy, so they are <b>contraindicated</b> unless no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. However, one meta-analysis looking at the outcome of pregnancies involving quinolone use in the first trimester found no increased risk of malformations. They are also <b>contraindicated</b> in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system. Their use in children is not absolutely <b>contraindicated,</b> however. For certain severe infections where other antibiotics are not an option, their use can be justified. Quinolones should also not be given to people with a known hypersensitivity to the drug class.|$|E
