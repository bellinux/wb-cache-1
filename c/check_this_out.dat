5000|$|The Allmusic review {{awarded the}} album 3 stars. Guy Peters stated [...] "People who are into adventurous, fearless {{experimentation}} should <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out</b> - even if it’s {{only to have}} heard it once -, but if Slayer and average free jazz are already too extreme for your tastes (pussy music!), just avoid this release, the real soundtrack to the apocalypse." ...|$|E

5000|$|First Strike Still Deadly has {{received}} mostly negative reviews. AllMusic writer Brian O'Neill awards the album one star out of five, and criticizes, [...] "Re-recording one's hits {{is worse than}} live albums because it tries to be something it never can be, and this disc is no exception.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Joclyn Layne awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "Dedicated fans should <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out,</b> {{as it is}} part of the early annals of Zorn. Listeners with less {{patience}} for music theory -- and Zorn skeptics -- should save Pool for later, because it will not win anyone over; nor will the compositional theories become more clear upon listening. Essentially, Pool has more historical value than listening interest." ...|$|E

5000|$|Writing for All About The Rock Anthony Biello {{scored the}} album 8.5 out of 10 and said [...] "I wasn’t expecting such a well written record from a band I {{discarded}} years ago. If {{you are a}} fan of Power, Progressive or Death Metal, then <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out.</b> Scar Symmetry blends all of those genres together unlike any other band I’ve ever heard before. Supposedly {{this is the first}} concept album of a trilogy, and if the next 2 are even close to The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity), I would consider it a success." ...|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} a {{possible}} five stars and described the album as [...] "sort of a Houston-style Chronic, albeit one that isn't quite as well developed or thought out".

5000|$|... "That {{darkness}} was always {{part of the}} band, but it wasn’t all about that. There was always an optimism, even in the darkest shit we wrote. With Dirt, it’s not like we were saying ‘Oh yeah, {{this is a good}} thing.’ It was more of a warning than anything else, rather than ‘Hey, come and <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out,</b> it’s great!’ We were talking {{about what was going on}} at the time, but within that there was always a survivor element - a kind of triumph over the darker elements of being a human being. I still think we have all of that intact, but maybe the percentage has shifted." [...] —Jerry Cantrell in 2013 ...|$|E
5000|$|Louder Than The Musics Jono Davies said [...] "to summarise, {{this is a}} {{very good}} album. Great {{creative}} songs, great voice and great expressions of praise to God (a few too many greats there maybe). But there is something thats stopping me saying this is an outstanding album. What that is, Im not sure. But when you hear it, you just know, and on this album I dont always hear it. But overall this is a good, and Ill even use that word again, a great album. Maybe given time this will grow on me more, but for now I am more than willing to express that you should <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out</b> and actually make up your own mind.|$|E
5000|$|Symbionese Liberation Album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. AllMusic's Tim DiGravina gave it 2 stars out of 5, describing its music as [...] "slightly above average indie hip-hop of a self-aggrandizing, sometimes scatological, and misogynistic nature." [...] Exclaim!s Brendan Murphy {{wrote of the}} album that [...] "the beats are not mind-blowing, nor any different than any Bay Area underground you've heard before." [...] In a more favorable review, Daryl Stoneage wrote that [...] "fans of groups like Dilated Peoples and Non-Phixion, who appreciate their hip-hop a little darker, will want to <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out</b> for sure." [...] Michael Frauenhofer gave the album 7 out of 10 stars, writing that [...] "it’s a somewhat calmly paced dish but undeniably hard-hitting" [...] and describing the group's style [...] "plodding, never awkward, slow but relentlessly d-o-p-e".|$|E

5000|$|Chris Mitchell from Popzara {{was equally}} {{optimistic about the}} shows future, saying that [...] "Fans of FXs Archer or Foxs Bobs Burgers will {{definitely}} want to <b>check</b> <b>this</b> one <b>out,</b> as its rapid-fire delivery is always consciously spot-on". The New York Times described the show as [...] "hilarious and ribald". Margaret Lyons of Vulture gave a positive review, describing it as [...] "radically sad. I love it".|$|R
50|$|<b>Check</b> <b>This</b> Kid <b>Out</b> is a Disney Channel {{short series}} which premiered in June 2005, during Disney Channel's So Hot Summer! promotion.

50|$|The P$$t..., <b>Check</b> <b>This</b> <b>Out...</b> and Heritage Farm {{lines of}} {{products}} {{were introduced in}} 1981 {{by the name of}} Cost Cutter and was known for its near-generic product labeling. It was then succeeded by FMV, which was a backronym to mean For Maximum Value, originally meaning Fred Meyer Value. In early 2007, Kroger replaced FMV with the Kroger Value brand. The Kroger Value brand was phased out in 2014. It offers staple products such as sugar, flour, bread and canned goods at the lowest price for that particular product in the store. Though some of these products (such as their cheese made with water and partially hydrogenated soybean oil) use a lower-quality manufacturing process, other products appear to be indistinguishable from their banner brand equivalent (P$$t... sugar and Kroger sugar, for example) other than the price.|$|E
5000|$|The album opener, [...] "Hit Da Pavement", which {{features}} additional vocals from Bootsy Collins, {{was the first}} track 7 Days of Funk recorded. In an interview for Pitchfork, Dâm-Funk expressed that [...] "the energy was so explosive" [...] with [...] "Hit Da Pavement" [...] {{and that he was}} impressed by Snoopzilla's work ethic. [...] "Snoop came to the pad at 10 p.m. and we were done at midnight. He killed it. His work ethic is stupid, man. I've never seen anything like it. I was in New York, in A1 Shop just listening to some records, and Snoop calls, like, 'Hey man, you need to <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out,</b> check your email.' Four hours later I'm at the club, and he's like, 'Hey man, check these out, two more done.' He was just smashing them. When you're inspired by something, that's how you do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On the flipside, Kevin Hoskins of Jesus Freak Hideout {{moderately}} stated, [...] "As {{with most}} albums, not all is perfect on this release as some tracks could {{be labeled as}} just fair....I personally wish he would stick to his sweet spot of rap/rock, but he definitely has an appeal to a much broader scope of fans. Fans should definitely <b>check</b> <b>this</b> <b>out</b> {{even though it may}} not be Mana's best work to date." [...] David Craft of Jesus Freak Hideout concluded, [...] "Ultimately, the album's greatest shortcomings are found in its lack of lyrical depth. None of the songs are of poor quality, and some are indeed quite enjoyable. If anything, Stones feels like a just above-average missed opportunity. Manafest is extremely talented and his skill bleeds through quite often this time around, but while the album is a success, we can hope for more home runs next time." ...|$|E
