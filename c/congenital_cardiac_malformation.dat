Materials and methods: The study population comprised every individual born from 2000 to 2008 who was registered in the NPR with a <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformation</b> diagnosis and treated at one of the two national departments of pediatric cardiology. Positive predictive values were established comparing NPR information with the clinical record of each individual. Results: A total of 2952 patients with a total of 3536 diagnoses were eligible for validation. Review of their clinical records unveiled no patient without cardiac malformation. In 98 % (98 %&ndash; 99 %) of the cases, the NPR diagnosis could be found as the discharge diagnosis in the patient&# 39;s clinical record, and in 90 % (89 %&ndash; 91 %) of the cases the NPR diagnosis was considered a true reflection of the patient&# 39;s actual malformation. Conclusions: Our study verifies that the present study population retrieved from the NPR is a valid tool for epidemiological research within the topic of congenital cardiac malformations, given that the research question is not dependent on a fully established sensitivity of the NPR. Precautions should be made regarding cardiac malformations characterized by low prevalence or poor predictive values, and the reported validity should not be extrapolated beyond the study period.

40|$|Aims: Our {{objectives}} were, first, {{to study}} seasonal distribution of perioperative deaths {{within 30 days}} after surgery, and late death, in children undergoing surgery for congenitally malformed hearts, and second, to study the causes of late death. Methods: We analysed a retrospective cohort of 1, 753 children with <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> born and undergoing surgery in the period from 1990 through 2002 with a special focus on the causes of late death. The data {{was obtained from the}} registry of <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> at Rikshospitalet, Oslo, and the Norwegian Medical Birth Registry. The mean follow-up from birth was 8. 1 years, with a range from zero to 15. 2 years. Results: During the period of follow-up, 204 (11. 6 %) of the children died having undergone previous surgery. Of these 124 (7. 1 %) died in the perioperative period, and 80 (4. 5 %) were late deaths. There were 56 late deaths during the 6 coldest months, compared with 24 during the 6 warmest months (p < 0. 01). There was no significant seasonal variation in perioperative deaths.

40|$|ObjectivesIn {{this study}} we used a {{population-based}} approach {{to assess the impact}} of fetal echocardiography on a well defined birth population with nearly complete ascertainment of cardiac defects. BackgroundAlthough fetal echocardiography is being used more frequently in the prenatal diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations,</b> its impact on the diagnosis and surveillance of cardiac defects has not been described in defined populations. MethodsAll stillborn and live-born infants with diagnosed cardiac defects and whose mothers resided in the metropolitan Atlanta area from January 1990 through December 1994 were ascertained through an established birth defects surveillance system. All fetuses with cardiac defects diagnosed prenatally by a pediatric cardiologist were identified from clinical records. The spectrum of cardiac defects, diagnostic trends and adverse fetal outcomes were described. ResultsWe identified 1, 589 infants with <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations,</b> for a live-birth prevalence rate of 8. 1 / 1, 000 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 7. 8 to 8. 6). Overall, 97 (6. 1 %) of these cases of <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> were diagnosed prenatally. The proportion of cardiac defects diagnosed prenatally rose from 2. 6 % in 1990 to 12. 7 % in 1994, a nearly fivefold increase. The proportion of cardiac defects diagnosed prenatally during the study varied by the type of defect, from a low of 4. 7 % for atrial septal defects to a high of 28 % for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Prenatally diagnosed <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> were associated with a high incidence of infant mortality (30. 9 %, 95 % CI 2. 4 to 5. 4) and fetal wastage (17. 5 %, 95 % CI 6. 2 to 11. 3). ConclusionsThese data show that fetal echocardiography is being used increasingly in the prenatal diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> in metropolitan Atlanta.

Although no significant ethnic variability {{has been reported in}} the frequency 22 q 11. 2 deletions, some recent studies question the high frequency of this as the underlying cause of velo-cardio-facial syndrome in Anglo-American populations. A screening program was initiated, including a detailed clinical assessment, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for microdeletion 22 q 11. 2 in 24 children with <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> referred consecutively to our genetics clinic.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that administration of trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene to pregnant rats during organogenesis would produce a significant fetal cardiac teratogenic effect. It was also hypothesized that administration of these compounds only before pregnancy would not be associated with fetal cardiac teratogenesis. Background. Epidemiologic observations demonstrated an increased number of <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> defects in children whose mother resided in an area with drinking water contaminated by trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene. A prior provocative intrauterine exposure study in rats established a positive link between these contaminants and an increased number of fetal hearts with <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> defects. Methods. Sprague-Dawley rats were given pure tap drinking water (control subjects) or water contaminated with high or low dose of trichloroethylene or dichloroethylene (experimental groups) during prepregnancy only, prepregnancy and pregnancy or during pregnancy alone. Results. A total of 2, 045 fetuses were examined. Trichloroethylene or dichloroethylene delivered exclusively in the period before pregnancy caused no increase in <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations</b> over the control level. Compared with the control group, rats exposed to these agents both before and during pregnancy, had a significantly greater number of fetuses with <b>congenital</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>malformations.</b> Trichloroethylene (high dose only) administered only during pregnancy produced a significant increase in cardiac defects.
