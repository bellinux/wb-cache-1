60|$|On January 19th Warren's turning {{movement}} began {{to bring him}} into closer touch with the enemy, his thirty-six field guns and the six howitzers which had returned to him crushing down the opposition which faced him. The {{ground in front of}} him was pleated into long folds, and his advance meant the carrying of ridge after ridge. In the earlier stages of the war this would have entailed a murderous loss; but we had learned our lesson, and the infantry now, with intervals of ten paces, and every man choosing his own cover, went up in proper Boer form, <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> after position, the enemy always retiring with dignity and decorum. There was no victory on one side or rout on the other--only a steady advance and an orderly retirement. That night the infantry slept in their fighting line, going on again at three in the morning, and light broke to find not only rifles, but the long-silent Boer guns all blazing at the British advance. Again, as at Colenso, the brunt of the fighting fell upon Hart's Irish Brigade, who upheld that immemorial tradition of valour with which that name, either in or out of the British service, has invariably been associated. Upon the Lancashire Fusiliers and the York and Lancasters came also a large share of the losses and the glory. Slowly but surely the inexorable line of the British lapped over the ground which the enemy had held. A gallant colonial, Tobin of the South African Horse, rode up one hill and signaled with his hat that it was clear. His comrades followed closely at his heels, and occupied the position with the loss of Childe, their Major. During this action Lyttelton had held the Boers in their trenches opposite to him by advancing to within 1500 yards of them, but the attack was not pushed further. On the evening of this day, January 20th, the British had gained some miles of ground, and the total losses had been about three hundred killed and wounded. The troops were in good heart, and all promised well for the future. Again the men lay where they had fought, and again the dawn heard the crash of the great guns and the rattle of the musketry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the available data}} that may {{shed light on the}} carry trade in Japanese yen. We define an individual or a sector to be engaged in the carry trade if it has a short position in yen and a long position in other currencies. The tendency of large yen movements to be skewed toward appreciations is consistent with the existence of substantial <b>carry</b> <b>positions,</b> and other evidence from market prices provides some modest support for an effect from the carry trade. Data on bank loans and bond holdings by currency reveal a large apparent yen <b>carry</b> <b>position</b> of the Japanese official sector and modest <b>carry</b> <b>positions</b> in the Japanese and foreign banking sectors. The Japanese private non-banking sector has a large long foreign-currency position, but does not have a short yen position, and is thus not engaged in the yen carry trade in the aggregate. However, it is possible that exporters and investors in Japan use the derivatives markets to hedge some of their long foreign-currency exposure, with the private non-banking sector outside of Japan (including most hedge funds) likely to be taking on most of the associated carry exposure.

50|$|One wrestler (usually {{the larger}} one) places an {{opponent}} over {{his or her}} shoulders in the fireman's <b>carry</b> <b>position</b> while the other attacking wrestler runs and jumps up alongside both men and takes hold/twists {{the neck of the}} opponent for any type of neckbreaker slam as the first wrestler falls down to the mat forcing the opponent down with them in a Samoan drop. This can see the wrestler performing the fireman's carry turn on the spot (an airplane spin) while the other charges at him or her and performs the neckbreaker as he or she spins. Another variation is when someone holds the opponent in a fireman's <b>carry</b> <b>position.</b> The partner then gives the opponent a side headlock and together at the same time, they do a double rolling somersault into a combination of the rolling fireman's carry slam and the corkscrew neckbreaker.|$|R

30|$|For PDR using {{unconstrained}} smartphones, {{it includes}} <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> recognition, walking step detection, walking step length estimation, and RMPCA-based walking direction estimation modules. Upon <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> recognition, different parameters for walking step detection and walking step length estimation modules may be set for different device carrying positions. This paper investigates four classical carrying positions [23]: put in trouser pocket (in-pocket), gazed {{by the user}} and held in hand (hand-held), against ear during phone calls (phone-call), and held in swinging-hand (swinging-hand).|$|E
30|$|Though a lot {{of works}} [7 – 14] {{have been done in}} {{integrating}} PDR with WiFi localization, some key problems remain to be solved to enhance reliability and applicability. Firstly, existing approaches always empirically set process and measurement noise parameters, whose inaccurate settings may render degraded performance. Secondly, most existing integrated localization approaches assumes that the device carrying positions and device orientations are fixed, such as held in hand [15, 16]. This assumption limits the applications of localization system using smartphones, whose carrying positions and orientations are always unconstrained. An orientation independent device <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> recognition method should be developed to predetermine the device <b>carrying</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to recognize the <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> of an unconstrained smartphone accurately and robustly, since carrying positions may directly impact the parameter settings for step detection and step length estimation. Many previous works [24, 25] have pointed out that the acceleration patterns for different carrying positions show distinct features. The statistics of three dimensional raw measured acceleration samples are deployed as input features to develop the <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> classifier. The developed classifiers are all designed upon relatively stable device orientations. If the device orientations are unconstrained, the raw measured acceleration samples may vary a lot with the changing orientations under the same carrying positions. As a result, these classifiers may render degraded recognition accuracy with the unconstrained uses of smartphones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel heading {{estimation}} approach for indoor pedestrian navigation using the built-in inertial sensors on a smartphone. Unlike previous approaches constraining the <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> of a smartphone on the user’s body, our approach gives the user a larger freedom by implementing automatic {{recognition of the}} device <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> and subsequent selection of an optimal strategy for heading estimation. We firstly predetermine the motion state by a decision tree using an accelerometer and a barometer. Then, to enable accurate and computational lightweight <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> recognition, we combine a position classifier with a novel position transition detection algorithm, which may {{also be used to}} avoid the confusion between position transition and user turn during pedestrian walking. For a device placed in the trouser pockets or held in a swinging hand, the heading estimation is achieved by deploying a principal component analysis (PCA) -based approach. For a device held in the hand or against the ear during a phone call, user heading is directly estimated by adding the yaw angle of the device to the related heading offset. Experimental results show that our approach can automatically detect carrying positions with high accuracy, and outperforms previous heading estimation approaches in terms of accuracy and applicability...|$|E

RosenbergAlthough {{the causes}} of the {{evolution}} of bipedalism are unclear, one consequence is that the hands are freed from use in locomotion, making it possible to carry objects including tools, firewood, water, food, and dependent, helpless offspring. Carrying infants can be problematic because while the baby needs to nurse, the mother also {{needs to be able to}} work. Cross-culturally, there are many different methods and tools used by women to carry their babies throughout the day such as front wraps, back wraps, side slings, and carrying in-arms. In this study, I conducted motion analysis on 22 women carrying 7 and 20 lb weights using these four ways of carrying infants. In the biomechanical engineering lab, I observed women carrying two different loads while walking and standing, to look at the change in their posture and variation in gait. Approved by the Human Subjects Board at the University of Delaware, the protocol does not involve harmful or invasive procedures, and assures anonymity. The two main objectives of this research were to understand the effects of baby weight and baby <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> on the hip flexion and extension angles and the lateral trunk and forward trunk angles. The results show that on the whole, carrying an increased weight exaggerates the effect of the load on the hip and trunk angles. Also, the front and back carrying positions cause a change in the gait of the carrier, while the back wrap and in arms <b>carrying</b> <b>position</b> cause a change in the posture of the carrier. This study will lead to a better understanding of a universal cultural practice that affects the biology of the human body. Anthropolog...|$|E
