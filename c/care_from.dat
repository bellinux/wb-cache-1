5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st Century India’s health care system is {{strained}} {{in terms of the number}} of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking <b>care</b> <b>from</b> unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental <b>care</b> <b>from</b> their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E

40|$|The {{dominance}} of technological paradigms within psychiatry creates {{moral and ethical}} tensions over how to engage with the interpersonal narratives of those experiencing mental distress. This paper argues that such paradigms are poorly suited for fostering principled responses to human suffering, and proposes an alternative approach that considers a view of relationships based in feminist theories {{about the nature of}} caring. Four primary characteristics are presented which distinguish <b>caring</b> <b>from</b> technological paradigms: (1) a concern with the particular nature of contexts, (2) embodied practice, (3) the dialogical basis of caring and (4) the existential basis of <b>caring.</b> <b>From</b> this we explore the role of the moral imagination and our ability...|$|R
40|$|Research into <b>caring</b> <b>from</b> the {{perspective}} of nursing students is poorly documented. This paper presents a study which described the construct of caring as experienced by students in pre-registration programmes at two universities in New South Wales, Australia. Qualitative data were collected using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. From {{the analysis of the}} data a model of professional nurse <b>caring</b> <b>from</b> the student's perspective was created. In this model, compassion, as the core of caring is actualized in the students' nursing of patients by communicating, providing comfort, being competent, being committed, having conscience, being confident and being courageous. Communication is not only an actualization of this caring but constitutes an important medium for the expression of caring actions...|$|R

At around 3:00p.m., Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across his bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick.

5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of <b>care</b> <b>from</b> others.|$|E
5|$|Although a Liberal {{by family}} {{heritage}} and disposition, Primrose never sought public office, or ever actively participated in politics. On September 10, 1936, {{on the advice}} of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Primrose was appointed to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Alberta by Governor General John Buchan, succeeding William L. Walsh, his old friend. He was sworn in on October 1, 1936. During his time as Lieutenant-Governor, Primrose and his wife resided in Government House, however, during this time, he was plagued by illness, therefore making him essentially unable to fulfill his duties of office, remaining in medical <b>care</b> <b>from</b> October 19, 1937 until his death. Most of his duties were carried out by his wife, Lily, who hosted the 1937 New Year's Day reception at Government House, and served as an honorary officer of the Royal Alexandra Hospital Women's Auxiliary. Public functions were also attended by others family members, assisting in the absence of Primrose. On February 25, 1937, the Speech from the Throne was read by Horace Harvey, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, due to Primrose's illness.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant <b>care,</b> <b>from</b> both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E

30|$|The low {{utilization}} of UCS services {{was found to}} improve from 2007 to 2013. Specifically, the use of designated facility <b>care</b> increased <b>from</b> 42.78 to 57.54 %, the use of informal <b>care</b> decreased <b>from</b> 28.53 to 19.12 %, the use of non-designated facility <b>care</b> decreased <b>from</b> 23.35 to 12.90 %, and no <b>care</b> increased <b>from</b> 5.34 to 10.44 % 6 (Kirdruang 2011). As mentioned previously, we did not notice {{a significant increase in}} private sector involvement from 2007 to 2013, thus, this improvement may be partially caused by the expanded benefits coverage of the UCS. Thus, future studies need to examine the impact of the benefits coverage expansion on the use of designated facilities for care. Additionally, other possible confounding factors (e.g., changes in beneficiaries’ perceptions of UCS service quality) should be further measured and investigated for a better understanding of this improvement.|$|R
