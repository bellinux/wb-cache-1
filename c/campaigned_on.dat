5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E

5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a Whig household, Harrison {{initially}} favored that party's politics, but joined the Republican Party shortly after its formation in 1856 and <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the Republican presidential candidate, John C. Frémont. In 1857 Harrison was elected as the Indianapolis city attorney, a position that paid an annual salary of $400.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E
5|$|He {{withdrew from}} the race on March 30 after his {{hospitalization}} for a concussion sustained in a fall against a bathtub in late February; an inner-ear injury from the accident left him unable to campaign. Both his wife and Scott Carpenter <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> his behalf during February and March, but doctors gave Glenn a recovery time of one year. Glenn {{did not want to}} win solely due to his astronaut fame, so he dropped out of the race on March 31.|$|E
50|$|The Open Rights Group (ORG) is a UK-based {{organisation}} {{that works}} to preserve digital rights and freedoms by <b>campaigning</b> <b>on</b> digital rights issues and by fostering a community of grassroots activists.

5|$|Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid {{that saves}} Queen Amidala's ship when other droids fail. Before the film's {{production}} started, fans <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would remain. Baker {{is used for}} scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side to side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.|$|E
5|$|On January 11, 2011, Harpole {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} run for Mayor of Amarillo. He <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> a plan to revitalize the downtown area to increase sales tax revenues, to establish Tax Increment Reinvestment Zones {{in other parts of the}} city, and to tackle graffiti. Out of a field of 11 candidates, he won the election held on May 14, 2011, with 77 percent of the vote. His closest opponent, Roy D. McDowell, came in second with 13 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown {{was elected}} to the Senate in a special {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become significant because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E

5|$|Riel {{soon became}} {{involved}} in the politics of Montana, and in 1882, actively <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the Republican Party. He brought a suit against a Democrat for rigging a vote, but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing British subjects {{to take part in the}} election. In response, Riel applied for United States citizenship and was naturalized on 16 March 1883. With two young children, he had by 1884 settled down and was teaching school at the St. Peter's Jesuit mission in the Sun River district of Montana.|$|E
5|$|The UFA government, {{which had}} <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> electoral reform, {{introduced}} AV {{in the rural}} constituencies in 1926, with the unique feature of only two rounds: rather than redistribute votes from each last-place candidate in several counts, only the top two candidates from the first count would advance to the second count. Edmonton and Calgary were also converted to STV districts, where a complicated system of vote transfers resulted in roughly proportional results.|$|E
5|$|Wickliffe <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> {{behalf of}} the Whig ticket of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler in the presidential {{election}} of 1840. Wickliffe and Tyler were friends, having shared a room when they were both in Congress. When Harrison's death elevated Tyler to the office of president, Tyler appointed Wicklilffe as Postmaster General, a choice that angered Clay supporters in the party. Wickliffe served in Tyler's administration until March 1845.|$|E

5|$|Although she has <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> her husband's behalf {{since early}} in his {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E
5|$|Byrd {{resigned}} from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> his stance of separate but equal. McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like Rutherford, ran as an independent. Rutherford <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Vulović as {{the world}} record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in 1990 after taking part in anti-government protests, but avoided arrest because the government {{was concerned about the}} negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she continued to struggle with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, {{political}} {{debate about the}} Royal Question continued and grew after the war, and remained a polemical topic in the popular press, notably in the Francophone newspaper Le Soir. In the general election of 1949, the PSC–CVP <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> a pro-Leopold royalist platform. The results reshaped the political landscape; the Communists were routed and the PSB–BSP lost seats to both the Liberals and Catholics. The Catholics gained a new majority in the Senate and a plurality in the Chamber of Representatives, their best results since the war. Gaston Eyskens took over as Prime Minister {{at the head of}} a Liberal-Catholic coalition. Both parties in the government (and Leopold himself) supported a referendum on the King's return, which became the focus of political attention.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy <b>campaigned</b> <b>on</b> the {{platform}} that Eisenhower was weak {{on defense and}} that he was not doing enough to solve the looming missile gap. After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E
