40|$|My {{proposal}} for this exhibition {{is based on}} the parallel development of my work as a professional art jeweller and my long-term relationship with opticians. The recent research in laser processing that I carried out at The University of Manchester has led me to work closely with scientists and engineers. The jewellery I called Ocular Series was inspired both by the laboratory environment that I worked in {{as well as by the}} aesthetic and function of the measuring instruments used in optometry. These had always been an intriguing source of interest to me, perhaps due to a lifelong condition of hyperopia and astigmatism. Manual instruments, trial lenses and <b>correcting</b> <b>glasses</b> have all provided me with inspiration and the jewellery usually includes a lens in the centre. This invites the wearer to peer through, to examine in detail, to inspect further - actions associated with scientific observation and also with improving sight, aiding discovery or simply appealing to the wonder of magnification. The Ocular Series was modeled on the idea of a monocle that might be made to individual prescriptions...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} two {{patients}} with anisohypermetropic amblyopia without strabismus were studied. Microstrabismus was excluded by detailed orthoptic examinations including visuscopy and Cüppers' bifoveal correspondence test. Treatment consisted in wearing <b>correcting</b> <b>glasses</b> and part-time or full-time patching of the nonamblyopic eye. In patients with dense amblyopia patching of the amblyopic eye {{was done and}} Cüppers' after-image method of pleoptic therapy was instituted as the initial procedure. When visual acuity improved sufficiently by this therapy, patching was used on the nonamblyopic eye. Sixty-five (63. 7 %) patients showed 2 lines or more improvement on the Snellen chart. Though young children (6 to 12 years) improved their visual acuity more often than those aged 13 to 20 years, {{a considerable number of}} patients (50. 0 %) in the older age group improved their visual acuity after therapy. The improvement in visual acuity was accompanied by improved stereoacuity in 49. 0 % of the patients. It is therefore suggested that every effort should be made to treat these patients even after the age of 12 years...|$|E

In such cases, known as 'fully accommodative esotropias,' the esotropia will only be seen when the child removes their glasses. Many adults with childhood esotropias of this type make use of contact lenses to control their 'squint.' Some undergo refractive surgery for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|Seeing {{as a kind}} of journey: {{from dark}} to light, from nothing to substance. Sight as {{crossing}} over…an understanding of oneself and the other. “ (Samuele Mazza. Spectacles) Over the last 15 years as a lecturer I have been increasingly interested in the integration of emerging technologies for the creative industries, overseeing the installation of laser systems for welding, cutting and marking for jewellery and applied art courses. In order to further understand the technology that artists increasingly look for to use as a daily tool, I recently completed the research project Laser processing on titanium for contemporary jewellery: a bridge between cultures at The University of Manchester in the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. The difficulty in understanding between my own art background and their engineering culture, however, created in the project a new dimension. The relatively straightforward task of finding applications of laser processing for contemporary jewellery also became a mission to improve the communication between art, science and engineering through the objects being made. The Ocular series 1 - 6 created during the research, was grounded in the aesthetic and function of the measuring instruments used in optometry. These had always been an intriguing source of interest to me, perhaps because of my lifelong condition of hyperopia and astigmatism. Manual instrumentation, trial lenses and <b>correcting</b> <b>glasses</b> provided an important design influence. The objects all include a lens in the centre, inviting the viewer to peer through, to examine in detail, to inspect further - actions associated with scientific observation and also with improving sight, clarifying vision, aiding discovery, altering perception or simply appealing to the wonder of magnification. The journey that I encountered during my research included microscopic views of titanium oxidation and opened new levels of material understanding thanks to the help of engineers and scientists working around me. Eyesight correction and the essential use of both eyes needed for binocular vision became metaphors for the research. The Ocular series were modelled on the idea of a monocle that might be made to individual prescriptions, suggesting that correcting vision would help see the ‘bigger picture’, assuage ‘clouded’ or ‘tunnel vision’. For this exhibition it is my intention to further develop the concept of using sight as a bridging mechanism between the cultures of science and art. Jewellery is the ideal art form with which to communicate and carry this notion forward and I hope to work with a scientist and/or an engineer to carry it out. The object/s made will also engage with issues surrounding the public understanding of both art and science, exposing aspects of engineering research and of art practice that aim to change persistent preconceptions...|$|E

40|$|New geochronological {{data are}} {{reported}} for two key ash beds interbedded in Upper Miocene (Messinian) -Early Pleistocene rocks at Maccarone, Bellante, and Mosciano S. Angelo on the Adriatic {{side of the}} Italian peninsula. Major element chemistry of glass shards was determined with electron microprobe analysis on the younger key bed. The older, Messinian-age ash bed, sampled at Maccarone, yields a <b>corrected</b> <b>glass</b> fission-track age of 5. 38 +/- 0. 42 Ma. The younger ash bed, sampled at Mosciano S. Angelo and at two localities at Bellante, yields <b>corrected</b> <b>glass</b> ages of similar to 2. 1 Ma, similar to ages previously determined on Pliocene-Pleistocene ash collected along the Ionic coast and on the Tyrrhenian side of Italy. Apatite fission-track dating {{of one of the}} Bellante samples confirms the glass age, whereas apatite from the Mosciano S. Angelo sample yields an excessively old age due to the presence in the sample of a significant component of detrital grains. An unusual bimodal spontaneous track-diameter distribution is found in the Maccarone glass, similar to the distributions previously obtained on other Messinian-age tephra samples from the same region. This anomalous track-diameter distribution is interpreted as a thermal disturbance coeval with the volcanic activity that produced the Pliocene-Pleistocene key volcanic ash bed sampled at Bellante and Mosciano S. Angelo. The contemporaneity of this ash with the event detected by the Maccarone glass suggests that it was related to the tectonic phase which marked, with numerous erosive levels distributed along the whole Apennine region, the end of the Pliocene sedimentary cycle and the onset of the Pleistocene cycl...|$|R

40|$|Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy is used {{to image}} the fundus of the living eye. In theory, this {{technique}} {{can be used to}} observe single cells of the retina. Unfortunately, vision of most eyes is decreased by higher-order aberrations, that cannot be <b>corrected</b> by <b>glasses</b> or contact lenses. This is also the reason why resolution in confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy is not as high as expected. By the use of adaptive optics (AO) resolution can be dramatically increased. Implementing a wave front sensor into a conventional confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (cSLO), therefore, is the first step to set up a compact adaptive-optical cSLO. In this work a Shack-Hartmann wave front sensor was implemented into a slightly modified Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) and aberrations of model eyes were measured.

30|$|Injury {{and disease}} {{can alter the}} thickness, {{curvature}} and transparency of the cornea, leading to severe changes in visual functionality. Keratoconus is a disease of the cornea which involves non-inflammatory changes to the corneal microstructure {{as well as to}} its macrostructure. As a result, the cornea gradually develops a conic-like shape, with serious implications on its refractive power [7 – 9]. Most keratoconic corneas have characteristically large differences between their central and peripheral thicknesses compared to normal corneas. Though keratoconus is a not a common condition, it may develop from a presumably normal cornea under normal intraocular pressure (IOP) values [10]. The pathogenesis of this disease is unclear, and several factors have been suggested to be involved in it, including prolonged elevated IOP, bursts of intense force, overexposure to sunlight, improper fitting of contact lenses, eye rubbing, decreased corneal tissue strength, and decreased corneal tissue mass [1, 9]. In mild conditions visual acuity (VA) can be <b>corrected</b> using <b>glasses</b> or rigid gas permeable contact lenses but severe cases may require corneal transplantation.|$|R

5000|$|Simple sheet or {{uncorrected}} molded glasses do not {{compensate for}} the 250 nanometer difference in the wavelengths of the red-cyan filters. With simple glasses the red filter image can be blurry when viewing a close computer screen or printed image since the retinal focus differs from the cyan filtered image, which dominates the eyes' focusing. Better quality molded plastic glasses employ a compensating differential diopter power to equalize the red filter focus shift relative to the cyan. The direct view focus on computer monitors has been recently improved by manufacturers providing secondary paired lenses, fitted and attached inside the red-cyan primary filters of some high-end anaglyph glasses. They are used where very high resolution is required, including science, stereo macros, and animation studio applications. They use carefully balanced cyan (blue-green) acrylic lenses, which pass a minute percentage of red to improve skin tone perception.
