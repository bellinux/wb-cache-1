25|$|In June 1798 Commander John Stiles became {{captain of}} <b>Cameleon,</b> {{replacing}} Bowyer. <b>Cameleon</b> spent the year cruising and escorting convoys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cameleon</b> was {{commissioned}} in November 1795 under Commander Richard Bennet. Commander Richard Boyer replaced Bennet in February 1796. Boyer sailed <b>Cameleon</b> for the Mediterranean on 22 February.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 1805, while <b>Cameleon</b> {{was lying}} becalmed, a {{flotilla}} of Spanish gunboats approached. However, when <b>Cameleon</b> got out her sweeps and a breeze sprang up they withdrew.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cameleons</b> are {{sophisticated}} genetically encoded fluorescent probes {{that allow}} quantifying cellular Ca 2 + signals. The probes {{are based on}} Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between terminally located fluorescent proteins (FPs), which move together upon binding of Ca 2 + to the central calmodulin myosin light chain kinase M 13 domain. Most of the available <b>cameleons</b> consist of cyan and yellow FPs (CFP and YFP) as the FRET pair. However, red-shifted versions with green and orange or red FPs (GFP, OFP, RFP) have some advantages such as less phototoxicity and minimal spectral overlay with autofluorescence of cells and fura- 2, a prominent chemical Ca 2 + indicator. While GFP/OFP- or GFP/RFP-based <b>cameleons</b> have been successfully used to study cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca 2 + signals, red-shifted <b>cameleons</b> to visualize Ca 2 + dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have not been developed so far. In this study, we generated and tested several ER targeted red-shifted <b>cameleons.</b> Our results show that GFP/OFP-based <b>cameleons</b> due to miss-targeting and their high Ca 2 + binding affinity are inappropriate to record ER Ca 2 + signals. However, ER targeted GFP/RFP-based probes were suitable to sense ER Ca 2 + in a reliable manner. With this study we increased the palette of <b>cameleons</b> for visualizing Ca 2 + dynamics within the main intracellular Ca 2 + store...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cameleon</b> {{was paid}} off at Portsmouth in September 1805. The Commissioners of the Navy offered her for sale there on 20 September 1810. <b>Cameleon</b> was broken up at Portsmouth in April 1811.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 1802, Keith {{promoted}} Lieutenant Thomas Staines to Commander {{and command}} of <b>Cameleon</b> in the Mediterranean. The appointment was confirmed on 24 July. During the short peace, <b>Cameleon</b> served by maintaining communications between Malta and Naples.|$|E
25|$|Cameleons last {{adventure}} {{took place}} on 15 August. She was forced to throw carronades, shot and stores overboard to escape from a Spanish 74-gun ship. While Beagle sailed towards <b>Cameleon</b> to take her in tow, a breeze came up that aided the Spaniard. Just in time for <b>Cameleon,</b> the Spaniard and the two British vessels sighted four sail off to the south-west. The British made signals as if the four unknown vessels were British warships, leading the Spanish 74 to withdraw back to her anchorage, with Beagle and <b>Cameleon</b> in pursuit.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe binding {{interface}} of calmodulin and a calmodulin {{binding peptide}} were reengineered by computationally designing complementary bumps and holes. This redesign {{led to the}} development of sensitive and specific pairs of mutant proteins used to sense Ca 2 + in a second generation of genetically encoded Ca 2 + indicators (<b>cameleons).</b> These <b>cameleons</b> are no longer perturbed by large excesses of native calmodulin, and they display Ca 2 + sensitivities tuned over a 100 -fold range (0. 6 – 160 μM). Incorporation of circularly permuted Venus in place of Citrine results in a 3 - to 5 -fold increase in the dynamic range. These redesigned <b>cameleons</b> show significant improvements over previous versions in the ability to monitor Ca 2 + in the cytoplasm as well as distinct subcellular localizations, such as the plasma membrane of neurons and the mitochondria...|$|R

25|$|By April 1800 <b>Cameleon</b> {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant Samuel Jackson (acting). Between April and mid-May, <b>Cameleon</b> was part of a three-vessel naval {{squadron}} that, at the behest of Admiral Lord Keith, supported the Austrian force besieging the fortress of Savona. The naval force {{was under the}} command of Captain Hugh Downman in the frigate , and also included the Neapolitan brig Strombolo, under Captain Settimo. The little squadron's boats rowed guard off the harbour's mouth for 41 nights; the famished garrison surrendered to the allies on 15 May. Although <b>Cameleon</b> was committed to the blockade, she managed to share in a number of captures by other vessels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cameleon</b> then {{returned}} to her old area of operation. There she captured nine merchantmen and also a French packet sailing from Corsica to Toulon. One of the merchant vessels was a polacre that <b>Cameleon</b> cut {{out from under the}} guns of batteries near Genoa in an action that cost her one man killed and seven wounded; enemy casualties amounted to four men killed and seven wounded.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescent protein-based {{indicators}} are invaluable tools for functional imaging of living cells and organisms. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as derivatives of yellow <b>cameleons</b> (YCs) and GCaMPs/pericams (Miyawaki et al., 1997; Nakai et al., 2001; Nagai et al., 2001) are a highly advanced class of indicators. Continued efforts {{for improvement of}} the performance of GECIs have resulted in brighter indicators with better photo-stability and expanded dynamic range, thus improving the sensitivity of detection. Fine-tuning of other properties, including Ca 2 + affinity and Hill constant, have also contributed to increase the detectability of Ca 2 + dynamics. Emerging optogenetic technology has forced the spectrally compatible GECI color variants. In this opinion, we highlight the recent development of GECIs including photo-switchable Ca 2 + indicators and bioluminescence-based Ca 2 + indicator, mainly invented in our group, focusing especially on the parameters determining their performance in order to provide a guideline for the selection of appropriate GECI for a given experiment...|$|R

25|$|On 4 August Maitland {{was again}} {{in command of}} Camelion. On that day he was captain of <b>Cameleon</b> when she {{captured}} the Corsican privateer felucca Providence. Providence, of Bastia, was armed with two guns and carried a crew of 23 men.|$|E
25|$|HMS <b>Cameleon</b> (or Camelion) was a Royal Navy Diligence-class brig-sloop, {{launched}} in 1795. She was built of fir (pitch pine), which allowed for rapid construction, {{but at the}} expense of durability. She captured some small vessels and a privateer, and served in the Mediterranean before being laid up in 1805, and broken up in 1811.|$|E
5000|$|Fura-2, an aminopolycarboxylic acid, is a {{ratiometric}} {{fluorescent dye}} which binds to free intracellular calcium. [...] It {{was the first}} widely used dye for calcium imaging, and remains very popular. Fura-2 is excited at 340 nm and 380 nm of light, and {{the ratio of the}} emissions at those wavelengths {{is directly related to the}} amount of intracellular calcium. Regardless of the presence of calcium, Fura-2 emits at 510 nm of light. The use of the ratio automatically cancels out confounding variables, such as variable dye concentration and cell thickness, making Fura-2 one of the most appreciated tools to quantify calcium levels. The high photon yield of fura-2 allowed the first real time (video rate) measurements of calcium inside living cells in 1986. More recently, genetically-encoded calcium indicators based on spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein, such as <b>Cameleons,</b> have supplemented the use of Fura-2 and other small molecule dyes for calcium imaging, but Fura-2 remains faster.|$|R
40|$|Genetically encoded {{indicators}} {{emerged as}} promising tools for cell type-specific and chronic recording of neuronal population activity. Since {{publication of the}} first prototypical genetically encoded Ca 2 + indicators (<b>Cameleons)</b> in 1997, we have witnessed remarkable evolution of the field, with rapid improvement of indicator performance as well as expanded application to many model organisms in the neuroscience community. Challenges still remain, however, concerning the mammalian central nervous system: limited sensitivity of indicators to subtle changes in activity, slow signal kinetics, cytotoxicity after a long-term and high-level expression of indicators, and variable performance across cell types. In addition to improvement of the indicators per se, development of strategies that allow combined use of the indicators and optogenetic tools is also desired. In this Research Topic, we recruited top researchers {{in the field and}} their young colleagues to present their cutting-edge research as well as insightful opinions on the following subtopics: 1) Latest breakthroughs on development of genetically encoded indicators 2) Novel scientific findings obtained with genetically encoded indicators 3) Wishlist for the next-generation genetically encoded indicators 4) Guideline for selecting an appropriate indicator 5) Optimal methodology for indicator delivery to mammalian CN...|$|R

In the results, two-photon excitation imaging of Yellow Cameleon-Nano 15 successfully visualized intracellular Ca 2 + concentration under stimulation with the agonist at nanomolar levels. This is the first demonstration for application of genetically encoded Ca 2 + indicators to pancreatic acinar cells. We also simultaneously observed exocytotic events and an intracellular Ca 2 + concentration under in vivo condition. Yellow Cameleon-Nano 15 mice are healthy and no significant deteriorative effect was observed on physiological response regarding the pancreatic acinar cells.
