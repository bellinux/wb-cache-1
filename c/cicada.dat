5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western <b>cicada</b> killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern <b>cicada</b> killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific <b>cicada</b> killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western <b>cicada</b> killers hunt the same <b>cicada</b> species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western <b>cicada</b> killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, the other to the west.|$|E

5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian <b>cicada</b> {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the <b>cicada</b> killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless <b>cicada</b> is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E

50|$|The Cicadinae are a {{subfamily}} of <b>cicadas,</b> {{containing the}} translucent <b>cicadas.</b> They are robust <b>cicadas</b> {{and many have}} gaudy colors, but they generally lack the butterfly-like opaque wing markings found in many species of the related Tibiceninae.|$|R

5|$|Sphecius grandis {{has very}} similar nesting and feeding habits to {{other members of}} its genus, most notably Sphecius speciosus. As with S.speciosus, the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks, helped by the calls of the <b>cicada</b> males, and paralyses the insect by {{piercing}} {{the central nervous system}} with her stinger. She drags the cicadas back to her nest to place them in brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell. Females carry cicadas that are on average 88% heavier than their own body mass. It has been hypothesised that <b>cicada</b> killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid-flight. There are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell. When the larvae hatch, the <b>cicada</b> provides nutrition for the offspring to feed on.|$|E
5|$|The song of cicadas is {{considered}} by entomologists to be unique to a given species, {{and a number of}} resources exist to collect and analyse <b>cicada</b> sounds.|$|E
50|$|His 1907 {{description}} of periodic <b>cicadas</b> remains a classic in the field. In this article, Marlatt proposed a grouping of periodic <b>cicadas</b> into 30 different broods, each given a Roman numeral. Broods I-XVII assigned brood numbers {{for each of}} 17 sequential calendar years to 17-year <b>cicadas.</b> Broods XVIII-XXX assigned 13 sequential calendar years to 13-year <b>cicadas.</b> Subsequent research has established that, in fact, not every year produces a brood of periodical <b>cicadas.</b> There are only 15 distinct broods, not 30, but Marlatt's scheme continues to be used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cicadas</b> {{have many}} predators {{because of their}} {{relatively}} few defenses. Numerous mammals, reptilians, birds, and arthropods consume <b>cicadas.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Cicadas</b> were {{eaten in}} Ancient Greece, and are {{consumed}} today in China, both as adults and (more often) as nymphs, in Malaysia, Burma, Latin America, and central Africa. Female <b>cicadas</b> are prized for being meatier. Shells of <b>cicadas</b> {{are employed in}} traditional Chinese medicines.|$|R
5|$|At least 1300 <b>cicada</b> {{species are}} {{distributed}} worldwide {{with the majority}} being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism {{has been used to}} study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient. There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand, around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico, at least 800 in Latin America, and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species is in England, the New Forest <b>cicada,</b> Melampsalta montana, which also occurs in continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cicada</b> nymphs drink sap {{from the}} xylem of various species of trees, {{including}} oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While {{it is common}} folklore that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap utilizing their sucking mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{have been}} used as money, in folk medicine, to {{forecast}} the weather, to provide song (in China), and in folklore and myths around the world. In France, the <b>cicada</b> represents the folklore of Provence and the Mediterranean cities.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes chorus <b>cicadas</b> {{are found}} on buildings, fences or some lamp posts. <b>Cicadas</b> {{preferred}} {{to stay at}} the eastern coast, in sub-tropical, sub-humid and temperate environments. Chorus <b>cicadas</b> are easily to be seen in open forests and woodlands. Chorus <b>cicadas</b> lay eggs in a herring-bone pattern in the thin branches of tree. The size of eggs is like a grain of rice. Nymphs crawl up from deep below the soil surface perch and sing. They would sing louder when the weather is warmer. Sometimes, you can watch that two <b>cicadas</b> fight each other. They usually mate on trunk of tree silently.|$|R
40|$|Periostracum <b>cicadae</b> {{is widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of skin diseases such as eczema, pruritus, and itching. The current study sought to evaluate the effect of P. <b>cicadae</b> extract on ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation and identify the mechanisms involved. Photodamage-protective activity of P. <b>cicadae</b> extracts against oxidative challenge was screened using HaCaT keratinocytes. P. <b>cicadae</b> extracts did not affect cell viability but decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The extract attenuates the expression of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2), and MMP- 9 in UVB-treated HaCaT cells. Also, P. <b>cicadae</b> abrogated UVB-induced activation of NF-κB, p 53, and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1). The downmodulation of IL- 6 by P. <b>cicadae</b> was inhibited by the p 38 inhibitor (SB 203580) or JNK inhibitor (SP 600125). Moreover, the extract attenuated the expression of NF-κB and induced thrombomodulin in keratinocytes and thereby effectively downregulated inflammatory responses in the skin. The nuclear accumulation and expression of NF-E 2 -related factor (Nrf 2) were increased by P. <b>cicadae</b> treatment. Furthermore, treatment with P. <b>cicadae</b> remarkably ameliorated the skin’s structural damage induced by irradiation. This study demonstrates that P. <b>cicadae</b> may protect skin cells against oxidative insult by modulating ROS concentration, IL- 6, MMPs generation, antioxidant enzymes activity, and cell signaling pathways...|$|R

5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the <b>cicada,</b> are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of <b>Cicada</b> are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E

5|$|The listroscelidine katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia {{is capable}} of {{attracting}} male cicadas of the Tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry {{is similar to the}} Photuris firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably versatile – playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is able to attract males of many <b>cicada</b> species, including Cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though <b>cicada</b> mating signals are species-specific. The evolution of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may have been facilitated by constraints on song evolution in duetting communication systems in which reply signals are recognizable only by their precise timing in relation to the male song (<< 100 ms reply latency).|$|E
30|$|To obtain {{population}} {{samples for}} estimating host parasitism rates, adult T. dorsatus were surveyed by {{walking through the}} habitat at a study site and attempting to capture all T. dorsatus that were observed perched in the vegetation or disturbed into flight. Teneral or recently emerged <b>cicadas</b> were excluded because male <b>cicadas</b> do not develop full calling capabilities or begin sexual acoustic behaviors until several days after eclosion (Maier 1982; B. Stucky, unpublished data). Captured <b>cicadas</b> were maintained in captivity to rear the parasitoids from all infected <b>cicadas,</b> determine {{the total number of}} infected <b>cicadas</b> in each sample, and determine the parasitoid load of each host, following the methods described above.|$|R
40|$|Cordyceps <b>cicadae,</b> a {{parasitic}} fungus, {{has been}} used as a traditional Chinese herb for treatment of illnesses related to immune dysfunction. However, mechanistic actions are not entirely clear. The specific aim of the present study is to investigate the immunological mechanisms of C. <b>cicadae</b> on human T lymphocytes in vitro. The two main objectives carried out in the present study in order to achieve the aim are: i. to investigate the immunological effects of the water extract of C. <b>cicadae</b> on human resting and proliferating T lymphocytes; 2. to investigate the adjuvant property of C. <b>cicadae</b> with the immunosuppressant Cyclosporin A (CsA) on the control of human T cells proliferation, cell death and cytokines secretion. C. <b>cicadae</b> has demonstrated a dual effect of enhancing the activity of resting Tlymphocytes and inhibiting that of PHA-stimulated cells. In resting T cells, C. <b>cicadae</b> increased cell activity, cytokines secretion, expression of IL- 2 α receptor (CD 25) and the population of Th 17 as well as Treg cells without affecting the cell cycle progression. In the viability and cell death test, C. <b>cicadae</b> has been found not to exert toxicity on T cells. These results reveal the role of C. <b>cicadae</b> as an invigorant to improve the immunity as a whole in healthy individuals. In PHA-stimulated proliferating T-lymphocytes, C. <b>cicadae</b> inhibited the cell proliferation by arresting them at G 0 /G 1 phase and decreasing both S and G 2 /M phase cell populations. The inhibitory effect was not through the induction of cell death as both PHA- and CsA-induced cell apoptosis and necrosis were reduced by C. <b>cicadae</b> treatment. It was believed that C. <b>cicadae</b> affects the progression of inflammatory responses by selectively suppressing the secretion of Th 1 cytokines and enhancing that of Th 2 cytokines, but it seemed unable to influence the CD 25 expression in PHA- and CsA-treated T cells. An increased population of Treg cells by C. <b>cicadae</b> was also observed in PHA-stimulated T cells. C. <b>cicadae</b> adjuvant to CsA showed greater inhibition of cell proliferation and Th 1 cytokines production. However, C. <b>cicadae</b> antagonized the effect of CsA in the secretion of IL- 10, a Th 2 and Treg cytokine. These results suggest a potential role of C. <b>cicadae</b> as an adjuvantive agent with CsA in the therapy of autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. Furthermore, C. <b>cicadae</b> demonstrated superior immunomodulatory properties over CsA as it can act selectively between resting and proliferating T cells, and also protect them from apoptosis and necrosis, alleviating the toxic effect caused by CsA. In summary, this study showed the potential of C. <b>cicadae</b> as an immunomodulator from which both healthy individuals and inflammatory disease patients can benefit. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
5|$|The {{periodical}} <b>cicadas</b> (Magicicada) {{make use}} of predator satiation: they emerge, all at once, at long intervals of 13 or 17 years; their juveniles are probably the longest-lived of all insect development stages. Since the number of <b>cicadas</b> in any given area exceeds the amount predators can eat, all available predators are satiated, and the remaining <b>cicadas</b> can breed in peace.|$|R
5|$|Bird {{predation}} of {{the adult}} <b>cicada</b> is common, with wrens and grey fantails, noisy miners, blue-faced honeyeaters, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, magpie-larks, Torresian crows, white-faced herons and even the nocturnal tawny frogmouth, all reported as significant predators. The frogmouths and bearded dragons have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs, however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10%.|$|E
5|$|German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar {{described}} the floury baker in 1834 as <b>Cicada</b> curvicosta. Germar based the description on two specimens {{now in the}} Hope Entomological Collections, Oxford, but did not designate a type specimen and their exact locations were not recorded. In 2003, {{one of the original}} specimens was designated the lectotype and the other the paralectotype.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of <b>cicada,</b> the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
30|$|Since female <b>cicadas</b> are silent, how {{are they}} {{discovered}} by E. erro in the field? One possibility is that, simply by chance, they happen to fly within the visual range of a perched female E. erro. Perhaps more likely, though, female T. dorsatus and female E. erro might sometimes encounter one another while seeking male <b>cicadas.</b> Like E. erro, female <b>cicadas</b> perform phonotaxis in response to males’ calls, so female <b>cicadas</b> could become parasitized if they were attracted to the same calling male as a female E. erro. In any case, despite many hours spent observing <b>cicadas</b> in the field, I never witnessed any interactions between female E. erro and female T. dorsatus, so such encounters must be rare in comparison to encounters between male <b>cicadas</b> and female E. erro. However, E. erro’s occasional use of female hosts is not unique. Several other species of acoustic parasitoids that primarily attack male hosts are also known to sometimes parasitize females (Soper et al. 1976; Lehmann 2003).|$|R
5|$|Several fungal {{diseases}} infect {{and kill}} adult <b>cicadas</b> while another entomopathogenic fungus, Cordyceps spp., attacks nymphs. Massospora cicadina specifically attacks the adults of periodical <b>cicadas,</b> the spores remaining dormant {{in the soil}} between outbreaks.|$|R

5|$|Predators {{such as the}} sarcophagid fly Emblemasoma hunt cicadas by sound, being {{attracted}} to their song. Singing males soften their song so that {{the attention of the}} listener gets distracted to neighbouring louder singers, or cease singing altogether as a predator approaches.

5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the <b>Cicada</b> 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the <b>cicada</b> sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>cicadas</b> such as Hemisciera maculipennis display bright deimatic flash {{coloration}} {{on their}} hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the <b>cicadas</b> time to escape. The majority of <b>cicadas</b> are nocturnal {{and rely on}} camouflage when at rest, but some species are aposematic; the Malaysian Huechys sanguinea has conspicuous red and black warning coloration, is diurnal, and boldly flies about {{in full view of}} possible predators.|$|R
30|$|All <b>cicadas</b> {{used for}} {{this part of the}} study were mature adult male T. dorsatus that were {{captured}} directly in the field. Captured <b>cicadas</b> were maintained outdoors in large cloth mesh cages placed over live branches of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), which provided the <b>cicadas</b> with a suitable food source. After capture, and before exposing them to parasitoids, all <b>cicadas</b> were closely monitored for up to 9  days to determine whether they had already been parasitized in the field by E. erro. Only unparasitized <b>cicadas</b> were used for studying cicada/fly interactions. Adult female E. erro were obtained by broadcasting the model call of T. dorsatus in the field, as described above, and collecting attracted female flies by hand. Flies were kept in small mesh cages in the laboratory and provided with sucrose and water ad libitum.|$|R
