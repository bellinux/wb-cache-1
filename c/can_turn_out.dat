500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Tippett {{produced}} three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony No. 4 (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). [...] The symphony, {{written in the}} manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen [...] "the sounds emitted <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello". [...] The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in [...] "finding a sound" [...] that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments [...] perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Algebras {{such as the}} split-complex {{numbers that}} include non-real roots of 1 also contain idempotents [...] and zero divisors , so such algebras cannot be {{division}} algebras. However, these properties <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be very meaningful, for instance in describing the Lorentz transformations of special relativity.|$|E

2500|$|Ponies are {{generally}} considered intelligent and friendly, though sometimes {{they also are}} described as stubborn or cunning. The differences of opinion often result from an individual pony's degree of proper training. Ponies trained by inexperienced individuals, or only ridden by beginners, <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be spoiled because their riders typically lack the experience base to correct bad habits. Properly trained ponies are appropriate mounts {{for children who are}} learning to ride. [...] Larger ponies can be ridden by adults, as ponies are usually strong for their size.|$|E
2500|$|In a 5–4 decision, Florence v. County of Burlington (2012), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} people {{detained}} and {{admitted to the}} general jail population for any offense may be subjected to strip searches without a reason to suspect contraband. Kennedy, joined by the court's conservative wing, wrote, [...] "Every detainee who will be admitted {{to the general population}} may be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed," [...] and [...] "undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from the more invasive search procedures at issue absent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband." [...] According to Kennedy, [...] "people detained for minor offenses <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the most devious and dangerous criminals," [...] and cited examples including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and a September 11 hijacker, who were both stopped for traffic violations shortly before committing their respective crimes.|$|E

40|$|As part of {{evaluating}} {{options for the}} design and implementation of a scalable application-level multicast system, we produced an independent implementation of CAN, experimented with tuning it, and also extended it to improve its performance and in some cases, correctness. We were able to reproduce most of the results in the original CAN paper, providing independent validation of their results. However, we encountered far more complexity with tuning and extending CAN than anticipated. The best set of parameter choices appeared to be highly scenariospecific and non-intuitive, at least {{for some of the}} parameters supported. Tuning CAN involved a lot of trial-and-error navigation through the CAN parameter space. Furthermore, the "anycast" semantics provided by <b>CAN</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to make our application design more complex than was originally anticipated...|$|R
50|$|This made {{also the}} forming of post-electoral coalitions {{somewhat}} unpredictable, as the overall success {{of one of}} the greatest parties <b>can</b> effectively <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be counterproductive if it is achieved at the expense of their foreseeable partner, causing them to not pass the threshold in some or all electorates (it happened to the HDZ-led coalition in previous 2003 election).|$|R

5000|$|Editing a long Wikipedia article <b>can</b> {{sometimes}} <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to {{be painful}} and time-consuming due to web-forms limitations.

60|$|Next day, sure enough, the {{cablegram}} didn't come.

Of course every day that the cablegram didn't come made Tracy all of twenty-four hours' more ashamed of himself than he was the day before, and made Sally fully twenty-four hours more certain than ever that he not only hadn't any father anywhere, but hadn't even a confederate--and so it followed that he was a double-dyed humbug and couldn't be otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Branding {{tended to}} be {{abolished}} like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under sharia law), sooner and more widely than flogging, caning, and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial knout) <b>can</b> even <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to cause death.|$|R
40|$|Atonal {{music is}} not very common inside guitar {{literature}} in particular and musical performance in general.
