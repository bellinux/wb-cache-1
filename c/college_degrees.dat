5|$|In 1738, the Synod {{moved to}} {{restrict}} itinerant preaching and to tighten educational requirements for ministers, actions the New Side resented. Tensions {{between the two}} sides continued to escalate until the Synod of May 1741, which ended with a definite split between the two factions. The Old Side retained control of the Synod of Philadelphia, and it immediately required unconditional subscription to the Westminster Confession with no option to state scruples. The New Side founded the Synod of New York. The new Synod required subscription to the Westminster Confession in accordance with the Adopting Act, but no <b>college</b> <b>degrees</b> were required for ordination.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack <b>college</b> <b>degrees</b> the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

5|$|This was but {{one point}} of {{difference}} between Oak Ridge residents {{and the rest of}} Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had <b>college</b> <b>degrees,</b> the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years.

5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with <b>college</b> <b>degrees,</b> and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|The Teamsters Union {{was by far}} {{the largest}} and most notable {{contributor}} of workers to the pipeline project. Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project.

There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project. Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, and pointed to the fact that 80 percent of the Teamsters in the project had <b>college</b> <b>degrees</b> or professional and management experience.|$|E
