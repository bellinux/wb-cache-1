She also visited many clients in their own homes. On Wednesdays she worked at the local hairdressing salon on Bay Street. As people sat under the hairdryer they would have their feet attended to as well.|$|E
25|$|Dickens's {{literary}} success {{began with}} the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's <b>chiropodist</b> expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features. His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring {{a new class of}} readers.|$|E

[...] Between 1837 and 1990, the chapel had six permanent pastors, some of whom served for many years: John W.

5000|$|The union {{originated}} in 1912 as the Society of <b>Chiropodists,</b> the first organisation of <b>chiropodists</b> in Europe. [...] In 1916, it was renamed the Incorporated Society of <b>Chiropodists,</b> and in 1919, it established examinations for potential new members. Several rival organisations emerged: the Northern Association of <b>Chiropodists,</b> the Chelsea <b>Chiropodists</b> Association and the British Association of <b>Chiropodists.</b> These {{merged with the}} Incorporated Society in 1945, the new body once more taking the name [...] "Society of Chiropodists". It was recognised as a negotiating body by the National Health Service in 1948, but did not register as a trade union until 1978. In 1993, it took its current name, recognising the membership of podiatrists, and in 1997, it affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. In 1998, the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers and the Podiatry Association both merged with the society.|$|R

2500|$|His {{characters}} were often so memorable {{that they took}} {{on a life of}} their own outside his books. [...] "Gamp" [...] became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp, and [...] "Pickwickian", [...] "Pecksniffian", and [...] "Gradgrind" [...] all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, quixotic, hypocritical, and vapidly factual. Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, though she didn't recognise herself in the portrait, just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's 'rhetorical exuberance': Harold Skimpole in Bleak House is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt: his wife's dwarfish <b>chiropodist</b> recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield. Perhaps Dickens's impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep.|$|E

6000|$|If he {{had taken}} a contradictious tone on purpose to draw Mrs. Luna out, he could not have {{elicited}} more of the information he desired. It was perfectly true that he had seen no reference to Verena's performances in the preceding June; there were periods when the newspapers seemed to him so idiotic that for weeks he never looked at one. He learned from Mrs. Luna that it was not Olive who had sent her the [...] "Transcript" [...] and in letters had added some private account of the doings at the convention to the testimony of that amiable sheet; she had been indebted for this service to a [...] "gentleman-friend," [...] who wrote her everything that happened in Boston, and what every one had every day for dinner. Not that it was necessary for her happiness to know; but the gentleman she spoke of didn't know what to invent to please her. A Bostonian couldn't imagine that one didn't want to know, and that was their idea of ingratiating themselves, or, at any rate, it was his, poor man. Olive would never have gone into particulars about Verena; she regarded her sister as quite too much one of the profane, and knew Adeline couldn't understand why, when she took to herself a bosom-friend, she should have been at such pains to select her in just the most dreadful class in the community. Verena was a perfect little adventuress, and quite third-rate into the bargain; but, of course, she was a pretty girl enough, if one cared for hair of the colour of cochineal. As for her people, they were too absolutely awful; it was exactly as if she, Mrs. Luna, had struck up an intimacy with the daughter of her <b>chiropodist.</b> It took Olive to invent such monstrosities, and to think she was doing something great for humanity when she did so; though, in spite of her wanting to turn everything over, and put the lowest highest, she could be just as contemptuous and invidious, when it came to really mixing, as if she were some grand old duchess. She must do her the justice to say that she hated the Tarrants, the father and mother; but, all the same, she let Verena run to and fro between Charles Street and the horrible hole they lived in, and Adeline knew from that gentleman who wrote so copiously that the girl now and then spent a week at a time at Cambridge. Her mother, who had been ill for some weeks, wanted her to sleep there. Mrs. Luna knew further, by her correspondent, that Verena had--or had had the winter before--a great deal of attention from gentlemen. She didn't know how she worked that into the idea that the female sex was sufficient to itself; but she had grounds for saying that this was one reason why Olive had taken her abroad. She was afraid Verena would give in to some man, and she wanted to make a break. Of course, any such giving in would be very awkward for a young woman who shrieked out on platforms that old maids were the highest type. Adeline guessed Olive had perfect control of her now, unless indeed she used the expeditions to Cambridge as a cover for meeting gentlemen. She was an artful little minx, and cared as much for the rights of women as she did for the Panama Canal; the only right of a woman she wanted was to climb up on top of something, where the men could look at her. She would stay with Olive as long as it served her purpose, because Olive, with her great respectability, could push her, and counteract the effect of her low relations, to say nothing of paying all her expenses and taking her the tour of Europe. [...] "But, mark my words," [...] said Mrs. Luna, [...] "she will give Olive the greatest cut she has ever had in her life. She will run off with some lion-tamer; she will marry a circus-man!" [...] And Mrs. Luna added that it would serve Olive Chancellor right. But she would take it hard; look out for tantrums then! ...|$|E
