40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that copper-based {{perovskite}} oxides rightly enjoy consensus as high-temperature superconductors on the basis of two signatures: Meissner effect and zero resistance. In contrast, I provide over twenty signatures for room temperature superconductivity in carbon nanotubes. The one-dimensionality of the nanotubes complicates the right-of-passage for prospective quasi-one-dimensional superconductors. The Meissner effect is less visible because the diameters of nanotubes are much smaller than the penetration depth. Zero resistance is less obvious because of the quantum contact resistance and significant quantum phase slip, both of which are associated with a finite number of transverse conduction channels. Nonetheless, on-tube resistance at room temperature {{has been found to be}} indistinguishable from zero for many individual multi-walled nanotubes. On the basis of more than twenty arguments, I suggest that carbon nanotubes deserve to be classified as room temperature superconductors.

40|$|We study {{electrical}} transport through self-assembled Au nanoparticle clusters {{which can}} be viewed as a new model system to study hopping transport. The physics of such systems is governed by two parameters: the charging energy and tunnel coupling between the particles. The charging energy is determined by the size of the nanoparticles. When the diameter of the nanoparticles is less than 4 - 5 nm the charging energy is large enough that Coulomb blockade eects were observed in electri-cal transport even at room temperature. The magnitude of the tunnel coupling between the parti-cles was determined by the thiol coating used. To study a wide range of tunnel couplings, we have synthesized gold nanoparticles with various thiol coatings, including 1 -octanethiol, 1 -dodecanethiol, 1 -octadecanethiol, 4 -mercaptodiphenylacetylene, 4 -nitro- 4 -mercaptodiphenylacetylene, and 3, 5 -dinitro- 4 -mercaptodiphenylacetylene.

In this paper we investigate the role of one component of the locomotion subsystem, namely the body wall muscles, with a focus on the role of inter-muscular gap junctions. We construct a detailed electrophysiological model which suggests that these muscles function, to a first approximation, as mere actuators and have no obvious rhythm generating role. Furthermore, we show that within our model inter-muscular coupling is too weak to have a significant electrical effect. These results rule out muscles as key generators of locomotion, pointing instead to neural activity patterns.

40|$|Abstract. Regulation of cell migration/invasion is {{important}} for embryonic development, immune function, and angiogenesis. However, migratory cells must also coordinately activate survival mechanisms to invade the extracellular matrix and colonize foreign sites in the body. Although invasive cells activate protective programs to survive under diverse and sometimes hostile conditions, the molecular signals that regulate these processes are poorly understood. Evidence is provided that signals that induce cell invasion also promote cell survival by suppressing apoptosis of migratory cells. Extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and molecular coupling of the adaptor proteins p 130 Crk-associated substrate (CAS) and c-CrkII (Crk) represent two distinct pathways that induce cell invasion and protect cells from apoptosis in a three-dimensional collagen matrix. CAS/Crk-mediated cell invasion and survival requires activation of the small GTPase Rac, whereas ERK-induced cell invasion, but not survival requires myosin light chain kinase activation and myosin light chain phosphorylation. Uncoupling CAS from Crk or inhibition of ERK activity prevents migration and induces apoptosis of invasive cells. These findings provide molecular evidence that during invasion of the extracellular matrix, cells coordinately regulate migration and survival mechanisms through ERK activation and CAS/Crk <b>coupling.</b> <b>Key</b> words: cell survival • mitogen-activated protein kinases • signal transduction • three-dimensional collagen • integrin...|$|E

A significant time delay was observed in the ionospheric response to the IMF B y changes between the two hemispheres. This is explained as being partially a consequence of the location of the dominant merging region on the magnetopause, which is ~ 8 - 12 R E closer to the northern ionosphere than to the southern ionosphere (along the magnetic field line) due to the dipole tilt of the magnetosphere and the orientation of the IMF.

40|$|ABSTRACT Sodium {{channels}} {{have four}} homologous domains (D 1 -D 4) each with six putative transmembrane segments (S 1 -$ 6). The highly charged $ 4 segments in each domain are postulated voltage sensors for gating. We made 15 charge-neutralizing or-reversing substitutions {{in the first}} or third basic residues (arginine or lysine) by replacement with histidine, glutamine, or glutamate in $ 4 segments of each domain {{of the human heart}} Na ÷ channel. Nine of the mutations cause shifts in the conductance-voltage (G-V) midpoints, and all but two significantly decrease the voltage dependence of peak Na + current, consistent with a role of $ 4 segments in activation. The decreases in voltage dependence of activation were equivalent to a decrease in apparent gating charge of 0. 5 - 2. 1 elementary charges (%) per channel for single charge-neutralizing mutations. Three charge-reversing mutations gave decreases of 1. 2 - 1. 9 eo per channel in voltage dependence of activation. The steady-state inactivation (h~) curves were fit by single-component Boltzmann functions and show significant decreases in slope for 9 of the 15 mutants and shifts of midpoints in 9 mutants.

Good and faulty memories are represented as Mealy automata using the formal framework for sequential machine testing developed by Brzozowski and J/irgensen. A precise description of the coupling fault is used to define two fault models: "general coupling, " which is the set of all possible multiple coupling faults, and "general toggling, " which is a subset of general coupling. A lower bound of 2 n 2 + n is derived on the length of any test that detects general toggling in an n cell memory; a test by Marinescu is thereby shown to be optimal for this fault model. A lower bound of 2 n z + 3 n is derived on the length of any test that detects general coupling, and a corresponding test of length 2 n z + 4 n is described.

Turner {{syndrome}} (TS), a disorder {{caused by the}} congenital absence {{of one of the}} 2 X chromosomes in femalehumans, provides a valuable human “knockout model ” for studying the functions of the X chromosome. At present, it remains unknown whether and how the loss of the X chromosome influences intrinsic functional connectivity (FC), a fundamental phenotype of the human brain. To address this, we performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and specific cognitive assessments on 22 TS patients and 17 age-matched control girls. A novel data-driven approach was applied to identify the disrupted patterns of intrinsic FC in TS. The TS girls exhibited significantly reducedwhole-brain FC strengthwithin the bilateral postcentral gyrus/intraparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, and cuneus and the right cerebellum. Furthermore, a specific functional subnetwork was identified in which the intrinsic FC between nodes was mostly reduced in TS patients. Particularly, this subnetwork is composedof 3 functionalmodules, and the disruption of intrinsic FCwithin one of thesemoduleswas associated with the deficits of TS patients in math-related cognition.

Reconstitution of dysgenic myotubes with the skeletal muscle Ca 2 � channel � 1 S subunit restores Ca 2 � currents, EC coupling, and the normal localization of � 1 S in the triads. In contrast, expression of the neuronal � 1 A subunit gives rise to robust Ca 2 � currents but not to triad localization. To identify regions in the primary structure of � 1 S involved in the targeting of the Ca 2 � channel into the triads, chimeras of � 1 S and � 1 A were constructed, expressed in dysgenic myotubes, and their subcellular distribution was analyzed with double immunofluorescence labeling of the � 1 S/ � 1 A chimeras and the ryanodine receptor. Whereas chimeras containing the COOH terminus of � 1 A were not incorporated into triads, chimeras containing the COOH terminus of � 1 S were correctly targeted. Mapping of the COOH terminus revealed a triad-targeting signal contained in the 55 amino-acid sequence (1607 – 1661) proximal to the putative clipping site of � 1 S.
