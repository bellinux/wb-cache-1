40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> are {{the third}} largest {{healthcare}} professional group in the world after physicians and nurses. Despite their considerable training, <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> are the only health professionals who are not primarily rewarded for delivering health care and hence are under-utilized as public health professionals. An emerging consensus among academics, professional organizations, and policymakers is that <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> who work outside of hospital settings, should adopt an expanded role in order {{to contribute to the}} safe, effective, and efficient use of drugs-particularly when caring for people with multiple chronic conditions. <b>Community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> could help to improve health by reducing drug-related adverse events and promoting better medication adherence, which in turn may help in reducing unnecessary provider visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions while strengthening integrated primary care delivery across the health system. This paper reviews recent strategies to expand the role of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in Australia, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Scotland, and the United States. The developments achieved or under way in these countries carry lessons for policymakers world-wide, where progress thus far in expanding the role of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> has been more limited.

DESIGN: A qualitative study employing focus groups was conducted. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING: 3 different geographical locations in the England. PARTICIPANTS: <b>Community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> (n= 22). RESULTS: The focus groups identified an array of factors and constraints, which affect the ability of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> to contribute to initiatives to limit the use of antipsychotics. 3 key themes were revealed: (1) politics and the medical hierarchy, which created communication barriers; (2) how resources and remit impact the effectiveness of community pharmacy; and (3) understanding {{the nature of the}} treatment of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an improvement in communication between <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and healthcare professionals, especially general practitioners (GPs) must occur in order for <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> to assist in limiting the use of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Additionally, extra training in working with people with dementia is required. Thus, an intervention which involves appropriately trained pharmacists working in collaboration with GPs and other caregivers is required.

Aim of the review: The aim was to review the current roles of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Objective: The objective was to encourage <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> toward extending their practice roles. Methods: In 2010, Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) surveyed <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> using an online questionnaire, on their preferences toward extending their counseling roles and their opinion of the greatest challenge facing the extension of their counseling roles. Results: Following this survey, several programs {{have been developed to}} prepare <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> to undertake these extended counseling roles. In addition to that, HAAD redefined the scope of pharmacist roles to include some extended/enhanced roles. Abu Dhabi Health Services (SEHA) mission is to ensure reliable excellence in healthcare.

40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmThe global {{movement}} towards enhancing inter-professional {{collaboration in}} patient care is {{in light of}} the increasing potency of drugs and complexity of drug regimens, particularly in the chronically ill where poly-pharmacy is rife, collaborative patient management by general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> in particular, has the potential to enhance patient therapeutic outcomes in primary healthcare. Literature {{from other parts of the}} world has enumerated the advantages of collaboration. South Africa with its unusual quadruple burden of disease and human resource deficient public healthcare system would benefit from collaboration between general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> through expanded roles for <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> to enable them to make more meaningful contributions to primary healthcare regimens. Particularly with the introduction of the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. This dissertation aims to assess from general practitioners‟ perspectives: the current level and stage of collaboration (using the collaborative working relationship (CWR) model proposed by McDonough and Doucette, 2001) between general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in patient care, if general practitioners‟ perceptions of the professional roles of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in patients‟ care can influence desired collaboration (prospects of enhanced future collaboration) and how do general practitioners envision enhanced future collaboration between them and <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in patient care, possible barriers to the envisioned collaboration between the two practitioners, and how general practitioners‟ demographic characteristics influence inter-professional collaboration with <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> Sixty randomly selected consenting general practitioners in private practice participated in a cross-sectional, face- to-face questionnaire study. The questionnaire contained a range of statements with Likert scale response options. Data was initially entered into Epi Info (version 3. 5. 1., 2008) and then exported to IBM SPSS Statistical software for analysis (version 19, 2010). Medians were used to summarize descriptive data and Spearman‟s correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test was used for bivariate analysis. Ethical approval was granted by the Senate Research and International Relations Committee, University of the Western Cape (Ethical Clearance Number: 10 / 4 / 29). The results indicated low-levels of current collaboration at stage 0 of the CWR model between general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> A statistically significant correlation was observed between general practitioners‟ perceptions of the professional roles of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and desired collaboration (prospects of enhanced future collaboration), [p= 0. 0005]. Good prospects of enhanced future collaboration between general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> were observed. General practitioners identified barriers to collaboration to include: the lack of remuneration for collaboration, absence of a government mandate or policy supporting collaboration, inability of general practitioners to share patients‟ information with <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and questionable professional ethics exhibited by <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> particularly over financial gains. Most general practitioners agreed that joint continuing professional education organized by pharmaceutical companies or other groups will increase interaction and enhance collaboration.

40|$|Introduction: In 1997, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain Working Party {{reported}} that UK <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> had {{a crucial role}} in effective medicines management and effective symptom control for those receiving palliative care in the community. However, prior to the integration of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> into the <b>community</b> palliative team, it is necessary {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} their pharmaceutical interventions. Aim: To assess the effectiveness of community pharmacists' clinical interventions in supporting palliative care patients in primary care using an independent multidisciplinary panel review. Methods: Patients with a life expectancy of less than 12 months were each registered with a single pharmacy and their consent was obtained for the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> to access their general practitioner (GP) case records. The <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> received training in palliative pharmaceutical care and documenting interventions. The trained <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> provided palliative pharmaceutical care to the recruited patients. At the end of a 10 -month period, the clinical interventions were reviewed by an independent multidisciplinary expert panel consisting of a palliative care consultant, a Macmillan nurse (community palliative care nurse) and a hospital pharmacist with special interest in palliative care. Results: Fourteen community palliative care teams (including <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> GPs and <b>community</b> nurses) took part in the study and 25 patients were recruited over the 10 -month recording period. All but one patient had a diagnosis of cancer; the other patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By the end of the project, 14 patients had died. <b>Community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> recorded a total of 130 clinical interventions. Thirty interventions were excluded as insufficient information had been documented to allow review by the panel. Eighty-one per cent of the interventions were judged by the expert panel likely to be beneficial. However, 3 % were judged likely to be detrimental to the patients' well-being. Conclusions: Most of the clinical interventions made by the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> for palliative pharmaceutical care were judged by the expert panel as being likely to be beneficial. The result supports the view that when <b>community</b> <b>pharmacists</b> are appropriately trained and included as integrated members of the team, they can intervene effectively to improve pharmaceutical care for palliative care patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Background Oral anticancer {{medicines}} (OAM) facilitate {{transfer of}} cancer care into the community, where safeguards developed in hospitals that control their prescribing, dispensing and administration may not exist. Objective To {{determine if the}} systems of prescribing and dispensing OAM in Ireland facilitate clinical verification of the prescription, thereby ensuring treatment is tailored and appropriate for the patient. Setting Randomly selected community pharmacies in Ireland and all Irish hospitals with cancer services. Method A questionnaire {{was sent to a}} random selection of Irish community pharmacists. A different questionnaire was sent to all Irish hospitals treating cancer patients. One hundred OAM prescriptions were retrospectively reviewed, to assess the information presented and the potential barriers to a <b>community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> performing a clinical verification of the prescription. Main outcome measure <b>Community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> survey: problems experienced when dispensing OAM and risk factors identified with the current system. Hospital pharmacist survey: proportion of hospitals that clinically verify prescriptions for parenteral versus oral anticancer medicines and associated policies. OAM prescription review: proportion of OAM prescriptions that contained sufficient information for a <b>community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> to clinically verify the prescription and safely dispense the medication. Results Sixty-four percent of <b>community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> respondents felt they did not have enough information available to them to safely dispense these prescriptions, and 74  % felt that patients are at risk with the current Irish system of prescribing and dispensing OAM. Irish hospitals do not have systems to ensure that all OAM prescriptions are clinically verified by a pharmacist. Seventeen different agents were prescribed on the prescriptions reviewed. The information provided to the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> would have allowed them to clinically verify 7  % of the OAM prescriptions. Conclusion Prescriptions for OAM reach the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> with little chance that they have been clinically verified in the hospital and the medicine reaches the patient with little chance that the <b>community</b> <b>pharmacist</b> has been able to clinically verify it. Healthcare risks are increased when inadequate information about patients and their medicines are available.
