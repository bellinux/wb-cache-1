5000|$|At Borneo Thailand, Reggie {{is seen in}} his lair, while he's taunting Shelly (who {{is still}} in her Heruka form) {{who is in a}} cage. Albino and Octavio arrive and Octavio has {{reported}} Reggie about the Chupacabra (spelled [...] "Chupakabra" [...] in the game) in Puerto Rico. Reggie forces Octavio to take Meg and Steppenwolf to Puerto Rico to get a blood sample from the Chupacabra. Octavio soon arrives at Puerto Rico with Meg and Steppenwolf. Octavio tells them to be careful by an evil group of villains called [...] "the Cult". Soon, Meg and Steppenwolf have stayed in a house and are seen at the balcony seeing a very nice view. Steppenwolf then had to leave for a while to see if Octavio has returned from his meeting at the Hotel Santo. Before going to the hotel, he knockes on several doors on houses, but the Puerto Rican villagers won't let him inside, because the Chupacabra is out there. Steppenwolf then head to the Hotel Santo. He enters one of the rooms and finds a scared man. He tells Steppenwolf to leave, because the Chupacabra apparently attacked Octavio at the other room. However he goes to the other room where Octavio is stabbed, not bitten and is badly wounded. He calls Meg for help to get here as soon as possible. Suddenly, Steppenwolf finds the man running in the hall. Steppenwolf has realized man attacked Octavio. After he leaves the hotel and breaks into the house, he finds the same person who was running into the hallway at the hotel. The man blocks Steppenwolf's path and tries to stab him with a dagger. Steppenwolf uses plates to hit the man. Steppenwolf then used a trash can lid and runs into the man who crashes into some of the glass objects and the objects breaks into sharp pieces and the wounded thief runs for his life. Steppenwolf chases the man while he finds the man's trail of blood. Steppenwolf goes into the sewer (thieves are blocking his path at the buildings and rats are blocking the sewers, until he scares them off with flames) and finds himself leading to the beach. Steppenwolf then finds a symbol where a cult has been. He uses the dagger into the doorway. As the secret door opens, Steppenwolf enters and he falls into a trapdoor. He falls into a cage and accidentally smashed his communicator that was on his left glove. He suddenly sees the Chupacabra growling at him. Meanwhile, back at the Santio Hotel, Meg and a doctor are giving aid to Octavio. Meg said that Steppenwolf isn't answering his calls, but she'll find him. As Meg leaves the hotel, a boy named Pedro then spotted her. He asks if she seen the Chupacabra. Meg said yes and asked how did he knew. Pedro said that a local farmer's goats were killed by the monster and its tracks are still fresh. He said he will take her to the area. As they reached there, the farmer told the two to leave, because he said there was [...] "nothing" [...] to see here. Meg needs to get inside to see what the farmer's hiding and Pedro will attract the farmer's attention by throwing rocks. After Pedro distracted the farmer, Meg gets inside and locks one of the Dobermen in a car. When Meg reached to the garden, she noticed dead goats with the same cult symbol on them and with a dagger next to them. However, the farmer noticed his dog locked in the car and the gate leading to dead goats is open. He releases his dog and tries to find Meg, but she keeps hiding in the tall grass. Meg then trapped the dog in a box. She then reaches to a farm and the farmer follows her. When Meg got in, the farmer was searching for her. Meg distracted him by running a lot of water and she climbs up a ladder where it leads to another room. Meg then finds a note that says "Now, you know what happens to those who refused to cooperate. Don't bother asking for help; you won't get it, and you never know when you'll be asking one of us. We're everywhere. So, from now on, do exactly what we say, and don't whisper a word to anyone - or next time, it won't be your livestock lying shredded {{in a pool of blood}} and gore." There was also a drop of blood on the note. Back at Donovan's lair, his nurse putting cosmetic on his face. He said that he was having enough of the disgusting concoctions. The nurse tells him to quit moving or she'll mess up his [...] "beautiful" [...] face. We see Reggie has some slight wrinkles on himself and a red spot on his forehead. He tells the nurse that he'll only accept orders from a babe like her if she gets a little closer to him and he chuckles. The nurse laughs with joy. Donovan told Albino to ask if a man can have some fun, but maybe not. Albino feels a bit nervous and <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> Donovan then told Albino that he doesn't trust Octavio and tells him to go to Puerto Rico to keep a close eye on their team.|$|E

Then D.W. believes That it looks just like a pepperoni pizza. Then D.W. told him that next year she would not have any homework cause Miss Meeker isn't giving it. Then Arthur calls his Mother like [...] "MOM!" [...] That his Sister was Being such a pest. Then his Mother told him that it was almost time for bed. By the next morning, Mr. Ratburn told Arthur's class that they would study harder than ever and they will be given a few words to study. Every week, Arthur's class studied harder than ever. Francine was reading Book called [...] "Spelling Tricks and Tips" [...] while drinking plum soda and wearing her movie star glasses. Muffy was busy doing work on the computer finding games, Buster was picking out a good luck charm. Then the Brain was taking a nap on top of the books. One Thursday, Arthur was in his tree house spending a lot of good time looking for some quiet places to study. On Friday, It was time for the best test, Arthur and his friends are busy spelling words, Once Arthur was taking the test, He could just hear Miss Sweatwater's Class making some popcorn. Then he also could hear Miss Fink's Class having a field trip to the aquarium. Then whispers to Francine [...] "Why did we have to get stuck with the rat?". During Lunch, Mr. Ratburn corrected Arthur and his friends' Paper list of words. Then Muffy smiles, Francine starts having the hiccups and Buster patted his good luck charm. And soon, Mr. Ratburn <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> that the class representatives will be Arthur and the Brain, Then Muffy says that they're must be some mistake. Mr. Ratburn gives Arthur and his friend, the Brain, a list of spelling words and tells them to studied these and be ready for the all-school spellathon in two weeks. At home, Arthur's family decided to help him study. Grandma Thora asked him a bunch of words. Then his father asked him about chores like [...] "C-H-O-R-E-S" [...] and his Mother added that he made his bed like [...] "B-E-D".

40|$|Olfaction, {{the sense}} of smell is an old sensory modality; in fact the whole {{olfactory}} system belongs to a phylogenetically old part of the neuraxis, the paleocortex. (1) It {{is one of the}} two chemical senses, the other being taste. Here the odorant is dissolved in the mucous layer covering the neuroepithelium and transported across the cell membrane to generate an action potential and a nerve impulse is initiated. This nerve impulse through the complex circuits of the olfactory cortex and diencephalic connections is perceived at cortical level as a smell sensation of a specific odorant. Pleasant or repelant is a subjective subsequent feeling which will determine the animal’s response and of course reaction. In submammalian vertebrates, animals odorant detection represents a crucial tool for exploration of the environment with the opinion of finding food, water, shelter and of course a mate, while on the other hand the avoidance of nonfavourable conditions in the environment especially enemies is needed for survival. In mammals this sense is enforced and behavioral functions are added to that including emotion. (2) Only 5 % of the mucus membrane of the nasal cavity sub-serves the function of smell. (3) The rest of the respiratory epithelium helps trap foreign bodies and clears them downwards into the gastrointestinal tract to be denatured by the stomach acid or otherwise cleared outwards every time one blows his nose or <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> The size of the epithelium is a good indicator of the acuity of smell e. g., the surface area of the neuroepithlium of humans is 10 square cm, that of dogs is 170 square cm, not only that but dogs have 100 times more receptors per square centimetre than humans no wonder dogs have a much better sense of smell (4). The olfactory nerve CN 1, is unique in belonging to the paleocortex, an old part of the neuraxis, lying in a peripheral position in the nasal mucus membrane and yet extending an axon to innervate olfactory cortex directly without relay station, last but not least it is the only cranial nerve which undergoes continuous cell renewal during programmed cell death or apoptosis and after injury or cell necrosis from staminal progenitor elements in the base of the neuroepithelium. The life span of olfactory sensory neurons is estimated to be 30 - 40 days.
