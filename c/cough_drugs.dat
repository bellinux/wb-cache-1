40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the level of evidence regarding the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications registered in Brazil. The National Health Surveillance Agency database was used to identify the drugs. Clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and studies on safety were searched on the Medline baseline, the Cochrane Library and SIETES (System of Essential Information in Therapeutics and Health; database in Spanish). Most drugs (62. 5 %) were sold as a fixed-dose combination of two or more drugs. Randomized clinical trials were found for only three drugs: bromhexine, dextromethorphan and guaifenesin. No clinical trials were found for fixed-dose combinations. Systematic reviews on Cochrane did not report any evidence in favor of or against the effectiveness of <b>cough</b> <b>drugs.</b> Efficacy is also unclear, especially regarding fixed-dose combinations. The evidence for the efficacy of OTC cough medications available in Brazil is poor due to the lack of quality studies. Pharmacovigilance of OTC cough medications should be encouraged...|$|E
40|$|Chronic cough {{is common}} in the population, and among some there is no evident medical {{explanation}} for the symptoms. Such a refractory or idiopathic cough is now often regarded as a neuropathic disease due to dysfunctional airway ion channels, though the knowledge in this field is still limited. Persistent coughing and a cough reflex easily triggered by irritating stimuli, often in combination with perceived dyspnea, are characteristics of this disease. The patients have impaired {{quality of life and}} often reduced work capacity, followed by social and economic consequences. Despite the large number of individuals suffering from such a persisting cough, there is an unmet clinical need for effective cough medicines. The cough treatment available today often has little or no effect. Adverse effects mostly follow centrally acting <b>cough</b> <b>drugs</b> comprised of morphine and codeine, which demands the physician’s awareness. The possibilities of modulating airway transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels may indicate new ways to treat the persistent cough “without a reason”. The TRP ion channel vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) and the TRP melastin 8 (TRPM 8) appear as two candidates in the search for cough therapy, both as single targets and in reciprocal interaction...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Chronic cough, cough {{persisting}} {{more than}} 3 to 8 weeks, causes reduction in {{quality of life}} in many patients. Quality of life can be measured with the validated questionnaire developed specifically for cough, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the three leading causes of chronic cough in non-smoking patients who have a normal chest X-ray and are not using ACE-inhibitors. Treating GERD with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce the chronic cough is debatable. The aim of our study is to determine the effectivity of treatment of GERD as cause of chronic cough. Method: The study was performed retrospectively in patients between 2004 and 2011 who, because of chronic cough, visited the cough clinic of the Isala clinics in Zwolle. All patients enrolled underwent a 24 -hour pH measurement in the esophagus, a very reliable way to demonstrate GERD. Data on age, gender, duration of <b>cough,</b> <b>drugs</b> used, LCQ scores, values of the 24 -hour pH measurement, brochohyperreactivity-tests and diagnosis were analyzed. Mean LCQ scores were measured twice, at first visit and after six months. Differences in LCQ scores were analyzed using the paired t-test. These differences were compared with the previously determined Mean Important Difference (MID) for the LCQ. Results: Of 1613 patients who visited the cough clinic, 12. 6 % were affected by GERD. There were 339 patients enrolled. A total of 111 patients had a positive 24 -hour pH test, were using PPIs and completed both LCQ’s. After six months these patients scored on average 2. 24 point higher on total LCQ score. Patients with idiopathic chronic cough averagely showed least progress in total LCQ score, patients with a combination of GERD and bronchial hyperreactivity causing their chronic cough showed most progress on average total LCQ score. Conclusion: Of the patients with chronic cough 12. 6 % suffer from GERD. One third of these patients have more than one cause of chronic cough. Patients treated with PPI’s who had GERD as cause of chronic cough showed significant improvement in quality of life. The average improvement in total LCQ score of 2. 2, however, remains under the MID of 2. 8. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dextromethorphan is an opioid {{derivate}} antitusive {{drug that}} can be found in common cold and <b>cough</b> <b>drug,</b> because of that dextromethorphan {{has the potential to be}} used for drug abuse. In dextromethorphan drug abuse case, primary excretion is from kidney, so it can damage the kidney especially the proximal tubule. This experiment’s objective is to observe the effect of per oral gradual dose dextromethorphan to the histopatology image of Wistar rat’s kidney. Method: This experimental study with The Post Test Only Control Group Design used 24 Wistar rats with age of 3 - 4 months and weight about 150 gram that divided into 4 groups. K group don’t receive any dextromethorphan and act as the control group; P 1 group is given 0, 175 mg/gBB dextromethorphan; P 2 Group is given 0, 35 mg/gBB dextromethorphan; P 3 group is given 0, 7 mg/gBB dextromethorphan. After that the kidney from the dead Wistar rat was taken and the kidney from Wistar rats that survived in 7 days was also taken after the decapitation. After that the kidney was made into slides with HE stain, then the image of proximal tubule of the kidney was examined with microscope. Result: Per oral gradual dose of dextromethorphan caused degeneration in proximal tubule of kidney. One Way ANOVA test showed that there was a significant difference (p= 0, 000). Post Hoc test showed that there was a significant difference in total proximal tubule damage between K-P 1 (p= 0, 000), K-P 2 (p= 0, 000), K-P 3 (p= 0, 000), P 1 -P 2 (p= 0, 004), P 1 -P 3 (p= 0, 000), P 2 -P 3 (p= 0, 000). Conclusion: There is a significant difference in proximal tubule histopatology image of Wistar rat’s kidney between the group that is given the gradual dose dextromethorphan with the control group, and also there is a significant difference between each group.

40|$|Previously {{considered}} {{a disease of}} childhood, pertus-sis is now also recognized as a significant problem for adolescents and adults; however, diagnosing pertus-sis remains problematic due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and the time delay, sensitivity/specific-ity, and expense of testing. To be effective, therapy is best started {{very early in the}} illness, when the ill-ness is seldom recognized. Other than chemoprophy-laxis in families with a non-immune infant, antibiotic therapy is controversial due to the ubiquitous nature of pertussis, its similarity to other respiratory infec-tions, increased prevalence, prolonged outbreaks, and difficulties in determining true exposures in the gen-eral community. If antimicrobial therapy is used ex-tensively for whooping <b>cough</b> prevention, <b>drug</b> reac-tions and increased bacterial resistance are expected.

40|$|In {{view of the}} anchylostomocidal effect against {{hookworm}} larvae {{as reported}} in the Part I of the present studies, chloroquine diphosphate, Stibnal and Mapharsen were used to treat the lung symptoms of Wakana disease, and the results obtained are as follows. 1. Chloroquine diphosphate administered intravenously proved to be effective in all the cases treated. There were no side effects and its prolonged administration was possible. Chloroquine diphosphate was far superior to the other two agents. 2. Chloroquine diphosphate was less effective when administered orally than administered intravenously, although the former method of administration was more convenient and feasible. 3. Although the effect of Stibnal was somewhat inferior to that of chloroquine diphosphate and its intravenous injection was sometimes followed by a transient increase of <b>cough,</b> the <b>drug</b> was nevertheless worthy of use. 4.

The aim of this study was to investigate new modalities for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Methods:This study was a mini-review research to investigate drugs that are used for DN treatment. Results: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptors blocker (ARB) are the bases of DN treatment during recent decades. Due to some of adverse reactions of these drugs like hyperkalemia and chronic <b>cough,</b> other <b>drugs</b> such as non dihydropridin Ca channel blockers, uric acid lowering drugs, renin antagonists, lipid lowering agents, oral hypoglycemic agents such as Thiazolidinediones, Vitamin D and selective endothelin receptor antagonists have been used in some studies for decreasing proteinuria and slowing progression of DN. The results of these studies are different and controversial in some cases. Conclusion: The cornerstone of diabetic nephropathy is prescription of angiotensin receptor antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or combination of two classes of drugs. For increasing the antiproteinuric effect of treatment or occurring the adverse effects of these drugs, (especially hyperkalemia), other agents such as Ca channel blockers, direct renin inhibitors, thioglithazons, uric acid lowering drugs or vitamin D may be added or replaced...|$|R
40|$|Several {{antidepressants}} {{have been}} used to treat severe pain in clinics. Recently, we reported that the centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive (<b>cough</b> suppressant <b>drug),</b> tipepidine produces an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test, although the mechanism of action appears to be quite different from that of known antidepressants. In the present study, we investigated whether a combination of tipepidine and carbamazepine acts synergistically to induce an antinociceptive effect in the acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice. Prior to studying the combination of tipepidine and carbamazepine, the analgesic action of tipepidine alone was also examined in mice. Tipepidine at 5 – 40 mg/kg i. p. significantly reduced the number of writhes induced by acetic acid in mice. Carbamazepine at 20 mg/kg i. p. also significantly reduced the writhing reaction. Furthermore, co-administration of carbamazepine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i. p.) and tipepidine (2. 5 mg/kg i. p.) significantly decreased the number of writhes induced by acetic acid. This finding suggests that a combination of carbamazepine and tipepidine may be a new strategy for the treatment of neuropathic pain such as what occurs in trigeminal neuralgia, because the use of carbamazepine is often limited by its adverse effects and by reduction of its analgesic efficacy by microsomal enzyme induction...|$|R

In this study, we evaluated the preventive effect of a graded escalation of the remifentanil concentration using a target controlled infusion pump and we compared this with the effect of lidocaine. Methods: One hundred fifty ASA I and II patients who were scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into 3 groups. The patients were pretreated with 2 % lidocaine 1 mg/kg (Group L) or saline (Group S) and remifentanil infusion (an effect site concentration of 4. 0 ng/ml) was followed 1 minute later by using a target controlled infusion pump. Group R was pretreated with saline and this was followed by remifentanil infusion (effect site concentration of 2. 0 ng/ml at first and then it was reset to 4. 0 ng/ml). We evaluated the incidence, severity and onset time of cough after remifentanil infusion. Results: The incidence of coughing was significantly decreased in Group R (6 cases, 12 %) and Group L (7 cases, 14 %), as compared to that of Group S (17 cases, 34 %) (P < 0. 05), but {{there was no significant difference}} between Group R and Group L.

AbstractFlu or common-cold is an acute {{upper respiratory tract}} infection mainly caused by virus, and a {{self-limiting disease}} which is requires only symptomatic treatments to alleviate the symptoms. Common-cold medication is usually an OTC drug and a fixed-dose combination of various active ingredients. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review the active ingredients in cold medicines and how to select the medicines rationally. This review is conducted cross-sectional with data sources derived from 56 references in the form of books, guidelines, on-line journals/articles or printed publications, using the keywords: common cold, <b>cough,</b> over-the-counter (OTC) <b>drugs,</b> non-prescription, self-medication, analgesics,sympathomimetics, antihistamines, decongestants, antibiotics, immunomodulators, food supplements, flu, and batukpilek. It is obtained about 191 fixed-dose combination of tablet and syrup which is indicated for reducing the symptoms of common-cold. The main active ingredients of the fixed-dose combination are antihistamines and decongestants. An additional component is an analgesic, antitussive, expectorant and stimulant. The doses strength of each component isin accordance with the recommended dose, but noted there is still a dose preparation with decongestants (phenylpropanolamine) higher than recommended. No single cold preparations were able to overcome all the symptoms of flu at once, so the flu combination product becomes the primary of choice.

40|$|Whilst cough is a {{defensive}} reflex, in respiratory {{diseases such as}} asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) the cough reflex may become exaggerated and unproductive, leading to presentation of chronic cough as a troublesome symptom. Chronic cough is the most common reason that patients seek ambulatory care in the UK, and cough medications are one of the largest segments of the global over-the-counter drugs market, yet there are no cough medications (prescription or OTC) available that are both efficacious AND safe, indicating a large unmet clinical need. β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonists, methylxanthines (theophylline) and fatty acid amide hydrogenase inhibitors (FAAHi) are peripherally acting drugs with a proven safety profile in humans for other uses, but are not currently recognised as anti-tussive medications. This thesis aimed to examine whether these drugs possess anti-tussive activity, and if so, the mechanisms by which they inhibit <b>cough.</b> These <b>drugs</b> were all effective at blocking the in vivo cough response to tussive stimuli in naïve guinea pigs, and in addition β-AR agonists and theophylline inhibited tussive stimulus evoked cough in guinea pigs previously exposed to cigarette-smoke, which display a clinically relevant enhanced cough phenotype. In vitro and in vivo assays of guinea pig vagus nerve/neuron activation were used to show that these compounds inhibit depolarisation of airway-innervating peripheral sensory nerves. Pharmacological and genetic tools were used to investigate the receptors and signalling pathways activated by these drugs. Whilst β-AR agonists, theophylline and FAAHi had different mechanisms of action, a common component was that all three classes of compound act on various potassium channels, thereby reducing the excitability of sensory neurons. This work suggests that drugs that inhibit peripheral sensory nerve activity have the potential to be efficacious as anti-tussives. Specifically the compounds tested have improved clinical side-effect profiles over currently used anti-tussives, and therefore have potential as therapies for chronic cough. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study {{describes}} the development, validation {{and application of}} a simple and reliable HPLC-DAD procedure for the stability-indicating determination of the <b>cough</b> suppressant <b>drug</b> pentoxyverine citrate (PTV). The method involved the use of Waters Symmetry C 8 (3. 9 × 150 mm, 5 μm) column with gradient elution of the mobile phase composed of 0. 025 M phosphoric acid and acetonitrile. The gradient elution started with 10 % (by volume) acetonitrile, ramped up linearly to 60 % in 10 min then it was kept constant {{till the end of}} the run. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The multiple wavelength detector was set at 210 nm, and quantification of the analyte was based on measuring its peak area. Retention time for PTV was about 7. 03 min. Reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC method was validated with respect to linearity, range, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection and quantification limits. Calibration curve of PTV was linear in the range 10 – 150 μg/mL with correlation coefficient > 0. 9998. The drug was subjected to forced-degradation conditions of hydrolysis, oxidation and dry heat. The proposed method proved to be specific and stability-indicating by resolution of the drug from its forced-degradation products. The validated HPLC method was applied to the analysis of PTV in syrup form where it was successfully resolved from the pharmaceutical additives and quantified with recoveries not less than 97. 7 %. Moreover, the proposed method was utilized to investigate the kinetics of acidic and basic hydrolysis of PTV, and to derive its pH-rate of degradation profile in Britton–Robinson buffer within the pH range 2 – 12. Finally, the proposed method made use of DAD as a tool for peak identity and purity confirmation...|$|R

Introduction: There is {{a burgeoning}} epidemic of antibiotic resistance in low-income countries, and pharmaceutical use {{is on the}} rise even in rural areas. It is important to understand how caregivers and drug sellers use pharmaceutical medicines in treating the common cold and cough in under-five children. Methods: The researchers interviewed caregivers and drug sellers, observed drug sellers’ practices, and conducted social mapping with caregivers in Bagnibari, a village transitioning to a peri-urban area in Savar, Bangladesh. Results: Researchers found that caregivers use pharmaceutical medicines extensively in treating the common cold and <b>cough</b> and that <b>drug</b> sellers recommend the use of pharmaceutical medicines. However extensive antibiotic use was not found. Drug sellers gave instructions {{on the use of the}} pharmaceutical medicines that caregivers followed, and caregivers considered drug sellers their main source of information. Drug sellers said they had completed a governmental training course.

40|$|International audienceThere {{has been}} {{significant}} progress {{in the field of}} cough in the past 10 years. Obstructive sleep apnoea, tonsillar enlargement and environmental fungi have recently been described as causes of chronic cough. The advances in the assessment of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) have led to a greater understanding of the relationship between cough and GOR and are likely to change the approach to managing patients with GOR-cough. The investigation of the phenotype of patients with idiopathic chronic cough has provided novel insights. Patients with an idiopathic chronic are predominantly female, have an onset of cough around the menopause and have a high prevalence of organ specific autoimmune disease, particularly hypothyroidism. The presence of bronchoalveolar lymphocytosis suggests there is homing of inflammatory cells from primary sites of autoimmune inflammation to the lungs. The importance of heightened cough reflex sensitivity has led to some investigators to suggest that chronic cough be recognised as unique entity called Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome (CHS). A number of subjective and objective tools have been developed recently to assess <b>cough</b> severity.

40|$|Misuse of {{pharmaceuticals}} is {{of increasing}} drug policy {{and public health}} concern. A scoping review {{was conducted on the}} diversionary use of pharmaceuticals for non-medicinal use and home production of drug solutions. The research question was broad: What is known from the existing literature about the diversion of pharmaceuticals for non-medicinal use and for home production of drug solutions? The scoping process centred on the systematic selection, collection, and summarization of extant knowledge within this broad thematic remit. One hundred and thirty-four records were grouped into discrete thematic categories namely: non medicinal use and tampering with pharmaceuticals, oral misuse of codeine <b>cough</b> syrups, homemade <b>drug</b> solutions, and home-produced drug-related harms in the narrative review design. Forms of abuse of codeine cough syrup include mixtures with alcohol or soft drinks ('Purple Drank'), with kratom leaves ('Kratom cocktails'), or chemically altered to extract dextromorphan ('Lemon Drop'). Production of homemade opiates ('Cheornaya', 'Kolyosa', Himiya', 'Braun', 'Krokodil'), methamphetamine ('Vint', 'Pervitin'), methcathinone ('Jeff'), and cathinone ('Boltushka') are described. Displacement patterns between the non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, commercial, and homemade drugs appear dependent on availability of opiates, prescribing practices, supervision of substitution drug dosing, availability of cheap ingredients, policing, and awareness of harms. Adverse health and social consequences relate to the use of unknown and contaminated (end) substances, injecting practices, redosing, medical complications, and death.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify risk factors for incautious use of oral non-prescription drugs (ONPD) and inform recommendations that promote cautious ONPD use among HEI students in the UAE. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted with 2875 students in three randomly selected UAE universities between January and April 2014. Results: More than half (1348; 57) of participants reported using of ONPD in the past 90 days before study commencement. Of 1348 participants reported using ONPD, one-quarter (1348; 22. 2) of ONPD was classified as incautious ONPD usage. Analgesic/antipyretic (84. 9), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1028; 76. 3), and <b>cough</b> and cold <b>drugs</b> (562; 41. 7) were reported by the majority of participants as the most commonly used ONPD. 10 risk factors were identified for incautious ONPD use. Participants with age group of 21 years and older (OR= 0. 554, 95; CI= 0. 373 - 0. 823; p< 0. 001), female (OR= 0. 339, 95; CI= 0. 236 - 0. 486; p< 0. 001), and students from medical schools (OR= 0. 619, 95; CI= 0. 435 - 0. 882; p= 0. 008) had lower odds of being incautious users compared to lower age group, males, and students from non-medical schools.

The patient experienced these symptoms five times before in his life, but they had self-resolved with squatting or raising his arms. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, syncope, or pre-syncope symptoms. He denied any recent illnesses, <b>cough,</b> chest pain, <b>drug</b> use, or infections. Significant findings: The initial EKG showed wide complex, irregular tachycardia > 200 bpm (EKG 1). Given the possibility of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW), procainamide {{was given to the}} patient. The patient’s heart rate responded and decreased to 120 - 140 bpm with narrowing of the QRS complex. A repeat EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia without P waves approximately 120 bpm (EKG 2). Once the procainamide infusion was complete, the patient had converted to sinus rhythm with a delta wave now apparent, consistent with WPW (EKG 3). Discussion: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a combination of the presence of a certain congenital accessory pathway (Bundle of Kent) and episodes of tachyarrhythmia. 1 The incidence is {{less than one percent of}} the general population, 2 but it is associated with the risk of sudden cardiac death, making the diagnosis imperative. When examining a wide-based tachycardia, it is important to consider WPW when choosing medications for rate control or chemical cardioversion. The first EKG shows an example of atrial fibrillation with WPW. While procainamide blocks the accessory pathway, other drugs such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers can inhibit the AV node resulting in increased use of the accessory pathway. This can worsen the tachyarrhythmia and potentially lead to ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or asystole...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays Angiotensin- {{converting}} {{enzyme inhibitor}} drugs {{are the leading}} drugs {{for the treatment of}} hypertension, heart failure and some of nephropathy. But One of the most frequent side effect of these <b>drugs</b> is <b>cough.</b> A dry, tickly and often bothersome cough that may develop in around 15 to 39 percent of these patients and may lead to discontinuation of treatment. So we decided to use herbal drug of althaea officinalis for the treatment of this cough. For this study in the year 1385 and by using of method of double-blind clinical trial 60 patients with hypertension who were from the province of Chaharmal va bakhtiarei and had been developed cough during taking of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor drugs were selected. Then for all of them were filled a paper of questionnaire. In these papers the scores of severity of their cough on a scale between 0 to 4 and the advantages of their spirometery tests were noted. Then all of these patients were divided in 2 groups. The first group was treated by herbal drug of althaea officinalis and the second group by placebo by 20 drops for every 8 hour (TDS). These patients used these drugs for treatment period of 4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks the scores of severity of their cough with the advantages of their spirometery tests were noted again.

However, tolerability must be considered when selecting treatments. This analysis compared the tolerability of telmisartan and ACE inhibitors using data pooled from 12 comparative, randomized studies involving 2564 telmisartan-treated patients and 2144 receiving ACE inhibitors (enalapril, lisinopril, or ramipril). Incidence rates of adverse events for the combined ACE inhibitor treatments and for telmisartan were similar (42. 8 % vs 43. 9 %, respectively) as were the rates of serious adverse events (1. 8 % vs 1. 7 % for telmisartan, respectively). Patients receiving ACE inhibitors had more cough (8. 6 % vs 2. 6 % with telmisartan, P &lt; 0. 0001). Results were similar irrespective of age, gender, or ethnicity. The adverse event of angioedema was observed in four patients (0. 2 %) receiving ACE inhibitors versus none with telmisartan (P = 0. 043). There were small, numerical differences in serious adverse events. A total of 107 patients (5. 0 %) receiving ACE inhibitors and 93 patients (3. 6 %) receiving telmisartan discontinued treatment because of adverse events (P = 0. 021); of these, 32. 7 % and 5. 4 %, respectively, were discontinuations due to cough (relative risk reduction of 88 % [P &lt; 0. 0001] with telmisartan). Telmisartan and ACE inhibitors produced comparable blood pressure reductions at marketed doses. Telmisartan and ACE inhibitors are suitable {{for the prevention of}} cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, but telmisartan is better tolerated, particularly with regard to <b>cough.</b> Keywords: adverse <b>drug</b> event, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, cough, hypertensio...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis work {{involves}} a descriptive {{assessment of the}} survey concerning drug consumption among third-year primary school pupils in the Aachen district. A parents’ survey concerning drug consumption by these children was already conducted three years ago on enrolment in school. The current inquiry is now directed towards the same basic population {{in order to be}} able to detect any possible shifts in drug consumption and discover reasons for these changes. In order to establish comparability of the studies, the questionnaire from the first study was used and was merely supplemented with a number of aspects. During the past 12 months, 94. 6 % of the children surveyed received a drug on at least one occasion. The drug group most frequently administered involved <b>drugs</b> against <b>coughs</b> and colds (84. 5 %), followed by antipyretics (71. 3 %), analgesics (52. 9 %) and antibiotics (51. 5 %). In the case of analgesics and antipyretics, inquiries were also made about the active substance used. The survey showed that paracetamol is the one most frequently employed. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) however is still used as an analgesic in 3. 5 % of cases and as an antipyretic in 1. 6 % of cases. Also of particular interest was inquiry about drugs against hyperactivity. Between the moment of enrolment in school and the present time, consumption of these drugs increased from 0. 3 % to 3. 0 %. In a comparison throughout Federal Germany however, which assumes a prevalence of 6 % among 6 to 10 -year-olds, this value is therefore within a rather low range for this age group. For the drug prescriptions, the focal point was the percentage of self-medication. This percentage was at its highest with 46. 6 % for vitamin and mineral preparations, followed by analgesics (23. 3 %), <b>cough</b> and cold <b>drugs</b> (22. 6 %) and antipyretic substances (19. 2 %). In differentiating the consumption behaviour as a function of social status, it was not possible to detect any significant difference in frequency of administration. However, there were major differences between the strata for the self-medication rate. Differentiation was also made according to the parents’ country of birth. In this case, significant differences in self-medication and consumption behaviour were observed as a function of migration background. Based on these results, a prevention programme should be applied that places emphasis on information about the analgesics and their undesirable effects, particularly the risks of Reye’s syndrome, in addition to sensible use of vitamin and mineral preparations. A moderate approach to drugs should also be made more accessible to parents. Schools, kindergartens, physicians’ practices and pharmacies should be included as the background for this prevention programme. Children are approachable above all at school and in the day-care facilities, whereas the information materials in physicians’ practices and pharmacies and topic-related parents’ evenings in the schools and kindergartens mainly serve to educate parents. The main aim in the prevention work should be to encourage parents’ competence with regard to drug consumption and create awareness among them that drug consumption is not always the means of choice. The local health authority of the district of Aachen, which is able to ensure implementation of the project throughout the whole district, is suitable in this case as a supraordinate body in coordinating the prevention programme...|$|R
