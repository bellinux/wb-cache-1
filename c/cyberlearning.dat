Full Abstract: This project provides a model for collaborative research across STEM and non-STEM disciplines that capitalizes on the theories, pedagogical approaches, and measurement tools that each offer. Our {{research team}} is designing, implementing, and evaluating the effectiveness of intercultural leadership learning interventions that utilize virtual reality technologies. While virtual reality has been frequently used to train individuals in scientific and technical skills such as military readiness, aviation maintenance, and surgery, the potential of this <b>cyberlearning</b> technology to facilitate the development of less technical but still critical skills such as leadership and cultural awareness has not been explored.

40|$|<b>Cyberlearning</b> {{presents}} numerous challenges such as {{the lack}} of personal and assessment-driven learning, how students are often puzzled {{by the lack of}} instructor guidance and feedback, the huge volume of diverse learning materials, and the inability to zoom in from the general concepts to the more specific ones, or vice versa. Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the <b>Cyberlearning</b> quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one 2 ̆ 2 first-class 2 ̆ 2 relation, 2 ̆ 2 is-a 2 ̆ 2, between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example 2 ̆ 2 part-of 2 ̆ 2 and time dependency are important relations to represent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL is limited to object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University’s extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protégé IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructors teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. The prototype of a knowledge-driven tutoring system was designed and implemented to illustrate how the KG supports integrated assessments; using assessment results to custom student learning order or material; and let the students freely navigate in the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, and following various custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this approach. ...|$|E

Beyond the obvious applications, including general online conversations and gaming, we hypothesize that our proposed system would be particularly beneficial to education by offering rich visual contents and interactivity. One distinct feature is the integration of egocentric pose recognition that allows participants to use their gestures to demonstrate and manipulate virtual objects simultaneously. This functionality enables the instructor to ef- fectively and efficiently explain and illustrate complex concepts or sophisticated problems in an intuitive manner.

40|$|Counter {{positioning}} virtual {{learning environments}} with traditional {{face to face}} learning {{has given rise to}} comparisons in which cyberspace education is represented as inauthentic, as a relatively impoverished experience. Recent commentaries (for example Dreyfus, 2001) suggest that an explanatory factor in this perceived lack of intensity is the absence of risk, as experienced by both students and teachers. In this analysis, risk carries an affective intensity integral to embodiment, physical presence and the visibility of teacher and students. This intensity is seen as crucial to learner commitment, and other social and ethical engagement. The diminished possibility of such encounters online renders what one does in cyberspace as having no ‘real ’ consequences. This paper critically examines such claims {{and the extent to which}} online environments are seen to minimise risk through mechanisms of control. The paper problematises such notions and examines the possibility that learning in cyberspace, rather than being comparatively risk free, contains risks and disquietudes that are qualitatively different. Similarly it cautions against what is termed here the ‘incorporeal fallacy ’ of assuming that <b>cyberlearning</b> is, indeed, disembodied. Rather it argues the need to reconsider how notions of risk, the subjectivity of the learner and ideas of embodiment might all be differently constituted online...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We examine expert human mathematics-tutor {{gestures}} in {{the context}} of an interactive design for proportionality in order to design a virtual pedagogical agent. Early results implicate distinct gesture morphologies serving consistent contextual functionalities in guiding learners towards quantitative descriptions of proportional relations. Towards a Virtual Pedagogical Agent Capable of Instructional Math Gesture Mathematics teachers spontaneously employ gesture as spatio-dynamic complements to verbal and symbolic utterance (Alibali et al., 2014), and a growing body of work emphasizes such multimodality as an essential dimension of instructional practice (e. g., Arzarello et al., 2009). However, to date, virtual pedagogical agents (VPAs) embedded in teacher-independent mathematics tutorials lack instructional gesturing capacity. Our NSF-funded <b>CyberLearning</b> EXP design-research project seeks to integrate an animated, gesturing VPA with The Mathematical Imagery Trainer for Proportion (MIT-P), an embodied-learning device (Abrahamson et al., 2012). The MIT-P was designed to provide an interactive context for students to ground proportionality in sensorimotor schemes. Students first discover an operatory scheme for achieving a non-symbolical goal state of a technological device—in Figure 1 this state is “green”—and then signify their strategy mathematically. The human tutor guides learners through the discovery of green-making hand movements and then facilitates a sequence of shifts in their green-making strategies toward a mathematical register. Each of these shifts is onset, formed, and enabled by a new symbolic artifact the tutor introduces onto the screen (cursors, a grid, numerals) ...|$|E
40|$|Concept {{maps are}} {{effective}} interventions in providing {{students with a}} holistic understanding of a domain while also allowing understanding of relationships among parts and across the engineering curricula. Yet when the domain of application is large, concept maps become overburdened with too much information and complexity. A function of the individual learners’ cognitive load abilities, this phenomenon (termed “map shock”) results in student disengagement and reduction of expected learning gains. This limitation prevents the creation of concept maps that provide a unified framework for engineering knowledge across courses and curricula. To address these limitations, the authors apply theoretical research on adaptive expertise, concept maps, and information visualization to design, develop and assess a <b>cyberlearning</b> tool that advances personalized learning and helps students develop deep and broad conceptual knowledge. The proposed visualization tool, the “adaptive concept map, ” overcomes the problem of map shock by providing the user control over the quantity and level of detail of information displayed, thus providing a means for navigating content {{in a manner that}} is adaptable to their personal cognitive load needs.

There is scarce research that defines which quality indicators are used to assess <b>cyberlearning</b> environments, how different stakeholders view the relative importance of these quality indicators in online graduate degree programs from fields like science and engineering that have a historical preference for formal program accreditation, and what practices are used in evaluating completely online graduate degree programs {{in higher education}}. This mixed methods study examined current practices in three established online degree programs in agriculture and engineering at the University of Illinois, identifying quality indicators and evaluation practices used with <b>cyberlearning</b> environments in these fields and comparing myriad stakeholder views regarding the value of these practices. Data collection in this study used a mixed-methods approach, including a combination of surveys (n = 107) and interviews (n = 27) with program administrators, faculty, and students, as well as a document review from the different programs. While most of the evaluation occurring in the programs is informal, analysis of the surveys, interviews, and documents collected from the programs revealed four key themes related to current evaluation practice including the use of: (a) informal feedback from the students and faculty, (b) student satisfaction surveys (i. e., ICES student feedback and department-specific and created satisfaction surveys), (c) student grades and performance information, and (d) the Committee on Extended Education and External Degrees (CEEED) process. There were a several challenges reported in using these strategies to evaluate quality, including lacking structured collection and reporting mechanisms, differing implementation levels in traditional and online courses, varying availability of data and student quality, lacking fidelity of information delivery and access, and changing survey forms. Also evident from study was that the implementation of these evaluation practices is occurring at varying levels which were categorized on a four-stage continuum of evaluation. The programs in this study are at or beginning {{to move out of the}} first evaluation stage of preservation, meaning that the administrators have an evaluation system that is focused on efficiency and on collecting student satisfaction ratings. In this evaluation stage, small improvements are made periodically in hopes of getting more efficiency out of the current system, but little is done to explore quality beyond student satisfaction. Thus, the evaluation is incomplete as it overlooks important issues like student learning outcomes, the teaching and learning process, faculty support, course structure, and others. A factor analysis was done to explore the dimensionality of the 72 items related to quality evaluation and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) program accreditation, from the 2009 National Research Council Study on the Quality of Traditional Programs, Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) Online Benchmark Study, and ABET Criterion Three Items for STEM programs, which resulted in 12 common quality indicators to determine program quality of STEM online programs. These 12 quality indicators included (a) diversity of students and faculty, (b) professional and scholarly productivity of faculty, (c) presence, accessibility, and articulation of evaluation activities, learning outcomes, and support information, (d) student knowledge of current practice, ethics, impact, and professional conduct in STEM, (e) student production of STEM capstone research projects, (f) customer service provided by the program, (g) student training in conducting scholarly research and access to university resources, (h) interaction between students with each other and the faculty, (i) comparable achievement profiles between entering online and traditional students, (j) faculty preparation to transition from traditional to online environments, (k) student persistence to degree completion, and (l) student success beyond graduation. Differences between stakeholders revealed that online students placed a statistically significant higher emphasis than faculty on the presence, accessibility, and articulation of evaluation activities, learning outcomes, and support information. Interviews revealed that the online students considered themselves to be “consumers” of the degree program, thereby increasing the need for identification of clearly defined “outcomes” or “competencies” that online students should be able to produce or demonstrate as a result of participation in the courses and degree program overall. The study concludes with implications on how online programs and evaluators can use the quality indicators to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current evaluation system and to define and develop their own evaluation procedures for richer understanding within and between institutions and departments...|$|E
40|$|Inspired by the {{recommendations}} of the NSF report “Fostering Learning in the Networked World: The <b>Cyberlearning</b> Opportunity and Challenge” (NSF 08204), the NSF National STEM Digital Learning program funded “Planning for the Future of Geocybereducation” Workshop sought to bring together leaders from the geoscience education community, from major geoscience research initiatives, and from the growing public- and private-sector geoscience information community. The objectives of the workshop were to begin conversations aimed at identifying best practices and tools for geoscience cyber-education, in the context of both the changing nature of learners and of rapidly evolving geo-information platforms, and to provide guidance to the NSF as to necessary future directions and needs for funding. 65 participants met and interacted live for the two-day workshop, with ongoing post-meeting virtual interactions via a collaborative workspace (www. geocybered. ning. com). Topics addressed included the rapidly changing character of learners, the growing capabilities of geoscience information systems and their affiliated tools, and effective models for collaboration among educators, researchers and geoinformation specialists. Discussions at the meeting focused on the implications of changing learners on the educational process, the challenges for teachers and administrators in keeping pace, and on the challenges of communication among these divergent professional communities. Ongoing virtual discussions and collaborations have produced a draft workshop document, and the workshop conveners are maintaining the workshop site as a venue for ongoing discussion and interaction. Several key challenges were evident from the workshop discussions and subsequent interactions: a) the development of most of the large geoinformatics and geoscience research efforts were not pursued with education as a significant objective, resulting in limited financial support for such activities after the fact; b) the “playing field” of cybertechnologies relevant to geoscience education, research and informatics changes so rapidly that even committed “players” find that staying current is challenging; c) the scholarly languages of geoscience education, geoscience research, and geoinformatics are different, making easy communication about respective needs and constraints surprisingly difficult; and d) the impact of “everyday” cybertechnologies on learner audiences is profound and (so far) not well addressed by educators. Discussions on these issues are ongoing {{in a number of other}} venues...|$|E
