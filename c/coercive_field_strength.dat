The carrier concentration in LSMO may be different for red and blue lights, which results in different angle rotation for LSMO spins.

Compressive stresses are wanted inthe surface material since they prevent crack growth and wear of the material andthis work is part of the development of better and longer lasting inserts. Different ways of measuring residual stress with 2 -dimensional x-ray diffraction areinvestigated. Also different surface treatment methods, used for attaining thesecompressive stresses, are tested and evaluated by measuring surface residual stress. Also hardness and residual stress in-depth profiles are measured by cutting treatedinserts in half and perform measurement on cross sections. The results show that measurements can be conducted on the raw sample surfacewith a 0. 5 mm x-ray spot size. The effectiveness of surface treatments varies withdifferent cemented carbide grades. Blasting gives rise to the highest compressivestresses in a harder cemented carbide grade while it produces a lot of crushedtungsten carbide grains and similar stresses as tumbling in a softer grade. Treatment Tgives interesting result since it produces high compressive stress but still leaves thesurface grains unbroken. Attempts to measure both hardness and residual stressgradients from the surface are found to be difficult.

The samples were 40 mm x 5 mm x 1. 5 mm in dimension, poled in the 5 mm-direction with a through-thickness notch {{in the middle of}} the 5 mm side. A cyclic electric field of variable maximum field strength was applied in the 5 mm-direction. Crack propagation was observed in-situ by an optical microscope and recorded simultaneously on video. A crack is found to initiate in the first half cycle antiparallel to the poling direction once the electric field strength exceeds the <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> of the material. In the subsequent cycles the crack propagates perpendicular to the electric field during each half cycle. The electric polarization was also measured so that a dielectric hysteresis could be observed during crack propagation. It was found that the crack does not propagate significantly before global domain switching takes place and stops growing after global domain switching has finished. During the first 10 - 20 cycles the crack propagates in a “steady-state ” with a constant growth rate da/dN. The growth rate depends on the electric field strength. Further cycling leads to a slowing down of the crack with eventual arrest.

Powders with varying compositions were produced by the mixed oxide process. A range of specimen grain sizes was produced by varying the temperature and hold time during pressure-less sintering. Lanthanum affects the grain growth and diffusion rate, changing the grain size, density and reducing the axial ratio. Strain and polarisation hysteresis, d 33, and permittivity with temperature were all measured. Lanthanum increases the d 33 value and reduces the Curie temperature and <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> <b>strength.</b> However, {{the results show that}} grain size and axial ratio also alter these properties. The lattice response was determined using neutron diffraction. Specific planes' lattice spacings, in different spatial directions, were measured by re-orientating the specimens relative to the neutron beam. The spacing of these planes was found to vary with applied field, {{as a result of the}} converse-piezoelectric effect, and clastic misfit strains resulting from domain reorientation in surrounding grains. Lattice strain in the nonpolar direction larger than that in the polar direction was observed, along with a small tensile lattice strain in the polar direction after poling. The large strain in the non-polar direction is attributed to elastic misfit strains, but an additional voltageinduced strain was found in that direction, potentially a result of the elastic misfit strain distorting the lattice and allowing the polarisation to align with the field. The tensile poling strain result is explained by a change in the crystal structure, or by considering elastic misfit strains between neighbouring domains. This study has discussed the factors affecting the macroscopic piezoelectric properties, and contributed to the understanding of the underlying lattice response.

The numerical integration of the Gilbert equation of motion provides the time evolution of the magnetization and thus shows how reversed domain nucleate and expand. The numerical results of static micromagnetic calculations reveal the influence of the intrinsic magnetic properties on the remanence and the <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> of three different types of permanent magnets: (1) In nucleation controlled Nd-Fe-B magnets, the magnetic properties of inter-granular regions control the <b>coercive</b> <b>field.</b> The <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> decreases with increasing alignment if the grain boundary region with reduced magnetocrystalline anisotropy exceeds 10 nm. (2) In isotropically oriented grains of nanocrystalline magnets, exchange interactions between neighboring soft and hard grains lead to remanence enhancement. An increase of the hard phase anisotropy of only 8 % increases the <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> of two phase Nd 2 Fe 14 B/α-Fe magnets significantly. In two phase Nd 2 Fe 14 B/ Fe 3 B, the reduction of the soft phase magnetization and/or the soft phase exchange constant leads to an improvement of the <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> without a significant loss in remanence. (3) For pin-ning controlled Sm-Co magnets for high temperature applica-tions a the finite element model was built according to the cellular microstructure. The simulation reveals the upper limits for the <b>coercive</b> <b>field.</b> Index Terms—Finite element method, Permanent magnets, Numerical micromagnetics, Nd-Fe-B, Sm-Co magnets I...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} finite {{temperature}} micromagnetic method (FTM) {{that allows for}} the calculation of the <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> of arbitrary shaped magnetic nanostructures at time scales of nanoseconds to years. Instead of directly solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, the <b>coercive</b> <b>field</b> is obtained without any free parameter by solving a non linear equation, which arises from the transition state theory. The method is applicable to magnetic structures where coercivity is determined by one thermally activated reversal or nucleation process. The method shows excellent agreement with experimentally obtained <b>coercive</b> <b>fields</b> of magnetic nanostructures and provides {{a deeper understanding of}} the mechanism of coercivity.
