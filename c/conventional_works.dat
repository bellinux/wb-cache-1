Nervous trepidation looks like guilt. Guilt, firmly sustained by insensibility, looks like innocence. One of the vilest wretches ever placed under my charge won the sympathies (while he was waiting for his trial) of every person who saw him, including even the persons employed in the prison. Only the other day, ladies and gentlemen coming to visit me passed a body of men at work on the road. Judges of physiognomy among them were horrified at the criminal atrocity betrayed in every face that they noticed. They condoled with me on the near neighborhood of so many convicts to my official place of residence.

It was concluded that (a) orthographic projection is learned best using worked examples with several intermediate stages and that (b) a linear relation between angle of rotation and problem difficulty did not hold for orthographic projection material.

At the same time, these works {{did not look like}} <b>conventional</b> <b>works</b> of sculpture, made of wood or metal. The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists. The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life. The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the seven}} novels extant, {{the first four}} to be {{published}} in book form (Wieland, Ormond, Edgar Huntly, and Arthur Mervyn) have received the lion's share of commentary and attention.

Stephen Calvert, which appeared only in serialized form and in the posthumous 1815 biography, remained little-read until the end of the 20th century, but is notable as the first US novel to thematize same-sex sexuality. Clara Howard and Jane Talbot have been regarded sometimes as relatively <b>conventional</b> <b>works</b> distinct from the earlier novels because they have classic epistolary form and concern domestic issues that seem very different from the violence and sensationalism of the first four novels.

50|$|After the Armistice, Vane {{turned to}} writing plays, and {{authored}} two <b>conventional</b> <b>works</b> that caused little stir. Then came Outward Bound, {{which was so}} unusual in its subject matter as a fantasy-drama that no producer would go near it. Instead, Vane produced it himself, renting a theatre in London, painting his own backdrops, building his own sets, and bringing together a company of actors, all for a reported total of $600. Outward Bound is about a small, motley group of eight passengers who meet in the lounge of an ocean liner at sea and realize {{that they have no}} idea why they are there, or where they are bound. Each of them eventually discovers that they are dead, and that they're about to face judgment from an Examiner about whether they are to go to Heaven or Hell. In post-World War I England, with its reflective, pacifist mood - many hundreds of thousands of families were still mourning the loss of loved ones, and the nation collectively mourned the decimation of a generation of students, artists, writers, and musicians - the play struck a responsive chord and was an immediate success. Outward Bound was moved to a large theatre in London and became the biggest hit of the 1923 season.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{upper bound}} {{constraint}} verification in grid workflow systems {{is based on}} the key assumption that an upper bound constraint only has two states: consistency and inconsistency. However, due to complexity of grid workflows and dynamic availability of participating grid services, this assumption is too restrictive as there may be some intermediate states. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce four states for an upper bound constraint. Namely, we treat conventional consistency as strong consistency and divide conventional inconsistency into weak consistency, weak inconsistency and strong inconsistency. Correspondingly, we develop their verification methods. For weak consistency, we present some algorithms on how to adjust it to strong consistency without triggering exception handling as in <b>conventional</b> <b>work.</b> For weak inconsistency, we analyse why it can rely on less costly exception handling than <b>conventional</b> <b>work.</b> The final evaluation demonstrates that our four-state approach can achieve better cost-effectiveness than the conventional two-state approach...|$|R

Therefore, we divide the conventional inconsistency into weak consistency,weak inconsistency and strong inconsistency and treat the conventional consistency as strong consistency. Correspondingly, we discuss how to verify them. Especially, for the weak consistency, we present a method on how to adjust it to the strong consistency. For the weak inconsistency, we analyse why it can be handled by simpler and more economical exception handling.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aims of {{the study}} were to 1) assess the effects of 12 weeks of {{exercise}} training at low work loads (i. e., corresponding to ≤ 50 % of peak oxygen consumption [Vo 2]) on peak Vo 2 and hyperemic calf blood flow in patients with severe congestive heart failure; and 2) evaluate left ventricular diastolic pressure and wall stress during exercise performed at work loads corresponding to ≤ 50 % and 70 % to 80 % of peak Vo 2. Background. Whether the benefits of exercise training can be achieved at work loads that result in lower left ventricular diastolic wall stress than those associated with <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> loads is unknown in patients with severe congestive heart failure. Methods. Sixteen patients with severe congestive heart failure trained at low work loads for 1 h/day, four times a week, for 12 weeks. Peak Vo 2 and calf and forearm reactive hyperemia were measured before and during training. Nine of the 16 patients underwent right heart catheterization and echocardiography during bicycle exercise at low and <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> loads (i. e., 50 % and 70 % to 80 % of peak Vo 2, respectively). Results. The increase in left ventricular diastolic wall stress was substantially lower during exercise at low work loads than during exercise at <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> loads, (i. e., [mean ± SEM] 23. 3 ± 7. 4 vs. 69. 6 ± 8. 1 dynes/cm 2 (p < 0. 001). After 6 and 12 weeks of training, peak Vo 2 increased from 11. 5 ± 0. 4 to 14. 0 ± 0. 5 and 15. 0 ± 0. 5 ml/kg per min, respectively (p < 0. 0001 vs. baseline for both). Peak reactive hyperemia significantly increased in the calf but not in the forearm. The increases in peak Vo 2 and calf peak reactive hyperemia correlated closely (r = 0. 61, p < 0. 02). Conclusions. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, peak Vo 2 is enhanced by exercise training at work loads that result in smaller increases in left ventricular diastolic wall stress than those observed at <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> loads.

40|$|Load {{balancing}} is {{a technique}} which allows efficient parallelization of irregular workloads, and {{a key component of}} many applications and parallelizing runtimes. Work-stealing is a popular technique for implementing load balancing, where each parallel thread maintains its own work set of items and occasionally steals items from the sets of other threads. The <b>conventional</b> semantics of <b>work</b> stealing guarantee that each inserted task is eventually extracted exactly once. However, correctness of a wide class of applications allows for relaxed se-mantics, because either: i) the application already explicitly checks that no work is repeated or ii) the application can tolerate repeated work. In this paper, we introduce idempotent work stealing, and present several new algorithms that exploit the relaxed semantics to deliver better performance. The semantics of the new algorithms guarantee that each inserted task is eventually extracted at least once–instead of exactly once. On mainstream processors, algorithms for <b>conventional</b> <b>work</b> stealing require special atomic instructions or store-load memory ordering fence instructions in the owner’s critical path operations. In general, these instructions are substantially slower than regular memory access instructions. By exploiting the relaxed semantics, our algorithms avoid these instructions in the owner’s operations.
