5|$|Production {{is still}} {{specialized}} in horticultural goods, {{but most of}} the masseiras were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets. Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is <b>commercial</b> <b>wine</b> production, however local masseira wines are not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.|$|E

The concentration of quercitol increased with aging time and depended on the age and characteristics of the barrels, but not on the grape variety used. For the other cyclitols, aging in oak barrels did not appreciably modify the concentration in each batch. In oak chip-treated wines, quercitol was also present and its concentration was influenced by chip size. Quercitol seems to be a potential new indicator of the contact of wine with oak wood.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} was to isolate DNA both {{experimental}} and <b>commercial</b> <b>wines</b> in order to differentiate some Romanian grapevine cultivars (Tămâioasă Românescă, Galbenă de Odobeşti, Fetească Neagră and Busuioacă de Bohotin) by PCR using wine as a sample. Extracted residual grape DNA quality and specificity were verified using co-dominant simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (VVS 2, VVMD 27, VVMD 5 and VVMD 7). The results obtained in this research shows that even 18 months after wine fermentation could be detected residual DNA that can be suitable for DNA fingerprinting. The 12 -month-old experimental wine samples were more amplified than the 18 -month-old ones. Among the microsatellite tested, VVS 2 and VVMD 7 gave satisfactory results. The VVS 2 marker, which generated the shortest PCR amplicons (119 - 138 bp), amplified all of the cultivars analyzed in the wines samples. In case of <b>commercial</b> <b>wines</b> authentication of grape material by PCR using wine as a biological material was unsuccessfully due to insufficient amount of residual DNA in samples analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The La Crescent grape, a {{cross of}} St. Pepin and an unnamed Swenson {{selection}} (Vitis riparia x Muscat Hamburg), is a cold-hardy cultivar gaining popularity throughout the Midwest. Due to its recent introduction, {{there is a}} considerable amount to be learned about the characteristics of wines made from the grape. To investigate the aromas specific to the wine, research lots of wine were produced from La Crescent juice contributed by a commercial Iowa winery over two vintages (years 1 and 2). Juice and wines were analyzed chemically by HPLC and bench-top methods. Descriptive sensory analysis was conducted by a trained sensory panel following each vintage. Samples evaluated were dry and off-dry versions of the research La Crescent <b>wines,</b> a <b>commercial</b> La Crescent <b>wine</b> from the contributing winery, and a <b>commercial</b> Moscato <b>wine,</b> included for comparison. Aroma and flavor attribute intensities were measured separately in year 1 and as a combined response for aroma in year 2. Sweetness and acidity were also evaluated. Six descriptors were identified in year 1, and 7 in year 2. Grapefruit, lychee, pineapple and rose attributes were common to the sensory panels for both vintages. Apricot (year 1) and peach (year 2) were also useful in describing La Crescent wines however, variations in panel make-up or training likely led to their interchangeable in the study. In year 1, grapefruit and pineapple were the most intense aromas in all La Crescent wines. In the Moscato wine, rose and lychee were the most intense aromas. Grapefruit flavors were more intense in research <b>wines</b> than in <b>commercial</b> <b>wines,</b> while apricot flavors were more intense in <b>commercial</b> <b>wines</b> than in research wines. Flavor ratings were affected by sweetness and acidity perceptions. In year 2, all wines were best characterized by rose and lychee. Principal component analysis (PCA) accounted for 59 and 63 percent of the variability in years 1 and 2, respectively. Wines were mainly separated by sweetness and acidity on the first principal component. Grapefruit, pineapple, rose and lychee were the most intense aromas/flavors expressed in dry, off-dry and <b>commercial</b> La Crescent <b>wines</b> and are important descriptors for these wines...|$|R
