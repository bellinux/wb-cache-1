25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{there was}} {{increasing}} tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a {{provision of the}} 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), {{while at the same}} time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business <b>consulting</b> <b>service</b> line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Because data were not readily available to identify how the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> and {{what is known about}} their costs, this report discusses the limitations on data concerning <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> and provides information on some of the uses of consultant contracts. Two primary factors limited GAO's ability to identify a list of consulting contracts that was sufficiently accurate and complete for identifying the types and costs of <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> used by VA. First, there is no consistently used definition for consultant or <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> across VA that GAO could apply for our intended purposes. Second, there are data limitations associated with identifying <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> at VA. Since there is no means for contracting officers to track obligations for <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> in the Federal Procurement Data System-New Generation, GAO used North American Industrial Classification Codes (NAICS) to identify contracts that could be for consulting. However, GAO could not use the NAICS codes to consistently identify consulting contracts because a single NAICS code can be used to classify both <b>consulting</b> and nonconsulting <b>services</b> and VA contracting officers sometimes reported that they had applied the wrong NAICS code to contracts. Nevertheless, VA offices were able to provide information on how they used <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> and identified contracts among those in our sample that they considered to be <b>consulting</b> <b>services.</b> For contracts that VA officials considered to be for consulting, VA procured a variety of services, including program evaluations, engineering and support services, and gathering data to support decision making. ...|$|R
