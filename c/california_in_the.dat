5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In {{some areas of}} dense human population, such as <b>California</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern <b>California</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
