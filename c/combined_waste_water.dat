50|$|Recycling {{rinse water}} from the {{semiconductor}} manufacturing process has been discouraged by many manufacturing engineers for decades {{because of the risk}} that the contamination from the chemical residue and particles may end up back in the UPW feed water and result in product defects. Modern Ultrapure Water systems are very effective at removing ionic contamination down to parts per trillion levels (ppt) whereas organic contamination of ultrapure water systems is still in the parts per billion levels (ppb). In any case recycling the process water rinses for UPW makeup has always been a great concern and until recently this was not a common practice. Increasing water and wastewater costs in parts of the US and Asia have pushed some semiconductor companies to investigate the recycling of manufacturing process rinse water in the UPW makeup system. Some companies have incorporated an approach that uses complex large scale treatment designed for worst case conditions of the <b>combined</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> discharge. More recently new approaches have been developed to incorporate a detailed water management plan to try to minimize the treatment system cost and complexity.|$|E

But apart from this, development will take part in waste collection, where collection on demand {{as well as the}} producer pay principle will become more relevant. Energy production from waste will be a main task for the future in order to substitute fossil fuels. More automatic sorting of marketable compounds from waste will be practiced in the future and the packaging directive may be rethought. More anaerobic treatment of biological degradable waste will be effected where hygienisation and product quality will be the prerequisite for land application. Decentralized <b>combined</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> and biowaste treatment will be more relevant in the future. 1...|$|E

This includes diuron and glyphosate, which are also used in residential areas [13]. The situation is even more complicated if combined sewer systems are sampled. Elaborated strategies are necessary to distinguish between run-off and other sources. Gasperi et al. [14] compared the concentrations in separate and combined sewer systems and concluded that higher concentrations of PAHs and alkylphenol ethoxylates in the <b>combined</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> indicate other sources than run-off. Wittmer et al. [15] conducted a comprehensive field study on the catchment scale {{and were able to}} assign concentration patterns to land uses. Bollmann et al.

Rainwater can be collected to quantify the total atmospheric fallout in the catchment area under consideration [17]. Wicke et al. [18] were able to show that different types of construction areas, like areas of single-family homes, either old or new apartment buildings, industrial parks, and traffic areas result in different contamination patterns of storm water, which could be linked to possible usage of the chemicals.|$|E

40|$|Recovering {{heat from}} <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> {{discharged}} from showers to preheat the incoming cold {{water has been}} promoted as a cost effective, energy efficient and low carbon design option which has {{been included in the}} UK’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for demonstrating compliance with the Building Regulation for dwellings. Incentivized by its carbon-cost effectiveness, <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> heat exchangers (WWHX) have been selected and incorporated in a newly constructed Sports Pavilion at the University of Brighton in the UK. This £ 2 m sports development serving several football fields was completed in August 2015 providing eight water and energy efficient shower rooms for students, staff and external organizations. Six of the shower rooms are located on the ground floor and two on the first floor, each fitted with 5 or 6 thermostatically controlled shower units. Inline type of WWHX were installed, each consisted of a copper pipe section wound by an external coil of smaller copper pipe through which the cold water would be warmed before entering the shower mixers. Using the installation at Sport Pavilion as the case study, this research aims to evaluate the environmental and financial sustainability of a vertical waste heat recovery device, over a life cycle of 50 years, with comparison to the normal use of a PVC-u pipe. A heat transfer mathematical model representing the system has been developed to inform the development of the methodology for measuring the in-situ thermal performance of individual and multiple use of showers in each changing room. Adopting a system thinking modelling technique, a quasi-dynamic simulation computer model was established enabling the prediction of annual energy consumptions under different shower usage profiles. Data based on the process map and inventory of a functional unit of WWHX were applied to a proprietary assessment software to establish the relevant outputs for the life cycle environmental impact assessment. Life cycle cost models were developed and industry price book data were applied. The results indicated that the seasonal thermal effectiveness was over 50 % enabling significant energy savings through heat recovery that led to short carbon payback time of less than two years to compensate for the additional greenhouse gas emissions associated with the WWHX. However, the life cycle cost of the WWHX is much higher than using the PVC pipe, even with significant heat recovered under heavy usage, highlighting the need to adopt more economic configurations, such as <b>combining</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> through fewer units, in order to maximize the return on investment and improve the financial viability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{longitudinal}} study of mosquito ecology in Tanyard Creek, an urban stream in Atlanta, GA, that receives <b>combined</b> storm and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> effluent from the Atlanta combined sewage overflow system, was undertaken in 2006. Culex quinquefasciatus was the dominant species found, but Culex restuans was also abundant during the spring with limited numbers of Culex nigripalpis and Anopheles punctipennis also collected. Significant differences in mosquito densities were found with greater densities associated with side pools of water and stagnant water. Mosquito numbers are regulated largely by flooding of the stream by effluent discharges exceeding 15 kgal/min. These floods are associated with significant immediate reductions, but not complete elimination, of mosquitoes from Tanyard Creek. Mosquito numbers rebound within 5 – 10 days after such floods and rapidly reach high densities...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium is a {{pathogenic}} protozoan parasite and is {{a leading}} cause of diarrhoea worldwide. The concentration of Cryptosporidium in the surface water is a determinant for probability of exposure and the risk of disease. Surface water concentrations are expected to change with population growth, urbanisation and changes in sanitation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the importance of future changes in population, urbanisation and sanitation on global human emissions of Cryptosporidium to surface water. The GloWPa-Crypto H 1 (the Global Waterborne Pathogen model for Human Cryptosporidium emissions version 1) model is presented and run for 2010 and with scenarios for 2050. The new scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) developed for the climate community. The scenarios comprise assumptions on sanitation changes in line with the storylines and population and urbanisation changes from the SSPs. In SSP 1 population growth is limited, urbanisation large and sanitation and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment strongly improve. SSP 1 * is the same as SSP 1, but <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment does not improve. SSP 3 sees large population growth, moderate urbanisation and sanitation and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment fractions that are the same as in 2010. Total global Cryptosporidium emissions to surface water for 2010 are estimated to be 1. 6 × 10 17 oocysts per year, with hotspots in the most urbanised parts of the world. In 2050 emissions are expected to decrease by 24 % or increase by 52 % and 70 % for SSP 1, SSP 3 and SSP 1 * respectively. The emissions increase in all scenarios for countries in the Middle East and Africa (MAF) region, while emissions in large parts in Europe decrease in scenarios SSP 1 and SSP 3. Improving sanitation by connecting the population to sewers, should be <b>combined</b> with <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment, otherwise (SSP 1 *) emissions in 2050 are expected to be much larger than in a situation with strong population growth and slow development of safe water and improved sanitation (SSP 3).

40|$|The CuveWaters project {{relates the}} {{alignment}} {{and implementation of}} innovative water technologies to an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in the Cuvelai-Etosha-Basin, which lies in Central Northern Namibia. The aim here is to improve inhabitants’ living conditions by means of appropriate technical schemes and measures – particularly {{with a view to}} enhancing water supply and basic sanitation (incl. <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> disposal). A focal part of Cuve-Waters concerns the re-use of water, efficient use of water and utilisation of different water qualities for different purposes (multi-resource mix). With respect to urban conditions and the problems of adequate supply and sanitation, the prospect of a semi-decentralised infrastructure system is under investigation, a concept which includes rainwater utilisation as well as <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> collection and treatment. One major option for such systems, in which <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> is considered a valuable resource, is a washing house <b>combining</b> effective <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> collection (vacuum sewer) with high-tech separation techniques (generation of energy, nutrients and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> processing). Cleaned <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> – free of bacteria, viruses or pathogens – and fertiliser from an anaerobic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment plant can be re-used for irrigation in small scale agriculture to enhance food security and/or generate alternative income through the marketing of fresh produce. Energy, in the form of biogas, can be used for cooking or lighting. On the rural sites of the study area, adequate water supply poses a major challenge, for which three technology options are investigated here: rainwater harvesting, solar-coupled desalination of brackish groundwater, and managed aquifer recharge. Suitable technology options are selected for different sites in a participatory process (cf. CuveWaters Project 2008 a, CuveWaters Project 2008 b). Thus, general aims of the project in terms of providing regional economic impetus and improving livelihoods are: - to link integrated water resources management to land issues, develop the technology needed to build capacity, and achieve better governance; - to bring together supply- and demand-driven approaches in developing the infrastructure; - to consider water as related to other resources (land, energy, nutrients) and other fields of sustainability such as poverty reduction, equality and regional development. From these project objectives arise the key questions driving the surveys documented in this paper: what impetus for regional development can be expected from the implementation of technological options selected for the CuveWaters project? What constraints and obstacles need to be considered here, particularly in terms of incorporating the technologies into strategies of IWRM? What conclusions can be drawn {{when it comes to the}} supervision of implementation (training, capacity building, governance) ? After an introduction the economic and social situation in the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin along with the conditions for urban agriculture is outlined. This is followed by the discussion of the potentials for water-related activities in the region, taking into account additional water uses and the operation and development of infrastructures, whilst investigating the potentials of urban agriculture for Central Northern Namibia. Finally, these potentials are summarized and conclusions pertaining to flanking measures for technical implementation are drawn. ...|$|R

This {{hospital has}} <b>Water</b> <b>Waste</b> Treatment (WWT) to procees liquid waste using an aeration system. <b>Waste</b> <b>water</b> parameters at outlet were above the standard. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify the influencing factors to <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> management at Denpasar General Hospital of Wangaya. This was an observational study with cross sectional approach. Sample was 30 workers who involved in hospital <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> management. Data were taken by using a questionnaire, direct interview and examining BOD, COD, TSS, free NH 3 and coliform parameters at the outlet of WWT. It was found that the workers who had sanitary background only 10 % and all the workers never had specific training about hospital <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> management. Knowledge about hospital <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> management still low and as well as motivation of the workers. There was standard operational procedure for hospital <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> management and it was revised in 2001. It is suggested to provide trainings on hospital <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> management, doing periodical monitoring on WWT management, and doing field work supervision and evaluation.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Civil Engineering at the College of Engineering, King Saud University, Advisor: Dr. Abdulaziz O. Al-Jaser Jumada (I) 1428 H - June 2007 GActivated sludge process is widely used for biological treatment of domestic and industrial wastewaters. The international association on water quality (IAWQ) developed activated sludge process models such as; ASM 1, ASM 2, ASM 2 d, and ASM 3 for the design and simulation of activated sludge treatment processes. The ASM 3 model is a replacement for the basic ASM 1 model that has introduced a new concept of biochemical storage products and corrects some of ASM 1 model deficiencies. Practical applicability of these models {{is limited by the}} non-availability of activated sludge process data (kinetic coefficients and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> characteristics) for a specific <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> This study aims to characterize and determine experimentally the values of major kinetic coefficients of ASM 3 for Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> Three sets of composite samples of raw and four sets of primary treated domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> were obtained from Riyadh <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment plant and extensively characterized. The average total COD, TSS, VSS, and TKN for the raw <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> were 1008, 603, 410, and 48. 3, and for primary treated wastewaters were 553, 249, 155, and 41. 9 mg/L, respectively. Calculated average VSS/TSS ratios indicate that about 70 % of suspended solids in raw <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> and 6 3 % of suspended solids in primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> are volatile. Batch respirometric experiments were conducted on raw and primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> with acclimated activated sludge seed obtained from Riyadh <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment plant. Automatic bench respirometer connected to a computer system was utilized for this purpose. Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) curves obtained from batch respirometric tests were analyzed to predict {{one of the most important}} <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> characteristics (readily biodegradable COD) and kinetic coefficients. The average readily biodegradable COD in Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> was found to be around 32 % of total COD for raw <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> and 22 % for primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> The storage yield (Y S T O) for Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> was determined as 0. 78 for raw and 0. 71 for primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>waters.</b> ASM 3 kinetic coefficient, maximum rate of storage (k S T O), was on an average 1. 65 and 2. 76 (1 /d) for raw and primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>waters,</b> respectively. The kinetic coefficient, maximum heterotrophic growth rate (uH m a x), was estimated as 3. 47 and 2. 90 (1 /d) for raw and primary treated Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> The determined ASM 3 kinetic coefficients are compared with the values reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} industries generate <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> streams {{that contain}} organic compounds. Nearly {{all of these}} streams undergo collection, contaminant treatment, and/or storage operations before they are finally discharged into either areceiving body of water or amunicipal treatment plant for further treatment. During some of these operations, the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> {{is open to the}} atmosphere, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) may be emitted from the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> into the air. Industrial <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> operations can range from pretreatment to full-scale treatment processes. In atypical pretreatment facility, process and/or sanitary <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> and/or storm water runoff is collected, equalized, and/or neutralized and then discharged to amunicipal <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> plant, also known as apublicly owned treatment works (POTWs), where it is then typically treated further by biodegradation. In afull-scale treatment operation, the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> must meet Federal and/or state quality standards before it is finally discharged into areceiving body of water. Figure 4. 3 - 1 shows ageneric example of collection, equalization, neutralization, and biotreatment of process <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> in afullscale industrial treatment facility.
