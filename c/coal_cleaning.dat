Smaller Betriebswerke handed the functions of this group to the running foreman. Group B, which was referred to by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as Sektion Triebfahrzeug-Betrieb (locomotive running section), had to look after everything to do with locomotive and train running. Tasks assigned to this group included supervising locomotive operations, clearing defects and faults, drawing up locomotive diagrams and crew rosters, allocating staff and engines, checking locomotive records, training personnel, managing all documents and the care and supply of all engines (heating, <b>coaling</b> and <b>cleaning).</b> The drawing up of tasks, locomotive diagrams and crew rosters was later taken over by so-called 'technologists' (Technologen).|$|R

All main {{units of the}} port are equipped with video surveillance systems. The process of unloading of coal laden railcars is performed at Rosterminalugol by two rotary car dumpers that can discharge the discharge simultaneously four gondola cars in three minutes at most. Therefore, this method virtually eliminates the mechanical damages to railcars possible while handling bulk materials with clamshell grabs. For {{the first time in}} Russia the traversers were used and have been successfully utilized for prompt formation of empty rolling stock. With the help of these transfer tables it is possible to expedite railcars supply to several parallel rail tracks without additional railroad switches. The railcar thawing system equipped with infrared transmitters operates to ensure the uninterrupted discharge of loaded cars in the winter season. After unloading coal is transferred to the conveyor belt through the grid with cells of 280-mm diameter. After that, having come through the aspiration equipment, the coal is automatically transported through the system of conveyor lines, to one of four warehouses or directly to the ship, depending on the loading scheme. The loading to the ships is performed by two high-technology ship loading machines on two berths, which enable simultaneous handling of two Panamax vessels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh-efficiency {{separation}} of hard-to-float high-ash fine coals {{has been a}} research hotspot in some countries, especially in China. Separation of hard-to-float high-ash fine coals by froth flotation, although {{considered to be the}} most effective, remains some challenges to be overcome. In this paper, the mineralogical/petrologic, physical and chemical characteristics of the of a hard-to-float high-ash fine coal collected in Kailuan mining area were studied. The floatability and liberation characteristics of this coal sample and potential separation processes were investigated experimentally. According to the coal characteristics, four separation processes were put forward and evaluated. Experimental results indicated that classified floatation couldn’t effectively improve the fine coal quality, while the processes of fine grinding-recleaning to roughing <b>cleaning</b> <b>coal</b> and selective agglomeration-floatation were suitable for the Kailuan coal. Compared with the original coal flotation process, the processes of fine grinding-recleaning to roughing <b>cleaning</b> <b>coal</b> increased the cumulative yield from 50. 87 % up to 55. 53 % while reduced the product ash content from 11. 76 % down to 10. 74 %.
