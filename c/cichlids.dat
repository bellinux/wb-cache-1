5|$|Ideal tank mates for convict <b>cichlids</b> {{consists}} of robust similar sized fish. Such fish include T-Bar <b>cichlids,</b> Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel <b>cichlids,</b> Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
5|$|The {{midbrain}} (or mesencephalon) {{contains the}} two optic lobes. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as rainbow trout and <b>cichlids.</b>|$|E
5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other <b>cichlids,</b> the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict <b>cichlids</b> continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
50|$|Amphilophus zaliosus is {{a species}} of <b>cichlid</b> that inhabits Lake Apoyo in Nicaragua.

50|$|The Texas <b>cichlid</b> (Herichthys cyanoguttatus, {{formerly}} Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum) is a {{freshwater fish}} of the <b>cichlid</b> family. This {{is the only}} <b>cichlid</b> species that is native to the United States. The fish, also known as Rio Grande <b>cichlid,</b> originates from the lower Rio Grande drainage in Texas near Brownsville and Northeastern Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Cryptoheros septemfasciatus (sometimes {{called the}} Seven-stripe <b>Cichlid</b> or Cutter's <b>Cichlid)</b> is a fish {{species in the}} <b>cichlid</b> family. It is found on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica, between the San Juan River {{drainage}} and the Banano River. [...] Several currently recognized <b>cichlid</b> species within the genus Cryptoheros were formerly considered varieties of Cryptoheros septumfasciatus, including Cryptoheros myrnae, the Topaz <b>Cichlid,</b> and Cryptoheros cutteri (which also sometimes uses the common name [...] "Cutter's Cichlid").|$|R
5|$|In captivity, pairs {{are known}} to select and clean {{generally}} flattened horizontal or vertical surfaces on which to lay their 1,000 to 3,000 eggs. Like most <b>cichlids,</b> A. ocellatus practices brood care, although the duration of brood care in the wild remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|The convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a {{fish species}} {{from the family}} Cichlidae, native to Central America, {{also known as the}} zebra cichlid. Convict <b>cichlids</b> are popular {{aquarium}} fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict <b>cichlids</b> has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict <b>cichlids</b> did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that there are some other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E
50|$|Paraneetroplus synspilus, the quetzal <b>cichlid,</b> redhead <b>cichlid</b> or firehead <b>cichlid,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>cichlid</b> native to Central America where it occurs in the Usumacinta River {{drainage}} in the countries of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala.

50|$|The Salvin's <b>cichlid</b> (Trichromis salvini), {{also known}} as the yellow-belly <b>cichlid</b> or tricolored <b>cichlid,</b> is a species of the family Cichlidae. It is found in rivers of the Atlantic slope of {{southern}} Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala.|$|R
5|$|Convict <b>cichlids</b> {{may show}} {{extended}} biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted <b>cichlids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and <b>cichlids,</b> quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, <b>cichlids</b> and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and <b>cichlids</b> where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E

50|$|Parachromis managuensis {{is a large}} {{species of}} <b>cichlid</b> native to {{freshwater}} habitats in Central America, where found from Honduras to Costa Rica. The scientific name refers to Lake Managua in Nicaragua from where the holotype was obtained. It is a food fish and {{is also found in}} the aquarium trade where it is variously known as the jaguar <b>cichlid,</b> managuense <b>cichlid,</b> managua <b>cichlid,</b> guapote tigre, Aztec <b>cichlid,</b> spotted guapote and jaguar guapote. Males grow to a total length of 35 cm and females to 30 cm.|$|R
5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of <b>cichlids</b> in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae, cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|E
5|$|Like most <b>cichlids,</b> such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Over 97% of {{all known}} fish are oviparous, that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish, <b>cichlids,</b> tuna, and eels. In the {{majority}} of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the horn shark, and oviparous rays, such as skates. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these <b>cichlids</b> was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cichlids</b> mate either monogamously or polygamously. The {{mating system}} {{of a given}} cichlid species is not {{consistently}} associated with its brooding system. For example, although most monogamous <b>cichlids</b> are not mouthbrooders, Chromidotilapia, Gymnogeophagus, Spathodus and Tanganicodus all include - or consist entirely of - monogamous mouthbrooders. In contrast, numerous open- or cave-spawning <b>cichlids</b> are polygamous; examples include many Apistogramma, Lamprologus, Nannacara, and Pelvicachromis species.|$|E
25|$|Most {{adult male}} <b>cichlids,</b> {{specifically}} in the Haplochromini tribe of <b>cichlids,</b> exhibit a unique pattern of oval-shaped, color dots on their anal fins. These phenomena are known as egg-spots and aid in the mouthbrooding mechanisms of <b>cichlids.</b> The egg-spots consist of carotenoid based pigment cells, which indicates a high cost to the organism, when considering that fish {{are not able to}} synthesize their own carotenoids.|$|E
40|$|Thanks to high species {{diversity}} {{and a broad}} range of speciation mechanisms, <b>cichlid</b> fishes represent a textbook model in evolutionary biology. They are also of substantial economic value. Despite this importance, <b>cichlid</b> parasites remain understudied, although some are more diverse than their hosts. They may offer important insights into <b>cichlid</b> evolution and the evolution of host-parasite interactions. We review five major lines of research conducted on <b>cichlid</b> parasites so far: the study of parasite diversity and speciation; the role of parasites in <b>cichlid</b> diversification; the evolutionary ecology of host specificity; historical biogeography; and biological invasions. We call for more research in these areas and suggest approaches to valorise the potential that <b>cichlid</b> parasites hold for the study of evolutionary parasitology...|$|R
