Work was started in April 1996 to increase the execution speed and accuracy of the code, which has resulted in MFIX 2. 0. To improve {{the speed of the}} code the old algorithm was replaced by a more implicit algorithm. In different test cases conducted the new version runs 3 to 30 times faster than the old version. To increase the accuracy of the computations, second order accurate discretization schemes were included in MFIX 2. 0. Bubbling fluidized bed simulations conducted with a second order scheme show that the predicted bubble shape is rounded, unlike the (unphysical) pointed shape predicted by the first order upwind scheme.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{experimental}} and numerical studies of multiphase flows has remarkably {{increased over the}} last several years. This research has abundant applications in energy, chemical, and conversion processes. Common use of these technologies includes catalytic cracking for petroleum refineries, fluidized bed reactors (type of chemical reactor), interface modification, and has been an important technology breakthrough in coal gasification. The present work will concentrate on the investigation and validation of gas-solid flows utilizing numerical methods. The gas-solid flows study on this research assumes the solid and gas phases as continua with averaged properties. ^ The fluid flow computation was achieved using two different solvers: 1) FLUENT a general-purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. FLUENT technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries, 2) MFIX (Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges) a solver developed at the Department of Energy 2 ̆ 7 s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for multiphase flows.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study was}} conducted to determine isotopic ratios of nuclides in spent fuel that may be utilized to reveal historical characteristics of a nuclear reactor cycle. This forensic information is important to determine the origin of unknown nuclear waste. The distribution of isotopes in waste products provides information about a nuclear fuel cycle, even when the isotopes of uranium and plutonium are removed through <b>chemical</b> <b>processing.</b> Several different <b>reactor</b> cycles of the PWR, BWR, CANDU, and LMFBR were simulated for this work with the ORIGEN-ARP and ORIGEN 2. 2 codes. The spent fuel nuclide concentrations of these reactors were analyzed to find the most informative isotopic ratios indicative of irradiation cycle length and reactor design. Special focus was given to long-lived and stable fission products that would be present many years after their creation. For such nuclides, mass spectrometry analysis methods often have better detection limits than classic gamma-ray spectroscopy. The isotopic ratios {sup 151 }Sm/{sup 146 }Sm, {sup 149 }Sm/{sup 146 }Sm, and {sup 244 }Cm/{sup 246 }Cm were found to be good indicators of fuel cycle length and are well suited for analysis by accelerator mass spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} for the In Situ Waste Disposal Program Tank Assessment Task (WG- 11) {{as part of an}} investigation to evaluate the long-term performance of waste storage tanks at the Hanford Site. This report, prepared by the Portland Cement Association, presents the results of four years of concrete degradation studies which exposed concrete and reinforcing steel, under load and at 180 F, to simulated double-shell slurry, simulated salt cake solution, and a control solution. Exposure length varied from 3 months to 36 months. In all cases, examination of the concrete and reinforcing steel {{at the end of the}} exposure indicated there was no attack, i. e., no evidence of rusting, cracking, disruption of mill scale or loss of strength. Radioactive waste resulting from the <b>chemical</b> <b>processing</b> of <b>reactor</b> fuel for recovery of special nuclear materials (primarily plutonium), has been accumulating at the Hanford Site since 1944. The defense waste is currently being stored in underground waste tanks and in capsules stored in water basins. Current U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) strategy is to emphasize development and implementation of technology for removal, solidification, and final disposition of defense waste at the Savannah River Site first, then at the Hanford Site. Final disposal of waste in tanks at Hanford is expected to consist of in-place stabilization of most tanks. Selected tank wastes may be retrieved. Disposal operations will be carried out during the next several decades. Consequently, defense waste will remain in the existing underground tanks at Hanford for at least several decades. To ensure the safe storage of the waste, the waste storage tanks are being evaluated for continued service as part of the DOE Waste Tank Evaluation Program (AR- 005 - 10 - 02 -G). Technical studies and laboratory tests have been conducted to determine the effect of the stored waste's chemicals and temperature on the reinforced concrete. Waste solutions, which can be chemically aggressive, could come in contact with the reinforced concrete waste tank wall and bottom through breaches in the steel liner. Tests have been conducted to estimate the relative durability of reinforced concrete specimens exposed to two different simulated Hanford waste solutions. - Results of these tests will be used as input to a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of the single-shell tanks for continued storage of radioactive waste. The information is also applicable to the newer double-shell tank designs...|$|R
