In {{the first section}} the new features of Autodesk Inventor Series 10 and process of designing model of arc chute cut of <b>circuit-braker</b> BD 250 are described. A next section of the thesis describes funcionality of double contact element during switching off, creation and disappearance of electric arc. The principle of electric arc exctincion using magnetic exhaustion into arc chute with the participation of dynamic forces. The data format IGES was used for animation creation and also there is a short description of the history and origin of the format.
