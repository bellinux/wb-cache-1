5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national <b>civics</b> education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E

40|$|The urgency  of {{the topic}} is stipulated by the {{importance}} of the problem of <b>civic</b> education under modern conditions of forming of the constitutional state and <b>civic</b> society, which has the rights and freedoms of citizens as the highest value. The purpose  of the research is to reveal and characterize the peculiarities of the process of <b>civic</b> education of schoolchildren in modern secondary school (using the example of the USA). The results  of the research showed that <b>civic</b> education involves three basic components: <b>civic</b> knowledge, <b>civic</b> skills and <b>civic</b> position. <b>Civic</b> knowledge includes clear understanding of the government structure and the processes of law adoption. At this stage the main focus in the process of <b>civic</b> education is directed to the students’ knowledge and skills to analyze historical and political events in the country, to understand the directions of the state policy in the country. The main function of the <b>civic</b> knowledge is its stimulation of the <b>civic</b> activity. The essential part of <b>civic</b> education is the formation of the <b>civic</b> skills, which are dependent on many factors including home environment, active and responsible participation in political life of the society, general education. These skills are classified as interaction, control and influence. The next basic component of <b>civic</b> education – <b>civic</b> position – is connected with personal and social characteristics of a citizen, which are important for active participation under the conditions of constitutional democracy. <b>Civic</b> position is closely connected with conscious readiness of a person to take part in social activity, availability of the theoretical <b>civic</b> know-ledge and practical <b>civic</b> skills. Itshould be mentioned that <b>civic</b> knowledge, <b>civic</b> skills and <b>civic</b> position are interconnected. Practical implications of the results.   The results of the research are applicable in the process of working out of the new technologies, methods and approaches in education to modernize the programs of <b>civic</b> education and create educational environment in educational institution to develop <b>civic</b> consciousness as an essential personal quality of a pupil’s personality. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{relation}} between the standardization of <b>civic</b> education and the inequality of <b>civic</b> engagement is examined. Using data from the International <b>Civic</b> and Citizenship Education Study 2009 among early adolescents and Eurydice country-level data, three-level analysis and variance function regression are applied to examine whether there is a relation between measures of <b>civic</b> education standardization and inequality in three dimensions of <b>civic</b> engagement: <b>civic</b> knowledge, interest in social and political issues, and participation in the community. Inequality is conceptualized as differences in students’ <b>civic</b> engagement between schools and the association between social origin and <b>civic</b> engagement. The results demonstrate that accountability is associated with more inequality in <b>civic</b> knowledge, whereas centralization is associated with less inequality in non-cognitive <b>civic</b> engagement...|$|R

5|$|Animal House was {{the first}} film {{produced}} by National Lampoon, the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were recent college graduates, hence their appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine’s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney {{was responsible for the}} first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon’s High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P. E. and <b>civics</b> teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{described}} {{the election of}} judges by popular vote as a major goal and supported {{increasing the number of}} judges. He supported giving more authority to law enforcement, including the ability to search people on parole and probation without warrant, making attempted murder a crime with lifelong sentence, and increasing penalties for possession of illegal guns. Ford is a proponent of stricter regulations of the financial industry. He sponsored a 2006 ban on payday lending, which was shown to discriminate against African Americans. In 2008, Ford blocked all House bills in the Senate until the bill was taken up. The bill failed in the Senate by a close vote and was heavily amended so lenders would not be banned but restricted. The bill then passed with Ford voting in favor but failed to advance after changes made in the House. A bill preventing consumers from taking out more than one loan at a time passed the House in 2009. Ford supported offshore drilling, stating conservation was not a priority for most citizens of the state. Geologists believe there is little oil to be found off the South Carolina coast. Ford wants to prevent the widening of Interstate 26 through Charleston, calling instead for a study for transportation needs. Ford emphasized the need for more funding for school programs, which he claimed is necessary due to the small number of pupils attending college and to remedy lacks of knowledge in geography and <b>civics,</b> which he wants reinstated as a school subject. Ford was told about favoritism, intimidation and racism in the South Carolina Highway Patrol and publicized it with Glenn McConnell. Subsequently, director and deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety resigned under pressure from governor Mark Sanford.|$|E

40|$|<b>Civic</b> {{education}} {{in higher education}} is housed in various types of institutions (i. e. community colleges, four year universities, public and private institutions), institutional offices, academic departments, and larger, cross-campus initiatives and organizations. <b>Civic</b> education programs promote numerous activities to foster student engagement {{both inside and outside}} the classroom. Many in higher education have embraced the <b>civic</b> education movement; however, as with other social movements, the <b>civic</b> education movement is still a contested area. Defining <b>civic</b> education (i. e. <b>civic</b> engagement, service learning, political engagement, community engagement, etc.) becomes problematic because there seems to be as many terms for <b>civic</b> education as there are <b>civic</b> education scholars.

In addition, it implies that <b>civic</b> returns to education could be overestimated if the transmission of <b>civic</b> attitudes were omitted from the <b>civic</b> returns to education regression.|$|R

30|$|In this {{empirical}} {{paper we}} attempt to measure the separate influence on <b>civic</b> engagement of educational attainment and cultural transmission of <b>civic</b> attitudes. Unlike most of the previous empirical works on this issue, {{we are able to}} approximate the cultural transmission of <b>civic</b> attitudes. We observe that <b>civic</b> returns to education are overstated when the transmission of <b>civic</b> attitudes is ignored. Moreover, the transmission of <b>civic</b> attitudes significantly enhances <b>civic</b> involvement and reinforces <b>civic</b> returns to education. Our findings are in line with the proposals of <b>civic</b> virtue theorists or grass movements who suggest that citizenship education {{should be included in the}} compulsory school curricula since, if not, families or local communities will only transmit their particular view of the world.|$|R
