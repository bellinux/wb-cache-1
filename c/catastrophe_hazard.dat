Natural hazard events such as hurricanes, tornadoes. and earthquakes rarely occur, but their devastation can be overwhelming when they do.

Our paper will outline a ptacticsl and understandable methodology for dealing with some complex issues involved in pricing the earthquake insurance exposure. The emphasis of the methodology within our paper will be on practicality and potential regulatory acceptance. Another feature of our paper will be the inclusion of a section dealing with the reflection of the net cost of reinsurance in the proposed direct rates. A final consideration is the treatment of a mode-l’s output when it is believed the modeled results are less than fully credible. The CAS ratemaking principles address data considerations used in making rates. Catastrophe harard mode&g output is an important component of “other relevant data ” that is referred to in the principles [l].

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-stage {{model for the}} optimal management of a potential invasive species. The arrival of an invasive species is modeled as an irreversible event with an uncertain arrival time. The model is solved in two stages, beginning with the post-invasion stage. In this stage, we assume perfect certainty regarding population size and arrivals. The loss-minimizing paths of prevention and control are identified, resulting in a minimized present value penalty associated with the invasion. After calculating this penalty, we analyze the pre-invasion stage and solve for the level of prevention expenditures that will minimize expected total cost. For {{the case of the}} Brown Tree Snake potentially invading Hawaii, we find that under a regime of precommitment, pre-invasion expenditures on prevention should be approximately $ 3. 2 million today, decreasing every year until invasion. However, if the planner is permitted to re-evaluate the threat following a non-event, prevention will be lower ($ 2. 96 million a year) and constant until invasion. Once invasion occurs, optimal management requires lower annual expenditures on prevention ($ 3. 1 million) but requires $ 1. 6 million to be spent on control annually to keep the population at its steady state level. <b>catastrophe,</b> <b>hazard</b> function, invasive species, Brown Tree Snake, Boiga irregularis, prevention and control, Hawaii...|$|E

Several techniques have been developed for avoiding such hazardous loss of life and property. In this paper we have proposed an approach using latest 4 G technology WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) i. e. IEEE 802. 16 e standards for preventing train accidents. The approach helps the train to know the location of its own with the help of Fixed WiMAX base stations whose position is known. The approach doesn’t require extra GPS service for the purpose calculating location like existing railway system uses. The WiMAX base station and the train (mobile stations) contribute in sending the information to the trains whenever a train comes in its vicinity and range. The trains will be equipped with WiMAX enabled laptops/Tablets for communicating with others. The speed location and distance of other trains will be known in advance to make safe from being part of some mishap. The technique will be more efficient and beneficial for avoiding situations like collision and <b>catastrophe</b> <b>hazards.</b> The simulation is done in Qualnet 5. 0 network simulator...|$|R

40|$|Flood {{disasters}} {{are causing}} 40 % of the damages globally each year. Most serious problems {{are related to}} urban flooding {{due to the fact}} that human populations are likely settled in flood prone areas. Accumulating valuable possessions on floodplains carries a great risk of damage to property and excessive threat in loss of life. To mitigate the impact of these <b>catastrophes</b> <b>hazard</b> and vulnerability of property and human life has to be analysed in advance, before the disaster strikes. The crucial input of flood extent modelling is the information on the elevation of the study area. The quality of hydraulic model outputs may benefit from an accurate description of the terrain surface. For this reason an investigation was done on the possibilities to perform terrain modelling using remote sensing surveying techniques in build-up areas. An investigation was made on two major data sources of 3 D surface modelling to serve as an initial input for flood modelling. In a first step the latest methods of airborne remote sensing was explored. Laser altimetry (LIDAR) was compared with the typical photogrammetric solution of image matching using aerial photographs in urban area. In a second step the space-borne radar altimetry was investigated (SRTM) to explore the possibilities of a global data set additionally to the two local surveying methods. Airborne data sets were surveyed by the Unit for Landscape Modelling, at the University of Cambridge over the town of Cambridge. Post-processing was done to acquire digital surface models in the study area. Image matching of stereo aerial images and filtering of LIDAR data points was performed to obtain spatial elevation information on the urban area. Radar altimetry was processed using interferometry 3 D mapping techniques to acquire the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of the Earth. Resulting digital surface models were compared in their performance to describe build-up areas. The great elevation differences between rooftops and streets in the city centre was found to be poorly reflected in photogrammetric results whereas geometrical shadowing of the pulse were causing information leak of the same area using laser surveying. Further one-dimensional steady state hydraulic simulation was performed for a section of the River Cam in Cambridge to compared typical advantages and disadvantages related to the different surveying methods in build-up areas concluding in the applicability of the data sets for hydrological modelling.

40|$|As {{extreme weather}} events affect the core {{business}} of insurance this industry has quite early addressed potential effects of natural climate cycles {{and global warming}} on natural <b>catastrophe</b> <b>hazards.</b> Munich Re’s experts have been researching loss events caused by natural hazards around the globe for 40 years. These losses are documented in the NatCatSERVICE database currently documenting more than 36, 000 single events. The analyses of the NatCatSERVICE data clearly show a high interannual variability, in some regions decadal oscillations, and a long term trend {{to an increase in}} the number of natural catastrophes around the globe, with ever growing losses. The trend curve indicating the number of loss relevant natural catastrophes worldwide reveals an increase by a factor of about three within the last 35 years. As the rise in the number of natural catastrophes is predominantly attributable to weather-related events like storms and floods, with no relevant increase in geophysical events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, there is some justification in assuming that changes in the atmosphere, and global warming in particular, play a relevant role. However, the main contribution to the upward trend of the losses caused by natural catastrophes comes from socio-economic/demographic factors such as population growth, ongoing urbanization and increasing values being exposed. Prevention measures, especially flood protection programs, on the other hand have a high potential to even reduce losses while the hazard has increased. Because of such factors influencing the loss trends a clear attribution of at least part of the effects to global warming is very difficult. There is, however, an increasing number of studies, which show significant increases in losses in some regions and for some perils even after they have been normalized to the exposed values today. Looking at trends of extreme weather events and their effects, natural climate variability has to be considered. Short term oscillations such as ENSO as well as decadal oscillations in hurricane (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) or typhoon activity (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) still play a dominant role on the variability of losses caused by weather extremes. As global warming will continue in the coming decades, its contribution to increasing natural catastrophe losses will become more prominent, a projection also given by the 5 th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014). As long as the risks from weather related disasters stay calculable and the insureds can afford a risk adequate premium there is no danger that such risks become uninsurable. Insurers, however, have to invest more resources into analyses of trends and have to assure that premiums for the risks they cover always reflect a dynamic hazard pattern. There is no sensible way to interfere with natural climate oscillations influencing natural catastrophe losses. Humankind, however, still has the chance to avoid catastrophic increases of losses caused by global warming driven weather extremes by ambitious climate protection and adaptation measures...|$|R

The report mentions that even now there is not exact definition of Homeland Security. Furthermore, the report presents seven defensible definitions of homeland security. These definitions [...] and there may be more than seven [...] are ideal types (as that phrase was used by Max Weber) and are based on assertions about what homeland security emphasizes or ought to emphasize. In a metaphorical sense, each definition represents a set of interests that claims a niche in the homeland security ecosystem. As in a biological system, these semantic entities struggle for resources to sustain themselves, to grow, and to reproduce their point of view within the rest of the ecosystem. As the homeland security ecosystem continues to evolve and interact with its environment, one can expect variation on particular aspects of the definitions, selection by others of the pieces of the definition that confer the most survival value, and reproduction elsewhere in the ecosystem of particular homeland security definitions. More specifically, the definitions include: Terrorism, All <b>hazards,</b> Terrorism and <b>Catastrophes,</b> Jurisdictional <b>Hazards,</b> Meta Hazards, National Security and Security ''ber Alles. Finally, the report argues that the absence of agreement can be seen as grist for the continued evolution of homeland security as a practice and as an idea.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of a society to adapt and cope with disasters is generally discussed under the term resilience. It {{is a concept that}} entered vulnerability research recently and that will still need further theoretical underpinning and empirical grounding. The vulnerability context of urban poor can be approached from different angles, such as urbanism or development studies. My thesis has the aim to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} resilience within vulnerability research. I decided to follow recent approaches in vulnerability research for two reasons. First, integrated vulnerability concepts highlight the value of interdisciplinary approaches. Second, the integrated vulnerability discourse offers a analytical framework that can be modified and applied to the empirical study of vulnerability in Jakarta's kampungs. In chapter two I will introduce the theoretical embedding of the analytical framework. This will be necessary, as disaster research in social science is a relatively young research stream. Terms such as disasters, <b>catastrophes</b> and <b>hazards</b> are often used synonymously. Moreover, different definitions of vulnerability and resilience lead to diverse applications of the concepts. Thus, I would like to outline some aspects of disaster research in social science and present the definitions I will apply in this thesis. Moreover, at the end of chapter two, I will refine my research question and present the methodological framework I use for the analysis of my empirical data. The integrated vulnerability framework is pointing out the importance of the temporal and spatial scale in vulnerability analysis. In chapter three, I will therefore provide the temporal and spatial embedding of my research by presenting a historical perspective on Jakarta. Since it is not possible to present almost 500 years of city history in one chapter, I will concentrate on two aspects. The first focus will be put on the origin and development of Jakarta's kampungs. The second focus will be put on the flood situation. Accordingly, I will shortly present the different phases of Jakarta's history. In each phase I will point out the aspects relevant for kampungs and aspects that will be relevant in regards to the flood situation. Finally, I will conclude how the situation of the kampungs and its dwellers changed over time. In addition to that, I will discuss the historical development of flood risk in a separate section in order to contribute to a better understanding of recent flooding. Since the integrated vulnerability framework is a place based approach, I would like to introduce the theoretical discussion on urbanism and space in chapter four. I will show that the analytical value of the concept of slum in approaching the local level in Jakarta's kampungs is limited. I will also present the concept of informality as it is often discussed in the context of slums and urban poverty. Moreover, I will argue that informality is an integral part of megacities in developing countries and it reflects processes of self-organisation on a local level. Aspects of social organisations are, again, also important for a vulnerability analysis. I will then link the concepts of institutions and social capital in order to show how social organisation can be approached as a resource for communities. I will conclude the chapter with models of social space, particularly the concept of locality, that will provide a framework for structuring and analysing the empirical field data. In chapter five and six, I will leave the theoretical discussion and present the data I collected during my empirical research in two kampung. Chapter five will begin with a short introduction to the research approach and the methods I used in the research process. Then I will present the field data following the structure provided by the concept of locality which is basically referring to the categories of material space and social organisation. I will add two categories to this structure. In order to link the previous discussion on informality with the empirical research, I will present data on the informal-formal continuum in both research locations. In addition to this I will sum up my empirical findings on how people adapt to and cope with hazards, particularly flooding. I decided to separate description and analysis of my research findings because I would like to first provide a general understanding of the local situation in both research locations in a descriptive way before I analyse and interpret the data. Accordingly, I will analyse and interpret the data in chapter six. The main focus will be put on aspects of space and social organisation so that local communities can be conceptualised. In chapter seven I will finally analyse aspects of vulnerability and resilience by applying the integrated vulnerability framework to my research findings. Lastly, I will briefly summarize the thesis in chapter eight and provide an outlook. Die Kapazität einer Gesellschaft sich an Katastrophen anzupassen und diese zu bewältigen wird mit dem Begriff der Resilienz beschrieben. Es ist auch ein Konzept, dass sich kürzlich in der Vulnerabilitätsforschung etabliert hat und deshalb einer weiteren empirischen Fundierung bedarf. Dem Vulnerabilitätskontext armer Bevölkerungsgruppen in Megastädten kann man sich mit Hilfe verschiedener Ansätze nähern, wie beispielsweise Ansätze aus der Stadtforschung oder Entwicklungsstudien. Meine Forschungsarbeit hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt zu einem besseren Verständnis des Resilienzkonzepts in der Vulnerabilitätsforschung beizutragen. Ich habe mich aus zwei Gründen dazu entschlossen neuere Ansätze der Vulnerabilitätsforschung als Grundlage in meiner empirischen Forschung zu verfolgen. Zum einen unterstreicht der Vulnerabilitätsdiskurs den Wert interdisziplinärer Ansätze. Zum anderen bietet der integrierte Vulnerabilitätsdiskurs einen analytischen Rahmen der für eine empirische Studie der Vulnerabiltät der Kamung-Gemeinschaften in Jakarta herangezogen werden kann. In Kapitel zwei werde ich die theoretische Einbettung des methodologischen Analyserahmens vorstellen, der zu der Erhebung der empirischen Daten verwendet wurde. Dies wird deshalb von Bedeutung sein, da Katastrophenforschung innerhalb der Sozialwissenschaften eine relatives junges Forschungsfeld ist. Der integrierte Vulnerabilitätsansatz betont die Bedeutung von zeitlichen und räumlichen Skalen. Deshalb werde ich in Kapitel drei die zeitliche und räumliche Einbettung meiner Forschung darstellen und eine historische Betrachtung der Stadtentwicklung in Jakarta aufzeigen. Dabei werde ich mich auf zwei Aspekte fokusieren, Der erste Fokus wird auf den Ursprung und Entwicklung von den Kampungs in Jakarta gesetzt. Der zweite Fokus beschäftigt sich mit der Hochwassersituation in Jakarta. In Kapitel vier wird die theoretische Diskussion zu Urbanismusstudien und Raum vorgestellt. Dabei werde ich zeigen, dass das Konzept "Slum" nur einen geringen analytischen Wert besitzt. In diesem Zusammenhang werde ich argumentieren, dass Informalität integraler Bestandteil von Megastädten ist und Selbstorganisationsprozesse auf lokaler Ebene reflektiert. Ich werde dann den Institutionenbegriff mit dem Diskurs zu "Sozialkapital" verbinden um zu zeigen, dass für lokale Gemeinschaften soziale Organisation eine Ressource bedeuten kann. In Kapitel fünf und sechs werde ich die empirischen Daten meiner Feldforschung darstellen. Dabei werde ich den Forschungsansatz und die Methoden vorstellen. De empirischen Daten werden mit Hilfe des Konzepts der Lokalität strukturiert. Abschliessend werden die Daten interpretiert.

40|$|Introduction There {{are many}} kind of {{libraries}} for different purpose. Unlike the {{other types of}} libraries that are meant for specific group of users, public libraries are not restricted to any group of users. They {{are more or less}} a universal library; as some perceive them as the 2 ̆ 2 poor people 2 ̆ 7 s university 2 ̆ 2; expected to serve all kinds of people including young children, the physically challenged and those who, for one reason or the other, are incapacitated, such as the hospital patients and the prisoners. Public libraries serve the general needs of cities, towns, villages and some larger areas and are saddled with the responsibilities of serving the entire group of users of a community where they are located, regardless of age, sex, religion, complexion and profession. When the librarian accepts holdings into his repository, it implies taking the responsibility for their custody. All this may be jeopardized, if the library is damaged or lost {{as a result of a}} disaster. Viewed from the point of view of the library, a disaster can be anything or event which directly or indirectly affects the normal administration of the library i. e. the disruption of services to readers on either a short-time or a long-time basis. This is different from the normal nature of events that are termed or described as disasters. Natural events like earthquakes, flood, and volcanic eruption are termed disaster because of the effects they have on human beings as well as their normal way of occurrence. Also, man-made events like fire, acts of war and terrorism, structural (building) deficiencies and chemical spills are termed disaster; because of their effects on materials and properties of the library. However, criminal acts, like book theft and mutilation are also termed as physical disasters. It can be argued that the classification of disasters into natural and man-made has very little importance for the identification of what actually is a disaster. Thus, an event becomes a disaster, only when man and the environment he has created or lived in, are affected; whereby the environment can be a nation, community, business organization, office, museum, or library. The moment these settings are disturbed and normal services are disrupted, the situation can be termed as a disaster. Hence, a disaster as an unexpected consequences to the holdings or materials in the custody of the librarians stressing that it can be a small-scale incident or a full-blown emergency; even though in both cases, the event or situation requires prompt action to limit damages. Alegbeleye (1993) defined disaster as an event that 2 ̆ 2 results in the sudden removal of records and documents from accessibility and use 2 ̆ 2; stating further that the disaster can be regarded as an occurrence that temporarily or permanently render information contained in document inaccessible. A disaster can be seen as an overwhelming ecological disruption occurring on scale sufficient to require outside assistance. Indeed, disasters are exceptional events which suddenly kill or injure large number of people and damage properties. Looking at disaster in a generic information management context, it can be viewed as any incident which threatens human safety; and/or damages or threatens to damage a library 2 ̆ 7 s buildings collection (or items therein), equipment and system. There are varied causes and for that matter classification of disaster. Alegbeleye (1993) agreed that the simplest and most common are the grouping into natural and man-made categories. They stated further that natural disasters are happenings, over which man has very little or no control and are generally initiated by such events as floods, earthquakes, storms, cyclones and hurricanes; among others. Man- induced disasters include war-time destruction, bombings, rioting, malicious vandalism, arson, negligence, power surges and failures. Irrespective of sources of disasters, the destruction and devastation they cause or threaten to cause to library resources and the provision of library services remain a critical factor in the management of libraries. Alegbeleye (1993) also mentioned two commonly recurring causes of library disasters to include floods and fires. Anderson and McIntyre (1985) however added vandalism, theft, earthquake, insect infection and the effect of light and temperature to the list of causes of disasters in libraries. Ngulube (2005) noted that although humankind tend to associate the term 2 ̆ 7 disaster 2 ̆ 7 with devastating floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and other <b>catastrophes,</b> risks and <b>hazards</b> to documentary materials, which include insects and rodents, mould and humidity, tornadoes, forest fire, volcanic eruption etc. can occur anytime without notice. Meanwhile, a disaster plan, according to Lyall (1993), is a document which describes the procedures devised to prevent and prepare for disasters, and those proposed to respond to and recover from disasters when they occur. The responsibility for performing these tasks is allocated to various staff members who comprise 2 ̆ 7 the disaster team 2 ̆ 7. The plan should be comprehensive enough to consist several independent yet interrelated smaller plans, recognizing that every disaster has three phases; before, during and after. A number of plans is required to cope with each of the phases namely: 2 ̆ 7 before phase 2 ̆ 7, should encompass two types of plan viz: preventive and preparedness; implying everyday routine operations. Whereas preventive plans recommend actions to prevent most disasters; such as the repair of leaking roofs, the improvement of maintenance and the upgrading of security, preparedness plans aimed at ensuring that identified disasters can be managed recommending actions such as the identification of important items in the collection, the purchase of plastic sheeting, the provision of freezing facilities and the training of staff to enable them to respond to different disasters. The 2 ̆ 7 during phase 2 ̆ 7 requires a response to the disaster; the effectiveness of which is hinged on the thoroughness of the preparedness plan. The 2 ̆ 7 after phase 2 ̆ 7 is where the recovery plans are implemented; though not in details; given the unique nature of every disaster. In each of the preventive, preparedness, response and recovery plans, priority attention should be given to possible areas to be affected by the disaster. These areas are: personnel including staff, users and visitors collections and records including all categories of archival records, serials, monographs, manuscripts, maps, sound recordings, computer discs, optical and video discs, pictorial materials, and their related catalogues. It is also important to consider the protection of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s vital records. These are usually considered to be those records without which the institution could not operate. All legal documents, essential files and financial records are included in this category building and equipment including equipment, vehicles, air conditioning plant, plumbing, electrical services and computers (Lyall, 1993). The desired that the plan be prepared by a team and not an individual is due to the fact that such a plan must naturally apply to the building and all its contents, including people, collections, records and equipment. Thus, preparing the plan involves five main steps viz: conducting a risk analysis identification of existing preventive and preparedness procedures making recommendations to implement additional preventive and preparedness procedures allocating responsibilities devising procedures to respond to and recover from disasters (Lyall, 1993). On their part, Newey, Lepschi 2 ̆ 6 Croft (2008) identified the objectives of the disaster plan as including to: minimise damage to the collections; recover and repair any damaged collection materials; and return the library and archival services to normal. These objectives are facilitated by the plan through provision of a framework and guidelines for the following: rapid and effective response to an emergency; good communication; ensuring staff are well trained; ensuring appropriate equipment and materials are available; and enabling assistance from outside organisations. Historical Background of Kwara State Public Library, Ilorin After the creation of Kwara State along with others in 1967, the need for a public library service in it became pressing. The Northern regional library, Kaduna was decentralized for the new States to establish their own. The area court building was chosen as a suitable place that could accommodate the new library, before it moved to its location in October 1967. Apart from the inherited library materials from the defunct northern region, a total sum of 300 pounds was released to the Interim Administrative Council to purchase more books for the library. On 1 st April 1968, the Kwara State Library commenced services to the public after which it was realized that the borrowed building was quite unsuitable due to its closeness to the central market. The problem of accommodation persisted for two decades during which the library moved from one building to the other. The lack of a befitting infrastructure was a setback to the library and frantic efforts were made by many to secure a suitable and permanent building for the library. In November 1987, the then military Governor, Lt. Col. Ahmed Abdullahi laid the foundation of a purposefully-built library where it presently occupies. The completed building was commissioned by the then military president, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida on 21 st November 1990. Between 1990 and 2001, the teeming reading population in the State made use of the library. Within a decade and half, the building got dilapidated, its stock became out-dated and irrelevant to the information needs of users. On assumption of duty as Governor, Dr. Bukola Saraki visited the dilapidated library and promised it a face-lift. Renovation started on 23 rd November, 2005. The transformed library building was commissioned and put back to use 1 st July 2006 (Kwara State Library Handbook, 2006). Like other libraries, it comprises the Administrative, Technical Services and Reader Services, Acquisitions, Cataloguing/Classification, Circulation, Reference, Automation, Children and Serials divisions as well as an Internet café. Electronic resources are available through dedicated websites for the library while it uses ALICE for windows for its automation and an electronic device system for the security of its collection. The library was established primarily to serve as local center of information that will make all kinds of knowledge and information readily available to its numerous users irrespective of their age, sex, race, religion, nationality, language or social status. However, there is no total claim to it that the library has fulfilled these service provision obligations to its numerous patrons...|$|R
