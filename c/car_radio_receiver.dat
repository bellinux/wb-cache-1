40|$|In 2006, the ISO/MPEG {{standardization}} group finalized the MPEG Surround specification, {{which allows}} for efficient and backward compatible compression of high-quality multi-channel sound using parametric coding techniques. Since then the MPEG Surround standard has been included {{in a number of}} digital broadcast standards as the multi-channel audio codec of choice and its use in electronic music distribution and media players is underway. This paper summarizes the technical background of MPEG Surround and discusses its use in digital broadcast systems with a special focus on automotive applications such as <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> rear seat entertainment, and portable music player docking stations in the car...|$|R
5000|$|As WRGB has {{returned}} to channel 6, it has proposed an unconventional approach, by which it has requested to operate an analog FM radio transmitter at one edge of its digital TV allocation, using vertical polarization to retain compatibility with standard broadcast <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b> According to WRGB's site, [...] "We hope that the FCC {{will allow us to}} continue to operate on 87.7. We are building a unique transmitter for 87.7 that can operate simultaneously with our DTV signal on channel 6. TV transmissions always use horizontal antennas. Our new 87.7 transmitter will be vertically polarized. The use of vertical polarization for 87.7 will allow reception of our audio in a <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> or any other FM radio with a whip type antenna. [...] " ...|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of power semiconductors and allied technologies, one way to convert the voltage of a DC supply to a higher voltage, for low-power applications, was to convert it to AC by using a vibrator, followed by a step-up transformer and rectifier. For higher power an electric motor was used to drive a generator of the desired voltage (sometimes combined into a single [...] "dynamotor" [...] unit, a motor and generator combined into one unit, with one winding driving the motor and the other generating the output voltage). These were relatively inefficient and expensive procedures used only {{when there was no}} alternative, as to power a <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> (which then used thermionic valves/tubes requiring much higher voltages than available from a 6 or 12 V car battery). The introduction of power semiconductors and integrated circuits made it economically viable to use techniques as described below, for example to convert the DC power supply to high-frequency AC, use a transformer—small, light, and cheap due to the high frequency—to change the voltage, and rectify back to DC. Although by 1976 transistor <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> did not require high voltages, some amateur radio operators continued to use vibrator supplies and dynamotors for mobile transceivers requiring high voltages, although transistorised power supplies were available.|$|R
50|$|The <b>radio</b> sets, or <b>receivers,</b> {{which could}} pick up 1worldspace signals were {{manufactured}} by South Korea's AMI, India's BPL and China’s Tongshi, among other corporations. Discontinued models were manufactured by JVC, Sanyo, Hitachi, and Panasonic. The radios consisted of a satellite receiver plus an antenna {{that has to be}} placed in clear view of the relevant satellite, and properly oriented to the user's geographic azimuth and elevation. A new receiver manufactured by Delphi using open standard ETSI Satellite Digital Radio technology would have been used in Europe if the company had entered the <b>car</b> satellite <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> marketplace.|$|R

50|$|In some countries, {{small-scale}} (Part 15 in United States terms) transmitters {{are available}} that can transmit {{a signal from}} an audio device (usually an MP3 player or similar) to a standard FM radio receiver; such devices range from small units built to carry audio to a <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> with no audio-in capability (often formerly provided by special adapters for audio cassette decks, which are becoming less common on <b>car</b> <b>radio</b> designs) up to full-sized, near-professional-grade broadcasting systems {{that can be used}} to transmit audio throughout a property. Most such units transmit in full stereo, though some models designed for beginner hobbyists might not. Similar transmitters are often included in satellite <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> and some toys.|$|R

In 1932 in Germany the Blaupunkt AS 5 medium wave and longwave radio was marketed for 465 Reichsmark, {{about one third}} of the price of a small car.

40|$|Radio is the {{communication}} vehicle {{that most people}} use to receive information and entertainment every day.
