Libraries keep books; at least that's what I thought until I found out they give them away, (although they always {{want you to}} return them.) After I {{went to work in}} a library in 1979 I found out that libraries kept more than books. I never knew about manuscripts in libraries; I always thought they were kept in museums, together with other works of art and treasures. Behind the walls of numerous libraries everywhere in the world such treasures are kept. For ages libraries have collected handwritten and printed publications: manuscripts, incunabula and post-incunabula, and special collections as maps, photographs and sometimes even works of art. Most of these treasures are unknown to the general public, kept in vaults or stored in climatised depots but researchers generally know about them and have ways of getting to them, although it may {{take a lot of time}} to be allowed to consult them. Making collections visible is not just a matter of making a digital <b>copy</b> <b>by</b> <b>scanning</b> and making them accessible on the internet. There are more issues involved: storage, cataloguing, technical aspects and quite important sufficient money...|$|E

2500|$|Pramoedya {{had done}} {{research}} for the books before his imprisonment in the Buru prison camp. When he was arrested his library was burned and much of his collection and early writings were lost. On the prison colony island of Buru he was not permitted even to have a pencil. [...] Doubting that he would {{ever be able to}} write the novels down himself, he narrated them to his fellow prisoners. [...] With the support of the other prisoners who took on extra labor to reduce his workload, Pramoedya was eventually able to write the novels down, and the published works derived their name [...] "Buru Quartet" [...] from the prison where he produced them. They have been collected and published in English (translated by Max Lane) and Indonesian, as well as many other languages. [...] Though the work is considered a classic by many outside of Indonesia, publication was banned in Indonesia, causing {{one of the most famous}} of Indonesia's literary works to be largely unavailable to the country's people whose history it addressed. <b>Copies</b> were <b>scanned</b> <b>by</b> Indonesians abroad and distributed via the Internet to people inside the country.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hologram}} can be <b>copied</b> optically <b>by</b> illuminating {{it with a}} laser beam, and locating {{a second}} hologram plate {{so that it is}} illuminated both by the reconstructed object beam, and the illuminating beam.

[...] An index matching fluid is often used between the plates to minimize spurious interference between the plates. Uniform illumination can be obtained <b>by</b> <b>scanning</b> point-by-point or with a beam shaped into a thin line.|$|R
