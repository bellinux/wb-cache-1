5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> artificially produce {{an array of}} colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is most <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can}} be applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
