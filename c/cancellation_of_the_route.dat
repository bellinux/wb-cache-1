50|$|During 1960 many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cubana's most {{experienced}} crews and technicians sought employment with foreign airlines and left Cuba, reducing <b>the</b> airline's pool <b>of</b> skilled personnel. Then, by late 1960 Cubana {{was forced to}} discontinue all its U.S. routes, which included Miami and New York, along with the merged Aerovías Q and Cuba Aeropostal services to Florida (Key West, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach). Rising tensions between the U.S. and Cuban governments, threats by the U.S. to impound Cubana aircraft, and <b>the</b> unilateral breaking <b>of</b> diplomatic relations by the U.S. government in January 1961, caused <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes.</b> Earlier, in October 1960, the U.S. government had imposed a partial embargo on Cuba, in retaliation for <b>the</b> nationalisation <b>of</b> American properties. These actions {{were part of a}} broader U.S. strategy that had started as early as October 1959, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and State Department-proposed programme to support opposition groups inside Cuba, and allow occasional air and sea-borne raids from U.S. territory. This initial programme then led to the March 1960 approval of a formal CIA plan to execute sabotage, assassinations, and to attack and invade Cuba with <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> overthrowing its revolutionary government.|$|R

The <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> south of Alpine was short lived. Beginning in 1946, SH 118 was extended incrementally in 10-20-mile (16-32 km) segments until the present route through Study Butte to the national park boundary was fully designated in 1951.|$|E
50|$|There was a ferry {{route that}} ran between Mei Foo and Central, {{operated}} by the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company. The ferry service commenced on 1 May 1974. The service originally operated from the Mei Foo seawall, which was considered unsatisfactory (versus a proper pier) for safety reasons. After the MTR Tsuen Wan Line started service in 1982, the route's patronage declined dramatically and the ferry operator applied to {{the government for the}} <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route.</b> In 1984, the ferry route was cancelled. The pier was later demolished {{to make way for the}} reclamation of Lai Chi Kok Bay. The site has now become a part of Lai Chi Kok Park.|$|E
50|$|The current FM 1719 {{was also}} {{designated}} in 1951 after <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>route.</b> It ran approximately 5.8 mi from the then-proposed US 66 (the present-day I-40 business <b>route)</b> to <b>the</b> north before doglegging eastward {{to what was}} then US 87.

When Loop 335 became a full loop in 1985, the dogleg eastward was transferred to that <b>route,</b> reducing <b>the</b> mileage <b>of</b> FM 1719 to approximately 2.9 mi.|$|R
5000|$|A Houston Chronicle {{article in}} May 2008 stated that {{expected}} subsequent military buildup {{and population growth}} could lead to an expansion of Continental Micronesia flights to and from Guam. However, on June 12, 2008, Continental's announcement of cuts of services, routes and destinations due to high fuel prices [...] included termination of flights to Hong Kong (which has since resumed) and Bali. Also among the cuts is <b>the</b> termination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saipan-Manila flights on July 15 which is the last remaining Air Mike flight for Saipan, the airline's original hub 40 years ago. According to an opinion columnist for <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saipan Tribune, the “declared” reason for <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saipan-Manila <b>route</b> was <b>the</b> fact that NCLEX tests were now available in Manila, so Filipino nurses {{no longer had to}} travel to Saipan to take the test. Before the flight's cancellation, the flight also served medical referrals from <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Mariana Islands to Manila and non-USA visa alien contract workers who were unable to transit to their final destinations via Guam; the author opined that the alien workers “particularly were Air Micronesia’s captive audience.” With only Continental Connection/Cape Air services left, Continental closed its Saipan city ticket office on the same day.|$|R

50|$|A Record of Decision {{from federal}} {{officials}} was expected {{by the end}} of 2007, but the Environmental Protection Agency had expressed concern over the environmental mitigation plan for Route 11, and expressed it still favored the Route 82/85 upgrade over extending Route 11. Because the EPA has veto power over Army Corps of Engineers permits, EPA opposition could have forced the delay or <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Route</b> 11 extension. In December 2007, Federal Highway Administration extended the FEIS review period through the end of January 2008 to provide the EPA with a detailed environmental mitigation plan. Additionally state and federal elected officials requested the FHWA and ConnDOT present a detailed financial management plan for activities related to the extension. In September 2009, ConnDOT indicated that due to funding constraints, it will indefinitely suspend further work on Route 11.|$|E
5000|$|Highway {{construction}} {{also created}} significant {{problems for the}} retail district. In 1955, federal, state, and regional highway planners proposed construction of an interstate highway across {{the southern part of}} Cleveland. Known primarily as the Clark Freeway, the six-lane limited-access freeway would begin West Boulevard in the Cudell neighborhood; cut across the Detroit-Shoreway, Ohio City, and Tremont neighborhoods; bridge Industrial Valley and the Cuyahoga River; and then cut across the North Broadway, Kinsman, Woodland Hills, and Buckeye-Shaker neighborhoods before exiting the city and connecting with Lee Road in the adjacent suburb of Cleveland Heights. A second interstate highway, the Willow Freeway, would begin near Lake Erie at the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway, largely follow the border between Downtown Cleveland/Goodrich-Kirtland Park and Industrial Valley/North Broadway, and cut across South Broadway before exiting the city and cutting through the towns of Newburgh Heights and Cuyahoga Heights to connect with a new [...] "outer belt" [...] east-west freeway in northern Independence, Ohio. A total of 465 homes, churches, and businesses were demolished between Broadway/E. 37th Street and Broadway/Gallup Avenue, including St. Wenceslas Church (which closed in 1962). Construction began in April 1964, and the north-south I-77 portion of the interchange completed in November 1965. The eastern portion of the interchange, I-490 connecting E. 55th Street with I-77, opened about July 31, 1966. But the bridge over Industrial Valley connecting the interchange to Interstate 90 was not opened until September 1990. Strong opposition to the extension of I-490 past E. 55th Street resulted in the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, plans {{were made for}} a freeway along the Route 35 {{corridor}} between Seaside Heights and Long Branch to reduce congestion along the current route. This proposed freeway was built as Route 18 between Wall Township and Eatontown from 1965 to 1991 while the southern portion to Seaside Heights was never built. In the early 1970s, a Route 35 freeway was planned to run from Route 18 north to the planned Route 74 freeway in Matawan with an estimated cost of $53 million. This freeway was never built due to the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Route</b> 74 freeway in the mid-1970s.Since the 1953 renumbering, the current alignment of Route 35 has seen many changes and improvements. The section of the route through downtown Point Pleasant Beach {{was turned into a}} one-way pair by 1969. Route 35 was extended south to the entrance of Island Beach State Park by the 1980s. Many traffic circles have been removed along Route 35 in recent years, including the Brielle Circle in 2001 and the Eatontown Circle, which were both converted into at-grade intersections with traffic lights, and the Victory Circle, which was replaced with an interchange between 2003 and 2006. Between 2002 and 2005, the Victory Bridge over the Raritan River was reconstructed at a cost of $109 million. Between February 2006 and November 2008, the cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 1/9 in Woodbridge Township, which was the first cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of Route 35 was still a part of Route 4, was replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange, costing $34 million.|$|E
