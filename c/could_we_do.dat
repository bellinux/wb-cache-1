25|$|We {{came down}} here to offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so {{all we can do is}} to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you <b>could.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not ask it.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Could</b> <b>we</b> not <b>do</b> {{much more}} than <b>we</b> <b>do</b> to make the broad issues of various current {{questions}} plain and accessible to our students in the college stage? ...|$|R
50|$|Three issues {{must first}} {{be present in the}} affirmative case and are the {{building}} blocks of logically choosing to take any action (in policy debate or in everyday life). They ask; what are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> now (inherency stock issue)? What <b>could</b> <b>we</b> be <b>doing</b> differently (solvency stock issue)? What are the results of what <b>we</b> are <b>doing</b> now versus what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be <b>doing</b> (significance stock issue)? The last stock issue, topicality, is procedural and unique to debate as it concerns how germane the plan (specifically, plan text) is to the resolution (which isn't usually a restriction in contemporary, outside policy issues).|$|R
5000|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} a season best third, {{said after the}} race that third [...] "was {{about as good as}} we had. You know, we just didn’t have the speed that the other cars had. We talked about that Friday during media. But we optimized our day. It’s the best <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> finished right where we should have.” ...|$|R
60|$|But what <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{about the}} tent? It would be {{impossible}} to go away and leave that, with its contents, for a whole day.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Indeed!' cried Wilmet, startled; 'it is very good, but how <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> without her? Mamma and the children! If {{she could}} only wait till the holidays.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> {{with the}} sea {{between us and the}} ship? Even if we were on the deck could we four deliver him from a hundred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I settled Johnny Gibson {{should keep}} them. He {{is going to}} bring his dog, you know; besides, what <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with them? We can't cook them, can we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three hundred pounds! Oh, Dick, {{just think}} what fun <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have, and what good <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with it! Do {{let him have}} them." ...|$|R

6000|$|Grobelaar. 'No: {{our opinion}} is quite unchanged. We {{prepared}} for the war. We have always thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> beat you. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not doubt our calculations now. <b>We</b> have <b>done</b> better even than we expected. The President is extremely pleased.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} I, too, felt compunction at abandoning them thus, but what <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> I only trust that no harm came to them, {{but of course}} we never heard {{anything}} as to their fate.|$|E
6000|$|Then Nora spoke. [...] "But what <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> Mr. Stanbury? It {{seemed so}} natural {{that he should}} call {{when he was in}} the neighbourhood. We have known him so long; and how could we refuse to see him?" ...|$|E

60|$|What {{on earth}} <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> This was a painful dilemma. If we once {{lost sight of}} her, we might not see her again. Yet if we walked with her openly, and talked like friends, we would betray ourselves, and her, to those fanatical Senoosis.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Capital?' cried my aunt. 'But you {{are doing}} us a great service--have done us a great service, I may say, for surely much {{will come out of}} the fire--and what <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> for you, that would be half so good as to find the capital?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> Sahib? There was the Hajji's {{reputation}} to consider. We {{could not}} have called in a heathen witness for such a thing.

6000|$|MY DEAR GLADSTONE,—I {{am afraid}} that we must wait till Thursday. I [...] do not much, like taking words from a passage {{certainly}} obscure [...] and probably corrupt. <b>Could</b> <b>we</b> not <b>do</b> better ourselves?

6000|$|What <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> We wished her at--Bath: {{certainly}} not in London.

6000|$|... "My dear child, Lord Brackenshaw is in Scotland, {{and knows}} nothing about us. Neither your uncle nor I would choose to apply to him. Besides, what <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in this house without servants, and without money to warm it? The sooner we are out the better. We have nothing to carry but our clothes, you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Being dead, however, these {{arguments}} {{did not apply}} to eating him, as we were sure he would himself acknowledge. So we cut off little bits of his flesh and, rolling them in snow till they looked as though they were nicely floured, hunger compelling us, swallowed them at a gulp.
