5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> to a cylindrical cup form, {{in two or}} three stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

The <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> MFT 8 steels with {{different}} reduction in cross sectional areas were investigated {{to understand the}} effect of aging time on the anti-stress relaxation ability of non-quenched and tempered steel. The hardness and the anti-stress relaxation ability of <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> NQT MFT 8 steel was improved after aging at 300 ℃since the precipitation of submicron particles within deformed ferrite. The <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> NQT MFT 8 becomes harder and more resistant to stress relaxation with increasing aging time. The <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> MFT 8 with both 25 % and 30 % reduction in cross sectional areas are stress relaxation resistant after aged at 300 ℃ for 2 hours...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} melt {{spinning}} and <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> parameters on {{the formation of}} β-phase crystallinity in Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride) (PVDF) fibres, and ways of increasing such crystallinity, were studied. Fibres were melt-spun using four different melt draw ratios, and subsequently cold-drawn at different draw ratios. The maximum <b>draw</b> ratio in <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> was dependent on the draw ratio used in the melt spinning. The crystalline structure of the fibres was studied mainly by DSC and XRD. Results showed {{that the degree of}} crystallinity in the fibres was determined by the melt draw ratio, and that before <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> the crystalline structure of the fibres was predominantly in the α form. By <b>cold</b> <b>drawing,</b> α-phase crystallites could be transformed into the β-phase. It was established that, at certain conditions of melt spinning and <b>cold</b> <b>drawing,</b> PVDF fibres containing up to 80 % of mainly β form crystallinity can be prepared. It is further proposed that fibres spun at a sufficiently high melt draw ratio consist to a large extent of extended-chain crystals, and this greatly affects the melting point of the PVDF. Thus DSC melting point data were shown to be insufficient to determine the crystalline phase of PVDF...|$|R

40|$|Magnesium alloys have, {{in recent}} years, been {{recognized}} as highly promising biodegradable materials, especially for vascular stent applications. Forming of magnesium alloys into high-precision thin-wall tubes has however presented a technological barrier in the fabrication of vascular stents, because of the poor workability of magnesium at room temperature. In the present study, the forming processes, i. e., hot indirect extrusion and multi-pass <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> were used to fabricate seamless microtubes of a magnesium alloy. The magnesium alloy ZM 21 was selected as a representative biomaterial for biodegradable stent applications. Microtubes with an outside diameter of 2. 9  mm and a wall thickness of 0. 2  mm were successfully produced at the fourth pass of <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> without inter-pass annealing. Dimensional evaluation showed that multi-pass <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> was effective in correcting dimensional non-uniformity arising from hot indirect extrusion. Examinations of the microstructures of microtubes revealed the generation {{of a large number}} of twins as a result of accumulated work hardening at the third and fourth passes of <b>cold</b> <b>drawing,</b> corresponding to the significantly raised forming forces.

40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{a detailed}} morphological study of cold-drawn polyethylene monofilaments by Raman spectroscopy, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and X-ray measurements. The structure of the three-phase morphology of the {{linear low density polyethylene}} monofilaments was investigated by combining these measurements. It was found that the most important structure variation was found in the intermediate or rigid amorphous phase, whereby the amounts of crystalline and amorphous phases were nearly constant and almost independent of the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio. The intermediate third phase contains gauche and trans molecules and the amount of trans molecules was increased with the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio and was directly related to this 2 <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio. The resulted mechanical properties of the oriented monofilaments are related to the amount of the trans content in the third phase, a result of the transformation of the gauche molecules into trans molecules due to the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> of the monofilaments. It was found that the two peaks in the Raman spectra, respectively at 1303 and 1295 cm- 1, can be correlated to the amount of gauche and trans molecules in the polyethylene monofilaments.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Progressive <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> in {{eutectoid}} steels {{produces a}} preferential {{orientation of the}} pearlitic micorstructure in the wire axis or drawing direction. This affects the posterior behaviour of the steels under environmentally assisted cracking (EAC) conditions. The experimental results show that <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> induces strength anisotropy in the steel, and thus the resistance to EAC is a directional property {{that depends on the}} angle in relation to the drawing direction. Therefore, an initial transverse crack changes its propagation direction to approach that of the wire axis, thus producing mixed mode propagation, the deflection angle being an increasing function of the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> degree. This experimental result may be explained by micro-mechanical considerations {{on the basis of the}} lamellar microstructure of the steels. A relationship is established between the microstructural angles and the deflection angles of the macroscopic crack in EAC, thus providing a materials science type relationship between the microstructure and the macroscopic crack paths...|$|R

50|$|A {{coupling}} nut, {{also known}} as extension nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing coupling nuts, for joining two different size threads; sight hole coupling nuts, which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the coupling nut for a certain distance. Coupling nut dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing coupling nuts.|$|E
