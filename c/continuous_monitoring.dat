In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda.

This is due in a part {{to a lack of}} sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a <b>continuous</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. However, even with sufficient resources, statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self-harm are undisclosed to the medical profession as acts of self-harm are frequently carried out in secret, and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual.

25|$|The {{historically}} significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows reproducible {{calculation of}} cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, {{also known as}} the thermodilution curve. Thermistor technology enabled the observations that low CO registers temperature change slowly and high CO registers temperature change rapidly. The degree of temperature change is directly proportional to the cardiac output. In this unique method, three or four repeated measurements or passes are usually averaged to improve accuracy. Modern catheters are fitted with heating filaments that intermittently heat up and measure the thermodilution curve, providing serial Q measurements.

40|$|There {{has been}} much hype in the {{research}} and development of <b>continuous</b> glucose <b>monitoring</b> technologies, driven by the enormous and rapidly expanding glucose monitoring market and the large and growing base of diabetes patients. <b>Continuous</b> glucose <b>monitoring</b> has shown significant benefits over traditional intermittent blood glucose testing in reducing the risks of developing long-term complications associated with diabetes, by maintaining blood glucose concentrations to near-normoglycemic levels and reducing glycemic variability. In this thesis, commercially available <b>continuous</b> glucose <b>monitoring</b> systems as well as those still in development are evaluated. SWOT analysis shows that <b>continuous</b> glucose <b>monitoring</b> has a promising future, but there remain a number of challenges to be overcome, such as accuracy, sensor span, data handling, cost and reimbursement issues.

25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires <b>continuous</b> <b>monitoring</b> of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E
