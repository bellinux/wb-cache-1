[...] For Erica Langmuir it is [...] "the most tartly lyrical picture {{in the history of}} art. Mr Andrew's satisfaction in his well-kept farmlands is as nothing to the intensity of the painter's feeling for the gold and green of fields and copses, the supple curves of fertile land meeting the stately clouds". [...] She notes the visual [...] "rhymes and assonances" [...] that link elements of the composition: the skirt with the bench back, Mrs Andrews' shoes with its feet and Mr Andrews' with the tree roots, and [...] "the lines of gun, thighs, dog, calf, coat". His hanging <b>coat</b> <b>tail</b> relates to the ribbon hanging from his wife's hat.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hired a wagon {{that night}} and {{commenced}} selling the bitters on Main Street. Fisher Hill was a low, malarial town; and a compound hypothetical pneumocardiac anti-scorbutic tonic was just what I diagnosed the crowd as needing. The bitters started off like sweetbreads-on-toast at a vegetarian dinner. I had sold two dozen at fifty cents apiece when I felt somebody pull my <b>coat</b> <b>tail.</b> I knew what that meant; so I climbed down and sneaked a five dollar bill into {{the hand of a}} man with a German silver star on his lapel.|$|E
60|$|There {{was only}} one man in the room, and he was leaning out of window {{as far as he}} could without overbalancing himself, endeavouring, with great perseverance, to spit upon the crown of the hat of a {{personal}} friend on the parade below. As neither speaking, coughing, sneezing, knocking, nor any other ordinary mode of attracting attention, made this person aware of the presence of a visitor, Mr. Pickwick, after some delay, stepped up to the window, and pulled him gently by the <b>coat</b> <b>tail.</b> The individual brought in his head and shoulders with great swiftness, and surveying Mr. Pickwick from head to foot, demanded in a surly tone what the--something beginning with a capital H--he wanted.|$|E

6000|$|In half an hour's {{time the}} entries were concluded. Mr. Pickwick {{carefully}} rubbed {{the last page}} on the blotting-paper, shut up the book, wiped his pen {{on the bottom of}} the inside of his <b>coat</b> <b>tail,</b> and opened the drawer of the inkstand to put it carefully away. There were a couple of sheets of writing-paper, pretty closely written over, in the inkstand drawer, and they were folded so, that the title, which was in a good round hand, was fully disclosed to him. Seeing from this, that it was no private document; and as it seemed to relate to Bath, and was very short: Mr. Pick-wick unfolded it, lighted his bedroom candle that it might burn up well by the time he finished; and drawing his chair nearer the fire, read as follows-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It was an {{impressive}} tableau. Alfred Jingle, Esquire, alias Captain Fitz-Marshall, was {{standing near the}} door with his hat in his hand, and {{a smile on his}} face, wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation. Confronting him, stood Mr. Pickwick, who had evidently been inculcating some high moral lesson; for his left hand was beneath his <b>coat</b> <b>tail,</b> and his right extended in air, as was his wont when delivering himself of {{an impressive}} address. At a little distance, stood Mr. Tupman with indignant countenance, carefully held back by his two younger friends; at the farther end of the room were Mr. Nupkins, Mrs. Nupkins, and Miss Nupkins, gloomily grand and savagely vexed. 'What prevents me,' said Mr. Nupkins, with magisterial dignity, as Job was brought in--'what prevents me from detaining these men as rogues and impostors? It is a foolish mercy. What prevents me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{allow me}} to say, Sir,' said the irascible Doctor Payne, 'that if I had been Tappleton, or if I had been Slammer, I would have pulled your nose, Sir, and the nose of every man in this company. I would, sir--every man. Payne is my name, sir--Doctor Payne of the 43rd. Good-evening, Sir.' Having {{concluded}} this speech, and uttered the last three words in a loud key, he stalked majestically after his friend, closely followed by Doctor Slammer, who said nothing, but contented himself by withering the company with a look. Rising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of Mr. Pickwick, almost to the bursting of his waistcoat, during the delivery of the above defiance. He stood transfixed to the spot, gazing on vacancy. The closing of the door recalled him to himself. He rushed forward with fury in his looks, and fire in his eye. His hand was upon the lock of the door; in another instant {{it would have been}} on the throat of Doctor Payne of the 43rd, had not Mr. Snodgrass seized his revered leader by the <b>coat</b> <b>tail,</b> and dragged him backwards.|$|E

6000|$|... "D-don't like Red Brook Seedlings, Sam? D-don't like 'em?" [...] said Jethro. He had parted {{his blue}} <b>coat</b> <b>tails</b> and seated {{himself on the}} stoop, his long legs hanging over it.|$|R
60|$|There would however be {{a radical}} error in {{attributing}} this instantaneous transition of {{feeling in the}} philosopher, {{to any one of}} those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To say no more, the conformation of his visiter's feet was sufficiently remarkable--he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall hat--there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his breeches--and the vibration of his <b>coat</b> <b>tail</b> was a palpable fact. Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas, which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication, enlighten the human race, {{and at the same time}} immortalize himself--ideas which, I should have added, his visitor's great age, and well-known proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to afford.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Speaker, {{it is no}} {{business}} or inclination of mine to defend Martin Van Buren {{in the war of}} extermination now waging between him and his old admirers. I say, [...] "Devil take the hindmost"--and the foremost. But there is no mistaking the origin of the breach; and if the curse of [...] "stinking" [...] and [...] "rotting" [...] is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle in the matter, I disinterestedly suggest that the gentleman from Georgia and his present co-workers are bound to take it upon themselves. But the gentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles, and taken shelter under General Taylor's military coat-tail, and he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading. Well, as his faith is, so be it unto him. But can he remember no other military coat-tail under which a certain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a century? Has he no acquaintance with the ample military <b>coat</b> <b>tail</b> of General Jackson? Does he not know that his own party have run the five last Presidential races under that coat-tail, and that they are now running the sixth under the same cover? Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used not only for General Jackson himself, but has been clung to, with the grip of death, by every Democratic candidate since. You have never ventured, and dare not now venture, from under it. Your campaign papers have constantly been [...] "Old Hickories," [...] with rude likenesses of the old general upon them; hickory poles and hickory brooms your never-ending emblems; Mr. Polk himself was [...] "Young Hickory," [...] or something so; and even now your campaign paper here is proclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the true [...] "Hickory stripe." [...] Now, sir, you dare not give it up. Like a horde of hungry ticks you have stuck to the tail of the Hermitage Lion {{to the end of his}} life; and you are still sticking to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after he is dead. A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow dog. Just such a discovery has General Jackson's popularity been to you. You not only twice made President of him out of it, but you have had enough of the stuff left to make Presidents of several comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now to make still another.|$|E
60|$|We had the United States Consul on board--the Odessa Consul. We {{assembled}} in the cabin and commanded him {{to tell us what}} we must do to be saved, and tell us quickly. He made a speech. The first thing he said fell like a blight on every hopeful spirit: he had never seen a court reception. (Three groans for the Consul.) But he said he had seen receptions at the Governor General's in Odessa, and had often listened to people's experiences of receptions at the Russian and other courts, and believed he knew very well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay. (Hope budded again.) He said we were many; the summer palace was small --a mere mansion; doubtless we should be received in summer fashion--in the garden; we would stand in a row, all the gentlemen in swallow-tail coats, white kids, and white neck-ties, and the ladies in light-colored silks, or something of that kind; at the proper moment--12 meridian--the Emperor, attended by his suite arrayed in splendid uniforms, would appear and walk slowly along the line, bowing to some, and saying two or three words to others. At the moment his Majesty appeared, a universal, delighted, enthusiastic smile ought to break out like a rash among the passengers--a smile of love, of gratification, of admiration--and with one accord, the party must begin to bow--not obsequiously, but respectfully, and with dignity; at the end of fifteen minutes the Emperor would go in the house, and we could run along home again. We felt immensely relieved. It seemed, in a manner, easy. There was not a man in the party but believed that with a little practice he could stand in a row, especially if there were others along; there was not a man but believed he could bow without tripping on his <b>coat</b> <b>tail</b> and breaking his neck; in a word, we came to believe we were equal to any item in the performance except that complicated smile. The Consul also said we ought to draft a little address to the Emperor, and present it to one of his aides-de-camp, who would forward it to him at the proper time. Therefore, five gentlemen were appointed to prepare the document, and the fifty others went sadly smiling about the ship--practicing. During the next twelve hours we had the general appearance, somehow, of being at a funeral, where every body was sorry the death had occurred, but glad it was over--where every body was smiling, and yet broken-hearted.|$|E

60|$|Jethro, however, understood. He had, indeed, {{never failed}} to {{understand}} her from the beginning. He parted his <b>coat</b> <b>tails</b> {{and sat down on}} the rock beside her, and very gently opened the book again, to the first chapter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Boston's full of 'em," [...] he said excitedly. [...] "One of 'em {{come up to}} me just now, {{and says}} he, 'Seems to me I've seen you before, but I can't place you.' 'Oh yes,' says I, 'I'll tell you where it was. I {{happened}} to be in the police court one morning when they was sendin' you up for three months.' I tell you he got round the corner! Might 'a' played checkers on his <b>coat</b> <b>tail.</b> Why, what do you suppose would been the next thing if I hadn't have let him know I saw through him?" [...] demanded the young man of Barker, who listened to this adventure with imperfect intelligence. [...] "He'd 'a' said, 'Hain't I seen you down Kennebunk way som'eres?' And when I said, 'No, I'm from Leominster!' or where-ever I was from if I was green, he'd say, 'Oh yes, so it was Leominster. How's the folks?' and he'd try to get me to think that he was from Leominster too; and then he'd want me to go off and see the sights with him; and pretty soon he'd meet a feller that 'ud dun him for that money he owed him; and he'd say he hadn't got anything with him but a cheque for forty dollars; and the other feller'd say he'd got to have his money, and he'd kind of insinuate it was all a put-up job about the cheque for forty dollars, anyway; and that 'ud make the first feller mad, and he'd take out the check, and ask him what he thought o' that; and the other feller'd say, well, it was a good cheque, but it wan't money, and he wanted money; and then the first feller'd say, 'Well, come along to the bank and get your money,' and the other'd say the bank was shut. 'Well, then,' the first feller'd say, 'well, sir, I ain't a-goin' to ask any favour of you. How much is your bill?' and the other feller'd say ten dollars, or fifteen, or may be twenty-five, if they thought I had that much, and the first feller'd say, 'Well, here's a gentleman from up my way, and I guess he'll advance me that much on my cheque if I make it worth his while. He knows me.' And the first thing you know--he's been treatin' you, and so polite, showin' you round, and ast you to go to the theayter--you advance the money, and you keep on with the first feller, and pretty soon he asks you to hold up a minute, he wants to go back and get a cigar; and he goes round the corner, and you hold up, and hold up, and in about a half an hour, or may be less time, you begin to smell a rat, and you go for a policeman, and the next morning you find your name in the papers, 'One more unfortunate!' You look out for 'em, young feller! Wish I had let that one go on till he done something so I could handed him over to the cops. It's a shame they're allowed to go 'round, when the cops knows 'em. Hello! There comes my mate, now." [...] The young man spoke as if they had been talking of his mate and expecting him, and another young man, his counterpart in dress, but of a sullen and heavy demeanour very unlike his own brisk excitement, approached, flapping a bank-note in his hand. [...] "I just been tellin' this young feller about that beat, you know." ...|$|E
