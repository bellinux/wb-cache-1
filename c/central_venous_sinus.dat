40|$|Background: The {{association}} between the progestin-only pill used for treatment of menstrual disorders and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis (CVST) has rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. This report describes a case of <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis following intake of norethindrone acetate for dysfunctional uterine bleeding secondary to polycystic ovary syndrome in a young woman with undiagnosed underlying hyperhomocysteinemia. Case: A 23 -year-old woman presented with severe headache, followed by hemiparesis, seizures, and altered sensorium. She had been prescribed norethindrone acetate for the management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding secondary to polycystic ovary syndrome.

40|$|A {{study of}} the blood {{pathways}} within the gills of Latimeria {{has been carried out}} using light and transmission electron microscopy. Clear evidence has been found for the presence of a secondary non-respiratory circulation in addition to the well-established respiratory pathway through the gill lamellae. All essential components of this system have been observed and have the same relationships and basic structure as comparable secondary systems in actinopterygian and elasmobranch fishes. These include a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> (CVS), arterio-venous anastomoses (AVAs) and central filament arteries (CFAs). AVAs connect both arterial vessels of the primary circulation and CFAs of the secondary circulation to the CVS. The latter contained many red blood cells. The presence of this secondary circulation in Latimeria gills contrasts with the situation in the gills of the three living genera of lungfishes where a system possessing the essential features of the tetrapod lymphatic vessel system has been recognized. No suggestions of a true lymphatic vessel system were observed in Latimeria. Other features of gill and vascular anatomy in Latimeria show its closer relationship to dipnoans than other groups of living fishes but evidence derived from this {{study of the}} secondary circulation clearly supports the view that the Dipnoi rather than Latimeria represent the living fishes most closely related to the tetrapods...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 2. 5 year old female child posted for squint surgery of both eyes under general anaesthesia. Child had microcephaly, subtle dysmorphic features, {{tracheostomy}} scar, global developmental delay and ADHD. Child also had diffuse cerebral atrophy, hypoplastic carpus callosum, acute on chronic <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis partially recanalised, subdural hygroma in left frontoparietal region and ventricular septal defect. ENT opinion was sought {{to rule out}} any bands within the trachea because of tracheostomy. Mother was accompanied with the patient in the operation theatre before induction to reduce the anxiety. Inhalational Induction was done in distraction technique with sevoflurane in an incremental manner quickly upto 8 vol% via facemask. Direct laryngoscopy was done and trachea was incubated successfully in a second attempt. Anaesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. Procedure took three and half hours. Patient tolerated anaesthesia well. Child was extubated after the child was completely awake. Propofol one mg/kg was given ten minutes before extubation to avoid emergence delirium. Inravenous methylprednisolone 10 mg was given intravenously to reduce the edema of the muscles(especially both medial rectus) which might reducethe incidence of bradycardia in postoperative period. Ondasetron 0. 1 mg was given slowly i/v in the peri and postoperatively to reduce PONV (Both ADHD and squint surgery has increased risk of emesis).

40|$|Background By {{analyzing}} the {{digital subtraction angiography}} (DSA) of intracranial <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> in jugular foramen segment, this article investigates the reasons for difficulty or failure of stent implanting in intracranial <b>venous</b> <b>sinus,</b> and attempts to formulate the clinical index, which can predict the difficulty of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> stenting so as to improve the success rate of stent implantation. Methods All of 118 patients treated with <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> stent angioplasty were analyzed retrospectively, among whom 87 cases were diagnosed as cerebral venous stenosis and intracranial hypertension, and 31 patients were diagnosed as intractable pulsatile tinnitus caused by <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> stenosis. All patients received thrombolysis, anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, and stent was implanted since the symptoms were not relieved. The two turning angles and diameter of cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> in the jugular foramen were measured to analyze their impact on stent implantation. Results Stent implantation of 115 cases were successful, while 3 patients did not complete the surgery due {{to the difficulty of}} stent implanting. The cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> in the jugular foramen was a transitional structure between the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein. Lateral view of angiography suggested "N" shape. The sum of two turning angles of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> of 115 patients was (120. 11 ± 30. 32) °, and the diameter of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> was (5. 10 ± 1. 12) mm. The sum of two turning angles of 3 patients who failed to implant stent was (86. 37 ± 10. 72) °, and the diameter of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> was (5. 11 ± 0. 37) mm. There were statistically significant differences between the angles of two groups (t = 23. 420, P = 0. 001), but {{no significant differences between the}} diameters of two groups (t = 7. 210, P = 0. 352). Conclusion Lateral view of angiography suggested "N" shape of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> in the jugular foramen. Difficulty of stent embedding would be caused by too small turning angles of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> in the jugular foramen. However, the diameter of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> did not influence the sugery ofstent implantation...|$|R

40|$|Freshwater-acclimated {{rainbow trout}} were chronically and non-occlusively {{cannulated}} in the dorsal aorta (DA), sinus venosus (SV) and branchial vein (BV), the latter returning the blood perfusing the <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> (CVS) of the gill after being shunted {{away from the}} systemic circuit. After recovery, blood samples from these three sites were analysed for haematocrit (Hct) and [Hb]. Branchial venous blood {{was found to have}} considerably lower Hct and [Hb] (Hct = 3 - 5 ± 3 - 1 %; [Hb] = l- 04 ± 0 - 75 gl 00 mrl) than systemic blood (DA: Hct = 24 - 3 ± 8 - 9 %, [Hb] = 6 - 54 ± 2 - 90 g 100 ml" 1; SV: Hct = 23 - 1 ± 8 - 8 %, [Hb] = 645 ± 2 - 55 g 100 ml" 1; means ± S. D. /V = 8), which strongly suggests that plasma skimming occurred at arteriovenous anastomoses and arterioles draining into the CVS. The partitioning of cardiac output, calculated {{on the basis of the}} [Hb] data, showed that the systemic flow accounted for 93 ± 4 - 6 % (N = 7) of the total cardiac output with only 7 ± 4 - 7 % of cardiac output being diverted into the CVS, thus bypassing the systemic vasculature.

40|$|The {{vascular}} organisation of the branchial basket {{was examined}} in two Tetraodontiform fishes; the three-barred porcupinefish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus and the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta by {{scanning electron microscopy}} of vascular casts and standard histological approaches. In D. punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses (iaas) originated at high densities from the efferent filamental and branchial arteries, subsequently re-anastomosing to form progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this system entered the filament body, where it was interspersed between the intrafilamental vessels. Large-bore secondary vessels ran parallel with the efferent branchial arteries, and were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that these vessels exited the branchial basket in company with the mandibular, the carotid and the afferent and efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to capillary beds after exit. Secondary vessels were not found to supply filament muscle; rather these tissues were supplied by single specialised vessels running in parallel between the efferent and afferent branchial arteries in both species examined. Although the branchial vascular anatomy was generally fairly similar for the two species examined, iaas were not found to originate from any branchial component in the banded toadfish, M. pleurosticta, which instead showed a moderate frequency of iaas on other vessels in the cephalic region. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present within the teleostean gill filament, the conventional arterio-arterial pathway across the respiratory lamellae; an arterio-arterial system of secondary vessels supplying the filament and non-branchial tissues; a system of vessels supplying the filament musculature; and the intrafilamental vessels (<b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus).</b> The present study demonstrates that phylogenetic differences in {{the arrangement of the}} branchial vascular system occur between species of the same taxon...|$|E
40|$|Four main {{types of}} pseudobranch were {{distinguished}} {{on the basis}} of their epithelial covering. The terms 'free', ‘semi-free’, 'covered' and 'buried' are used to describe these types. All pseudobranchs possess specific ‘pseudobranch type’ cells, characterised by an orderly arrangement of tubules around closely packed mitochondria. They also contain vacuoles which may play a role in osmoreception by causing changes in the size and shape of the cells. Another specialised cell type, similar to the gill 'chloride' cell was found in 'free' and 'semi-free' pseudobranchs of salt water fish. They are associated with smaller 'accessory' cells from which they are separated by 'leaky' junctions which may provide a structural basis for the proposed ion secretory nature of 'chloride type' cells. Ultrastructural changes in 'chloride type' and 'pseudobranch type' cells were noted under osmotic stress but the cells still remained distinguishable from each other, giving no reason to suggest that they were different forms of the same cell. The two other main cell types found in the pseudobranch epithelium were mucous and rodlet cells. The epithelial surface possesses numerous microridges which are thought to aid anchorage of mucous. The vascular system of the pseudobranch shows close similarities to that of the gill and contains a well developed arterio-venous pathway as well as an arterio-arterial system. Arterio-venous anastomoses were found between the efferent filament artery and the <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> of the bass pseudobranch. The pseudobranch innervation is extremely complex. Morphological and denervation studies suggest an autonomic innervation and physiological evidence indicates the presence of at least two and possibly four types of receptor. The results of this study indicate that the pseudobranch has a number of inter-related functions associated with the development of specific cell types and a complex innervation linked directly or indirectly to the vascular system.

40|$|The {{ability to}} avoid {{infection}} depends on animal mechanisms of innate immunity. The {{innate immune system}} {{is responsible for the}} primary response and one type of granular cells, mast cells (MCs), has been reported to play a critical role as part of the defence function against pathogens and evidence for its involvement in the immune system of fish is growing. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely distributed in nature and are considered to be ancestral components in the evolution on innate immunity. Several types of AMPs have been isolated from fish and they are present in mucosal surfaces and in immune cells such as MCs. One type of AMPs expressed by fish MCs is piscidins, which are 22 - 44 residue, α-helical AMPs that were originally isolated from MCs of hybrid striped bass. In this study on gills of 45 Dicentrarchus labrax, the MCs positive to piscidin 3 and 4 synthesized greater amounts of these peptides in the presence of metazoans, irrespective of the number of parasites or of the proximity to them. In the 46 specimens of Sparus aurata heavily parasitized the number of positive cells to piscidin 3 was higher than both those lightly parasitized and healthy ones in all the investigated tissue districts (<b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus,</b> capillaries of secondary lamellae and extravascular tissue), irrespective of the vicinity of the parasite. In the extravascular tissue, furthermore, the intensity of the immunostaining was stronger in heavily parasitized fish compared to both lightly parasitized and healthy. The study on 24 Perca fluviatilis showed that the intensity of immunostaining for both piscidin 3 and 4 was stronger in healthy fish than those parasitized and that there were no differences in abundance of MCs expressing piscidins in {{the presence or absence of}} helminths. Our report documents the response of gills of D. Labrax and S. Aurata, and intestine of P. Fluviatilis and provides further evidence that MCs and their AMPs may play a role in response to branchial ectoparasite and intestine endoparasite infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{roles of}} the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl- 2, and pro-apoptotic Fas receptor-ligand interactions in cell death decisions during the development of B lymphocytes in mouse bone marrow and their maturation in the spleen have been evaluated in gene-modified and mutant mice. In Emu-bcl- 2 transgenic mice, the population dynamics and tissue organisation of phenotypically defined precursor B cells, have been evaluated by immunofluorescence labeling, mitotic arrest, BrdU uptake, flow cytometry and in vivo radioimmunolabeling combined with light and electron microscope radioautography. In bone marrow of Emu-bcl- 2 mice, the number and production rate of proliferating precursor B cells were increased. Immature B lymphocytes also increased in number, accumulating extravascularly around the <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>sinus,</b> and the total rate of production of these rapidly-renewed IgM + B cells was increased. Phenotypically mature B lymphocytes and B lymphocytes having a slow turnover rate greatly increased in number. Many mature B cells were located within the lumen of venous sinusoids and in perisinusoidal locations. In the spleen, the usual population of rapidly-renewed IgM + B cells was undetectable. In contrast, both slowly renewing B cells and a further stable population of very long-lived B cells were greatly increased in numbers but had unchanged longevity. The rates of apoptosis among B cell subsets in short term bone marrow cultures from bcl- 2 transgenic mice were reduced, while bcl- 2 /scid mice accumulated many B 220 +mu- pro-B cells in bone marrow. The results indicate that overexpression of bcl- 2 inhibits apoptosis during B cell development in bone marrow and promotes survival of newly-formed B cells in the spleen and their entry into a long-lived recirculating B cell pool. In Ipr and gld mutant mice lacking functional Fas and Fas ligand, respectively, pre-B cells were increased in number and production rate in bone marrow, while in spleen, {{in addition to an}} increase in number of mature B cells, a population of B 220 +mu - cells was expanded. Thus, Fas ligation may contribute to B cell death in bone marrow. The findings suggest that Bcl- 2 and Fas can help to regulate the developmental stage-specific apoptosis of B cells designed to prevent the persistence of nonfunctional, preneoplastic or autoreactive cells...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the value of attenuation measurement and the H:H ratio on unenhanced brain CT scans in the diagnosis of acute cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS:This retrospective study evaluated 20 patients with acute cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis and 20 age- and sex-matched control participants without thrombosis. Three experienced observers independently evaluated the unenhanced brain CT scan for the presence of cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis and measured the attenuation in the dural sinuses. Interreader differences were examined, as well as densities and H:H ratio between patients with acute cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis and control participants. RESULTS:A significant difference in the average sinus attenuation was found between patients with acute cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis (73. 9 ± 9. 2 HU) and the control group (52. 8 ± 6. 7 HU; P <. 0001). A similar difference was found for the H:H ratio (1. 91 ± 0. 32 vs 1. 33 ± 0. 12 in patients with and without cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> thrombosis, respectively; P <. 0001). Optimal thresholds of 62 HU and 1. 52 lead to accuracies of 95 % for average sinus attenuation and 97. 5 % for the H:H ratio, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) remains a poorly understood and therapeutically challenging disease. Enthusiasm has emerged for endovascular therapy with stent reconstruction of dural sinus narrowing; however, a {{complete understanding of}} the hydrodynamic dysequilibrium is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To review and characterize catheter manometry findings including pulsatility changes within the <b>venous</b> <b>sinuses</b> in IIH. METHODS: Cases of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> stent implantation for IIH were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Three cases of <b>venous</b> <b>sinus</b> stent implantation for treatment of IIH are reported.
