5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in <b>clinical</b> <b>studies.</b> Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{quality of}} harms {{reporting}} in journal publications is often poor, which can impede the risk-benefit {{interpretation of a}} <b>clinical</b> trial. <b>Clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports can provide more reliable, complete, and informative data on harms compared to the corresponding journal publication. This case study compares {{the quality and quantity}} of harms data reported in journal publications and <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports of orlistat trials. Methods Publications related to clinical trials of orlistat were identified through comprehensive literature searches. A request was made to Roche (Genentech; South San Francisco, CA, USA) for <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports related to the orlistat trials identified in our search. We compared adverse events, serious adverse events, and the reporting of 15 harms criteria in both document types and compared meta-analytic results using data from the <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports against the journal publications. Results Five journal publications with matching <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports were available for five independent clinical trials. Journal publications did not always report the complete list of identified adverse events and serious adverse events. We found some differences in the magnitude of the pooled risk difference between both document types with a statistically significant risk difference for three adverse events and two serious adverse events using data reported in the <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports; these events were of mild intensity and unrelated to the orlistat. The CONSORT harms reporting criteria were often satisfied in the methods section of the <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports (70 – 90 % of the methods section criteria satisfied in the <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports compared to 10 – 50 % in the journal publications), but both document types satisfied 80 – 100 % of the results section criteria, albeit with greater detail being provided in the <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports. Conclusions In this case study, journal publications provided insufficient information on harms outcomes of clinical trials and did not specify that a subset of harms data were being presented. <b>Clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports often present data on harms, including serious adverse events, which are not reported or mentioned in the journal publications. Therefore, <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports could support a more complete, accurate, and reliable investigation, and researchers undertaking evidence synthesis of harm outcomes should not rely only on incomplete published data that are presented in the journal publications...|$|R
40|$|Summary Points: Systematic {{reviews of}} {{published}} randomized clinical trials (RCTs) {{are considered the}} gold standard source of synthesized evidence for interventions, but their conclusions are vulnerable to distortion when trial sponsors have strong interests that might benefit from suppressing or promoting selected data. More reliable evidence synthesis would result from systematic reviewing of <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports—standardized documents representing the most complete record of the planning, execution, and results of clinical trials, which are submitted by industry to government drug regulators. Unfortunately, industry and regulators have historically treated <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports as confidential documents, impeding additional scrutiny by independent researchers. We propose <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports become available to such scrutiny, and describe one manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s unconvincing reasons for refusing to provide us access to full <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports. We challenge industry to either provide open access to <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> reports or publically defend their current position of RCT data secrecy...|$|R

5|$|Similar to its {{induction}} pharmacokinetics, methoxyflurane {{has very}} slow and somewhat unpredictable emergence characteristics. During initial <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> in 1961, {{the average time}} to emergence after discontinuation of methoxyflurane was 59minutes after administration of methoxyflurane for an average duration of 87minutes. The longest time to emergence was 285minutes, after 165minutes of methoxyflurane administration.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. <b>Clinical</b> <b>studies</b> {{have shown that the}} effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} methods involve {{determining the}} most fertile {{days of the}} menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or {{the day of the}} cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples. If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> of the symptothermal method.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> {{have shown}} that MFGM could {{positively}} affect circulating lipids.

Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early <b>clinical</b> <b>studies.</b> A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
