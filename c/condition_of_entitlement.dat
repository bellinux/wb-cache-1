40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{analysis}} {{presented in this article}} is the legal context and political debates regarding access of illegal migrants to health care assistance and institutions of public health. Consequences of non-regulated legal status significantly impair or even deny illegal migrants the most basic access to medical care. The main <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> to specialized medical care is legal residence within a state in accordance with its legal provisions. Fearing a growth in illegal migration and increased expenditure, EU countries are not interested in extending social benefits to irregular migrants. Fearing deportation, dismissal from work and the enormous costs of private health care, they usually do not ask for professional medical assistance. By analyzing the most important health risks for migrants the author has also highlighted the current legal and political debates on this issue. Lawful residence based on migration status and rules governing the welfare state must be coordinated with migrants' access to health care on the basis of universality and non-discrimination. In many EU countries such as Sweden and Denmark, the right of undocumented migrants to free emergency care and more advanced health care is restricted and may be subject to payment. Examining international treaties and explanatory documents from the Council of Europe and the United Nations, I try to analyze relevant international laws affecting several groups of undocumented migrants concerning the right to health and access to health care institutions. This article also highlights activities undertaken in recent years by NGOs with the aim of establishing access to health for undocumented migrants in EU countries and placing this issue on the international agenda...|$|E

40|$|In many welfare states, 'austerity' {{policies}} have ignited {{debates about the}} fairness and cost-effectiveness of universal welfare benefits, with benefits received by older citizens a particular topic of concern. Empirical studies suggest that conditionality generates problems of access and uptake but, to date, {{there has been little}} research on how different <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> are understood by older citizens. This study drew on interviews with 29 older citizens from three areas of England to explore how eligibility for and uptake of different kinds of welfare benefits were understood. In interviews, current entitlement was understood in relation to a generational habitus, in which 'our generation' was framed as sharing cohort experiences, and moral orientations to self-reliance, hard work and struggle. Entitlement to some welfare benefits was taken for granted as a reward owed by the state to its citizens for hard-earned lives. State transfers such as pensions, free travel and fuel subsidies were congruent with a nationalised generational habitus, and fostered recognition, self-worth and the sense of a generation as a collective. In contrast, transfers contingent on economic or need-based conditionality were more explicitly framed as 'benefits', and negatively associated with vulnerability and moral contestation. Uptake was therefore often incompatible with their generational habitus. Calls for introducing further conditionality to benefits for older adults are often based on claims that this will increase fairness and equality. Our analysis suggests, however, that introducing conditionality has the potential to promote inequality and foster differentiation and division, within the older population and between generations...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{attendance}} allowance {{and the control}} process over its usage in people aged 18 and over. Process <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for attendance allowance is governed by the Act on Social Services. Attendance allowance is provided to people who, because of long-term adverse health <b>condition,</b> need assistance <b>of</b> another individual {{to care for them}} and to ensure their self-sufficiency. The purpose of this benefit is to enable the entitled person to ensure care and choose the provider of necessary assistance through providers of social services or related person. Local authority decides specified degree of dependence and also carries out checks of usage of the benefit. A proposal to amend the Act is currently being discussed with the aim to adjust the system of social services in a way to take into account findings from practice, in particular in the area <b>of</b> clear <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and use <b>of</b> the attendance allowance. The objective of the thesis is to find out impacts of upcoming changes in recipients of attendance allowance in the 1 st degree of dependence and to make a survey of experience of social workers with checks of usage of the benefit. To achieve the objective a questioning method was used, the technique of semi-structured interview, secondary analysis of data and participant observation. The research has shown that in recipients in 1 st degree of dependence the attendance allowance is paid in the amount which does not correspond to actual costs incurred to provide the assistance. It can therefore be assumed that reduction in the allowance would not endanger provision of necessary care. Interest in social services is not likely to increase by payment of the allowance in 1 st degree of dependence by means of vouchers. Futhermore, it was found out that there are not any explicit methodical guidelines which would describe implementation of controls over usage of the allowance. More specific definition of control activities would enable to carry out controls more effectively and transparently. Implementation of more controls is possible only under the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> increasing staff numbers of administrative authorities...|$|R

Up until 2012 these benefits were set by Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll., on State Social Support. In 2012, Amendment No. 401 / 2012 Coll., transferred foster care benefits to Act No. 359 / 1999 Coll., for Social-Legal Protection of Children. With this change in law, there was also a change in the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> to claim foster care benefits and the establishment of efforts to professionalize foster care. The aim of my work is to analyse and compare the legislation of changes to foster care benefits {{from the perspective of the}} State Social Support Law and the Law of Social-Legal Protection of Children. I have tried to confirm or invalidate the hypotheses using quantitative research, this forms the empirical part of my work. Hypotheses were focusing on comparing the situation before and after the changes of Law for Social-Legal Protection of Children. As a technique I chose to study documents and using these documents I have provided secondary analysis. I have worked with the statistics of the Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic, the Labor Offices and the Regional Offices. The results of my findings have shown that more foster parents should be able to claim foster care benefits. Passing the bill on professional foster care has increased the interest in providing foster care, this must be seen as positive outcome. My research could be used as study material for other students of social science or for people who work in the area of social-legal protection of children. It could also be used as feedback for ministerial officials to sea the real situation since the changes in foster care law...|$|R

We also explore the effect <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has on different consumers depending on their prior relationship, if any, with the company or business in question. We show that when preferential treatment is afforded "non-loyal" customers of a company, those customers experience an elevated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> {{and are more likely to}} behave opportunistically than the same company's "loyal" customers are...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a conception of}} “sites of entitlement” {{as a basis for}} better understanding how infrastructure and services are perceived and experienced in informal settlements. While legal and policy frameworks are often viewed as the source <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> to infrastructure and services, the complexity of provision, access and negotiation in informal settlements demands a conception <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> that exceeds those domains. Based on ethnographic research on sanitation and water in informal settlements in Mumbai, we focus on the ways in which people’s everyday experiences, interactions and practices constitute sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> These sites are unevenly produced, contested, often in flux and ambivalent, sometimes made through collective struggle and at other times through quiet individual practice, and always constituted by social relations. Sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> emerge in close relation to moral economies, and are characterized by often profound and – for research, policy and practice – challenging levels of spatial and temporal variation. We argue that sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> are vital for thinking through the possibilities of realizing the universal right to sanitation and wate...|$|R
40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} {{the concept of an}} inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> the modern term for a concept that {{can be traced back to}} Plato in 360 BCE (Before Christian Era). Although the concept is advanced and examined in philosophical terms, Plato’s work is also considered to be one of the first and most comprehensive psychological theories of human motivation. A sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is frequently referred to in contemporary literature, and yet there has been a lack of investigations into the nature <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and how it operates in violent men. This investigation set out to rectify the deficiency by examining the concept through four studies. The global purpose of this thesis is to determine if an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related to both violent offending and self-harming behaviour. The first study was designed to refine a definition of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for violent offenders and to determine if there was a qualitative difference in this characteristic between violent offenders and male members of the general public. The study examined twelve domains used to describe an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> It also identified two main themes which were an action theme and an experiential theme. The action theme included actions that were likely to be elicited when an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated. These actions were assault, confrontation and rejection of others. This was particularly so when the domains of anger, respect, power, obedience from subordinates and obedience from family and friends were violated. The experiential theme included emotions and cognition and whether these were expressed in an outward direction towards others or inwardly towards the self. The second study was conducted on archival material from a prison database. It examined the self-harming behaviour of offenders currently incarcerated in Western Australia (WA). This study was conducted to test the assumption that violent offenders are more likely to self-harm than non-violent offenders, using a current cohort. It was revealed that violent offenders self-harm at a far higher rate than incarcerated nonviolent offenders. Of the self-harming offenders, nine out of ten were violent offenders. It was also found that violent offenders were far less likely to have warnings of potential self-harm on the prison database than non-violent offenders. The third study involved the construction and validation of the Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) on a student population. The purpose of this study was to enable the measurement of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men. The action themes and the domains from the first study formed the basis of the questions. This scale had sound psychometric properties and revealed two statistical factors indicating both attitude and behaviour subscales. Further investigations found differences in levels of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in terms <b>of</b> age and sex. The fourth study was the administration of the SOEQ to violent and non-violent, as well as self-harming and non-self harming, incarcerated offenders. This was to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men as well as to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in self-harming offenders. It was found that violent men have an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in both attitude and behaviour. If their inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated then violence was most likely their first choice. This was particularly likely when the respect, power, forgiveness and anger domains were involved. When examining self-harming behaviour and entitlement, this study found a difference in attitude only. This body of work demonstrated that an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related both to violent offending and self-harming behaviour. Through these investigations different aspects of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> were identified, which included a strong desire for respect, power, admiration and status, as well as a profound aversion to feelings of shame, disrespect and humiliation. A violation of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has the capacity to end in violent behaviour towards others and harm towards the self. These findings show how an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> meets two <b>of</b> the three criteria required to qualify as a criminogenic need: that is, that the characteristic has the ability to distinguish non-criminal from criminal behaviour and has the ability to be measured. This opens the way for further research to investigate the third criterion required to qualify for a criminogenic need, which is whether an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> can be changed...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the role of three facets <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> (active, passive and revenge) in various forms of subjective well-being (SWB) : hedonistic and two facets of eudaimonic well-being (social and psychological). Social well-being was based on Keyes’ model (1998) and psychological well-being on Ryff’s model (1989). Participants and procedure The study was performed in three nations (Poland, Puerto Rico and Vietnam) on student samples (Poland, n = 245, Vietnam, n = 115, and Puerto Rico, n = 300). To assess entitlement level the Entitlement Questionnaire was used. The level of hedonistic well-being was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and eudaimonic well-being by the Mental Health Continuum–Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Active entitlement {{was positively related to}} all aspects <b>of</b> SWB. Revenge <b>entitlement</b> was negatively related to hedonistic and psychological SWB in all samples and negatively related to social well-being only in Poland. Passive entitlement was unrelated to SWB. Conclusions The current study shows cross-cultural similarities in relationships <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> with hedonistic and psychological well-being and cross-cultural differences in the relationship <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> with social well-being. Additionally, the study indicates positive meaning of healthy aspects <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being and negative meaning of dysfunctional aspects <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{notion of}} an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has recently been proposed as a criminogenic need. Criminogenic needs are those factors which {{are directly related to}} criminal behaviour and recidivism. The three determinants that are required for a characteristic to qualify as a criminogenic need are that it can distinguish criminal behaviour, is able to be measured, and has the ability to generate pro-social change. The Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) was designed {{in the absence of an}} appropriate instrument to measure this construct within the offending population. The SOEQ was administered to non-offenders, non-violent offenders and violent offenders. The results indicated that violent offenders have a more inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> than non-offenders and non-violent offenders that, when violated, is more likely to result in violent behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to examine the {{possible}} relationship between socioeconomic status, the personality trait sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and driver attitudes and behaviour. Previous research have shown that individuals high in sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> are less inclined to abide by the rules and norms that normally govern social interactions. They might be aware of what the rules are, but they see themselves as exempt from these rules due to their perceived special status. They also show increased levels of aggression in situations with perceived ego threat, and show less concern for the welfare of others. The same kinds of behaviour has also been associated with having a high socioeconomic position, and it could be that these variables are related. The results are based on the responses to a mail questionnaire survey carried out among a representative sample of the Norwegian public (n = 159). Sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was found to predict attitudes towards violations and speeding, self-reported violations and aggressive behaviour in traffic, in addition to positive behaviour towards other road users. Unexpectedly, an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was found. Income had a direct effect on attitudes and behaviour, and moderated the effect <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> on attitudes towards violations.
