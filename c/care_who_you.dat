500|$|... "Kissing You" [...] {{was covered}} by American R singer Beyoncé under the title [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", later {{replaced}} with other track [...] "If". Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album. She called the song [...] "a beautiful ballad" [...] and said, [...] "I've always loved [...] It gives you this emotion – I don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, you just feel it. And it meant a lot for me to do this." [...] While reviewing the deluxe edition of B'Day, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, saying that it [...] "sound downright subtle".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on Christian principles {{to support the}} film's main theme of redemption. According to Favreau, Meacham's teaching Doc how to shoot not only references similar scenes in other Westerns but also [...] "teach him {{how to be a}} person". Meacham's dying words to Jake, [...] "God don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were, Son, only who you are", speaks of the central theme of redemption. The hummingbird that Jake sees at various points in the film is a [...] "good spirit" [...] that could represent either Alice or Ella; an alternate theory is that Ella was an angel that helped Jake [...] "get over" [...] Alice. Favreau also suggested a back-story to Cowboys & Aliens: the über-alien is the mastermind of the invasion; all other aliens are [...] "worker bees", possibly genetically engineered by another species of aliens that remained on their home planet and sent the worker bees as conquistadors.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Corey Taylor {{said that}} he only met Rubin four times during the entire {{recording}} process of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses and that Rubin barely ever showed up to the studio: [...] "...we were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of {{the guys in the}} band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes on a lot of projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of like Big Brother up on the hill. Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was. That's my favorite record we've done." ...|$|E

Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some [...] "phase"!

2500|$|The Doctor {{starts walking}} {{back when he}} hears cries of help: the {{infected}} crew have broken the biodome seal and are now attacking the central hub with massive amounts of water, infecting several others. The rocket's pilot is infected, but he sacrifices himself by causing the rocket to self-destruct and strand the Flood. The Doctor races back and rescues Adelaide and the last surviving crew, Yuri and Mia, via the TARDIS moments before the base destructs. He returns them to Earth, arriving outside Adelaide's home. Yuri takes a shocked Mia away, while Adelaide demands {{to know why the}} Doctor saved them and risked changing history. The Doctor insists that he can break the laws of time to save the [...] "little people", calling himself [...] "Time Lord Victorious". Adelaine becomes indignant and warns him, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are - the Time Lord Victorious is 'wrong'", before stepping into her home and killing herself.|$|E
2500|$|Madonna {{has been}} a strong {{supporter}} of U.S. President Barack Obama. She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— though I know that plenty {{of people in this country}} think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience. [...] However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience. [...] Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> vote for. [...] Do not take this great privilege for granted." ...|$|E

In her weariness forgetting everything, {{she moved}} {{about at the}} little tasks that {{remained}} to be done, set his breakfast, rinsed his pit-bottle, put his pit-clothes on the hearth to warm, set his pit-boots beside them, put him out a clean scarf and snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went to bed. He was already dead asleep. His narrow black eyebrows were drawn up {{in a sort of}} peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks' down-strokes, and his sulky mouth, seemed to be saying: [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are nor what you are, I SHALL have my own way." ...|$|E

Now, give me those letters. What, {{do you want your}} money first? Very well," [...] and, rising, Brant went to a cupboard and produced a small steel box, which he unlocked; and, having taken from it the appointed sum, locked it again. [...] "There you are," [...] he said; [...] "oh, you needn't stare at the cupboard; the box won't live there after to-day, or anywhere in this house. By the way, I understand that Montalvo never paid you." ...|$|E

[...] This had all the air of being a formula of dismissal, as if her next words would be that I might take myself off now that she had had the amusement of looking on the face of such a monster of indiscretion. Therefore I was all the more surprised when she added, with her soft, venerable quaver, [...] "You may have as many rooms as you like--if you will pay a good deal of money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No names, please!" [...] said Holmes, as we {{knocked at}} Gilchrist's door. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he {{understood}} our errand. There were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within. Holmes was so charmed {{with one of}} them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the Indian--a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance, and was obviously glad when Holmes's architectural studies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching. Only at the third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it. [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are.

I have never gone a mile {{out of my way to}} meet any woman in my life. My life here has seemed of all things the best to me. I am a dull, unambitious sort of fellow, you know, since I settled down here, and I expected to go on for the rest of my days pretty much in the same way. And yet when Pelham showed me your picture it was different. I made him give a copy to me. I told him--liar that I was--that I could not carry the memory of your face in my mind, when it was already engraven in my heart. And I went off to Paris, Phyllis, like the veriest Don Quixote, and I came back very sad indeed when I could not find you. Then you came to Runton Place, and the trouble began. I did not <b>care</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were, Phyllis Poynton, Sybil Fielding, or any one else. I let the others dispute. You were--yourself, and I love you, dear. Now do you understand why I cannot let you go away like this?" ...|$|E

5000|$|As she was {{female and}} held a {{position}} in her uncle's court, Griffith realized {{that it would be}} possible for Hild to have sexual partners of either sex as women of Hild's station would have to worry primarily about being discreet and careful about whom they selected. However Griffith also stated that: Hild isn’t lesbian/homosexual. She’s bisexual. I doubt they had such terms back then, though. I’ve seen no evidence that <b>who</b> <b>you</b> did or did not have sex with defined how women thought of themselves. Actually, there’s no evidence for anything, sexually, in early seventh-century northern Britain. Nothing. No material culture and no text.The way I see it, at the time, before widespread conversion to Roman Christianity, no one much <b>cared</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> did and didn’t have sex with. Sex wasn’t a moral issue. All royal women before the founding of nunneries ... got married, and that if they then wanted to have sex with other women no one would much care {{as long as they were}} discreet. After all, the point of marriage was alliance, household management, and the provision of heirs. Married girls loving other married girls wouldn’t have any impact on any of these points. Griffith also stated that she wanted to write the book in an immersive style in order to let the reader [...] "experience the seventh century, to see, smell, hear, taste and feel what Hild does; to gradually adopt her mindset and worldview; to think as she does, to learn her lessons, feel her joys—to be her, just for a little while." ...|$|R
