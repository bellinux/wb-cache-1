25|$|It {{starts in}} Gathiuru, and mainly follows the North Burguret River, then {{continues}} up to Hut Tarn on the Peak Circuit Path. It {{is the shortest}} route to Peak Lenana. It is managed by the Gathiuru <b>Community</b> <b>Forest</b> Association. The locals in the areas have {{for a long time}} suffered human-wildlife conflict. They had to wake up to the reality that God has endowed them with a great mountain and wildlife from which they can earn a living. They came together and formed the Gathiuru <b>Community</b> <b>Forest</b> Association which was aimed at conserving the two great natural resources as they make a living. To access the route tourists will have to pass through the Mt Kenya Royal Cottages for payment and facilitation. This is a lodge situated opposite the Nanyuki airstrip and has entered into a partnership with the association to help market the route for the locals so that the community benefits. The Gathiuru Route boasts of great fauna and flora, wildlife and great scenery.|$|E

In the United States, <b>community</b> <b>forests</b> have been owned and operated {{for more than a century}} by Native Americans, Spanish land-grant (Hispano) settlers in the Southwest, and by early colonists in New England (Baker and Kusel 2003; McCullough 1995). In the early twentieth century, the establishment of <b>community</b> <b>forests</b> was advocated by a small group of professional U. S. foresters, but their advice went largely unheeded (Brown 1941; Reynolds 1939). Today, efforts to establish <b>community</b> <b>forests</b> are coming from a new source─community-based conservation organizations seeking to avoid landscape parcelization and to maintain local access to and control of nearby working forests for the conservation of wildlife, rural lifestyles, jobs, recreation, and ecosystem services (Belsky 2004; Duvall and Belsky 2005; Braxton-Little 2006).

25|$|Land {{ownership}} in the region rests with the native authority, which must obtain community consent for land transfers. The local people, with reason, are suspicious of government promises that they will receive long-term economic assistance in exchange for giving up their land, and instead demand exorbitant cash payment.

However, this practice is still dwarfed in comparison to the total amount of wood being gathered annually for fuelwood and charcoal production, which happens at an amount 30 times greater than artisanal logging. There are three types of forest codes in the DRC—public institutions, private, and community forests. Artisanal logging takes place under <b>community</b> <b>forest</b> area.|$|E

25|$|The Van Gurjars ("forest Gurjars") {{are found}} in the Shivalik hills area of North India. The Van Gurjars follow Islam, and they have their own clans, similar to the Hindu gotras. They are a {{pastoral}} semi-nomadic community, practising transhumance. In the winter season, the Van Gurjars migrate with their herds to the Shiwalik foothills, and in summer, they migrate to pastures high up in the mountains. The Van Gurjars have had conflicts with the forest authorities, who prohibited human and livestock populations inside a reserved park, and blamed the Van Gurjar community for poaching and timber smuggling. After the creation of the Rajaji National Park (RNP), the Van Gurjars in Deharadun were asked to shift to a resettlement colony at Pathari near Hardwar. In 1992, when they returned to the foothills, the RNP authorities tried to block them from the park area. The community fought back and finally the forest authorities had to relent. Later, a <b>community</b> <b>forest</b> management (CFM) programme aiming to involve the Van Gurjars in forest management was launched.|$|E
