500|$|His {{political}} awakening {{happened during}} his university years. Studying law and {{arts at the}} University of Adelaide, he became very active in political organisations, joining the University Socialist Club, Fabian Society, the Student Representative Council and the Theatre Group. A two-week stint in the Communist Party was followed by membership in the Australian Labor Party. Dunstan was markedly different from the general membership of the Labor Party of the time; upon applying for membership at Trades Hall, a Labor veteran supposedly muttered [...] "how <b>could</b> <b>that</b> long-haired prick be a Labor man?" [...] His peculiarities, such as his upper-class accent, were a target of derision by the working-class Labor old guard throughout his early political involvement. Dunstan funded his education by working in theatre and radio during his university years. He eventually graduated with a double degree, with arts majors in Latin, comparative philology, history and politics, and he came first in political science.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{production}} of season two, rumors circulated that upcoming episodes would feature a love interest for Kurt. Initial fan and media speculation suggested that Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was created to fill this role; however, according to Overstreet, Sam's storyline quickly paired him with Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) {{as a result of the}} chemistry the producers detected between him and Agron. In September 2010, it was confirmed that Criss would join the show in a [...] "much-talked-about new gay role". Media speculation suggested that Blaine would be Kurt's new love interest. His original character description was: [...] "a cute and charismatic gay student from a rival Glee club named the Dalton Academy Warblers—will maintain a strictly platonic friendship with McKinley High's most out and proud pupil. But <b>could</b> <b>that</b> change as the season progresses? Yes, it could." [...] Murphy stated that Blaine's arc would be a significant one. He explained, [...] "He sort of becomes Kurt's mentor and then maybe love [...] Kurt really admires him and respects him." ...|$|E

The first book has been given a first printing of one million copies and was released on October 23, 2012. The title of the first book had earlier been hinted at in a message to fansite 667 Dark Avenue, where it was apparently designated as [...] "The First Question".

2500|$|The {{charge of}} a uranium nucleus, we found, was indeed large enough to {{overcome}} {{the effect of the}} surface tension almost completely; so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop, ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation, such as the impact of a single neutron. But there was another problem. After separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200MeV in all; where <b>could</b> <b>that</b> energy come from? ...Lise Meitner... worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula E= mc2, and one-fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200MeV. So here was the source for that energy; it all fitted! ...|$|E
