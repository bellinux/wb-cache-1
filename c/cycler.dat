Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the Peltier effect, which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation {{at the top of the}} reaction tube. Older thermal cyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.|$|E

[...] The System One can also use a separate dialysate production device manufactured by NxStage - the PureFlow. The PureFlow uses a deionization process to create a 60, 50 or 40 liter batch of dialysate depending on the SAK (bag of dialysate concentrate) specified by the MD. A batch has a 96-hour shelf life and is usually used for two or three treatments, although some patients are using the entire 60, 50 or 40 liter batch for a single extended treatment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Repeated {{weight loss}} {{followed}} by weight gain may cause women to become metabolically efficient and therefore regain weight after dieting. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate what effect long term weight cycling has on metabolic function and eating behaviour in a normal weight population. Method: Subjects were matched for body composition and grouped by previous weight fluctuates (weight <b>cyclers)</b> versus those who have remained weight stable (non-weight <b>cyclers).</b> Indirect calorimetry, 7 -day nutritional intake and activity, three-factor eating questionnaire and a DEXA scan were performed. Results: There were no significant differences in resting metabolism, however the weight <b>cyclers</b> were lower (4. 8 ± 1. 0 versus 5. 0 ± 1. 1 MJ/day). Restrained eating and disinhibition were different between non-weight <b>cyclers</b> (3. 9 ± 2. 9; 5. 1 ± 2. 2) and weight <b>cyclers</b> (6. 7 + 3. 7, p= 0. 04; 7. 8 ± 3. 7, p= 0. 03; respectively). Self reported daily activity was higher (p= 0. 03) in the weight <b>cyclers</b> (1. 7 ± 0. 2) than the non-weight <b>cyclers</b> (1. 5 ± 0. 2). Conclusions: Resting metabolic rate did not differ between groups, however will power, resistance to eating cues and daily activity levels did.

40|$|As {{part of a}} large {{international}} {{project for}} validation and standardization of PCR, the influence of thermocyclers on PCR was tested. Six brand-new, Peltier technology-driven 96 -well thermocyclers were subjected to a novel and stringent in-tube (not block) physical testing. The temperature was directly monitored in PCR tubes containing 50 μl of distilled water at 13 different block positions. The certified temperature accuracy of the measurement system was ± 0. 3 °C. Finally, the results of the physical testing were compared to those of an amplification efficiency study running an in-house PCR assay. The <b>cyclers</b> did not perform within the manufacturer′s specification. Premature timing, under- and overshooting, and spatial variation of heat transfer were found to be the critical factors. The physical testing allowed us to distinguish accurate from less-accurate (2 / 6) <b>cyclers.</b> The lack of thermal homogeneities became most evident at the denaturation level during the first 15 s. At the time point zero, the accurate <b>cyclers</b> showed temperature deviations of 0. 5 to 1. 5 °C, whereas less-accurate <b>cyclers</b> failed to reach the set temperature by 13 to 20 °C. Consequently, the two less-accurate <b>cyclers</b> could not gain positive PCR results by running an in-house PCR assay. However, by modifying the original temperature protocol by increasing the denaturation temperature and time, the amplification efficiency of these two <b>cyclers</b> could be improved significantly.

40|$|Background Controversy exists {{about whether}} weight cycling {{increases}} morbidity and mortality. Methods To assess the independent association of weight cycling with mortality, {{we conducted a}} prospective study of 44 882 middle-aged or older women in the Nurses' Health Study who provided information on intentional weight losses between 1972 and 1992, survived until at least 1994, had a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of at least 17, and had no history of cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) or heart disease. Women who reported they had intentionally lost at least 9. 1 kg at least 3 times were classified as severe weight <b>cyclers.</b> Women who had intentionally lost at least 4. 5 kg at least 3 times but {{did not meet the}} criteria for severe weight cycling were classified as mild weight <b>cyclers.</b> All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were assessed. Results: Between 1972 and 1992, approximately 18. 8 % of the women were mild weight <b>cyclers,</b> and 8. 0 % were severe weight <b>cyclers.</b> During 12 years of follow-up, 2884 women died; of their deaths, 425 were due to cardiovascular events. Weight <b>cyclers</b> gained more weight during follow-up than noncyclers (P <. 001). After adjusting for BMI at age 18 years, physical activity, smoking, postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, alcohol intake, net weight change from age 18 years, and change in physical activity, there was no increase in risk of all-cause mortality among mild (relative risk [RR], 0. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 75 - 0. 93) or severe <b>cyclers</b> (RR, 0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 77 - 1. 04).

40|$|Background: Rapid cycling, {{defined as}} 4 or more mood episodes per year, is a course {{specifier}} of bipolar disorder associated with relative treatment resistance. Several risk {{factors have been}} suggested {{to be associated with}} rapid cycling. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare clinical studies for the evidence of discriminating factors between rapid and non-rapid cycling. Data Sources and Selection: We searched MEDLINE and reference lists of articles and book chapters and selected all of the clinical studies published from 1974 to 2002 comparing subjects with rapid and non-rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Prevalence rates and mean random effect sizes for 18 potential risk factors that were reported by at least 3 studies were calculated. In addition, we differentiated between current and lifetime diagnoses of rapid cycling. Data Synthesis: Twenty studies were identified. Rapid cycling was present in 16. 3 % of 2054 bipolar patients in 8 studies that included patients who were consecutively admitted to an inpatient or outpatient facility, without a priori selection of rapid <b>cyclers</b> and without matching the numbers of rapid <b>cyclers</b> to non-rapid cycling controls. Female gender and bipolar II subtype both had a small, but statistically significant, effect (p <. 000 for female gender, p <. 001 for bipolar 11 subtype). The further absence of recurrences with lithium prophylaxis was reported in 34 % of rapid <b>cyclers</b> compared with 47 % of non-rapid <b>cyclers,</b> a nearly significant difference, and a partial response was present in 59 % and 65 % of patients, respectively. The effect of hypothyroidism was significant (p <. 01) in studies using current, but not lifetime, definitions of rapid cycling. In 46 % of cases, a rapid cycling course was preceded by treatment with antidepressants, but systematic data on their causal role are lacking. Conclusion: Rapid cycling is slightly more prevalent in women and in patients with bipolar II subtype. In contrast to common opinion, lithium prophylaxis has at least partial efficacy in a considerable number of rapid <b>cyclers,</b> especially when antidepressants are avoided. Hypothyroidism may be associated with mood destabilization in vulnerable patients...|$|R

This study compared treatment patterns and treatment effectiveness between TNFi <b>cyclers</b> and non-TNFi switchers in patients with RA. Methods: The analysis included a cohort of patients from the Truven Health Analytics ­MarketScan Commercial database with RA who switched from a TNFi (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, or infliximab) either to another TNFi or to a non-TNFi targeted DMARD (abatacept, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib) between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2014. A claims-based algorithm was used to estimate treatment effectiveness based on six criteria (adherence, no dose increase, no new conventional therapy, no switch to another targeted DMARD, no new/increased oral glucocorticoid, and intra-articular injections on < 2  days). Results: The cohort included 5, 020 TNFi <b>cyclers</b> and 1, 925 non-TNFi switchers. Non-TNFi switchers were significantly less likely than TNFi <b>cyclers</b> to switch therapy again within 6  months (13. 2 % vs 19. 5 %; P< 0. 001) or within 12  months (29. 7 % vs 34. 6 %; P< 0. 001) and {{significantly more likely to}} be persistent on therapy at 12  months (61. 8 % vs 58. 2 %; P< 0. 001). Non-TNFi switchers were significantly more likely than TNFi <b>cyclers</b> to achieve all six of the claims-based effectiveness algorithm criteria for the 12  months after the initial switch (27 % vs 24 %; P= 0. 011). Conclusion: Although the absolute differences were small, these results support switching to a non-TNFi targeted DMARD instead of TNFi cycling when patients with RA require another therapy after TNFi failure.
