50|$|This system {{provides}} for the installation of a <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> for each well. The distribution of the wells is established according to the permeability of the land to be drained and the lowering of the water pressure to be achieved. The use of isolated wells with <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps</b> leads to high operational costs and imposes a very time-consuming level of control and maintenance.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> {{should be tested}} at regular intervals to master {{the status of the}} <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> in real time and thus achieve the goal of saving energy. The ultrasonic flowmeter method is traditionally used to measure the flow of the pump. But there are some defects in this kind of method of underground coal mine. This paper first introduces the principle of testing the main <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency in coal mine using thermodynamic theories, then analyzes the energy transformation during the process of draining water, and finally derives the calculation formulae of the pump efficiency, which meet the on-site precision of engineering. On the basis of analyzing the theories, the protective sleeve and the base of the temperature sensor are designed to measure the water temperature at inlet and outlet of the pump. The efficiencies of pumps with two specifications are measured, respectively, by using the thermodynamic method and ultrasonic flowmeter method. By contrast, the results show that thermodynamic method can satisfy the precision of the testing requirements accuracy for high-flow and high-lift <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> under normal temperatures. Moreover, some measures are summed up to improve the accuracy of testing the pump efficiency, which are of guiding significance for on-site testing of the main <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency in coal mine...|$|R

50|$|The Nasiriyah <b>Drainage</b> <b>Pump</b> Station {{is a land}} <b>drainage</b> <b>pumping</b> {{station in}} Iraq 10 km {{southeast}} of Nasiriyah {{in the province of}} Dhi Qar. The station pumps farm run-off collected by the Main Outfall Drain (MOD) north of the Euphrates River in Dhi Qar and Muthanna provinces to a siphon under the Euphrates where it is then returned to the MOD and eventually discharged in the Persian Gulf. The pump station relieves water back-up and is a critical component of a larger agricultural drainage system designed to drain 1.5 million hectares of land in order to reduce soil salinity. Consisting of 12 pumps, each with a 20 m³/second (316,000 gal/min) capacity, it is the largest <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> in the Middle East.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> at Dogdyke {{was built}} in 1796 and was wind-powered. It was {{replaced}} in 1856 by the Dogdyke Pumping Station which was driven by steam, and later by diesel.|$|R

50|$|While the {{majority}} of the city's <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps</b> were able to be reactivated after the storm, some of the usually reliable pumps failed in 2006 due to corrosion. This was caused by wiring being submerged in the brackish water from Katrina.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 1900s, the {{invention}} of the steam shovel seemed to make it possible to commoditize and exploit much of the river lowlands, including Hennepin Lake and Hopper Lake.

Financial institutions lent money for levees, ditches, tile lines, and <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps.</b> [...] Soon the watery, muddy ground was remapped as arable cropland.|$|R
40|$|Pump {{stations}} prevent backwater {{effects from}} urban streams and safely drain rainwater in urban areas. Urbanization {{has increased the}} required capacity of centralized reservoirs and drainage pumps; yet, their respective designs {{are based on the}} runoff of the target watershed at the time of design. In Korea, additional pump stations are constructed to supplement the insufficient capacity of centralized reservoirs and <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps.</b> Two pump stations in the same drainage area share centralized reservoirs, and there are gates between them. Operation of the gates and <b>drainage</b> <b>pumps</b> is based on the water level in the connected centralized reservoirs. The convertible operation is based on changes in flow between two pump stations with different effluent streams in shared centralized reservoirs. Efficient distribution of inflow to both pump stations provides additional storage capacity in centralized reservoirs and rapid drainage. For a rainfall event in 2010, flooding volumes for current and convertible operations were 58, 750 and 7507 m 3, respectively. For an event in 2011, the corresponding figures were 3697 and 471 m 3. This shows that resilience increased by 0. 10829 and 0. 00756, respectively, for the two events. Accordingly, a new technique to operate multiple pump stations for reducing urban inundation is proposed...|$|R

The Sewage and Water Board recommended taller levees to protect the city from flooding on the lake side.|$|R
