The latest tool that the spatial scientist can use is the terrestrial laser scanner. Terrestrial laser scanners are the latest development in the spatial science industry. They are becoming more popular throughout the industry and new applications for their use are constantly being developed. One {{of the most popular}} applications is to remotely capture large amounts of data in a short space of time or from locations where it would be dangerous for a human to occupy. For clients to have confidence in the spatial science profession it needs to have a testing procedure that ensures instruments are measuring correctly. It is the purpose of this research project to conduct investigations into developing a <b>calibration</b> <b>range</b> and <b>calibration</b> procedure at the University of Southern Queensland. There are many design criteria that need to be considered when developing a <b>calibration</b> <b>range.</b> The first major criteria are to have targets located at high and low vertical angles for accurate estimation of the collimation axis error and a vertical angle correction. Having targets in a 360 degree circle around each scanner station is the second design criteria, which is used to calculate a horizontal angle correction. For the calculation of the scale error, multiple distance ranges are required. Finally at least two (2) scanner stations {{are required to}} be able to perform the calibration. This project will develop a <b>calibration</b> <b>range</b> at USQ {{that can be used to}} estimate corrections to TLS instruments. The results of this project have found appropriate station geometry that can be used for the calibration of terrestrial laser scanners.
