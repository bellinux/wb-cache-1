5000|$|The UK Wireless World {{magazine}} of March 1970 published a detailed Capacitor-discharge Ignition system as an electronic hobby build project by R.M. Marston. The circuit {{of this system}} {{was similar to the}} Winterburn patent in that it used a push-pull converted switch mode oscillator for energy transfer to a store - discharge capacitor and conventional contact breakers to initiate a thyristor triggering discharge of the charged CD capacitor. It was stated to offer several advantages over <b>conventional</b> <b>ignition.</b> Among which: better combustion, easy starting even under subzero conditions, immunity to contactor (points) bounce and 2% - 5% fuel economy. Subsequent letters to Wireless World ( [...] March & May 1970), with Mr. Marston’s replies, further discussed aspects of the design and build. In July 1971 Mr. A.P. Harris, undergraduate of the City University London made a detailed electrical engineering analysis of the Marston design as well as automotive engine measurement trials to verify fuel economy. These confirmed the benefits of the CD ignition system. However, he found that the core ingredient of the CD design rested on careful hand winding of the switch mode transformer and appropriate selection of oscillator transistors and choice of oscillator frequency.|$|E
40|$|Flame {{ignition}} by short-duration (≈ 50 ns) transient plasma, or corona, discharges {{was investigated}} for methane-air, propane-air and butane-air mixtures at atmospheric and elevated pressures. Such discharges produce a larger fraction of high-energy electrons, yield more spatially distributed energy and deposit {{energy in the}} gas more efficiently than conventional arc discharges do. We show that compared to <b>conventional</b> arc <b>ignition,</b> flames ignited by transient discharges yield significantly shorter (typically {{by a factor of}} 3) ignition delay and burn times. The major advantage of coronas was found to be the spatial distribution of ignition sites and more efficient use of wall-plug energy. Experimental evidence suggests that chemical effects of the ionized species and radicals generated are apparently minor. The observed effects of discharge energy, equivalence ratio, pressure and fuel type on ignition delay and burn times can all be explained using a simple mechanistic model that considers the spatial distribution of streamers and a hypothesized minimum streamer ignition energy that is analogous to the <b>conventional</b> minimum <b>ignition</b> energy.

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} Closed access. Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) uses the {{internal}} {{energy of the}} compressed charge to auto-ignite the mixture. Using internal exhaust gas re-circulation (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next. Although the emission and fuel economy can be largely improved, the engine power output is limited to part-load conditions only. At high-load, <b>conventional</b> Spark <b>Ignition</b> (SI) is required.

50|$|Though the Mk II has a {{familiar}} look, every {{panel on the}} new car was changed from the previous model. New safety requirements resulted in the overall length increasing by 60 mm, the front end raised and the indicators being repositioned inside the headlight housings. The headlights themselves are now fixed to the front quarter panels rather than being integrated with the bonnet, {{so that they are}} not raised up with it when the bonnet opens. The car has a restyled grille and larger rear light clusters. The Cooper S retains the bonnet scoop in order to keep an association with the outgoing model — although the relocation of the intercooler {{to the front of the}} engine means that the scoop is now purely decorative. In addition, the Cooper S no longer has the battery located under the boot floor, instead being found in the more conventional location under the bonnet. The C-pillars are no longer encased in glass and have been shaped to improve aerodynamics and to reduce the tendency for dirt to accumulate on the back of the car. Much criticised for the lack of rear legroom, Mini added more space for rear passengers by creating sculpted cut-outs in the rear of the front seats.
