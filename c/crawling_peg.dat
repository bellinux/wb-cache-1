25|$|While chronic {{budget deficits}} (exacerbated during the {{dictatorship}} by growing tax evasion and military spending) accounted for around half the new debt, the remainder originated in banking deregulation enacted in 1977 {{and in a}} <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> enacted in 1978 that by 1980 made the peso {{one of the most}} overvalued currencies in the world. At least US$20 billion borrowed by private parties from foreign banks in just two years were wired to offshore banks by 1981, around US$15 billion of which was absorbed into the public debt the following year. The total cost of these bailouts rose to US$23 billion {{by the time they were}} curtailed in 1985. These costs included bailouts for two firms in which Martínez de Hoz was the chief shareholder: the insolvent CIADE electric utility (US$395 million) and steel maker Acindar (US$649 million).

50|$|Every {{currency}} area must decide {{what type of}} exchange rate arrangement to maintain. Between permanently fixed and completely flexible however, are heterogeneous approaches. They have different implications for {{the extent to which}} national authorities participate in foreign exchange markets. According to their degree of flexibility, post-Bretton Woods-exchange rate regimes are arranged into three categories: currency unions, dollarized regimes, currency boards and conventional currency pegs are described as “fixed-rate regimes”; Horizontal bands, <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs</b> and <b>crawling</b> bands are grouped into “intermediate regimes”; Managed and independent floats are described as flexible regimes.All monetary regimes except for the permanently fixed regime experience the time inconsistency problem and exchange rate volatility, albeit to different degrees.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{exchange rate}} rules in {{their role as}} macroeconomic instruments. Two quite different approaches are pursued. The traditional view is that exchange rate flexibility is a substitute for money wage flexibility so that managed money and managed exchange rates yield the necessary instruments for internal and external balance. An entirely different perspective is offered by the modern macro-economics of wage contracting and the long run trade-off between the stability of output and the stability of inflation. In this context it is shown that exchange rate policies that seek to maintain real exchange rates or competitiveness do stabilize output but do so {{at the cost of}} in-creased inflation instability. Exchange rate rules such as full purchasing power parity <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs</b> are the analogue of full monetary accommodation of price disturbances. ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> {{attempts}} to combine flexibility and stability using a rule-based system for gradually altering the currency's par value, [...] typically at a predetermined rate or {{as a function}} of inflation differentials. A <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> is similar to a fixed peg, however it can be adjusted based on clearly defined rules. Often used by (initially) high-inflation countries or developing nations who peg to low inflation countries in attempt to avoid currency appreciation. [...] At the margin a <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> provides a target for speculative attacks. Among variants of fixed exchange rates, it imposes the least restrictions, and may hence yield the smallest credibility benefits.

40|$|The {{series of}} crises that have {{affected}} emerging markets {{in recent years}} have reopened the debate on the most appropriate exchange regime for an emergent economy. In particular, all countries that experienced severe crises in the 1990 s had some sort of fixed exchange rate regime, the majority of them falling in the categories that Corden (2002) calls the fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate regime (FBAR) and in- between regimes of the pegged (including flexible and <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs)</b> and target zone types. As a result, in recent years countries have been emigrating to a corner solution: a credible fixed regime or a floating regime with a monetary anchor. Within the latter categories, the increasingly used monetary regime is the inflation targeting one. The paper discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} alternative exchange rate regimes and ends with a discussion of the possibility of dollarization in the Americas. ...|$|R

This changed markedly in 2014. On March 17, 2014, the PBC expanded the floating {{band of the}} {{exchange rate}} of RMB against US dollar on the foreign exchange market from 1 to 2  %, i.e., on every trading day on the inter-bank spot market, the trading prices of RMB against US dollar will fluctuate within a band of ± 2  % below and above the central parity as released by the CFETS on that day. The exchange rate of RMB against US dollar first depreciated then appreciated before depreciated again, moving in an N-shape, with a spread of 1481 basis points between the peak and trough.

40|$|A {{series of}} major {{international}} financial crises in the 1990 s, {{and the recent}} introduction of the euro, have renewed interest in alternative exchange rate systems.

This article examines the evolution of exchange rate regimes in emerging markets {{over the past decade}} and compares {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the various available systems. These include intermediate regimes, such as the adjustable pegged exchange rate popular throughout much of the post-war period, and the two extreme exchange rate regimes: permanently fixed or freely floating exchange rate regimes.

It shows that deeper monetary integration requires more fiscal discipline, especially if price stability is an objective; these monetary arrangements cannot be achieved by monetary policy alone, as conventional wisdom would seem to suggest. A particularly striking result is that a currency peg is simply not sustainable if fiscal surpluses are determined by an exogenous political process; maintenance of a fixed currency peg requires the government to guarantee fiscal solvency for any equilibrium sequence of prices (which Woodford calls a Ricardian Regime). Interestingly, the debt and deficit constraints that were written into the Maastricht Treaty, and will continue in the Stability Pact after EMU, are examples of the fiscal discipline that is required.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} some prescriptions {{that are}} currently popular regarding exchange rate regimes: a general movement toward floating, a general movement toward fixing, or a general movement toward either extreme {{and away from the}} middle. The whole spectrum from fixed to floating is covered (including basket <b>pegs,</b> <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs,</b> and bands), with special attention to currency boards and dollarization. One overall theme is that the appropriate exchange rate regime varies depending on the specific circumstances of the country in question (which includes the classic optimum currency area criteria, as well as some newer criteria related to credibility) and depending on the circumstances of the time period in question (which includes the problem of successful exit strategies). Latin American interest rates are seen to be more sensitive to US interest rates when the country has a loose dollar peg than when it has a tight peg. It is also argued that such relevant country characteristics as income correlations and openness can vary over time, and that the optimum currency area criterion is accordingly endogenous. ...|$|R

For instance, Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, p. 74) state “ … there is little, if any, comfortable middle ground between floating rates and the adoption of a common currency. ” Hence, in their view, in the future we will see a disappearance of the middle ground that corresponds to soft commitments to some sort of exchange rate regime—adjustable <b>pegs,</b> <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs,</b> or bands, and perhaps also managed floating.

40|$|Most {{countries}} which have experienced exchange rate crises {{over the last}} two decades have been under soft <b>pegs</b> or <b>crawls.</b> These exchange rate arrangements have normally succumbed in the face of massive capital inflow reversals [...] especially in developing countries [...] thus provoking a search for options. Hard pegs and floating regimes seem to be the only viable options. This paper carries through an empirical analysis with panel data to study the relationship between the option of exchange rate regime and macroeconomic performance in developing countries. We use an extended and updated database to study the evidence for 154 countries over the period 1974 - 2004. Performance is measured by per capita GDP growth and its volatility. Our results show that floating rates tend to present higher levels of growth and lower levels of volatility in relation to other exchange rate arrangements. Intermediate regimes (soft and <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs),</b> on the other hand, score at the bottom of the growth rankings, while hard pegs appear to induce the largest growth volatility. In light of these results, it should not come as a surprise that the world is not moving to a single global currency, as some have predicted. The world is moving to fewer currencies, but at an extremely slow pace. Yet, floating rates will probably remain the most popular form of exchange rate regime over the next half century. This paper provides some basis for that popularity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{exchange}} rate of Rp/USD has experienced three regimes since 1967 : fixed, managed float, and free float. During {{the period of}} 1967 – 1986, Rp/USD was devalued for 8 times by the authority to help maintain the external balance. The devaluations {{were part of the}} expenditure switching policy and moreover, were then considered the right policy to correct the misalignment of the Rp/USD real {{exchange rate}}. However it became clear that such approach to quell the Rp/USD real exchange rate misalignment always failed later on due to the inflation. After 1986, the Indonesian authority switched the exchange regime to the managed float, when the <b>crawling</b> <b>pegged</b> intervention band was set and adjusted {{from time to time to}} keep the real exchange rate healthy.

40|$|Credibility and {{transparency}} {{are at the}} core of the current debate about exchange rate regimes. The steady growth in the magnitude and variability of international capital flows has complicated the question of whether to use floating, fixed, or intermediate exchange rate regimes. Emerging market economies are abandoning basket <b>pegs,</b> <b>crawling</b> <b>pegs,</b> bands, adjustable pegs, and various combinations of these. One of several reasons intermediate regimes have fallen out of favor is that they are not transparent; it is very difficult to verify them. Verifiability is a concrete example of the principle of"transparency"so often invoked in discussions of the new international financial architecture but so seldom made precise. A simple peg or a simple float may be easier for market participants to verify than a more complicated intermediate regime. The authors investigate how difficult it is for investors to verify from observable data whether the authorities are in fact following the exchange rate regime they claim to be following. Of the various intermediate regimes, they focus on basket pegs with bands. Statistically, it can take a surprisingly long span of data for an econometrician or investor to verify whether such a regime is actually in operation. The authors find that verification becomes more difficult as the regime's bands widen or more currencies enter the basket peg. At the other extreme, they also analyze regimes described as the regime's bands widen or more currencies enter the basket peg. At the other extreme, they also analyze regimes described as free floating and find that in some cases the observed exchange rate data do validate the announced regime.

40|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing debate on the {{appropriate}} exchange rate policy in developing countries. Frankel (2000) considers the range from currency unions through a whole intermediate spectrum of pre-determined <b>crawls</b> and <b>pegs</b> to free floats.
