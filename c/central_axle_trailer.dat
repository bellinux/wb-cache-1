50|$|Geared {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for power, not for speed, and were popular with logging companies {{who had to}} move heavy trains up and down grades safely. Four types of logging locomotives were utilized {{in the early twentieth}} century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which actuate rods attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of actuating rods for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with a crown gear. The Heisler configured geared-locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a <b>central</b> <b>axle.</b> This <b>central</b> <b>axle</b> was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the logging locomotives is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a <b>central</b> <b>axle,</b> thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Bill Crealock {{designed}} the longest, lightest, trailerable Masthead ketch sailboat ever built, the Clipper Marine 32 Aft Cabin Ketch coastal diesel cruiser racer. About 100 of these sailboats {{were built in}} 1975 and 76, and many still sail {{the waters of the}} world today. CM32's had an 8-foot beam and 4,500 displament, were supplied with a two or three <b>axle</b> <b>trailer</b> that could be pulled by the family vehicle, put his design in the record books. A heavier displacement blue water CM32 was also built, and was also trailerable, sold in an aft cockpit single mast sloop. A smaller designed CM 30, a 30-foot motorsailor was also offered.|$|R

50|$|A {{tandem axle}} {{is a group}} of two or more axles {{situated}} close together. Truck designs use such a configuration to provide a greater weight capacity than a single <b>axle.</b> Semi <b>trailers</b> usually have a tandem axle at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Larger water wheels (usually {{overshot}} steel wheels) {{transmit the}} power from a toothed annular ring that is mounted near {{the outer edge}} of the wheel. This drives the machinery using a spur gear mounted on a shaft rather than taking power from the <b>central</b> <b>axle.</b> However, the basic mode of operation remains the same; gravity drives machinery through the motion of flowing water.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{study is}} {{reported}} on a two lane in-service pre-stressed concrete bridge having susceptible vibrations under service traffic conditions. The bridge was 1300 ft long with thirteen simple pre- cast post tensioned spans resting on in-situ bridge piers. The client reported significant vibrations under service loads and requested a solution. The bridge {{did not have a}} top wearing surface. Bridge design drawings were provided. The methodology of health assessment included the visual inspection followed by analysis with the help of drawings provided by the client. The records of concrete strengths along with prestressing protocols were missing. The static and dynamic bridge response using static and moving three different loaded vehicles (over loaded tractor trolley, unloaded 5 <b>Axle</b> vehicle loaded <b>trailer</b> and loaded 5 <b>axle</b> <b>trailers)</b> was monitored. Core samples from the bridge deck were taken. NDT, Digital half-cell and electrical resistivity readings were taken at various locations of bridge. The results indicated some design inadequacies, faulty construction methodologies, improper maintenance and lack of awareness even by the professionals to deal with such structures. The remedial measures were suggested in terms of strengthening and maintenance of bridge...|$|R
50|$|The Palace Theater, {{the oldest}} {{preserved}} palace theatre in Europe, was built {{during the reign}} of Duke Eberhard Louis but received its machinery in 1758, {{during the reign of}} Duke Charles Eugene. The single <b>central</b> <b>axle</b> underneath the stage, designed by Johann Christian Keim, allowed a single person to control the entire stage set, allowing for very speedy transitions that astounded visitors. The Theater had its first performance on 23 May 1758.|$|R
50|$|The 2-10-0's main {{advantage}} {{was that}} {{five out of}} six of its axles were powered, meaning almost all the weight was available for traction rather than being distributed over pilot and trailing wheels. The long rigid wheelbase caused problems on tightly curved track, so blind drivers were the norm, either on the <b>central</b> <b>axle,</b> and/or on the second and/or fourth axles. Often lateral motion devices were attached to the leading drive axle.|$|R

50|$|Denmark and Norway allow 25.25 m trucks (Denmark from 2008, and Norway from 2008 on {{selected}} routes). In Sweden the allowed length has been 24 m since 1967. Before that, the maximum length was unlimited; the only limitations were on axle load. What stopped Sweden from adopting {{the same rules}} {{as the rest of}} Europe, when securing road safety, was the national importance of a competitive forestry industry. Finland, with the same road safety issues and equally important forestry industry, followed suit. The change made trucks able to carry three stacks of cut-to-length logs instead of two, as it would be in a short combination. They have one on stack together with a crane on the 6×4 truck, and two additional stacks on a four <b>axle</b> <b>trailer.</b> The allowed gross weight in both countries is up to 60 tonnes depending on the distance between the first and last axle.|$|R
