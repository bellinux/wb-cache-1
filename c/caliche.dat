5|$|Iodine is {{the least}} {{abundant}} of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46parts per million of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544ppm, chlorine 126ppm, bromine 2.5ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance. Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include lautarite, Ca(IO3)2, and dietzeite, 7Ca(IO3)2·8CaCrO4. These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the <b>caliche,</b> found in Chile, whose main product is sodium nitrate. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium iodate is extracted from the <b>caliche</b> and reduced to iodide by sodium bisulfite. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|E

Nemegt sediments preserve floodplains, large river channels and soil deposits, but <b>caliche</b> deposits indicate periodic droughts. This environment supported a more diverse and generally larger dinosaur fauna than in earlier times. Kurzanov reported that other theropods, including Tarbosaurus, ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs were discovered at the same locality, but these remains have never been reported in detail. If the Nogon Tsav fauna {{was similar to that}} of the Nemegt Formation, troodontid theropods, as well as pachycephalosaurs, ankylosaurids and hadrosaurs would also have been present.

5|$|The three known Deinocheirus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of a far more humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations.

5|$|The <b>caliche</b> was {{the main}} source of iodine in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (which is no longer an economically viable source), but in the late 20th century brines emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to evaporate the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{recharge}} water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of <b>caliche</b> that is practically impermeable; this limits {{the amount of water}} able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with <b>caliche,</b> making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the <b>caliche</b> is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of <b>caliche</b> in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.|$|E
40|$|The {{carbonate}} encrusting {{process and}} its consequent products (crusts, tufa and travertine) {{in the southern}} Morocco (Ouarzazate) are studied in this thesis. A detailed inventory of the carbonate deposits is given. The dynamic aspects of carbonate precipitation and dissolution are considered from an environmental point of view. The main factors influencing their genesis are discussed {{on the basis of}} a multidisciplinary investigation. Among the accumulated carbonates, <b>caliches</b> are the most abundant. Their genesis invokes a changing environment where sedimentation has the same importance as the biogenic and pedogenic processes. Dated by the Uranium/Thorium method, these <b>caliches</b> are older than 300 ka. They indicate that the encrusting process is ancient. These deposits have become progressively rare during the Quaternary period except for the important hydrothermal travertine of Skoura. Only a few accumulations are still forming nowadays (Ait Arbi and Ifesfas). Their absence in present day water, especially in rivers is interpreted as indicating an environmental change. It is hypothesised that a desequilibrium affects the incrusting process. A comparative study between rivers and sources in different settings is carried out. The saturation degree of water, its chemical composition, especially in elements that may have particular origins (potassium, nitrate, sulfate, etc.) and its bacteriological characteristics are investigated in the thesis. Results seem to indicate that differences exist between the calcite - precipitating waters of some sources (not affected by human activities) and the sterile waters of rivers (Dades and M'goun). The latter are polluted by chemical fertilizers or turbulent, such that no carbonate deposits are permitted. The conclusion is that the reduced incrusting phenomena indicate an environmental change. A progressively drier climate and progressively reduced discharge make the deposits more limited in space and rare. The human impact on the quality of water must be considered to explain the limited extend of present day encrusting processes...|$|R

30|$|Located {{amidst a}} human {{inhabited}} and agricultural landscape, KNP {{is likely to}} be affected by the agriculture practices in the surroundings. The soil in the area is alkaline and lack essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Fertilizers (urea and di-ammonium phosphate) meet these requirements. The prescribed usage of N fertilizer in the crop is 80  kg/ha (Parihar 2004). An increase in production was seen when 70 – 80  kg/ha the fertilizer is applied. While the higher application of N fertilizer increased crop production from 1999 to 2000, it resulted in a reduction in 2007 and 2008. Sneva (1977) reported that addition of N-fertilizer above 56  kg/ha leads to a buildup of NO 3 -N just above the cemented <b>caliches</b> layer that significantly increases the residues in the subsurface soil and deeper horizons in the soil profile. This prevents proper drainage in the soil because rainfall in the area is low for notable leaching and evacuation, and the presence of an impervious layer would further reduce it. Accumulation of NO 3 -N at a depth below the primary rooting zone would lead to restricting the supply of N to plants (Sneva, 1977), reducing crop productivity. The reduction of productivity in later years seen in the area would be perhaps for these reasons.|$|R

40|$|The Campumari-Coremò succession, {{at least}} 50 m thick, {{starts with the}} «Rio Is Corras Formation», a lithostratigraphic unit {{consisting}} of alternations of conglomerates and dolomites and rare sandstones with <b>caliches,</b> reddish siltites and argillaceous siltites. These deposits are transgressive and discordant over the folded Hercynian basement, which is irregularly cut by erosion channels. The lithotypes described show abrupt lateral facies changes. The abundance of the carbonate sediments increases towards the south, thus suggesting the provenance direction of the transgressive sediments. Sediment deposition probably occurred in variable environments, ranging alternatively from alluvial fan-delta to restricted carbonate (lagoonal?-coastal?) lake, with frequent emersions related to fluctuations of the base level. The consequent oscillation of the water table {{may be one of}} the possible causes of dolomitization and calcretization of carbonate sediments, together with variations of temperature and salinity under a dry-hot climate with sporadic hard rainfall episodes. In some of the calcretes, Characeae remains have been found, testifying to the former subaqueous (brackish?) depositional environment of the calcretized sediments. In its lower part, the Riu Is Corras Formation is also crossed by thin veins containing barite and sulfides. These features, together with sedimentological characters and facies analogues, suggest an age older than previously supposed and connected with the late-post Hercynian (Permian) hydrothermal circulation. The Rio Is Corras Formation shows a maximum thickness of 23 - 24 m at the west side of the Riu Is Corras valley: it can be dated as Permo?-Triassic, but its age cannot yet be better defined. Upwards, the carbonate-bearing «Campumari Fm. » follows after an unconformity. The «Campumari Formation» begins with the «Su Passu Malu Member», consisting initially of thin marly-clayey greenish sediments, locally rich in plant debris and containing an Upper Anisian (Pelsonian/Illyrian) palynomorph association. A thin horizon of dark, fetid dolostones rich in former sulfate nodules with chickenwire structure follows and is abruptly overlain by a succession consisting of about 15 m of yellowish, finely stratified, marly dolostones to dolostones, also rich in sulfate pseudomorphs with chert nodules. The main feature of the latter deposit is the gradually increased folding towards the top, caused probably by diagenetic deformation of the evaporite layers. Close to the upper boundary of the laminated dolomites, the folded structures pass to chaotic breccias, some of which appear very similar to typical «tepee» deposits. Mud-cracks and ripple marks have also been locally observed. The «Su Grifoneddu de S’Acqua Member» is the last member of the Campumari Fm. It starts with a thick collapse breccia made of angular clasts of dark limestone embedded in a carbonate matrix, locally containing pseudomorphs after sulfates. These breccias are overlain by grey dolostones, at first thick but subsequently well-stratified. Some horizons are characterized by pseudomorphs either after either gypsum or anhydrite, while others contain unclassifiable bioclasts and are bioturbated, this occurring mostly at the top of the dolomitic succession. The Campumari Fm. is transgressive over a substrate constituted by the Is Corras Formation: at Su Grifoneddu de S’Acqua it has a maximum thickness of 26 m. This formation was deposited initially in an ephemeral, low-energy, reducing lagoon with local clastic supply, that quickly evolved first to a restricted, frequently hypersaline carbonate environment (with subordinated sabkha episodes), and later to a carbonate platform environment fluctuating from strongly to weakly hypersaline. Both the absence of continuous, major barriers and the lack of significant slump deposits, as well as the gradual passage from shallow to deeper deposits, point to a ramp depositional model. In more detail, the Campumari-Coremò succession can have been deposited in a carbonate ramp environment, passing from a lagoonal substage, with restricted episodes at the beginning, to an inner ramp and then to shallow ramp subenvironments...|$|R

We will make all 17 stops if the weather is reasonably good and the roads are passable. On the first day, April 29, we will try to get to stops 1 – 5, the more distal parts of the Ogallala and younger deposits in Nebraska. On April 30, we will try to visit stops 6 – 9. Stops 10 – 15, in areas closer to the sediment sources of the Ogallala and some of the younger units, will be examined on May 1. Stops 16 – 17 will be made on our return trip to Lincoln. Stop 1. Todd Valley. Our first stop will be north of North Bend, Nebraska, {{on the surface of the}} Todd Valley fill to see some of the Quaternary geomorphology of eastern Nebraska and to review some aspects of Quaternary stratigraphy in the eastern part of the state. Stop 2. Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park. This is one of the truly extraordinary mammalian vertebrate fossil localities in North America. Stop 3. Long Pine Formation. Skinner and Hibbard (1972) described the units in this area and originally placed them in the early Pleistocene. The Keirn, Long Pine, Duffy, and Pettijohn formations have subsequently been placed in the Pliocene and are equivalent in age to the Broadwater Formation of western Nebraska. Stop 4. Valentine Formation. This is a short stop to see some of the sands of the Valentine Formation and the Niobrara River valley. Stop 5. Valentine and Ash Hollow formations. Skinner and Johnson (1984) subdivided these formations into a number of members, some of which can be seen exposed in road cuts and natural exposures northeast of the city of Valentine, Nebraska. Stop 6. Snake River Falls. The geologic section exposed here was illustrated and described by Skinner and Johnson. Part of the Caprock Formation of the Ash Hollow forms the resistant ledge over which the Snake River falls. Stop 7. Box Butte Tablelands, Niobrara Valley, and Pine Ridge. Swinehart and others (1985) have described the stratigraphy of this area in general and have placed in the Ogallala Group several units previously included by some workers in the Hemingford Group.

Çalışma alanı 1 / 25. 000 ölçekli topoğrafik haritada Kahramanmaraş L 37 b 3; L 38 a 4 paftaları içinde yer almaktadır. Bu çalışma büro ve arazi çalışmaları olarak 2 aşamada gerçekleştirilmiştir. İlk aşamada bölge hakkında ayrıntılı bir çalışma yapmak amacıyla literatür araştırması yapılmış, ilgili tezler ve raporlar incelenmiş; saha hakkında bilgiler derlenmiştir. Jeoloji haritası olarak arazide Staesche (1972) 'nin haritası kullanılmış ve araziden elde edilen veriler ile harita revize edilmiştir. Sahada ki jeolojik birimler temelden üste doğru incelenmiş; Temel kayaçlar, Mesozoyik karbonatlı kayaçlar, Neojen gölsel çökeller ve Kuvaterner birimler olarak ayrılarak sıralanmışlardır. Bu birimlerin içerisinde ise özellikle Kuvaterner birimler üzerinde durulmuştur ve bu birim kendi içerisinde sahada ki gözlemlere dayanarak akarsu çökelleri, alüvyal yelpaze, taşkın düzlükleri, taraçalar ve kalişler olarak ayrılmıştır. Heyelanlara birçok kaynakta en büyük sebep olarak su gösterilmektedir. Gerek yağışlar gerek akarsular, dereler, kaynaklar ve yeraltı suları ele alınmıştır. Devlet Meteoroloji İşleri'nden alınan 18 yıllık yağmur verileri incelenmiş, ortalamaları ve eklenik sapma değerleri hesaplanmış ve grafiğe dökülerek yorumlanmıştır. Kurak ve yağışlı dönemler belirlenmiştir ve içinde bulunduğumuz dönemin yağışlı dönem olduğu sonucuna varılmıştır. Ortamdaki jeolojik birimler suyu iletebilme özelliklerine göre geçirimsiz, yarı geçirimli ve geçirimli birimler olarak 3 'e ayrılmış, yaşanan heyelan hadiselerine olası etkileri tartışılmıştır. Çalışmanın asıl amacı olan Çöllolar Açık İşletmesi'nin heyelanlar üzerine yorum yapmadan önce heyelan üzerine yapılan çalışmalar araştırılmış, birçok bilim insanının yaptığı sınıflamalar tez içerisinde sıralanmıştır. Çalışma alanında ki heyelanlar arazi çalışmalarında incelenmiş, fotoğrafları alınmış, litolojik özellikleri belirlenmeye çalışılmış ve hareketin şekli ortaya konulmaya çalışılmıştır. Arazi çalışmalarından elde edilen bulgular ve gözlemlere dayalı olarak yapılan değerlendirmeler, batı şevlerinde meydana gelen heyelanın yenilme mekanizmasının progresif kayma modeline uygun olduğunu göstermektedir. Doğu şevlerinde meydana gelen heyelanın yenilme mekanizmasının ise oldukça karmaşık bir yapıda olduğu o kaymanında progresif kayma şeklinde gözlendiği söylenebilir. Bu kayma, birleşik iki kayma yüzeyi üzerinde makaslama yenilmesine bağlı olarak meydana gelmiş olmalıdır. Kaymanın 1. yüzeyini (tabandaki yüzey) killerle geçişli kömür seviyesi, 2. yüzeyini (arka yüzey) ise süreksizlikler oluşturmaktadır. Büyük olasılıkla tabandaki kayma yüzeyinin üzerinde bulunan yeraltı suyu ve tabandaki 1. kayma yüzeyini oluşturan malzemelerin zayıf dayanımına sahip olmaları şevlerdeki heyelanı meydana getiren ana faktörler olmalıdır. Mechanism causing {{landslides}} hit between 6 and 10 February 2011 {{were studied}} to clarify in thesis prepared as Master of Science (M.

Study area {{is located in}} Kahramanmaraş L 37 b 3; L 38 a 4 map sections of 1 / 25. 000 scale topographic maps. This study was carried out as office and field work in 2 phases. In the first phase, the literature survey was carried out {{so as to make}} a detailed study about the area, related theses and reports were examined, information about the field was compiled. In the second phase to made the field work by going to land, landslides examined, lithology, slope angle, the region's rainfall, underground and surface water of the predisposing factors causing landslides are examined. Photographed the landslide area. For the obtain strike and dip of the layers of landslide area outside and inside was measured. In the field compass for geologists, geologists hummer, and GPS are used. Staesche (1972) map was used as geological map and data obtained from the field was revised. The geological map which was revised drawn on the computer again and the value of direction and inclination of layers was measured marked on the geological map. However, discontinuities was observed in the geological units marked on the map. In addition to, terraces which can carry water marked to on the map. During the field study, the drilling data from borehole logs made from MTA and EÜAŞ used for the ensuring thickness of coal and other geological units. These borehole logs are made by MTA for determining the the coal mine evaluation. In this study, three of borehole logs are used which are selected close to the mine. In the first, a literature review was carried out about the basin. Then the study area is a coal basin, research is concentrated on coal basins. As a result of this research there are two ways in which class of coal basin that have been found. The first of these types of is according to the environment where the sediments basins. The second is the According {{to the development of the}} shape of the basin and coal basins. According to this informations Afşin-Elbistan coal basin is limnic and asymetric foredeep basin. In this study, the geological units have been approached with informations taken from previous studies. To naming of geological units are avoided from previous studies. Geological units in the field were examined from bottom to top; by separating basement rocks, Mesozoic carbonate rocks, Neogene lacustrine sediments and Quaternary as units were sorted. Among these units, it was particularly focused on the Quaternary units and this unit in itself was separated into the fluvial deposits, alluvial fans, flood plains, terraces and <b>caliches</b> based on observations in the field. Stratigraphic column section of geolocic units are drawn. On this stratigraphic column section is painted with the same color of geological map which used in this study. In addition to divergent between in geological units are shown in this stratigraphic column section. Afşin Elbistan basin is a region that has been exposed quite a lot of tectonic effects. For his reason, this tectonic effects shaped to basin are interpreted. For this purpose, structural features of geological units researched in both litearture survey and in the field. As a result of this researches, it has Watercourse) been found that the Hurman faultline (analogous with Hurman river) narrows the pit field from east and Kışlaköy Faults narrows the pit field from West. Location of these faultlines are marked on the geological transverse section this locations obtained from Staesche (1972). In addition, these geological transverse section are drawn on the computer. Water is shown as the biggest reason of landslides in many sources. As the presence of water in the field, precipitation, streams, creek, springs and groundwater sources are considered. 18 years of rain data received from Turkish State Meteorological Service; mean and cumulative deviations were calculated, graphed and interpreted. Dry and wet periods were determined and it was concluded that the period we are in is the rainy period. Geological units were separated into 3 as impermeable, semi-permeable and permeable; potential impacts on landslides occurred were discussed. Before Çöllolar, the main aim of the study, made comments, the studies conducted on landslides were investigated and classifications made by many scientists were listed in the thesis. Landslides in the study area were examined in the field studies, their photographs were taken and lithological features were tried to be determined and shape of the movement was tried to be revealed. During these researches, especially focused on the progressive landslides and this type of landslides whether suitable to Çöllolar open pit or not was tried to observe in the field. Additionally, in this study, prevention of landslides are takes place too, precuation from landslides was expressed. Assessments based on the findings and observations obtained from area studies have showed that landslides occurred in the western slope are suitable for failure mechanism of the progressive model shift. Landslides occured in the western slope was drawn on the computer with the drawing program and shown the estimated sliding surface. The failure mechanisms of the landslides occurred in eastern slope is quite a complex structure and firstly it can be said that it is in the shape of annular slip based on progressive slide and superficial findings and observations. Landslides occured in the eastern slope was drawn on the computer with the drawing program and shown the estimated sliding surface like other western slope. Progressive slip should be occurred on the combined two slide surfaces depending on shear failure. Permeable coal level with clay constitutes 1 st surface of slide (bottom surface) and discontinuities constitute 2 nd surface (back surface). Most likely, the groundwater on the slide surface on the base, the material forming 1 st slide surface having weak strength should be the main factors of landslides occurrence on the slope. Landslides occured in the Çöllolar open pit's slopes' lithological features shown below of same name of this title in this study and below of this title was indicated water carrying characteristics, thickness, spread features of these slopes' lithological units. The result of experiments conducted with landslide material which taken from slopes are given in this study. These results are internal friction angle, cohesion, unit weight and these results given in this study. Landslides type of the western and eastern slopes was found suitable for progressive landslide from result of literature survey and field work. Many research indicated that water is the main reason of landslides. Water is reason of landslides of the Çöllolar open cast mine,result of interaction with water entering the mine and geological units in the mine is concluded. Water of the Çöllolar open cast mine must be carried with Hurman river and terraces structures.

2500|$|The last {{significant}} area of Albuquerque geologically is the West Mesa: this is {{the elevated}} land west of the Rio Grande, including [...] "West Bluff", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west {{of most of the}} developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as [...] "blow sand", along with occasional clay and <b>caliche</b> and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.|$|E
2500|$|Below the foothills, {{the area}} usually called the [...] "Northeast Heights" [...] {{consists}} of a mix of clay and <b>caliche</b> soils, overlaying a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This bajada is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming {{the lower end of}} the Heights.|$|E
2500|$|The Ogallala {{formation}} is {{a wedge of}} sediments built up eastward of the Rocky Mountains as they were uplifted in the Miocene, with the consequent alluvial fans {{referred to as the}} [...] "Gangplank". [...] The Ogallala Aquifer is the main freshwater source for the region and consists of braided stream deposits filling in valleys during humid climatic conditions, followed by a sub-humid to arid climate and thick eolian (wind-blown) sand and silt. <b>Caliche</b> layers cap the Ogallala, which reflect today's arid conditions. Pleistocene rainfall over the flat terrain caused water to pond at the surface, resulting in a High Plains characteristic, innumerable round ponds called playa lakes.

50|$|<b>Caliche</b> beds {{can cause}} {{problems}} for agriculture. First, an impermeable <b>caliche</b> layer prevents water from draining properly, which can keep roots from getting enough oxygen. Salts can also {{build up in}} the soil {{due to the lack}} of drainage. Both of these situations are detrimental to plant growth. Second, the impermeable nature of <b>caliche</b> beds prevents plant roots from penetrating the bed, which limits the supply of nutrients, water, and space so they cannot develop normally. Third, <b>caliche</b> beds can also cause the surrounding soil to be basic. The basic soil, along with calcium carbonate from the <b>caliche,</b> can prevent plants from getting enough nutrients, especially iron. An iron deficiency makes the youngest leaves turn yellow. Soil saturation above the <b>caliche</b> bed can make the condition worse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caliche</b> {{remembers when}} he met El Flaco; being kidnapped by gunmen and where is locked in a laundry room, turned into a cage, where he meets El Flaco and befriends. That same night after taking the dishes and their droppings, El Flaco asks his two captors sicarios {{that allow them to}} walk him and <b>Caliche.</b> Hitmen after {{discussing}} between them allow both young go for a walk in addition to express his desire to kill them. The next day El Flaco tells <b>Caliche</b> is kidnapped being the son of a judge investigating the case of a gunman working for drug traffickers and after receiving multiple death threats, was later kidnapped reciting a poem by Porfirio Barba Jacob. <b>Caliche</b> for his part was kidnapped by former partners of his father who had refused to give them money for their war against the authorities, and <b>Caliche</b> knows her father has called for several gunmen to rescue him. These assassins arrive that night to where El Flaco and <b>Caliche</b> are kidnapped. The two assassins decide to kill El Flaco and let live <b>Caliche</b> who insists the life of his friend but he was locked gunmen and two shots are heard, <b>Caliche</b> believes they killed El Flaco but <b>Caliche</b> when released by the gunmen at the service of his father notes that El Flaco was alive and that the dead had been his two captors so <b>Caliche</b> accompanied by El Flaco and assassins leave the place.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>caliche</b> also {{forms in}} other ways. It can form when water rises through {{capillary}} action. In an arid region, rainwater sinks {{into the ground}} very quickly. Later, as the surface dries out, the water below the surface rises, carrying up dissolved minerals from lower layers. This water movement forms a <b>caliche</b> that tends to grow thinner and branch out as it nears the surface. Plants {{can contribute to the}} formation of <b>caliche,</b> as well. Plant roots take up water through transpiration, and leave behind the dissolved calcium carbonate, which precipitates to form <b>caliche.</b> It can also form on outcrops of porous rocks or in rock fissures where water is trapped and evaporates. In general, <b>caliche</b> deposition is a slow process, but if enough moisture is present in an otherwise arid site, it can accumulate fast enough to block a drain pipe.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large part}} of the [...] "Park's concrete" [...] mix was <b>caliche,</b> a thick deposit of gravelly clay that {{underlies}} Seguin. Usually the <b>caliche</b> was dug out on site, providing a basement level, as at Sebastopol. The <b>caliche</b> was then mixed with sand, lime made from nearby limestone deposits, and organic materials like straw or horsehair. The exterior walls were usually whitewashed, and the interiors often had woodwork or wainscoting of local walnut, oak or pecan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caliche</b> (the calcium {{carbonate}} mineral) {{is used in}} construction worldwide. Its reserves in the Llano Estacado in Texas {{can be used in}} the manufacture of Portland cement; the <b>caliche</b> meets the chemical composition requirements and {{has been used as a}} principal raw material in Portland cement production in at least one Texas plant. Where the {{calcium carbonate}} content is over 80%, <b>caliche</b> can also be fired and used as a source of lime, which can then be used for soil stabilization.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} for <b>Caliche</b> is an informal term for Salvadoran Spanish due to colloquialisms and unique indigenous lexical {{words that are}} different from Salvadoran Spanish. <b>Caliche</b> refers to the Nahuatl influenced dialect of Spanish spoken in El Salvador. Many words {{have gone through the}} process of deletion, vowel assimilation, or epenthesis {{to make it easier for}} the speaker to understand. Salvadorian <b>Caliche</b> is used across social classes, although professional individuals tend to avoid it because it is not considered [...] "proper" [...] Spanish.|$|E
50|$|When {{mixed with}} {{small amounts of}} either {{pozzolan}} or Portland cement, <b>caliche</b> {{can also be used}} as a building material that exceeds building code requirements for unfired masonry materials. For example, <b>caliche</b> was used to build some of the Mayan buildings in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. A dormitory in Ingram, Texas and a demonstration building in Carrizo Springs, Texas for the United States Department of Energy were also built using <b>caliche</b> as part of studies by the Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems.|$|E
5000|$|In {{northern}} Chile and Peru, <b>caliche</b> also {{refers to}} mineral deposits that include nitrate salts. [...] <b>Caliche</b> can also refer to various claylike deposits in Mexico and Colombia.
