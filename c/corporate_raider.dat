5|$|Wall Street is a 1987 American drama film, {{directed}} and co-written by Oliver Stone, which stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Daryl Hannah. The film {{tells the story}} of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young stockbroker who becomes involved with Gordon Gekko (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous <b>corporate</b> <b>raider.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stone {{made the}} film {{as a tribute to}} his father, Lou Stone, a {{stockbroker}} during the Great Depression. The character of Gekko {{is said to be a}} composite of several people, including Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, Michael Ovitz, Michael Milken, and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and <b>corporate</b> <b>raider</b> Sir James Goldsmith. Originally, the studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted Richard Gere, but Gere passed on the role.|$|E

5|$|Many of the <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> were onetime {{clients of}} Michael Milken, whose {{investment}} banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> could make a legitimate attempt {{to take over a}} company and provided high-yield debt financing of the buyouts.|$|R

40|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> {{are often}} {{associated}} with the 1980 s takeover wave that reshaped the U. S. corporate landscape. While during the 1980 s Europe remained relatively immune {{to this sort of}} investor, <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> have operated actively both in Continental Europe and in the U. K. since the mid- 1990 s. Yet these <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> are very different from the raiders that operated in the U. S. market during the 1980 s. Whatever the perspective adopted, even the 1990 s European <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> are a controversial group of investors. Their purchases were usually accompanied by a lot of rumors and speculations. The financial press sometimes described them as investors who were interested only in short-term profits. On the other hand, raiders were also praised as corporate governance champions who shook up European boardrooms as never before. <b>Corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> were key players in redefining corporate Europe during the 1990 s. Thus, first, it is natural to wonder whether these investors helped to improve the performance of their target firms or whether they simply extracted corporate resources to their advantage from these companies. Second, the investors who are labelled <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> are generally believed to have superior skills in spotting profitable investments. Finally, these raiders earned a reputation as troublemakers. As far as I know, this dissertation is the first attempt to examine the behavior of the particular investors called <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders.</b> This dissertation belongs to the growing body of literature exploring the market for partial corporate control in Europe. The contribution of the thesis is twofold. First, it provides new evidence concerning partial corporate control events in Europe. Second, it sheds some light on the question whether the investor's identity matters. I collected both short-run and long-run evidence relating to the firms in which the raiders announced their stockholding. On average, there is a positive market reaction to the first public announcement of stockholding of these investors in a company. Raiders earn an abnormal profit when they sell their stakes within one year of the initial purchase. Conversely, when raiders are still shareholders in a company on 31 December 2001 abnormal returns are significantly negative. There is no clear support for the hypothesis that raiders affect firm performances at accounting level. The Holderness and Sheehan (1985) hypotheses are not supported by the evidence. Evidence at individual investor level is provided as well...|$|R

25|$|As {{the area}} {{streetcar}} system, operated by Twin City Rapid Transit, was being dismantled {{in the early}} 1950s and replaced with diesel buses, Blumenfeld owned a 16% stake in the company. He was accused of allying himself with a <b>corporate</b> <b>raider,</b> using force to intimidate stockholders, and disposing of the scrap metal {{on the black market}} after their hostile takeover had succeeded. Some historians believe he held considerable responsibility for what happened, but when a federal court case years later led several executives from the company to go to prison, Blumenfeld was not convicted. What remained of Twin City Rapid Transit was taken over at the behest of Governor Orville Freeman by noted Minneapolitan Carl Pohlad in 1960.|$|E
25|$|These as well {{as other}} deals placed Pickens at the center of {{controversy}} during the 1980s. His celebrity rose so quickly after the Gulf Oil takeover bid that Time magazine put Pickens on the cover for the March 1985 issue. He briefly considered running for president in the 1988 elections. During this period, he was often characterized as a <b>corporate</b> <b>raider</b> and greenmailer. This {{is due to the fact}} that many of his deals were not completed, although Pickens and the shareholders he represented received substantial profits through the eventual sale of their stock as a result. His later takeover targets included Newmont Mining, a New York-based firm, Diamond Shamrock, and Koito Mfg., Ltd., a Japanese auto-parts manufacturer, making substantial gains in the process. He was also involved in the creation of the United Shareholders Association (USA), which from 1986–1993 attempted to influence the governance of several large companies. After nearly two years of periodic hearing and debate, in July 1998 the Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4–1 to approve a one-share, one-vote rule, a primary USA objective.|$|E

500|$|Weiser {{wrote the}} first draft, {{initially}} called Greed, with Stone writing another draft. Originally, the lead character was a young Jewish broker named Freddie Goldsmith, but Stone changed it to Bud Fox to avoid the stereotype that Wall Street was controlled by Jews. Reportedly, Gordon Gekko {{is said to be}} a composite of several people: Wall Street broker Owen Morrisey, an old friend of Stone's who was involved in a $20 million insider trading scandal in 1985, Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, <b>corporate</b> <b>raider</b> Carl Icahn, art collector Asher Edelman, agent Michael Ovitz, and Stone himself. For example, the [...] "Greed is good" [...] line was based on a speech by Boesky where he said, [...] "Greed is right".|$|E
50|$|Holmes à Court {{was one of}} the world's {{most feared}} <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> through the 1980s, having built his empire single-handedly from {{virtually}} nothing to a diversified resources and media group with an estimated worth prior to the 1987 stockmarket crash of about A$2 billion.

Boone Pickens, Harold Clark Simmons, Kirk Kerkorian, Sir James Goldsmith, Saul Steinberg and Asher Edelman. [...] Carl Icahn developed {{a reputation as a}} ruthless <b>corporate</b> <b>raider</b> after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985. [...] The result of that takeover was Icahn systematically selling TWA's assets to repay the debt he used to purchase the company, which was described as asset stripping. [...] In 1985, Pickens was profiled on the cover of Time magazine as [...] "one of the most famous and controversial businessmen in the U.S." [...] for his pursuit of Unocal, Gulf Oil and Cities Services. In later years, many of the corporate raiders would be re-characterized as [...] "Activist shareholders".|$|E
500|$|The {{personal}} {{lives of the}} protagonists begin to spiral out of control. Michael's increasingly erratic behaviour prompts his family to leave him, and when he becomes a movie producer at film studio Richards Majestic, he comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a self-made billionaire venture capitalist and <b>corporate</b> <b>raider</b> who vows revenge after his attempts {{to shut down the}} studio are thwarted by Michael and his lawyer dies in an accident. Franklin rescues his friend Lamar Davis from gangster and former friend Harold [...] "Stretch" [...] Joseph, who repeatedly attempts to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new brethren. Trevor's reckless efforts to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County see him waging war against [...] outlaw motorcycle club, several Latin American street gangs, rival meth dealers, hillbillies, private security firm Merryweather, and Triad kingpin Wei Cheng.|$|E
500|$|Management of {{many large}} {{publicly}} traded corporations reacted negatively {{to the threat}} of potential hostile takeover or corporate raid and pursued drastic defensive measures including poison pills, golden parachutes and increasing debt levels on the company's balance sheet. [...] Additionally, the threat of the corporate raid would lead to the practice of [...] "greenmail", where a <b>corporate</b> <b>raider</b> or other party would acquire a significant stake in the stock of a company and receive an incentive payment (effectively a bribe) from the company in order to avoid pursuing a hostile takeover of the company. [...] Greenmail represented a transfer payment from a company's existing shareholders to a third party investor and provided no value to existing shareholders but did benefit existing managers. [...] The practice of [...] "greenmail" [...] is not typically considered a tactic of private equity investors and is not condoned by market participants.|$|E
40|$|The term “corporate raiders” {{previously}} struck fear in {{the hearts}} of corporate boards and management teams. It generally refers to investors who target undervalued, cash-flush or mismanaged companies and initiate a hostile takeover of the company. <b>Corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> earned their name in part because of their focus on value extraction, which could entail dismantling a company and selling off its crown jewels. Today, the term often conjures up images of Michael Milken, Henry Kravis or the movie character Gordon Gekko, but the alleged threat posed to companies by <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> is less prevalent—at least with respect to the traditional use of equity to facilitate a hostile takeover. The growing use of debt rather than equity to cause a change of control at target companies raises new concerns for corporate boards and management teams and new policy considerations for commentators and legislators. Are activist debtholders who employ this investment strategy akin to the <b>corporate</b> <b>raiders</b> of the past? This Article explores these issues by, among other things, presenting in-depth case studies and critically evaluating the value implications of traditional takeover activity and regulation. It compares and contrasts the use of equity and debt in control contests and identifies similarities that suggest some regulation of strategic debt acquisitions is warranted. The Article proposes a proactive approach that better equips corporate boards and management teams to negotiate with activist debtholders while preserving investment opportunities for debtholders and the governance efficiencies that often flow from activism for the corporate target’s other stakeholders...|$|R
