We argue that these apparent <b>contradictions</b> <b>arose</b> because different models were used {{to interpret the results}} and because differences in false-alarm rates between groups biased the estimates provided by those models. A reanalysis of those studies with a dual-process signal-detection model that incorporates response bias revealed that amnesia led to a pronounced reduction in recollection and smaller but consistent reduction in familiarity. To test the assumptions of the model and to further assess recognition deficits in amnesics, we examined receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) in amnesics and controls. The ROCs of the controls were curved and asymmetrical, whereas those of the amnesics were curved and symmetrical. The results supported the predictions of the model and indicated that amnesia was associated with deficits in both recollection and familiarity...|$|E

In particular, the study material comes from Site 1409 (Hole A, B, C). During the preliminary phase of this investigation some <b>contradictions</b> <b>arose</b> from the relative positions detected for standard biohorizons in different Holes (B and C). We thus decided to spit our record by Holes to prove if these inconsistencies {{may be due to}} some mistakes in constructing mcd scale. In fact, this was the case and we eventually decided to propose an alternative depth, the proposed mcd (pmcd), to temporary overcome the problem. A medium to high resolution calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy is provided that results in precise biostratigraphic classification of the studied interval at Site 1409. This stratigraphic succession expands from late Paleocene to early Eocene, that is from Zone NP 9 to Zone NP 13 in term of NP calcareous nannofossil zonation (Martini, 1971). A detailed analysis of biostratigraphic results evidenced also the presence of two hiati, the first positioned {{at the base of the}} Eocene and the second lying in the upper part of the studied section, between the upper part of Zone NP 12 and the lower part of Zone NP 13...|$|E

Just as America 2 ̆ 7 s civil and governmental forces came together during the imperial tours, in 1954 and 1975 respectively, to strongly promote Cold War ideological narratives to a global audience, African American and Japanese American {{racial and ethnic groups}} within the United States created their own interpretations of the tours. Likewise, the governments and imperial institutions of Ethiopia and Japan both appropriated American efforts in an attempt to renegotiate political relationships and produce imperial narratives for domestic consumption. However, fundamental <b>contradictions</b> <b>arose</b> during these tours as both Ethiopia and Japan simultaneously sought to embrace America and to expand their presence on the world stage.

40|$|Reverse gyrases are {{the only}} topoisomerases capable of {{introducing}} positive supercoils into circular DNA. Their exclusive presence in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms indicates a DNA thermoprotective role in vivo. In spite of the efforts to improve our knowledge of reverse gyrase, modest {{progress has been made}} since its discovery. Currently, only one crystal structure of the enzyme is available, and the most widely accepted reaction mechanism is a hypothetical one, mostly derived from the functions of enzymes related to reverse gyrase domains. In the present work we address mechanistic aspects of the reaction by exploiting the capabilities {{of a wide range of}} techniques, to elucidate the role of one module of T. maritima reverse gyrase. Reverse gyrase consists of an N-terminal helicase-like domain, fused to a C-terminal topoisomerase domain. We selected the helicase-like domain as a model of study due to its capacity to couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to DNA processing. Exploiting of these features by reverse gyrase turns this region into a key player at virtually every step of DNA supercoiling. Steady-state ATPase assays and equilibrium binding titrations with the helicase-like domain and the full-length enzyme, enabled us to prove for the first time a harnessing effect of the topoisomerase over the helicase-like domain. We showed that properties intrinsic to the helicase-like domain, like DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, nucleotide-dependent affinity switch for DNA, and thermodynamic coupling between DNA binding and ATP binding and hydrolysis, are strongly reduced in the context of reverse gyrase. At that time apparent <b>contradictions</b> <b>arose,</b> from reports stating that the isolated helicase-like domain is less active than within the context of the full-length enzyme. We reconciled these differences by demonstrating that the presence of the putative N-terminal Zn-finger in the helicase-like domain construct is the cause for the decreased activity. Furthermore, we have elucidated the thermodynamic and conformational cycle of the helicase-like domain, and predicted the stages fulfilling the requirements for interdomain communication, local duplex DNA unwinding, and the stages where DNA is in a suitable state to support the supercoiling reaction. Finally, besides the use of smFRET as a tool to investigate conformational changes in solution, we have also provided high-resolution snapshots of the helicase-like domain via X-ray crystallography. We have provided the most detailed structures of this region to this date, in the apo and ADP-bound forms. They also revealed high flexibility of the linker joining the RecA domains with relative orientations far from random, and local differences in secondary structure motifs that discard the assumption of all reverse gyrases having a “monolithic” build-up. We also created a deletion mutant of the latch, region with a sui generis location, perfectly suited for interdomain communication. Previous reports stated that its deletion from reverse gyrase abolishes positive supercoiling. We demonstrated its strong involvement in DNA binding, DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and thermodynamic coupling between these processes in the isolated helicase-like domain. We also revealed its role in presenting the ssDNA to the topoisomerase domain and in guiding the strand passage and resealing, ensuring the directionality leading to the introduction of positive supercoils. Additionally, we also elucidated the nucleotide cycle and conformational transitions for this helicase-like domain mutant, which gave the first indications of why no positive supercoiling can be performed by the full-length reverse gyrase lacking the latch, and only DNA relaxation is allowed. Finally, our pre steady-state kinetic studies allowed us to fully describe the unstimulated ATPase activity of the isolated helicase-like domain. We also demonstrated for the first time its DNA unwinding activity, shedding light on the rarely documented local B-DNA duplex destabilization of helicase-like modules, appended to bigger enzymes. Additionally, the sequence of ssDNA strand release, and identification of secondary structure motifs involved in ssDNA binding at different stages were determined. Together with the finding of new conformational states via smFRET, and “targeted” supercoiling assays with the full-length enzyme, we end up proposing a detailed catalytic mechanism, similar to the one derived from the reverse gyrase structure, only this time based on and supported by a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural data...|$|E
