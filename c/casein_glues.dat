30|$|Three {{types of}} {{adhesives}} (Scheirs 1998) are utilized for unmodified labels instead of water-soluble adhesives such as dextrin, starch, and <b>casein</b> <b>glues,</b> which have poor adhesion to PET plastics. The first type is synthetic glues based on polyvinyl acetate or ethylene vinyl acetate, and these glues are broken down in water during the recycling process. Some glue may be {{retained in the}} PET and {{be incorporated into the}} recycled resin. The second type is thermal adhesives based on ethylene vinyl acetate, which are completely uninfluenced by the washing process. These glues can soften during shredding or the label removal process because of their low Tm, resulting in glue residue being attached to the PET. The last type is alkali-soluble glue. When it is exposed to NaOH solution (2  wt%), this glue crumbles and separates from the PET. This glue is the preferred option except for its higher cost compared with traditional adhesives.|$|E

To determine the general bacterial contamination of repeatedly researched edible acid casein samples and the presumable quantity of coliformic germs. 4.

Micro flora of crude milk constitutes certain part of micro flora, found in powdered milk. However, the increased level of general contamination and coliform germs shows the signs of secondary contamination. The enlarged bacteriological contamination, which exceeded the preset limit of 3. 0 x 104 CFU/g, was identified in 3 per cent of analyzed acid casein edible samples. This was caused by impurity of crude milk. During the acid casein edible casein production process, the temperature of pasteurization was reached twice and in addition to that, comparatively low pH was maintained. These conditions are not hospitable for microorganisms to survive through the production process and remain alive in the final products. The number of thermophylic germs in analyzed samples made up to 19. 79 per cent of bacteria number of bacteria impurity in average. Moreover, there were samples, where the number of thermophylic germs made up from 46. 09 per cent to 66. 95 per cent of total bacterial count contamination...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} proteins found in artistic and archaeological objects based on analytical pyrolysis. Proteins (mainly egg yolk and/or egg white, <b>casein,</b> animal <b>glue</b> and collagen) have been extensively used as paint binders, adhesives and varnishes in mural and easel paintings, {{and they can be}} found in archaeological findings, such as bones and skin tissues. In order to overcome limitations of wet chemical methods arising from the reduced solubility of aged proteins in samples of cultural heritage, a combination of analytical pyrolysis techniques was used to characterise reference materials, paint reconstructions and samples from different historical periods (2 nd century BC- 20 th century AD) and geographical origins, which were collected from paintings and archaeological findings. In particular evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry (EGA/MS), pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS) and double shot pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (DSP/GC/MS) were used. This analytical approach allowed us to characterise and differentiate the proteinaceous media, investigate their thermal behaviour and evidence changes occurring with ageing. Data clearly indicate that egg, <b>casein</b> and animal <b>glue</b> can be identified and distinguished in a sample of unknown composition using each of the analytical pyrolysis techniques used. With time though differences tend to disappear to the extent that extremely degraded samples present pyrolytic profiles extremely similar to each other, irrespective {{of the nature of the}} proteins present.

40|$|A new {{approach}} was explored to purify proteins in a multi-step procedure for the characterisation of proteinaceous materials (<b>casein,</b> animal <b>glue,</b> and egg) in artwork samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. High concentrations of inorganic salts, such as azurite, {{have been found}} to impair the determination of protein via amino acid analysis. The effect of varying concentrations of copper-based pigments on the quantification of amino acids was evaluated through the analysis of replica paintings prepared with the three types of proteinaceous materials. Glycine, aspartic and glutamic acids are the amino acids most affected by the presence of copper salts. In the case of high concentration of salts, this interference hampers the correct identification of the proteins. To eliminate the inorganic salts, a C 18 pipette tip was used to clean-up the ammonia extracts before the acidic hydrolysis step. The clean-up procedure allows us to prevent the influence of the inorganic salts and thus allows correct protein identification, though the quantitative recovery of proteinaceous material is quite low. The effectiveness of the optimised procedure was evaluated by analysing samples from two Italian wall paintings from the 13 th and the 14 th centuries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a GC-MS analytical procedure for determining proteinaceous materials, glycerolipids, natural waxes and terpenoid resins {{in the same}} paint micro-sample. The procedure is also reliable when high amounts of interfering inorganic pigments, dryers and charges are present. The characterisation of proteinaceous binders in a paint sample can be subject to analytical interferences by inorganic materials. Such materials may form complexes with functional groups of proteins, thus preventing their efficient derivatisation, which is necessary prior to GC analysis. For this reason an analytical procedure has been developed based on two extractions and a clean-up step, {{in order to obtain}} two fractions: a lipid-resinous fraction and a proteinaceous fraction. The lipid-resinous fraction is subjected to salification/saponification assisted by microwaves, followed by acidification, extraction, derivatisation and GC-MS analysis. The proteinaceous fraction is analysed by CC-MS after hydrolysis and derivatisation of the freed amino acids. The desalting step is applied before the hydrolysis, and is based {{on the use of the}} monolithic sorbent tip technology with a C 4 stationary phase. Reference paint replicas of egg, <b>casein</b> and animal <b>glue</b> were prepared with and without several metals containing pigments, and used to develop and validate the analytical procedure. The procedure proved to be efficient in desalting the proteinaceous materials both from cations and anions. Although non quantitative, it is reliable in the analysis of samples whose content of extractable proteins is < 1 mu g, thus showing it to be suitable for the characterisation of paint samples. An example of how the analytical procedure was used to characterise a sample from a 15 th century panel painting is also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Ilaria Bonaduce 2, Alessia Andreotti 2, Maria Perla Colombini 2. 2 Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, Università di Pisa, Italy. The pysico-chemical {{analysis}} of wall paintings is particularly challenging {{due to the}} vast range of inorganic and organic materials which often constitute them. Although the organic paint media can be often reliably identified, changes in the composition, degradation phenomena, the formation of minor components, and molecular modifications that have occurred as an effect of production processes and aging cannot be completely understood by using only gas chromatography/mass spectrometric based approaches. In these cases the support of other techniques able to give information also from the macromolecular composition point of view are often fundamental and, up to now, they {{have been used for}} limited number of cases. The application of proteomics strategy to the characterization of proteinaceous binders in paintings has been recently reported in the literature. Actually, these studies were dedicated to setting up a protocol to be used to identify proteinaceous paint media, and not focused {{to a better understanding of}} modifications and degradation phenomena undergone as an effect of processing treatments used by artists and restorers, as well as ageing.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} {{of an art}} paint is influenced by several factors: the painting technique used by the artist, the decay processes affecting the painting materials over time due to environmental factors, and the different materials possibly used for the protection and conservation of the object. Improved knowledge on the material {{composition of}} paint layers on heritage items will allow {{a better understanding of}} the painting technique used by the authors, will contribute to the characterization assignment and authentication of artworks, and sustainable conservation of the heritage objects. This thesis presents a research related to the characterization and physical chemical properties of organic materials used in paint layers both from natural and synthetic origin. Organic materials can be used in painted surfaces for different purposes: as adhesives, when joining together two surfaces; as binging media, if applied in order to assure cohesion in a paint layer; as consolidant if used to return the lost coherence a paint layer; as varnish or protective layer or coatings of the painted surfaces. In this thesis we focus our attention on proteinaceous materials used as binders in tempera paint layers, their interaction with coloured pigments and their ageing behavior, and on alkyd resins used in modern and contemporary art; in particular synthetic resin produced by the Winsor & Newton, Series Griffin – fast drying oil colour were considered. Two formulations of siloxanes produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) to be used as protective coatings were studied as well. Analysis were performed by using several techniques with a particular focus on thermoanalytical ones. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetric and evolved gas analysis coupled with Fourier infrared spectroscopy (TG-EGA-FTIR), and Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the solid samples enabled the characterization of the chemical physical behavior of the paint layer components. The first chapter of the thesis introduces the different organic materials studied, natural and synthetic, in particular proteins, proteinaceous materials and alkyd resins. The second chapter presents the technical aspects of sampling giving an overview of the methods used for binding media and resins analysis (TGA, TG-FTIR, FTIR and DSC) revealing advantages and limits for each of them. Beginning from the third chapter the thesis presents the analysis of the material studied. The pure pigments (natural or synthetic) used in proteinaceous and alkyd binders, and filler are characterized by TGA and FTIR. The fourth chapter studies the proteinaceous binder (ovalbumin, <b>casein</b> and rabbit <b>glue),</b> their interaction with five different inorganic pigments (azurite, red ochre, calcium carbonate, cinnabar and minium) and the effect of artificial UV-ageing. The fifth chapter studies the alkyd resins produced by the Winsor & Newton- series Griffin- Fast drying oil colour and their interaction with ten different pigments, organic (arylamide yellow, phthalocyanine, naphtol carbamide) and inorganic (cadmium-zinc sulphide, chromium oxide and sulphoselenide, aluminium-silicate of sodium, titanium dioxide and bone black), the effect of natural ageing of 8 months and of artificial ageing with acetic acid. The sixth chapter studies the silane/siloxane coatings, in particular alkyl silane and alkyl-alkoxy siloxane, their characterization, their ageing after two years of natural outdoor ageing and their interactions with acrylic colour. These two formulations of coatings are produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) and the selected product will be applied on the wall painting “Tuttomondo” of Keith Haring on the Church of Sant’ Antonio in Pisa...|$|R
