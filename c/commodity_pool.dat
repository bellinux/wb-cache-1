Section 355 also specified that a report be produced jointly by the Secretary of Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Securities and Exchange Commission with recommendations for effective regulations to apply {{the requirements of the}} BSA with regards to investment companies.

5000|$|For {{unregistered}} investment companies, {{the report}} found that hedge funds {{to be the most}} vulnerable to money laundering. This was because of the relatively high liquidity of their structure and interests. Hedge funds have relatively short periods where money is kept locked up, and a hedge fund's structure makes them vulnerable because domestic hedge funds do not need to identify the source of their funding, and offshore hedge fund structures are complex and more likely to allow [...] "anonymous" [...] investments. The report notes that <b>commodity</b> <b>pools</b> are highly regulated and that private equity funds and venture capital funds are long term investments that provide little opportunity to redeem their investments. The report also noted that Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs) investments [...] "tend to be illiquid because the investors have no right to redeem their interests and the REIT often restricts the transfer of interests to comply with other Internal Revenue Code requirements".|$|R
5000|$|Under the CFTC's Rule 4.7, a CPO may {{be exempt}} from certain {{disclosure}} and reporting requirements if investment in the fund it operates is only open to [...] "qualified eligible persons", including registered commodities and securities professionals and accredited investors.

If a CPO is exempt from registration, they may still have to follow certain limited requirements for disclosure and reporting, including providing investors with a fund's offering memorandum, quarterly account statements, and an abbreviated form of its annual report.

First, are findings of long memory (fractional integration) in commodity futures price volatility spurious, following Granger?s conjecture? Yes, only two out of eleven commodities are characterized by true long memory and certain stochastic break models (e. g. Markov-switching) are found to be more plausible. Second, do large Index Traders such as <b>commodity</b> <b>pools</b> and pension funds increase futures price volatility through a large volume of trading activity? This appears to be true only for non-storable commodity contracts. Third, can we improve the accuracy of term structure models of futures prices by (i) including more state variables to better capture maturity and inventory effects, and (ii) filtering out what appears to be noise at the shortest time horizons? The results suggest that (i) three state variables is an optimal choice and (ii) estimates using filtered data are not improved and the noise may be economically meaningful...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{based on the results of}} {{interviews}} with music industry actors in the USA, and several other countries, that examined the industry, distribution and retail structures controlling ‘foreign’ music’s access to the world’s largest music markets. The paper uses the US market in order to demonstrate and trace the principal channels and barriers that determine the conditions of market access for a musical product. It is shown that music distribution channels and retail environments exist in a networked commodity chain dominated by a limited set of oligopolistic global firms. The journey of a foreign musical product to market in the USA is a difficult one through a set of globally interlinked but highly fractured and localised <b>commodity</b> <b>pools</b> and channels. The paper concludes by suggesting that for firms and national industries interested in exporting to the USA understanding the workings of these links between products and consumers is vital. The implications for regional industrial and innovation policy of power over products’ commercial success being ‘located’ largely outside the local production centre are argued to be far-reaching. In summary, the article is premised on the idea that if we are to understand success or failure in music sales and better develop regional production milieus we must first understand those who control the distribution channels and retail environments that sales are made through. In such a task a revised version of the global commodity chain perspective has much to offer researchers and policymakers alike...|$|R
