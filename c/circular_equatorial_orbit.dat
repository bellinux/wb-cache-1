40|$|A binary {{black hole}} system, where each black hole orbits the system 2 ̆ 7 s center of mass, loses energy by {{emission}} of gravitational waves. This causes both black holes to spiral in towards each other. However, if the binary were to, by some mechanism, gain orbital energy {{at the same rate}} that it radiates away this energy, a non-decaying or “floating” orbit would result. The thesis uses superradiant scattering and tidal friction, which are two equivalent ways of looking at a process by which the system can gain orbital energy from the spin energy of either black hole, to determine the possibility of a floating orbit. It turns out that, for extreme mass ratio {{binary black hole}}s in <b>circular</b> <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits,</b> the energy radiated away comfortably exceeds the combined energy gained from the spin of both black holes. Thus, the thesis concludes that <b>circular</b> <b>equatorial</b> floating <b>orbits</b> generated via superradiant scattering/tidal friction are not possible...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{terrestrial}} radiation belts are well recognised as hazards to spacecraft systems {{and sources of}} data corruption. The two belts are dramatically different in nature. The inner belt consists of both protons and electrons. Although recently {{it has been shown}} that sudden flux increases can occur here, it is generally stable over periods of months. The outer belt is much more variable. It consists almost entirely of electrons and experiences wide fluctuations over periods of less than a day. This is evidence that strong source and loss mechanisms affect this region. Peak fluxes in the outer radiation belt lie around 4. 5 Re from the earth but significant fluxes extend beyond geostationary orbit at 6. 6 Re. Geostationary satellites are extremely useful platforms from which to observe the outer radiation belt. Their <b>circular</b> <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> keep them almost permanently in the radiation belts and they pass through all local times, at constant altitude once per day. ...|$|R

The computation proceeds {{by establishing a}} relation between the Lindblad torques and the gravitational waveforms emitted by the perturber and a test particle in a slightly eccentric orbit at the radius of the Lindblad resonance. We show that our result reduces to the usual formula when taking the non-relativistic limit. Discs around a black hole possess an m = 1 inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) with no Newtonian–Keplerian analogue; however, its strength is very weak even in the moderately relativistic regime (r/M ~ few tens), which is {{in part due to}} the partial cancellation of the two leading contributions to the resonant amplitude (the gravitoelectric octupole and gravitomagnetic quadrupole). For <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> around Kerr black holes, we find that the m = 1 ILR strength is enhanced for retrograde spins and suppressed for prograde spins.

The radiative part of the perturbed metric is constructed from the Hertz potential which is extracted from the Weyl scalar by an algebraic inversion\cite{sf 2 }.

40|$|A deorbiting {{strategy}} for small satellites is proposed that exploits {{the effect of}} solar radiation pressure to increase the spacecraft orbit eccentricity so that the perigee falls below an altitude where atmospheric drag will cause the spacecraft orbit to naturally decay. This is achieved by fitting the spacecraft with an inflatable reflective balloon. Once this is fully deployed, the overall area-to-mass ratio of the spacecraft is increased; hence, solar radiation pressure and aerodynamic drag have a greatly increased effect on the spacecraft orbit. An analytical model of the orbit evolution due to solar radiation pressure and the J 2 effect as a Hamiltonian system show the evolution of an initially circular orbit. The maximum reachable orbit eccentricity {{as a function of}} semi major axis and area-to-mass ratio is found analytically for deorbiting from <b>circular</b> <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> of different altitudes.
