25|$|The {{ultimate}} aim {{for those}} 11 years during which I {{have been the}} Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: to create an order of good blood which is able to serve Germany; which unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made use of because the greatest losses <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> harm to the vitality of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always be replaced; to create an order which will spread the idea of Nordic blood so far that we will attract all Nordic blood in the world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb it so that never again, {{looking at it from}} the viewpoint of grand policy, Nordic blood, in great quantities and to an extent worth mentioning, will fight against us.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E
500|$|Many {{outside the}} {{community}} were critical of Brook Farm, {{especially in the}} press. The New York Observer, for example, suggested that, [...] "The Associationists, under the pretense {{of a desire to}} promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the 'passions' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes", concluding that they were [...] "secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society". Critic Edgar Allan Poe expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled [...] "Brook Farm" [...] in the December 13, 1845, issue of the Broadway Journal. He wrote that he had [...] "sincere respect" [...] for the group and that its journal, The Harbinger, was [...] "conducted by an assemblage of well-read persons who mean no harm—and who, perhaps, <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> less". Despite many critics, none suggested George Ripley be replaced as Brook Farm's leader.|$|E

[...] Through the half century that followed, he progressed on the statues, and by {{the time of his death}} in 1990, he had completed the group in plaster of Paris, that still needed to be bronzed before display.

500|$|One of the monarch's {{historic}} prerogatives was {{the dissolution}} of Parliament, which was [...] "perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatest potential for controversy." [...] This prerogative was normally exercised {{at the request of}} Parliament and the prime minister, either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence. Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves [...] "the acquiescence of ministers", and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without ministerial consent; [...] "if ministers refuse to give such advice, she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more than dismiss them". A. V. Dicey, however, believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly, on the condition that [...] "an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors... A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} cited by some as undeserving of its acclaim, while others assert that Radiohead's career was {{negatively}} impacted by the album's critical success. In a poll surveying thousands conducted by BBC Radio 6 Music, OK Computer was named the sixth most overrated album [...] "in the world". David H. Green of The Daily Telegraph called the album [...] "self-indulgent whingeing" [...] and maintains that the positive critical consensus toward OK Computer {{is an indication of}} [...] "a 20th-century delusion that rock is the bastion of serious commentary on popular music" [...] to the detriment of electronic and dance music. The album was selected as an entry in [...] "Sacred Cows", an NME column questioning the critical status of [...] "revered albums", in which Henry Yates said [...] "there's no defiance, gallows humour or chink of light beneath the curtain, just a sense of meek, resigned despondency," [...] and criticised the record as [...] "the moment when Radiohead stopped being 'good' [...] and started being 'important'." [...] In a Spin article on the [...] "myth" [...] that [...] "Radiohead <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>No</b> Wrong", Chris Norris argues that the acclaim for OK Computer created an inflated set of expectations for each successive Radiohead release.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{received}} almost unanimous {{rave reviews}} after its opening in 1945. [...] According to Hischak, reviews {{were not as}} exuberant as for Oklahoma! as the critics were not taken by surprise this time. [...] John Chapman of the Daily News termed it [...] "one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always". [...] The New York Timess reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that [...] "Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> wrong, have continued doing no wrong in adapting Liliom into a musical play. [...] Their Carousel is on the whole delightful." [...] Wilella Waldorf of the New York Post, however, complained, [...] "Carousel seemed to us a rather long evening. [...] The Oklahoma! formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille's ballets. [...] All right, go ahead and shoot!" [...] Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits {{for her role as}} Louise, stating, [...] "Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand". [...] Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune also applauded the dancing: [...] "It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show." ...|$|E
500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a mixed {{review of}} Most Wanted, stating that [...] "hardcore fans will be hard-pressed {{for a reason}} to add this to their collection" [...] and that the new songs—"Wake Up", [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Break My Heart"—"sound a bit like leftovers". Although he wrote that Most Wanted [...] "isn't a terrible album by any means, it's not {{particularly}} a good one, since Duff's two pop albums [...] have distinctive personalities that don't necessarily mesh together , and are both more fun than this." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs [...] "seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction" [...] but said that [...] " [...] remaining bulk of this collection is strong." [...] Anthony Miccio, from the Baltimore City Paper, wrote that the album [...] "doesn't signify the closure of a brief career" [...] but is [...] "meant to satisfy an audience that won't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again." [...] He noted that Duff's voice was not strong enough and stated that the [...] "rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that [...] "... there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase if you're already the owner of her back catalogue. But if you're after your first taste of Duff-flavoured pop to listen to in the background as you do your homework, then this album <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> harm." ...|$|E

500|$|Suggesting {{that many}} of the {{philosophical}} and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In [...] "The Gun", [...] "Second Variety", The Penultimate Truth, and [...] "The Last of the Masters", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of [...] "The Last of the Masters", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: [...] "It is not clear why he does not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors it <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more than maintain itself." [...] Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, [...] "...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant." [...] Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's concept of what made an object unique and valuable: [...] "A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive power, {{according}} to ArticleV and ArticleVII, {{was in the}} hands of [...] "the king in his council", a cabinet of ministers called the Guardians of the Laws (or Guard of the Laws, Straż Praw). The ministries could not create or interpret the laws and all acts of the foreign ministry were provisional and subject to the Sejm's approval. The king presided over this council, which was composed of the Roman Catholic Primate of Polandwho was also president of the Education Commissionand five ministers appointed by the king: a minister of police, a minister of the seal (internal affairs), a minister of foreign affairs, a minister belli (of war), and a minister of treasury. Council members also includedwithout a votethe Crown Prince, the Marshal of the Sejm, and two secretaries. This royal council descended from similar councils that had functioned since King Henry's Articles (1573), and from the recent Permanent Council. Acts of the king required the countersignature of the respective minister. A minister was required to cosign a law if the king demanded it, unless that minister refused and all other ministers unanimously endorsed his objection, in which case the king could withdraw the law or press the issue by taking it before the parliament. The stipulation that the king, [...] "doing nothing of himself,... shall be answerable for nothing to the nation," [...] parallels the British constitutional principle that [...] "The king <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> wrong." [...] (In both countries, the respective minister was responsible for the king's acts.) The ministers were responsible to the Sejm, which could dismiss them by a vote of no confidence with a two-third majority in both houses. Ministers could be also held accountable by the Sejm court, and a simple majority vote was sufficient for the Sejm to demand that a minister face an impeachment trial. The king was the nation's commander-in-chief, commanding its armies; the institution of the hetman (high-ranking military official) was not mentioned. The king also had the right to grant pardon except in cases of treason. The decisions of the royal council were carried out by commissions, including the previously created Commission of National Education, and the new Commissions for Police, the Military and the Treasury, whose members were elected by the Sejm.|$|E
