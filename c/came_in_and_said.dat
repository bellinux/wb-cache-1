500|$|According to author Bruce Spizer, the line-up for {{the basic}} track, before overdubs, was Lennon (vocals, {{acoustic}} guitar), Harrison (electric guitar), Preston (organ), Voormann (bass) and White (drums). Lennon later recalled of the recording: [...] "Phil (Spector) <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'How do you want it?' And I said, '1950s' and he said 'Right' and BOOM! ... he played it back and there it was." [...] The song uses a similar amount of echo to 1950s Sun Records recordings.|$|E
500|$|Callie and Arizona have {{a five-year}} relationship, {{ultimately}} marrying {{in the seventh}} season and divorcing in the [...] eleventh season. Callie starts a new relationship with Penny Blake and leaves to go to New York {{with her in the}} twelfth-season finale. Shonda Rhimes spoke on Ramirez's abrupt departure, saying, [...] "This one was different because it wasn’t a big planned thing. I had a different plan going and when Sara <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘I really need to take this break,’ I was lucky that we’d shot {{the end of the season}} with her going to New York.” ...|$|E
500|$|Initially unenthusiastic {{about his}} task of {{realising}} Alan Fennell's script, director David Elliott developed his inspiration {{after seeing the}} 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine. He remembers that the film [...] "used all the old-fashioned shotslooking through a lampshade, etc. On Monday morning, Paddy [...] <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I saw a film this weekend,' and I said, 'So did I.' 'Was it The Ipcress File?' 'Yep. Right, that's what I want to do.'" [...] In homage to The Ipcress File, Elliott decided to incorporate [...] "quirky visuals" [...] into his direction of the Thunderbirds episode.|$|E

500|$|Betts {{became the}} group's de facto leader during the {{recording}} process. [...] "It's not like Dickey <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm taking over. I'm the boss. Do this and that.' It wasn't overt; {{it was still}} supposedly a democracy but Dickey started doing {{more and more of}} the songwriting," [...] said road manager Willie Perkins. The band first recorded [...] "Wasted Words" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] the latter showcasing a more country-infused sound. The entire group were initially reluctant to record [...] "Ramblin' Man" [...] — [...] "We knew it was a good song but it didn't sound like us," [...] said drummer Butch Trucks — but the band gradually headed in a more country direction, as that was Betts' background. Betts was very serious about his songwriting, sitting down each afternoon to write.|$|E
500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{unanimously}} {{decided to}} carry on and arranged auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked Lamar Williams, {{an old friend of}} drummer Jai Johanny Johanson's from Gulfport, Mississippi, two years removed from an Army stint in Vietnam. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman’s solo album, Laid Back (1973), and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Dickey Betts became the group's de facto leader during the recording process. [...] "It's not like Dickey <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm taking over. I'm the boss. Do this and that.' It wasn't overt; it was still supposedly a democracy, but Dickey started doing {{more and more of the}} songwriting," [...] said road manager Willie Perkins. Brothers and Sisters was an enormous success, peaking at number one, resulting in the band becoming [...] "the most popular band in the country." [...] "Ramblin' Man", Betts' country-infused number, received interest from radio stations immediately, and it rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Gainsbourg as [...] "She": French actress Eva Green was {{initially}} approached {{for the female}} lead. According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the pre-production process. Eventually Gainsbourg turned up, and by Trier's words she was very eager to get cast: [...] "Charlotte <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm dying to get the part no matter what.' So I {{think it was a}} decision she made very early and she stuck to it. We had no problems whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E

5000|$|... "Dream a Little Dream of Me" [...] was {{recorded}} for the Mamas & the Papas April 1968 album release The Papas & The Mamas. The group had often sung the song for fun, having been familiarized with it by member Michelle Phillips, whose {{father had been}} friends with the song's co-writer, Fabian Andre, in Mexico City where Michelle Phillips' family had resided {{when she was a}} young girl. [...] "Mama" [...] Cass Elliot suggested to group leader John Phillips that the group record [...] "Dream a Little Dream of Me". According to him she was unhappy while recording the song, objecting to its campiness. However, Elliot herself would later tell Melody Maker: [...] "I tried to sing it like it was 1943 and somebody had just <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Here's a new song.' I tried to sing {{it as if it were}} the first time." ...|$|R

2500|$|While Lucas was filming in London, where {{additional}} casting took place, Baker, {{performing a}} musical comedy act with his acting partner Jack Purvis, {{learned that the}} film crew {{was looking for a}} small person to fit inside a robot suit and maneuver it; Baker, who was [...] tall, was cast immediately after meeting George Lucas. He said, [...] "He saw me <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'He'll do' because I was the smallest guy they'd seen up until then." [...] He initially turned down the role three times, hesitant to appear in a film where his face would not be shown and hoping to continue the success of his comedy act, which had recently started to be televised. R2-D2's recognizable beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt and Lucas imitating [...] "baby noises", recording these voices as they were heard on an intercom, and creating the final mix using a synthesizer.|$|R
