40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{optimisation}} technique that combines multiresolution subdivision surfaces for boundary description with immersed finite elements for the discretisation of the primal and adjoint problems of optimisation. Similar to wavelets multiresolution surfaces represent the domain boundary using a <b>coarse</b> <b>control</b> mesh and a sequence of detail vectors. Based on the multiresolution decomposition efficient and fast algorithms are available for reconstructing control meshes of varying fineness. During shape optimisation the vertex coordinates of control meshes are updated using the computed shape gradient information. By virtue of the multiresolution editing semantics, updating the <b>coarse</b> <b>control</b> mesh vertex coordinates leads to large-scale geometry changes and, conversely, updating the fine control mesh coordinates leads to small-scale geometry changes. In our computations we start by optimising the coarsest control mesh and refine it each time the cost function reaches a minimum. This approach effectively prevents the appearance of non-physical boundary geometry oscillations and control mesh pathologies, like inverted elements. Independent of the fineness of the control mesh used for optimisation, on the immersed finite element grid the domain boundary is always represented with a relatively fine control mesh of fixed resolution.

The finite element analysis is performed with subdivision basis functions corresponding to a sufficiently fine control mesh. During iterative shape optimisation the geometry is updated starting from the <b>coarsest</b> <b>control</b> mesh and proceeding to increasingly finer control meshes.
