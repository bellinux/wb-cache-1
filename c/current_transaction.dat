40|$|The {{matter of}} balance {{adjustment}} generates many interesting reflections. For a long time, the equilibrium {{of the balance}} of payments {{was the focus of}} theoretical debates referring to international economy. At the beginning, it was reduced to the equilibrium of the balance of <b>current</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, the focus still remains on bringing the balance to the state of equilibrium, both in the case of <b>current</b> <b>transactions</b> {{and in the case of}} non-monetary operations. The paper presents the main monetary factors that influence the elements of the balance of payments and the direction and path of such influence. Thus, the results can conclude the impact of the NBR monetary policy over the current account and the capital account of the balance of payments. In the first decade of the transition the monetary policy of the NBR was based especially on some very restrictive monetary tools, such as maintaining for a long time a high discount rate and a high rate of the minimum reserves in lei. Their high level, as compared to that of the other economies in transition, has caused the maintaining o...|$|R

50|$|Countries {{implementing}} dual exchange {{systems may}} merely separate the exchange {{rates for the}} current and capital account markets, or they may set controls on one or the other; the latter option being intended to raise revenue for the government.

This means that the full bandwidth of the link will most likely not be used. This kind of switching is therefore used when capacity is the major concern, and not performance.|$|R
