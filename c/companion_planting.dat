5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, <b>companion</b> <b>planting</b> (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and <b>companion</b> <b>planting.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known examples of <b>companion</b> <b>planting</b> is the growing of rice with Azolla, the mosquito fern, which covers {{the top of a}} fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.|$|E

40|$|A {{potential}} {{strategy for}} controlling pests {{is through the}} use of “companion plants” within a crop system. This strategy has been used in several trials to fight against a major crop insect pest: the aphid. We reviewed the literature to highlight the major mechanisms by which a <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> may act. Trials carried out under laboratory or field conditions revealed that <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> operate through several mechanisms. A <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> may be associated with a target crop for various reasons. Firstly, it can attract aphids and draw them away from their host plants. Secondly, it can alter the recognition of the host plant. This effect is mostly attributed to <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> volatiles since they disturb the aphid host plant location, and additionally they may react chemically and physiologically with the host plant, making it an unsuitable host for aphids. Thirdly, it can attract natural enemies by providing shelter and food resources. In this review, the feasibility of using <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> is discussed. We conclude that many factors need {{to be taken into account}} for a successful <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> strategy. For the best long-term results, <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> strategies have to be combined with other alternative approaches against aphids...|$|R

500|$|Squash was domesticated first, {{followed}} by maize and then beans, {{becoming part of}} the Three Sisters agricultural system of <b>companion</b> <b>planting.</b> The English word [...] "squash" [...] derives from askutasquash (a green thing eaten raw), a word from the Narragansett language, which was documented by Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, in his 1643 publication A Key Into the Language of America. Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family.|$|E
500|$|A {{system of}} <b>companion</b> <b>planting</b> called the Three Sisters was {{developed}} in North America. Three crops that complemented each other were planted together: winter squash, maize (corn), and climbing beans (typically tepary beans or common beans). The maize provides a structure for the beans to climb, {{eliminating the need for}} poles. The beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use, and the squash spreads along the ground, blocking the sunlight, helping prevent the establishment of weeds. The squash leaves also act as a [...] "living mulch".|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for controlling {{cabbage root fly}} was tested. <b>Companion</b> <b>plants</b> of either birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), red clover (Trifolium pratense) or yellow trefoil (Medicago lupulina) were sown into modules together with calabrese (Brassica oleracea var Italica). The presence of <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> subsequently reduced cabbage root fly egg-laying by up to 48 % and reduced root damage considerably. <b>Companion</b> <b>plant</b> species did not affect egg-laying in this trial. Although, financially, this technique compares very favourably with an alternative strategy of applying fleece, further refinement is needed to improve the survival of <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> on a commercial field scale as they were particularly vulnerable to damage by steerage hoes, which are used commonly in organic systems...|$|R
40|$|<b>Companion</b> <b>plant</b> {{intercropping}} involves {{growing a}} cash crop with another plant {{that is not}} harvested, to confer a set of benefits on the crop and the environment. Weed control and herbicide use reduction {{are one of the}} principal reasons for adopting this approach. <b>Companion</b> <b>plants</b> should compete with weeds for light, nutrients and water, but they may also compete with the crop. The species grown must therefore be carefully chosen and managed so as to outcompete weeds but limit competition with the crop and yield loss. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the effects of <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> on weed regulation and cash crop yields, and to analyze their sources of variability. We reviewed different intercropping systems involving an annual cash crop and a legume <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> from around the world. We report data from 34 scientific articles, corresponding to 476 experimental units (i. e. combinations of site × year × cash crop × legume <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> species × agricultural practices), and we explore whether intercropping with legume <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> can control weeds while maintaining crop yield. Yield and weed biomass ratios were analyzed as response variables. We used the type of cash crop (straw cereals, maize or other crops), the methods used to establish the <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> (living mulch, synchronized sowing or relay intercropping) and the overlap between the growth periods of the <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> and the cash crop as explanatory variables. Intercropping with a <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> resulted in a lower weed biomass and a higher yield (win-win situation) than non-weeded or weeded control treatments, in 52 % and 36 %, respectively, of the experimental units considered. A higher weed biomass associated with a lower yield (lose-lose) was observed in only 13 % and 26 % of the experimental units, in comparisons with non-weeded and weeded control treatments, respectively. Considering all the experimental units together, the <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> had no significant effect on cash crop yield, but significantly decreased weed biomass, by 56 % relatively to a non-weeded control treatment, and 42 % relative to a weeded control treatment. The greatest benefits from <b>companion</b> <b>plant</b> intercropping were reported for maize, with yields 37 % higher than those for non-weeded control treatments. The other explanatory variables tested had no significant effect on yield or weed control. Thus, the use of legume <b>companion</b> <b>plants</b> generally seems to enhance weed control without reducing crop yield, but the conditions giving rise to win-win situations should be explored further, to encourage the spread of this technique among farmers...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} of European contact in the 17th century, Hudson County was the {{territory}} of the Lenape (or Lenni-Lenape), namely the bands (or family groups) known as the Hackensack, the Tappan, the Raritan, and the Manhattan.

2500|$|At {{the time}} the {{existing}} population were bands of seasonally migrational Algonquian people, the Lenape. The area that would become Bergen was the territory of Unami, or Turtle Clan, called the Hackensack Indians and the Tappan. While the Hackensack tended to camp on the tidal lands (Upper New York Bay and Meadowlands), the Tappan moved in the highlands (North Hudson to Palisades Interstate Park). Other closely related peoples circulated in the region: the Acquackanonk, the Manhattan, the Raritan, the Haverstraw, the Rockaway, and the Wecquaesgeek. Some were later called Delaware Indians (after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr). Their larger communities were palisaded villages where they practiced <b>companion</b> <b>planting</b> (of the three sisters) to supplement foraging, hunting, and fishing. Shellfishing in the vast oyster beds spread throughout the entire estuary was essential to their diet. [...] The trapping of beaver and rodents for pelts {{played a crucial role}} in their interaction with the Swannukens or Salt Water People, who procured the land from them through [...] "purchases" [...] that were misconstrued by both parties. A basic misconception was that while Europeans thought they were buying land in perpetuity, the Lenape believed they were entering into defense alliances with farming, hunting, and fishing rights. The Tappan and Hackensack had early and frequent contact with the settlers, and their sagamore, Oratam, negotiated many agreements and treaties with them.|$|E
