5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} groups {{coming from the}} Molotschna colony to settle in the East Reserve: Mennonites from the Bergthal and the Kleine Gemeinde churches. When the Kleine Gemeinde {{families}} arrived in 1874, they found {{that much of the}} better land had already been settled by some of the other Bergthaler and Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers and families had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were laid out on the northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had now <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that {{it would be impossible to}} say all that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events of the past few years and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works on Jesus, Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E

25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1965 both Ole Miss and Mississippi State University had been integratedthe former violently, the latter peacefully. University of Southern Mississippi leaders, such as President McCain, had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the battle to {{maintain}} segregation was lost. Therefore, they made extensive confidential plans for the admission and attendance of their first black students. A faculty guardian and tutor was secretly appointed for each. The same campus police department which six years before had attempted to railroad Kennard to prison when he attempted to enroll, now had very strict orders to prevent or quickly stop any incident involving the two black students. Student athletic, fraternity, and political leaders were recruited to keep the calm and protect the university from such bad publicity as Ole Miss had suffered from its reaction to James Meredith.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{availability}} of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient. Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation. Some past treatments include opiates like poppy extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like salicylic acid, and local anesthetics like cocaine. Other recent treatments consist of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed. However, patients respond to these treatments differently, possibly because of gender differences or genetic backgrounds. Therefore, researchers have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain. Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception {{and how it can}} go wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{appears to}} have hoped in 1796 that his {{influence}} within an Adams administration would be as great or greater than in Washington's. By 1800, Hamilton had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that Adams was too independent and thought the Federalist vice presidential candidate, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, more suited to serving Hamilton's interests. In his third sabotage attempt toward Adams, Hamilton quietly schemed to elect Pinckney to the presidency. Given Pinckney's lack of political experience, {{he would have been}} expected to be open to Hamilton's influence. However, Hamilton's plan backfired and hurt the Federalist party, particularly after one of his letters, a scathing criticism of Adams that was fifty-four pages long, fell into the hands of a Democratic-Republican and soon after became public. It embarrassed Adams and damaged Hamilton's efforts on behalf of Pinckney, not to mention speeding Hamilton's own political decline.|$|E

25|$|The Jivamukti Yoga {{method of}} {{meditation}} is a mantra form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus. The mantra “Let-Go” is taught to all Jivamukti students, {{and provides the}} focus. The practitioner is instructed to align the silent repetition of the mantra with the incoming and outgoing breath. By witnessing the continuous movement of breath through the body and thought through the mind, Jivamukti teaches that the practitioner can eventually let go of identification with the body and mind and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the supreme Self. The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment {{to be the ultimate}} goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction and then about 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q session with the teacher, and a final closing.|$|E
25|$|Esmurdoc {{described}} {{the development of}} Psychonauts as difficult due to various setbacks, compounded by the new studio's lack of experience in how to manage those setbacks. The game's initial development began in 2001 during the Dot-com boom. Due {{to the cost of}} office space at that time, Double Fine had established an office in an inexpensive warehouse in San Francisco that initially fit their development needs. By 2003, they had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the area they were in was not safe or readily accommodating, slowing down their development. With the collapse of the dot-com bubble, they were able to secure better office space, though this further delayed production. Schafer was also handling many of the duties for both the studio and the development of the game. Though some of the routine business tasks were offloaded to other studio heads, Schafer brought Esmurdoc onto the project in 2004 to help produce the game while he could focus on the creative side.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} divided into eight books, or parts, {{each with its own}} subchapters. Book one opens with the story of the three Magi, who arrive in Bethlehem to hear the news of Christ’s birth. Readers meet the fictional {{character}} of Judah {{for the first time in}} book two, when his childhood friend Messala, also a fictional character, returns to Jerusalem as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The teen-aged boys <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that they have changed and hold very different views and aspirations. When a loose tile is accidentally dislodged from the roof of Judah's house during a military parade and strikes the Roman governor, knocking him from his horse, Messala falsely accuses Judah of attempted assassination. Although Judah is not guilty and receives no trial, he is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned in a Roman jail, where they contract leprosy; and all the family property is confiscated. Judah first encounters Jesus, who offers him a drink of water and encouragement, as Judah is being marched to a galley to be a slave. Their lives continue to intersect as the story unfolds.|$|E

500|$|Bianca Gracie from Idolator website {{wrote that}} [...] "Bedtime Stories proved that Madonna never lost her edge; she {{just decided to}} soften it so that her image could regroup.

However she noted how the album never {{let go of the}} sexual provocation associated with Madonna and how the singer chose to turn against what people expected from her at that time—being apologetic.|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. [...] "I've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E
