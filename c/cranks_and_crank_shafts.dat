Seven competitive cyclists performed an incremental test to exhaustion on a stationary cycle ergometer equipped with an SRM® torque analysis system and a strain gauge instrumented pedals system (SGI pedals). The SRM® torque analysis system measured net torque while the SGI pedals measured the normal and anterior-posterior force applied on the pedal surface. Forces on the pedal surface were resolved into forces on the <b>cranks</b> (tangential <b>and</b> radial). <b>Crank</b> torque {{was measured by the}} pedals using the tangential force on the <b>cranks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> length. Power output was calculated from <b>crank</b> torque <b>and</b> angular velocity of the crank (calculated from pedalling cadence). All data were acquired between the 20 th and the 40 th seconds of each stage of the incremental test. Magnitudes of differences between outputs from the SGI pedals and the SRM® torque analysis system were assessed by effect sizes. Power output was higher for the SRM® torque analysis system than the SGI pedals. Peak torques were lower for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The angle of the right and left peak torque increased for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The SRM® torque analysis system overestimated power output, underestimated peak torque and increased the angle of peak torque compared to the SGI pedals. Where possible a strain gauge instrumented pedals system should be used to measure performance variables of cyclists rather than the SRM® torque analysis system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Among the {{complete}} family of sensors for automotive safety, consumer and industrial application, speed sensors {{stand out as}} one of the most important. Actually, speed sensors have the diversity to be used in a broad range of applications. In today’s automotive industry, such sensors are used in the antilock braking system, the traction control system and the electronic stability program. Also, typical applications are cam <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> <b>shaft</b> position/speed <b>and</b> wheel and turbo shaft speed measurement. In addition, they are used to control a variety of functions, including fuel injection, ignition timing in engines, and so on. However, some types of speed sensors cannot respond to very low speeds for different reasons. What is more, the main reason why such sensors are not good at detecting very low speeds is that they are more susceptible to noise when the speed of the target is low. In short, they suffer from noise and generally only work at medium to high speeds. This is one of the drawbacks of the inductive (magnetic reluctance) speed sensors and is the case under study. Furthermore, there are other speed sensors like the differential Hall Effect sensors that are relatively immune to interference and noise, but they cannot detect static fields. This limits their operations to speeds which give a switching frequency greater than a minimu...|$|R

5000|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine requires regular maintenance to ensure its continued function. Engine oil, power steering and brake fluid are examples of engine maintenance that must be kept and checked at regular intervals. Often wear and tear over time can leave an engine totally unusable, {{in which case the}} restorer might remove the existing engine {{and replace it with a}} similar or modern engine substitute. In order to conduct an engine restoration first a technician will conduct a thorough inspection. Often pre-restored vehicle have engines that have gone without maintenance for years and therefore require engine restoration to return them to working order. The engine is removed from the car and inspected for broken and non-functional parts. Typical parts that require replacing include the pistons, spark plugs, fuel lines battery, fuses, timing belt and various gaskets. All are subject to deterioration over time. Structural components like the engine block, cam <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> <b>shaft</b> are less likely to require repair but not uncommon. [...] Typically, after all required parts are gathered, the disassembled pieces will be cleaned, lubricated (if required), and reassembled. The engine is then replaced within the car. A mechanic will then perform a series of tests to ensure that the engine is in working, road worthy condition. [...] This is known as a pre-start engine check. First all the lines and hoses are checked for breaks and leaks. Second the radiator is topped off with water to ensure that the system is sealed off. Next the oil level is replenished. Finally the battery charge is checked and the ignition system is inspected. The engine is then ready to be started.|$|R
