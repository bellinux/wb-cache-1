5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. <b>Collets</b> are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} machine collet systems, 5C <b>collets</b> were {{developed}} primarily for work holding. Superficially similar to R8 <b>collets,</b> 5C <b>collets</b> have an external thread {{at the rear}} for drawing the collet closed and so work pieces may pass right through the collet and chuck (5C <b>collets</b> often also have an internal thread). <b>Collets</b> are also available to hold square stock. 5C <b>collets</b> have a limited closing range and so shank and collet diameters must be a close match.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. <b>Collets</b> can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are <b>collets</b> for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding <b>collets,</b> there are <b>collets</b> used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency <b>collets</b> (e-collets) or soft <b>collets</b> (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E
25|$|R8 <b>collets</b> have a keyway {{to prevent}} {{rotation}} when fitting or removing, {{but it is}} the compressed taper and not the keyway that provides the driving force. <b>Collets</b> are compressed by a drawbar from behind, they are self releasing and tool changes can be automated.|$|E
25|$|R8 <b>collets</b> were {{developed}} by Bridgeport Machines, Inc. for use in milling machines. Unusually, R8 <b>collets</b> fit into the machine taper itself (i.e. there is no separate chuck) and tools with integral R8 taper can also be directly fitted. R8 was developed to allow rapid tool changes and requires an exact match between collet and tool shank diameter.|$|E

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the <b>collets</b> to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and <b>collets</b> slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split <b>collets</b> in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split <b>collets</b> will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split <b>collets</b> in place.|$|E

25|$|The interstage, which {{connects the}} upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber {{aluminum}} core composite structure. Separation <b>collets</b> and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The Falcon9 tank walls and domes are made from aluminium-lithium alloy. SpaceX uses an all-friction stir welded tank, a technique which minimizes manufacturing defects and reduces cost, according to a NASA spokesperson. The second-stage tank of Falcon9 is simply a shorter version of the first-stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.|$|E
25|$|Bits {{also differ}} by the {{diameter}} of their shank, with ½ inch, 12mm, 10mm, ⅜inch, 8mm and ¼ inch and 6mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and {{are less likely to}} break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable <b>collets</b> for the popular shank sizes (in the USA ½-in and ¼-in, in Great Britain ½-in, 8mm and ¼-in, and metric sizes in Europe—although in the United States the ⅜-in and 8mm sizes are often only available for extra cost).|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the FBI was {{notified}} of 78 threats to bookstores in early March 1989, {{thought to be}} a small proportion {{of the total number of}} threats. B. Dalton bookstore chain received 30 threats in less than three hours. Bombings of book stores included two in Berkeley, California. In New York, the office of a community newspaper, The Riverdale Press, was all but destroyed by firebombs following the publication of an editorial defending the right to read the novel and criticising the bookstores that pulled it from their shelves. But the United Kingdom was the country where violence against bookstores occurred most often and persisted the longest. Two large bookstores in Charing Cross Road, London, (<b>Collets</b> and Dillons) were bombed on 9 April. In May, explosions went off in the town of High Wycombe and again in London, on Kings Road. Other bombings included one at a large London department store (Liberty's), in connection with the Penguin Bookshop inside the store, and at the Penguin store in York. Unexploded devices were found at Penguin stores in Guildford, Nottingham, and Peterborough.|$|E

500|$|The Queen's first tiara was {{a wedding}} present in 1947 from her grandmother, Queen Mary, who {{received}} it {{as a gift}} from the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland in 1893 on the occasion of her marriage to the Duke of York, later George V. Made by E. Wolfe & Co., it was purchased from Garrard & Co. by a committee organised by Lady Eve Greville. In 1914, Mary adapted the tiara to take 13 diamonds in place of the large oriental pearls surmounting the tiara. Leslie Field, author of The Queen's Jewels, described it as, [...] "a festoon-and-scroll with nine large oriental pearls on diamond spikes and set on a base of alternate round and lozenge <b>collets</b> between two plain bands of diamonds". At first, Elizabeth wore the tiara without its base and pearls but the base was reattached in 1969. The Girls of Great Britain and Ireland Tiara is one of Elizabeth's most recognisable pieces of jewellery due to its widespread use on British banknotes and coinage.|$|E

2500|$|... "Autolock" [...] {{collet chucks}} (Osbourn [...] "Pozi-Lock" [...] {{is a similar}} system) were {{designed}} to provide secure clamping of milling cutters with only hand tightening. They were developed in the 1940s by a now defunct UK company, Clarkson (Engineers) Limited, and {{are commonly known as}} Clarkson chucks. Autolock <b>collets</b> require cutters with threaded shank ends to screw into the collet itself. Any rotation of the cutter forces the collet against the collet cap taper which tightly clamps the cutter, the screw fitting also prevents any tendency of the cutter to pull out. <b>Collets</b> are only available in fixed sizes, imperial or metric, and the cutter shank must be an exact match.|$|E
2500|$|While {{threaded}} shank [...] "Autolock" [...] tools may be gripped by plain <b>collets,</b> such as ER, plain shank tools {{should never be}} used in an [...] "Autolock" [...] collet as {{they will not be}} properly clamped or aligned.|$|E
