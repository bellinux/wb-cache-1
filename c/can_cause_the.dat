5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
50|$|Studies on rodents have {{revealed}} that when exposed to very large doses, phthalates <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> damage to <b>the</b> liver, lungs, kidneys, testes and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> hormonal disruption. <b>The</b> latest research indicates that exposure to these substances can upset the body's ability to regulate hormone production, damage reproduction, <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> liver and kidney defects, and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> cancer. <b>The</b> most common and external side-effects are rashes, itchiness and irritation to the locations of use.|$|R

5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing water <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> {{spread of}} disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure {{may have been}} destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E

5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and {{different kinds of}} signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E

5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
5|$|Stormy weather <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> {{sea level}} by {{the coast to}} rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused {{disastrous}} flooding in the town, {{the worst in the}} town's history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including groynes, sea walls and shingle beach. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and an offshore breakwater, now known as Neptune's Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.|$|E
5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser.

The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
