5|$|The cathedral has two {{unusual and}} often-reproduced monuments, the Berkeley memorials. These are set into niches in the wall, and each is {{surrounded}} by a <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> inverted cusped arches. Pearson's screen, completed in 1905, echoes these memorials in its three wide arches with flamboyant cusps.|$|E
5|$|The pardalotes are a {{small family}} of very small, brightly {{coloured}} birds native to Australia, with short tails, strong legs and stubby blunt beaks. They feed on insects, generally in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> eucalypts and nest in burrows. Three species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic and endangered.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E

5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and {{arboreal}} quadrupeds, often observed leaping {{through the}} upper <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They {{are also the}} most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, {{and they are very}} sensitive to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal, and have loud, raucous calls.|$|E
5|$|The {{region is}} semi-arid, and the {{vegetation}} is generally scrubland. Muckaty Station {{lies at the}} boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with a <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> bloodwood trees.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{vegetation}} to block shortwave radiation can reduce cooling loads in hot climates. From July 22 nd, 1989 to October 7, 1989, this study, using shade cloth to simulate vegetative canopies, compared the electricity used for air conditioning between quarter-scale models. The treatments were: (1) <b>canopies</b> <b>of</b> the same density on east, west, and/or south walls, (2) wall canopies versus roof <b>canopies</b> <b>of</b> the same density, (3) wall <b>canopies</b> <b>of</b> different densities, and (4) roof <b>canopies</b> <b>of</b> different densities. Although the savings in electricity in any treatment was usually less than 11 %, the results showed: dense canopies gave better savings than medium canopies, which, in turn, gave better savings than the least dense canopies; wall canopies gave better results than a roof canopy; an east wall canopy gave better results than a west wall canopy; and shading all walls except the north gave better results than shading only {{the east and}} west wall...|$|R

5|$|While {{the social}} {{organisation}} of the red-headed myzomela is relatively unknown, {{it is reported}} as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it {{has been described as}} forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white-eye. It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder. It calls throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> the food trees.|$|E
5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls.

5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> a host tree and begin {{life as an}} epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E

5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

5|$|The Solomon Islands skink is {{native to}} Solomon Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the {{south-west}} Pacific Ocean. The common subspecies (C. z. zebrata) is found on the islands of Choiseul Island, New Georgia, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Ngela, Malaita, Makira (Solomon Islands), Ugi and Santa Ana. The northern subspecies (C. z. alfredschmidti) is known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka and the Shortland Island Group. Bougainville and Buka are geographically part of the Solomons Archipelago, though politically part of Papua New Guinea. Both subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink are strictly arboreal, usually inhabiting the upper <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> forested areas throughout its range. It commonly occurs in the strangler fig tree (Ficus sp.), provided the epiphytic growth of its several food plants are present. It occurs in trees in semi-cleared areas and cultivated food gardens, again provided its food plants occur there.|$|E
5|$|The splendid fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; its diet includes {{a wide range}} of small creatures, mostly arthropods such as ants, grasshoppers, crickets, spiders and bugs. This is supplemented by small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. They mostly forage on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres above the ground; this has been termed 'hop-searching'. Unusually for fairywrens, they may also occasionally forage in the <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> flowering gums. Birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups as this foraging practice does render them vulnerable to a range of predators. Food can be scarce in winter and ants are an important 'last resort' option, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet. Adult fairywrens feed their young a different diet, conveying larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers to nestlings.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Morphological {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> creosotebush <b>canopies</b> (angle <b>of</b> exterior stems), size of litter {{layer and}} sub-canopy soil chemistry were measured on several {{sites on the}} Jornada Experi-mental Range.

In Death Valley, creosotebushes growing in braided washes were predominately hemispherical in shape and those growing on a dry bajada were predominately inverted cone shaped. The morpho-logical characteristics of creosotebushes appear to vary with soil type and with mean annual rainfall. The proportional distribution of different morphotypes of creosotebush affects the heterogeneity of creosote bush dominated ecosystems.

5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} green pigeon was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} {{in the style of}} those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.|$|E

30|$|Our study {{examined}} the potential for microbial nitrification in the phyllosphere <b>of</b> tree <b>canopies</b> <b>of</b> C. japonica by incubation of the throughfall samples and detection of amoA genes. After incubation of unfiltered throughfall samples, nitrate production and decreased δ 18 O and δ 15 N values of nitrate were observed. These reactions were inhibited in sterile (filtered) throughfall samples. The archaeal amoA genes were detected from the throughfall and leaf surface of C. japonica. These results highlight the potential for microbial nitrification on tree <b>canopies</b> <b>of</b> C. japonica. Our findings indicate that the tree phyllosphere is a natural habitat for AOA and provide new insight into the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.|$|R
