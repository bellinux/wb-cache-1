2500|$|Just after 5:00a.m. on February 11, 2011, Gelman stabbed {{and killed}} his stepfather, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn after an {{argument}} with his mother about driving Kuznetsov's vehicle. According to Gelman, he believed DEA agents were after him and planned to flee to the Dominican Republic. He claimed he woke his mother {{to find out where}} his passport was, and this developed into an argument as his mother believed he was drunk. Their argument awoke Kuznetsov, who came into the kitchen swearing at Gelman in Russian. Gelman grabbed a knife and stabbed Kuznetsov repeatedly. When the knife broke, Gelman continued the attack with a <b>carving</b> <b>fork,</b> ultimately stabbing Kuznetsov 55 times. [...] His mother was not physically hurt. Gelman then took the vehicle and sped off in it, running over a crossing guard and breaking her leg.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{range of}} production of the company is constituted by professional knives and other food preparation tools. It includes 0.4 to 3.5-kg cleavers, knives for butchering, knives and spatulas for kitchens and bakeries, cheese knives, <b>carving</b> <b>forks</b> and bonding knives. The company has implemented various innovations as it relates with food safety and hygiene in the recent years, such as switching the production of wood handles to PP (polypropylene) or POM (polyoxymethylene). The blades are made using molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel which has a high carbon content.|$|R
50|$|A <b>carving</b> <b>fork</b> is a long, two-pronged fork {{used to hold}} meat steady {{while it}} is being carved. Carving forks are often sold {{together}} with carving knives or slicers {{as part of a}} matched carving set.|$|E

He then tortures the man with various instruments, including a hammer and by salting his wounds, before killing him by driving a <b>carving</b> <b>fork</b> in his head.|$|E

Watson further claims {{that while he was}} washing off the LaBianca's blood in the couple's shower, Krenwinkel repeatedly stabbed the already dead Leno LaBianca and left a <b>carving</b> <b>fork</b> embedded in his abdomen and a small steak knife protruding from his neck. In an interview, Krenwinkel admitted to stabbing Mr. LaBianca with the fork and leaving it in his abdomen. Both utensils were taken from the kitchen.

50|$|When more {{courses are}} being served, place {{settings}} {{may become more}} elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, cheese knife, and pastry fork. Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. <b>Carving</b> knives and <b>forks</b> are used to carve roasts at the table.|$|R
60|$|Back again came Mrs. Day {{with a box}} {{of bright}} steel horn-handled knives, {{silver-plated}} forks, carver, and all complete. These were wiped of the preservative oil which coated them, and then a knife and fork were laid down to each individual with a bang, the <b>carving</b> knife and <b>fork</b> thrust into the meat dish, and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must think}} of another, then," [...] said the imperturbable Edward. [...] "Have some more beef?" [...] The captain passed his plate up. [...] "You {{should have seen}} her when I said that I was coming to supper with you this evening," [...] he said, impressively. Mr. Tredgold laid down the <b>carving</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> [...] "What did she say?" [...] he inquired, eagerly. [...] "Grunted," [...] said the captain. [...] "Nonsense," [...] said the other, sharply.|$|R

50|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the city}} has a total area of 130.4 square miles (337.7 km²), of which 129.2 square miles (334.6 km²) is land and 1.2 square miles (3.1 km²) (0.93%) is water. The city lies in a valley <b>carved</b> by East <b>Fork</b> Mulberry Creek (part of the Elk River watershed). State Route 55, known as Majors Boulevard in Lynchburg, is the city's main thoroughfare. Just south of Lynchburg, this highway intersects two other highways: TN-50 (which {{continues}} southwest to Fayetteville) and TN-129 (which continues westward to Mulberry).|$|R
60|$|He {{observed}} another slight shudder of his wife, which {{affected his}} sensibility. As she persisted in hiding {{her face in}} her hands, he thought he had better leave her alone for a while. On this delicate impulse Mr Verloc withdrew into the parlour again, where the gas jet purred like a contented cat. Mrs Verloc’s wifely forethought had left the cold beef on the table with <b>carving</b> knife and <b>fork</b> and half a loaf of bread for Mr Verloc’s supper. He noticed all these things now for the first time, and cutting himself a piece of bread and meat, began to eat.|$|R
60|$|And {{she went}} on with her methodical proceedings. She laid two plates, got the bread, the butter, going to and fro quietly between {{the table and the}} {{cupboard}} in the peace and silence of her home. On the point of taking out the jam, she reflected practically: “He will be feeling hungry, having been away all day,” and she returned to the cupboard once more to get the cold beef. She set it under the purring gas-jet, and with a passing glance at her motionless husband hugging the fire, she went (down two steps) into the kitchen. It was only when coming back, <b>carving</b> knife and <b>fork</b> in hand, that she spoke again.|$|R
5000|$|Torso of a Young Man is a {{sculpture}} created by Constantin Brâncuși between 1917 and 1922. It depicts the male torso as a cylinder mounted on vestigial cylindrical legs, cut off at mid-thigh. Sidney Geist {{has pointed out}} that the sculpture, without genitalia, is itself a phallus with testes. [...] There are several versions. Torso of a Young Man I was <b>carved</b> from a <b>fork</b> in a maple branch wood mounted on a limestone block. It is now in the Brodsky Gallery of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A similar sculpture, dated 1923 and carved in walnut, is in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. Brancusi also cast the torso in highly polished bronze. The two examples of this version are held in the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} about the supper party on that {{particular}} Sunday evening in November at Daisy Villa, Green Street, Streatham, which seemed to indicate {{in any way that}} one of the most interesting careers connected with the world history of crime was to owe its very existence to the disaster which befell that little gathering. The villa was the residence and also--to his credit--the unmortgaged property of Mr. David Barnes, a struggling but fairly prosperous coal merchant of excellent character, some means, and Methodist proclivities. His habit of sitting without his coat when carving, although deprecated by his wife and daughter on account of the genteel aspirations of the latter, was a not unusual one in the neighbourhood; and coupled with the proximity of a cold joint of beef, his seat at the head of the table, and a <b>carving</b> knife and <b>fork</b> grasped in his hands, established clearly the fact of his position in the household, which a somewhat weak physiognomy might otherwise have led the casual observer to doubt. Opposite him, at the other end of the table, sat his wife, Mrs. Barnes, a somewhat voluminous lady with a high colour, a black satin frock, and many ornaments. On her left the son of the house, eighteen years old, of moderate stature, somewhat pimply, with the fashion of the moment reflected in his pink tie with white spots, drawn through a gold ring, and curving outwards to seek obscurity underneath a dazzling waistcoat. A white tube-rose in his buttonhole might have been intended as a sort of compliment to the occasion, or an indication of his intention to take a walk after supper in the fashionable purlieus of the neighbourhood. Facing him sat his sister--a fluffy-haired, blue-eyed young lady, pretty in her way, but chiefly noticeable for a peculiar sort of self-consciousness blended with self-satisfaction, and possessed only at a certain period in their lives by young ladies of her age. It was almost the air of the cat in whose interior reposes the missing canary, except that in this instance the canary obviously existed in the person of the young man who sat at her side, introduced formally to the household for the first time. That young man's name was--at the moment--Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald.|$|R
