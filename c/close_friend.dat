30|$|The peer-tree {{indexing}} structure {{can serve}} as a guideline for forwarding location updates and queries. When a target host represents a host whose location is under query or is being updated, a location query or update is always forwarded to the <b>closer</b> <b>friends</b> of the target host. A <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> of the target host should qualify two conditions. First, the <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> is one of the neighbors surrounding the host which currently holds a location update or query. Second, the identifier of the <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> must share the longest suffix with the identifier of the target host. The selection of a <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> can be imagined as searching in the peer-tree. The search starts at the root and moves toward the leaf node representing the identifier of the target host. The height of a peer-tree represents the maximum number of times that a location update or query can be forwarded.|$|R

40|$|Accuracy at reading nonverbal cues to {{emotions}} {{was examined}} for <b>close</b> <b>friends,</b> less <b>close</b> <b>friends,</b> and strangers. Forty-eight senders were videotaped {{talking about an}} experience during which they felt either very happy, very sad, or very angry. Half {{of the time they}} expressed their emotion clearly, and half of the time they concealed their emotion. Forty-eight judges watched these tapes without sound and attempted to identify the senders emotions. Each judge watched a videotape of both a platonic friend and a stranger. Overall, friends were more accurate than strangers at identifying the senders emotions, however, less <b>close</b> <b>friends</b> were better than <b>closer</b> <b>friends</b> at correctly judging concealed sadness and anger. In discussing these findings, we consider models of motivated inaccuracy, accommodatingness, and emotions as calls to action...|$|R
