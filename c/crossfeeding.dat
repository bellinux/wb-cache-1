50|$|<b>Crossfeeding</b> blends {{the left}} and right stereo {{channels}} slightly, reducing the extreme channel separation which is characteristic of headphone listening in older stereo recordings, and is known to cause headaches in a small fraction of listeners. Crossfeed also improves the soundstage characteristics and makes the music sound more natural, as if one was listening to a pair of speakers. While some swear by crossfeed, many prefer amplifiers without it. The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) technology led a number of manufacturers to introduce amplifiers with 'headphone virtualization' features. In principle, the DSP chips allow the two-driver headphone to simulate a full Dolby 5.1 (or more) surround system. When the sounds from the two headphone drivers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate the source of a sound. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine as they do with crossfeed, the illusion of sound directionality is created.|$|E

This investigation aims to further our understanding of multi-axis control by focusing on one phenomenon that is known to occur in such tasks: <b>crossfeed.</b> <b>Crossfeed</b> occurs when operators’ inputs in one controlled axis feed into another controlled degree-of-freedom, thereby affecting overall control performance. A human-in-the-loop experiment, in which operators performed a dual-axis aircraft roll and pitch tracking task with physical motion feedback, was conducted in the SIMONA Research Simulator at TU Delft. Three conditions were tested: the full dual-axis control task, supplemented with reference single-axis roll and pitch tasks. Through the use of independent target and disturbance forcing function signals in both controlled axes, {{we were able to}} detect the presence of <b>crossfeed</b> in this dual-axis task from spectral analysis. Furthermore, these signals facilitated the objective identification of the dynamics of the <b>crossfeed</b> contribution, in parallel with estimating operators visual and motion responses.

Using 3 Y 1 cells transformed with temperature-sensitive Rous sarcoma virus, we showed that the tyrosine kinase activity of pp 60 v-src was responsible for the serum-sparing effect on the level of RNA expressed from the viral promoter. Sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases that nonspecifically elevates the level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in cells, stimulated transcription from the viral promoter. The effects of both pp 60 v-src and orthovanadate were resistant to cycloheximide.

40|$|Microbial {{communities}} are increasingly utilised in biotechnology. Efficiency and productivity {{in many of}} these applications depends on the presence of cooperative interactions between members of the community. Two key processes underlying these interactions are the production of public goods and metabolic <b>crossfeeding,</b> which can be understood in the general framework of ecological and evolutionary (eco-evo) dynamics. In this review we illustrate the relevance of cooperative interactions in microbial biotechnological processes, discuss their mechanistic origins, and analyse their evolutionary resilience. Cooperative behaviours can be damaged by the emergence of ‘cheating’ cells that benefit from the cooperative interactions but do not contribute to them. Despite this, cooperative interactions can be stabilized by spatial segregation, by the presence of feedbacks between the evolutionary dynamics and the ecology of the community, by the role of regulatory systems coupled to the environmental conditions and by the action of horizontal gene transfer. Cooperative interactions enrich microbial communities with a higher degree of robustness against environmental stress and can facilitate the evolution of more complex traits. Therefore, the evolutionary resilience of microbial communities and their ability to constraint detrimental mutants should be considered in order to design robust biotechnological applications...|$|E
40|$|Cross-feeding is the {{exchange}} of nutrients among species of microbes. It has two potential evolutionary origins, one as an exchange of metabolic wastes or byproducts among species, the other {{as a form of}} cooperation known as reciprocal altruism. This paper explores the conditions favoring the origin of cooperative cross-feeding between two species. There is an extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation, and some of the requirements for the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding follow from this prior work–specifically the requirement that interactions be limited to small groups of individuals, such as colonies in a spatially structured environment. Evolution of cooperative cross-feeding by a species also requires that cross-feeding from the partner species already exists, so that the cooperating mutant will automatically be reciprocated for its actions. Beyond these considerations, some unintuitive dynamical constraints apply. In particular, the benefit of cooperative cross-feeding applies only in the range of intermediate cell densities. At low density, resource concentrations are too low to offset the cost of cooperation. At high density, resources shared by both species become limiting, and the two species become competitors. These considerations suggest that the evolution of cooperative <b>crossfeeding</b> in nature may be more challenging than for other types of cooperation.

40|$|A Read-While-Write (RWW) {{operation}} for tape and/or potentially disk applications {{is needed in}} the following three cases: 1. High reliability; 2. Data servo systems; 3. Buried servo systems. All these applications mean that the read (servo) head and write head are operative simultaneously. Consequently, RWW operation will require work to suppress the so-called <b>crossfeed</b> field radiation from the write head. Traditionally, write-read <b>crossfeed</b> has been reduced in conventional magnetic recording heads {{by a variety of}} screening methods, but the effectness of these methods is very limited. On the other hand, the early theoretical investigations of the <b>crossfeed</b> problem concentrating on the flux line pattern in front of a head structure based on a simplified model, may not be comprehensive. Today a growing number of magnetic recording equipment manufacturers employ thin-film technology to fabricate heads and thereby the size of the modern head is much smaller than in the past. The increasing use of thin-film metallic magnetic materials for heads, along with the appearance of other new technologies, such as the MR reproductive mode and keepered media, has stimulated the need for an increased understanding of the <b>crossfeed</b> problem by advanced analysis methods and a satisfactory practical solution to achieve the RWW operation. The work described in this thesis to suppress the <b>crossfeed</b> field involves both a novel reproductive mode of a Dual Magnetoresistive (DMR) head, which was originally designed to gain a large reproduce sensitivity at high linear recording densities exceeding 100 kFCI, playing the key role in suppressing the <b>crossfeed</b> (the corresponding signal-noise ratio is over 38 dB), and several other compensation schemes, giving further suppression. Advanced analytical and numerical methods of estimating <b>crossfeed</b> in single and multi track thin-film/MR heads under both DC and AC excitations can often help a head designer understand how the <b>crossfeed</b> field spreads and therefore how to suppress the <b>crossfeed</b> field from the standpoint of an overall head configuration. This work also assesses the scale of the <b>crossfeed</b> problem by making measurements on current and improved heads, thereby adapting the main contributors to <b>crossfeed.</b> The relevance of this work to the computer industry is clear for achieving simultaneous operation of the read head and write head, especially in a thin-film head assembly.

NRK cell division was stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), and these cells showed high levels of EGF receptors, as determined by 125 I-labeled EGF binding. KNRK cells were unresponsive to EGF and no EGF receptors were detectable. Ts cells also were unresponsive to EGF at both temperatures, but exhibited just detectable EGF binding at 32 degrees C and 10 - 15 % of NRK cell binding at 39 degrees C.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The microaerophilic {{bacterium}} Azorhizobium caulinodans, when fixing N(2) both in pure cultures held at 20 µM dissolved O(2) {{tension and}} as endosymbiont of Sesbania rostrata legume nodules, employs a novel, respiratory-membrane endo-hydrogenase to oxidize and recycle endogenous H(2) produced by soluble Mo-dinitrogenase {{activity at the}} expense of O(2). METHODS AND FINDINGS: From a bioinformatic analysis, this endo-hydrogenase is a core (6 subunit) version of (14 subunit) NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I). In pure A. caulinodans liquid cultures, when O(2) levels are lowered to < 1 µM dissolved O(2) tension (true microaerobic physiology), in vivo endo-hydrogenase activity reverses and continuously evolves H(2) at high rates. In essence, H(+) ions then supplement scarce O(2) as respiratory-membrane electron acceptor. Paradoxically, from thermodynamic considerations, such hydrogenic respiratory-membrane electron transfer need largely uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, required for growth of non-phototrophic aerobic bacteria, A. caulinodans included. CONCLUSIONS: A. caulinodans in vivo endo-hydrogenase catalytic activity is bidirectional. To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration of hydrogenic respiratory-membrane electron transfer among aerobic (non-fermentative) bacteria. When compared with O(2) tolerant hydrogenases in other organisms, A. caulinodans in vivo endo-hydrogenase mediated H(2) production rates (50, 000 pmol 10 (9) ·cells(- 1) min(- 1)) are at least one-thousandfold higher. Conceivably, A. caulinodans respiratory-membrane hydrogenesis might initiate H(2) <b>crossfeeding</b> among spatially organized bacterial populations whose individual cells adopt distinct metabolic states in response to variant O(2) availability.

40|$|Abstract Background Resource cycling is a {{defining}} {{process in the}} maintenance of the biosphere. Microbial communities, ranging from simple to highly diverse, {{play a crucial role in}} this process. Yet the evolutionary adaptation and speciation of micro-organisms have rarely been studied in the context of resource cycling. In this study, our basic questions are how does a community evolve its resource usage and how are resource cycles partitioned? Results We design a computational model in which a population of individuals evolves to take up nutrients and excrete waste. The waste of one individual is another's resource. Given a fixed amount of resources, this leads to resource cycles. We find that the shortest cycle dominates the ecological dynamics, and over evolutionary time its length is minimized. Initially a single lineage processes a long cycle of resources, later <b>crossfeeding</b> lineages arise. The evolutionary dynamics that follow are determined by the strength of indirect selection for resource cycling. We study indirect selection by changing the spatial setting and the strength of direct selection. If individuals are fixed at lattice sites or direct selection is low, indirect selection result in lineages that structure their local environment, leading to 'smart' individuals and stable patterns of resource dynamics. The individuals are good at cycling resources themselves and do this with a short cycle. On the other hand, if individuals randomly change position each time step, or direct selection is high, individuals are more prone to crossfeeding: an ecosystem based solution with turbulent resource dynamics, and individuals that are less capable of cycling resources themselves. Conclusion In a baseline model of ecosystem evolution we demonstrate different eco-evolutionary trajectories of resource cycling. By varying the strength of indirect selection through the spatial setting and direct selection, the integration of information by the evolutionary process leads to qualitatively different results from individual smartness to cooperative community structures. </p...|$|E
40|$|Facultative {{anaerobic}} organisms {{have the}} metabolic versatility {{to grow in}} both aerobic and anaerobic environments. However, molecular mechanisms that underpin adaptation to anaerobic environments are not well understood. This study aims {{to understand how the}} facultative anaerobe, Escherichia coli, adapts to environments that vary in oxygen content. An experimental evolution experiment was conducted in which replicate lineages were established from a preevolved clonal culture of E. coli REL 4536. Lineages were serially sub-cultured for 4, 000 generations within strict aerobic and strict anaerobic environments, and a treatment that fluctuated between the two environments. Significant increases in the relative fitness of lineages exposed to anaerobic conditions were observed, whereas the relative fitness of lineages in aerobic conditions did not increase, likely as the ancestor had been pre-adapted to aerobic growth. Mutations that arose during evolution were identified by genome sequencing randomly-selected clones from each lineage at 2, 000 and 4, 000 generations. Traits that contributed to adaptation were predicted via the occurrence of independent mutations affecting common traits among lineages. Adaptation to the anaerobic environment was facilitated by modifications to anaerobic fermentation and the inactivation of virulence genes, whereas in the aerobic environment, mutations predicted to confer a growth advantage in stationary phase were observed. The evolution of generalists involved traits that were similar to those found in both aerobic and anaerobically evolved lineages, as well as the deletion of cryptic prophages from the genome and modifications to amino acid transport. Phenotypically distinct small colony morphotypes (SCM) arose within anaerobic lineages and two separate adaptive pathways are hypothesised for this divergence. SCM 1 were capable of stable coexistence with co-evolved cells of typical colony morphotype, most likely through an acetate <b>crossfeeding</b> mechanism. In contrast, SCM 2 was able to out-compete the ancestor within 14 days, despite exhibiting a lower growth rate than the ancestor. SCM 2 likely evolved the ability to inhibit the ancestral strain through a contact dependent inhibition mechanism, as evidenced by a mutation in glgC.

The work discussed here is a first report of the isolation of genetically marked strains of J. caries and their use in wheat plant infection studies. Procedures for the isolation of auxotrophic and drug-resistant mutants in haploid strains of J. caries were developed. Preliminary determination of the nuclear condition of secondary sporidia showed that spores were typically mononucleate. Additionally, characterization of the kinetics of secondary sporidial formation in liquid culture provided essential information concerning the extent of the logrithmic phase of growth and spore generation rates. Log-phase sporidia of two monokaryotic, compatible strains of race T-l were mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Two "non-leaky" nutritional mutants were isolated and characterized; one required adenine, the other uracil. Five "leaky" nutritional mutants were also isolated. One was identified as a glycine auxotroph, and the other four had mutations in pathways for general nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, secondary sporidia of T. caries were tested for their growth response to twelve different drugs in attempts to isolate drug-resistant strains. Only mutants resistant to cycloheximide were detected. Pairings of compatible auxotrophic strains produced mycelial growth on a minimal medium whereas unpaired strains typically failed to grow. Growth in the absence of nutritional supplements was presumed to be due either to 'forced' heterokaryon formation or syntrophism (i. e., <b>crossfeeding).</b> Inability to successfully isolate viable hyphal tips from colonies arising from paired auxotrophic strains precluded proof of heterokaryosis. Hypodermic inoculations with compatible auxotrophic, drug-resistant, and wild type strains failed to result in teliospore production in wheat plants of the susceptible spring wheat var. 'Red Bobs'. J. caries was successfully reisolated as four morphologically distinct colony or sector types from 38 plants that failed to head normally. It was also isolated from a small number of mature plants showing no signs of disease. All auxotrophic and drug-resistant strains were successfully recovered as individual haploid isolates from outgrown colonies on wheat plant tissue. Inability to success fully isolate viable hyphal tips precluded proof of heterokaryosis. Consequently, the nuclear condition, i. e., heterokaryon or homokaryon, of the outgrown fungus was not determined...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{major factor}} in the ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf- 5 to act as a {{biological}} control agent is its production of antibiotics, including pyoluteorin (PLT), 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (2, 4 -DAPG) and pyrrolnitrin (PRN). The data provided in this thesis demonstrate that the presence of any of these antibiotics in the extracellular milieu affects production of that same antibiotic, as well as others, by Pf- 5. Amending the growth medium with antibiotics had multiple effects on secondary metabolism in Pf- 5. i) PLT positively regulated its own production, ii) 2, 4 -DAPG positively regulated its own production. iii) PLT suppressed 2, 4 -DAPG production. iv) 2, 4 - DAPG inhibited PLT production. v) PLT suppressed transcription of a heterologous ferric-pyoverdine uptake gene. vi) PRN exerted a slight inhibitory effect on PLT gene transcription and production. PLT autoinduction by Pf- 5 was extensively characterized, and was shown to require concentrations of exogenous PLT in the nanomolar range. These low concentrations are comparable to those of many molecules proposed to function in signaling roles. PLT served as a signal between distinct populations of cells within the rhizosphere, where it prompted autoinduction by those cells. Aside from effects of Pf- 5 antibiotics on one another, I also described the positive effect of exogenous PLT on expression of a set of transport genes flanking the PLT biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence data and experimental evidence suggests that these genes encode a transport apparatus for PLT. The deduced amino acid sequences for four adjacent open reading frames together resemble Type I secretion apparatuses, which typically function in transport of proteins rather than secondary metabolites. The intact transporter genes are necessary for optimal PLT production. Taken together, the data from the studies described herein demonstrate that i) the production of PLT by Pf- 5 can affect the production of PLT by neighboring cells, and ii) PLT and other exogenous secondary metabolites have both autoregulatory and cross-regulatory effects in culture. Because Pf- 5 derivatives engaged in PLT <b>crossfeeding</b> in the rhizosphere, it is likely that cross-feeding occurs for other secondary metabolites as well. Thus, production of an antibiotic by one cell can profoundly affect secondary metabolism in neighboring cells occupying natural habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of grape must into wine involves {{the development and}} succession of yeast populations differing in species composition. The initial population is formed by vineyard strains which are washed into the must from the crushed grapes and then completed with yeasts coming from the cellar environment. As the origin and natural habitat of the vineyard yeasts are not fully understood, this study addresses the possibility that grape yeasts can be preserved in berries left behind on vines at harvest until the spring of the next year. These berries become mummified during the winter on the vines. To investigate whether yeasts can survive in these overwintering grapes, mummified berries were collected in 16 localities in the Tokaj wine region (Hungary-Slovakia) in early March. The collected berries were rehydrated to recover viable yeasts by plating samples onto agar plates. For the detection of minority species which would not be detected by direct plating, an enrichment step repressing the propagation of alcohol-sensitive yeasts was {{also included in the}} process. The morphological, physiological and molecular analysis identified 13 basidiomycetous and 23 ascomycetous species including fermentative yeasts of wine-making relevance among the 3879 isolates. The presence of viable strains of these species demonstrates that the grapes mummified on the vine can serve as a safe reservoir of yeasts, and may contribute to the maintenance of grape-colonizing yeast populations in the vineyard over years, parallel with other vectors and habitats. All basidiomycetous species were known phylloplane yeasts. Three Hanseniaspora species and pigmented Metschnikowia strains were the most frequent ascomycetes. Other fermentative yeasts of wine-making relevance were detected only in the enrichment cultures. Saccharomyces (S. paradoxus, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum) were recovered from 13 % of the samples. No Candida zemplinina was found. The isolates with Aureobasidium morphology turned out to belong to A. subglaciale, Kabatiella microsticta or Columnosphaeria fagi. The ascomyceteous isolates grew at high concentrations of sugars with Wickerhamomyces anomalus being the most tolerant species. Complex interactions including antagonism (growth inhibition, contact inhibition, competition for nutrients) and synergism (<b>crossfeeding)</b> among the isolates and with Botrytis cinerea shape the composition of the overwintering communities...|$|E
50|$|Directional sound {{perception}} {{is based on}} the delay between the same sound reaching a person's left and right ears. In stereo speakers, the sound from one speaker reaches both ears, although at different levels, and with a delay between one ear and another, since the speaker is placed away from the center. In headphones, this <b>crossfeed</b> does not occur, so the resulting stereo image is different from what is heard from speakers. A <b>crossfeed</b> signal processor attempts to recreate the stereo image heard from speakers by mixing some signal from the left channel into the right channel, and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain's decision not to follow approved fuel <b>crossfeed</b> procedures. Different output pressure settings on the fuel boost pumps coupled with the open <b>crossfeed</b> valve resulted in both engines drawing fuel from the left tank. All of the fuel from the airplane's left tank that was not used by the engines was transferred into the right tank due to the pressure differential between the boost pumps. During the airplane's descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank became exhausted. Both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the exhausted left tank into the fuel system, resulting in a dual-engine flameout.|$|R
