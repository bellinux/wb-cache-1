40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} the redistributional {{effects of the}} National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) using a national database of premium, coverage, and <b>claim</b> <b>payments</b> at the county level between 1980 and 2006. Measuring progressivity as the departure from per capita county income proportionality we find that NFIP premiums are weakly regressive {{on an annual basis}} but become proportional as the time horizon is extended beyond a single year. In contrast, we find that NFIP <b>claim</b> <b>payments</b> are moderately progressive over all time horizons studied. In sum, we find no evidence that the NFIP disproportionally advantages richer counties...|$|R

50|$|Several standards, such as IHE or HL7, use LOINC to {{electronically}} transfer {{results from}} different reporting systems {{to the appropriate}} healthcare networks. However, the health information enclosed is identified by a multiplicity of code values that may {{vary according to the}} entity producing those results. This has obvious disadvantages to the healthcare network that may need to adopt different codes to access and manage information coming from multiple sources. Managed care providers, for example, often have negotiated contracts that reimburse episodes of care and unique coding to trigger automated <b>claim</b> <b>payment.</b> Mapping each entity-specific code to its corresponding universal code can represent a significant investment of both human and financial capital.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} further that the {{certificate}} of completion signified the coming into existence of a right to <b>claim</b> <b>payment</b> of the retention money subject to a suspensive condition, namely the repair of any defects which might manifest themselves during the retention period. It has been accepted in commerce and by the courts of South Africa {{for more than a}} century that future rights could be ceded and transferred in anticipando. Accordingly, the cession of 31 December 1984, was a valid one. If it incorporated a transfer in anticipando of the right in question (which only came into being at a later stage), it would have been legally effective.|$|E

40|$|Government high-risk {{insurance}} plans vary {{in terms of}} structure and operation. In automobile insurance, most states have an assigned risk plan (ARP), while a few have a joint underwriting association (JUA). ARPs and JUAs are similar in their purpose: to provide state-mandated automobile insurance coverages to high-risk drivers. They are, however, fundamentally different in their structure and operation. This article analyzes the differences in <b>claims</b> <b>payment</b> practices between these two forms of automobile residual market facility used in the United States.

In 1777, Pierre de Beaumarchais founded the [...] "Bureau de Legislation Dramatique" [...] which became the present Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD) in 1829. Many years later, in 1847, this inspired the composer and librettist Ernest Bourget to <b>claim</b> <b>payment</b> for each performance of his works at Les Ambassadeurs, a leading Café-concert venue of that time.

50|$|Typically a {{policyholder}} hires {{a public}} adjuster to document and expedite their claims, obtain a more satisfactory claim recovery, more quickly, and completely restore their residence or business operations, and insulate {{themselves from the}} stress of engaging in an adversarial role with a large corporation. However, the cost of hiring outside experts, no matter how well-earned, can be an added burden when they are borne entirely by the policyholder.

Following the success of the project to accept electronic applications via third party software RPA took the next logical step and in March 2010 began allowing submissions directly through their own Whole Farm Approach website. There is speculation within the agricultural industry that paper forms will be withdrawn in an attempt to reduce costs.|$|E
50|$|Bermuda is the world's leading {{offshore}} captive domicile. The onshore {{regulatory burden}} {{and the cost}} of operating either a U.S.-based or Lloyd's-based captive in the early 1960s drove Reiss to seek out a jurisdiction that would allow his captive concept to flourish. After much investigation, he chose Bermuda, due to its geographical location, clean reputation and status as a British Dependent Territory, which avoided the risks and uncertainties often experienced by international businesses operating in politically unstable and unaccountable jurisdictions. Bermuda's captives are predominantly owned by large U.S. corporations. The Cayman Islands is the second largest licensing jurisdiction {{in terms of the number}} of captives licensed. Vermont, in the United States, is second in terms of insurance company assets but third in terms of captives licensed. Healthcare corporations prefer Bermuda, due to the ease of <b>claim</b> <b>payment</b> provided by the regulatory environment.|$|E
