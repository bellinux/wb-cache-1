40|$|Iran‟s {{foreign policy}} has evolved {{substantially}} {{since the time of}} the Islamic Revolution in 1979. A major shift came after the demise of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, and especially under the presidency of Akbar Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami. The most important drivers in Iran's foreign policy in its neighbourhood are its national security and economic interests, which seem to go hand in hand in most of the cases. The thesis looks at Iran's foreign policy in its immediate neighbourhood, i. e. from its policy decisions on support to Christian Armenia against Shia Azerbaijan, cooperation with the United States (the "Great Satan") in Afghanistan and Iraq, and its support towards stabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan all point in the direction of pragmatism in the foreign policy, decisions which directly have an effect on improving both security as well as economic standing of Tehran in the whole region. It also shows a tendency of <b>continued</b> <b>support</b> <b>towards</b> its allies, using all possible tools to advance its standing and influence in the region; religion, culture, economic aid, reconstruction, trade and cooperation, support to de-facto and local power holders, all serve as means to advance its national interests in terms of the policy of realpolitik...|$|E

5|$|On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera's son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By {{this time}} the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, <b>continuing</b> his <b>support</b> <b>towards</b> a military operation.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, as {{it became}} {{increasingly}} clear that Soviet communism would not last, a rift arose within the KKE between those who <b>supported</b> <b>continuing</b> efforts <b>towards</b> a reconciliation with the Euro-communists through Synaspismos, and orthodox communists who felt that communism was threatened internationally and favoured a return to ideological roots. Florakis sided with the latter and at the 13th KKE conference in early 1991 —even before the fall of Mikhail Gorbachev and {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union— the party officially withdrew all support from Synaspismos and Florakis was elected honorary president of the KKE.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{communication}} subsystem design reflect a <b>continued</b> thrust <b>towards</b> <b>support</b> for highperformance and high-function data transfer. One important type of value-added functionality is support for {{quality of service}} (QoS) guarantees within end host communication subsystems (and operating systems) and network elements such as routers. QoS guarantees on end-to-end communication are potentially useful for a large class of distributed multimedia and real-time applications. Building QoS-sensitive host communication subsystem software requires, in addition to significant architectural enhancements, an intimate knowledge of the overheads and {{costs associated with the}} host hardware and software platform. This dependency makes it extremely difficult to develop portable QoS-sensitive communication software that can be readily deployed across heterogeneous computing and network platforms while accommodating subsequent hardware or software platform upgrades.

40|$|Abstract Enabling policy {{environments for}} {{nutrition}} require require {{evidence to support}} best practice and engagement with political and policy contexts, as well as leadership, resourcing, advocacy, and technical support. However, research on nutrition policy contexts is limited. The papers in this special supplement on policy contexts for infant and young child feeding (IYCF) in South Asia makes a valuable {{contribution to understanding the}} policy landscape and political dynamics in the region and the global literature. Studies included in this special supplement analyzed policy content and stakeholder influence on IYCF in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and assess the role of advocacy in addressing multiple elements of the policy environment. These analyses highlight opportunities to harmonize and manage the demands and interests of multiple actors while strengthening policy to strategically support optimal IYCF as the ultimate goal. They also provide robust examples of research on policy environments and policy change. Further investments in research on policy contexts for nutrition can help to understand and <b>support</b> <b>continued</b> progress <b>towards</b> improved actions for nutrition...|$|R
