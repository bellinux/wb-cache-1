40|$|Abstract: During the Beta Test (BT) phase, WIPL-D [1] was parallelized for matrix fill/solution, to {{supplement}} the frequency parallelization developed in the Alpha Test (AT) phase [2]. The new WIPL-DP code was required to run on three distinct HPC platforms. The BT phase was the final testing phase of WIPL-DP, since the IOT&E was eliminated from the requirements. WIPL-DP was successfully parallelized for frequency and matrix fill/solution. The revised code received threshold level (or better) performance rating for all <b>Critical</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Parameters</b> (CTPs) tested. The chosen test case for the BT phase was a further modification to the version used in the AT phase of the “Human Head Adjacent to a Cellular Phone ” (DEMO- 531) problem. This WIPL-DP effort was funded under the Common High Performance Computing Software Support Initiative (CHSSI) as described in [2]. The goal of this initiative was to provide efficient, scalable, portable software codes, algorithms, tools, models and simulations that can run {{on a variety of}} DOD High Performance Computing platforms that can be used by scientists and engineers to solve computing problems...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the properties of}} electric power networks {{for use as a}} channel for transmitting telecommunications signals. It starts by exploring the principles and theoretical basis for calculating power lines’ <b>critical</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters,</b> referring in detail to the following primary parameters: inductance, capacitance, conductance and resistance. It then deals with e secondary para- meters (most useful from a telecommunications perspective) : characteristic impedance and propagation constant (the attenuation constant being the latter’s real component). Different topologies and low- and medium-tension aerial power line structures are verified; a mathematical model is then proposed to analyse their behaviour at high frequencies, extending to most aerial electric power distribution systems in Colombia. This work includes some of the results from previous research which was known as “U- sing power line telecommunications (PLT) technology for designing a solution for accessing the broadband internet in rural areas of Colombia” by the present author and the Pilot University of Colombia. The proposed mathematical model provides a tool for making theoretical calculations applicable to PLT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{expression}} of gene batteries, genomic units of functionally linked genes which are activated by similar sets of cis- and trans-acting regulators, {{has been proposed}} as {{a major determinant of}} cell specialization in metazoans. We developed a predictive procedure to screen the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for cases of gene-battery-like regulation. Results In a screen that covered ~ 40 per cent of all annotated protein-coding genes, we identified 21 co-expressed gene clusters with statistically supported sharing of cis-regulatory sequence elements. 66 predicted cases of over-represented transcription factor binding motifs were validated against the literature and fell into three categories: (i) previously described cases of gene battery-like regulation, (ii) previously unreported cases of gene battery-like regulation with some support in a limited number of genes, and (iii) predicted cases that currently lack experimental support. The novel predictions include for example Sox 17 and RFX transcription factor binding sites that were detected in ~ 10 % of all testis specific genes, and HNF- 1 and 4 binding sites that were detected in ~ 30 % of all kidney specific genes respectively. The results are publicly available at [URL]. Conclusion 21 co-expressed gene clusters were enriched for a total of 66 shared cis-regulatory sequence elements. A majority of these predictions represent novel cases of potential co-regulation of functionally coupled proteins. <b>Critical</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> were evaluated, and the results and the methods provide a valuable resource for future experimental design. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{evolution}} in thermochemical behaviours of hospital plastic wastes {{and changes in}} chemical composition and characteristics of pyrolysis liquid products have been investigated by using different fixed bed reactor scales. The main objective is to identify the <b>critical</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> enabling thermochemical process adaptation in function of raw materials chemical structure, {{with the aim of}} maximising the yield of condensable fraction and optimising its energetic properties related to internal combustion engines. It is a step-by-step procedure using three reactor capacity levels, which allows various aspects approach of thermochemical process development from the evaluation of global reaction kinetic parameters to the measurement of physicochemical properties of the final pyrolysis products. In order to reduce the gas and solid fractions with corresponding increasing of condensable products, the transposition of thermal and kinetic information provided by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to larger reactors is used to control of process parameters. In this experimental work the mass of samples increases from 0. 05 g in the thermogravimetric analyser to 600 g in the bench scale reactor. Gas-chromatography techniques have been used to identify the chemical composition of gases (GC/TCD) and liquids (GC/FID-MS). It was established that changing the reactor scale does not result in significant differences in pyrolysis product distribution, neither in gas composition. On the other hand, the aspect and the quality of condensable fraction display a high variability. Also, the energy contained in the final valuable pyrolysis product was compared with the energy demand during the thermochemical transformation in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the process.

40|$|CubeSats are a {{relatively}} new type of satellite. Smaller than long-term (5 + year life expectancy) satellites, these pico-satellites are comparatively cheap, small (10 x 10 x 10 cm), and are very versatile. Universities world-wide are using CubeSats to conduct a variety of experiments in space {{without the need for}} a large experimental platform. Today CubeSats are considered {{to be one of the}} most effective ways to send a small payload into space and has attracted the attention of many educational and non-profit organizations. As this pico-satellite model continues to gain penetration into the satellite build and launch industry, it is expected that more governmental, educational, and commercial interests will emerge. As an example, more of the space-related items of high interest to the National Science Foundation may be tackled with a CubeSat platform resulting in lower life cycle costs than traditional satellite options. NASA LSP, in cooperation with the Florida Institute of Technology, has initiated a feasibility study to investigate the technical aspects of measuring and transferring vibration, acceleration, temperature, and video data from a CubeSat to NASA Hanger AE on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) a. k. a. Kennedy Space Center (KSC). This report provides a technical feasibility analysis to determine whether-or-not a specific set of NASA/LSP requirements can be accomplished. Our approach has been to provide a "notional" component layout to determine the feasibility of the NASA/LSP stakeholder requirements. The notional layout is used to consider component level technical issues such as size, weight, & power (SWaP), bandwidth, and other <b>critical</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters.</b> Even though the notional components may satisfy the stated requirements and thereby demonstrate feasibility, the notional layout is NOT considered a design since no component optimization and design trade-off analysis has taken place. This activity should be accomplished in an appropriate design phase that is outside of the scope of this effort...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) for light water nuclear power reactors {{was the subject}} of lengthy, controversial and technically complex hearings conducted by the AEC over the two years from 1971 through 1973. An independent, objective review and assessment of the technical issues associated with ECCS effectiveness was conducted in a study performed at the Environmental Quality Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. The review was based upon the testimonies and supporting technical documentation of the principal participants in the hearings: the AEC, utilities, reactor manufacturers, and intervenors. From the review, the <b>critical</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> influencing ECCS performance, which were at issue, are identified. Of fifteen parameters cited by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safety in the hearings as being of unproved conservatism, essentially all are reviewed in detail, including, for example, the initial stored fuel energy, fuel rod gas gap conductance, fluid flow rates through broken pipes, metal-water reaction energy release and fuel rod embrittlement, reflood/core-spray heat transfer, and reflooding rates, as well as the adequacy of ECCS analytical models and numerical methods.,The relative influence of uncertainties in the performance criteria associated with these parameters is assessed. Based upon the relative importance of these parameters, alternative responses to resolution of the ECCS problem are analyzed. The importance of the core reflooding rate in resolving the technical issues of the problem is emphasized. The conservatism of the proposed criteria (current and past) is reviewed. Recommendations are made for improvements in criteria conservatism, especially in the establishment of minimum reflood heat transfer rates (or alternatively, reflooding rates). Several new and/or accelerated research programs and additional large scale testing programs are also recommended. Suggestions are also made for areas in which design improvements would help to achieve greater ECCS reliability...|$|E

CTP, originally proposed by Phil Agre, tightly binds technology development (as practiced in computer science) with critical reflection (as practiced in critical studies and design research), thereby uncovering and altering hidden values and assumptions in technology design. HCI, due to its interdisciplinary constitution and reflective nature, is a particularly fruitful domain for <b>critical</b> <b>technical</b> practice.

40|$|In {{the quest}} to develop high spatial {{resolution}} Positron Emission Tomography (PET), {{the goal of this}} work is to characterise the innovative silicon detector array that forms the foundation of a new PET detector module design. The new detector module circumvents the current requirement for photomultiplier tubes by the implementation of its solidstate detector analogues. The detector module is based upon pixelated scintillation crystals optically coupled to custom designed silicon 8 x 8 photodiode arrays and read out by a 128 channel low noise charge sensitive preamp. Each element pad of the array has an active area of 3 x 3 mm 2 and, for the work described in this thesis, is coupled via a fan-out connection system to the testing instrumentation. The testing instrumentation included I(V), optical excitation and nuclear spectroscopy (alpha particle and gamma ray spectroscopy). This work fits in {{as part of a larger}} project to provide proof of principle of this new PET detector module design. The dark current of individual pixel elements of an unbonded array was found to be 460 pA at an operating bias voltage of 40 V. To investigate uniformity of response across the array, three different methods have been used. Spectroscopy response on the photopeak of 137 Cs in the case of optical coupling of each pixel with 3 x 3 x 3 mm 3 CsI(Tl) showed uniformity of collected charge of ± 28 %. Investigation of direct response of pixels across the array with 59. 9 keV X-rays from 241 Am source demonstrated excellent response. To investigate the variation in uniformity of the detector pixel, the optical response of the array was measured using a laser diode (spot size of ~ 50 μm) and was found to be ± 12 %. The uniformity of a single pixel element response using scanning optical beam was measured to be ± 1 %. Initial characterisation of 3 x 3 mm 2 diode taken from the same wafer used to create the array was optically coupled to a 4 x 4 x 10 mm 3 LSO scintillator and then to a 3 x 3 x 3 mm 3 CsI(Tl) scintillator and irradiated by 511 keV and 1. 2 MeV gammas from 22 Na and 662 keV gammas from 137 Cs sources. The energy resolution for the LSO was shown to be 28. 8 % FWHM for 511 keV and 16. 5 % for the 662 keV gammas. And the energy resolution for the CsI(Tl) scintillator crystal was 9. 5 % FWHM for the 511 keV gammas and 7. 7 % FWHM for the 662 keV gammas. The time properties of this array were tested with coincidence techniques using current pulses from the front and back – side of the array. For modelling of charge induced in a pixel from LSO photons, in the case of 511 keV photopeak, we used low energy alpha particles generating the same amount of charge. The FWHM of the time spectra was found to be about 700 ps resulting mostly from noise and statistics of charge collection. This specially developed Si pixel array photodiode was demonstrated to satisfy the <b>critical</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> required for high resolution PET scanners. Further work has been recommended for stabilisation the sensitive area of pixel to avoid increasing reverse current due to optical coupling. A special optical adhesive has been proposed to avoid this affect...|$|E

40|$|Wendelstein 7 -X is {{designed}} to be a steady state experiment. One discharge may last up to 30 min and will be divided into many segments (elementary experimental program parts). Physics programs need to be pre-planned and <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> need to be adjusted in the long run. The <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> are a complete set of parameters for all participating components, which describe their behavior within a segment. To enable the diagnosticians to focus on physical experiment parameters only, an abstraction layer above the <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> has been developed, the so-called high level parameters. The high level parameters specify a subset of the <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> on a physics level and are therefore used to hide technical details. During ordinary program planning, the diagnosticians only see and work with these physics parameters.
