40|$|We {{show that}} the jet {{structure}} of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be investigated with the tail emission of the prompt GRB. The tail emission which we consider is identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive, for the first time, {{the distribution of the}} decay index of the GRB tail emission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and the time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for fitting the light <b>curve</b> <b>lead</b> us an unique definition of the decay index, which is useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially, if we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform and the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation study.

The samples were Al 2 O 3 single-crystal chips, of the type usually known as TLD- 500, and Luxel(TM) dosimeters (Al 2 O 3 :C powder in plastic) from Landauer Inc. The samples were exposed to 4 He (150 MeV/u), 12 C (400 MeV/u), 28 Si (490 MeV/us) and 56 Fe (500 MeV/u) ions, with linear energy transfer values covering the range from 2. 26 to 189 keV/micrometers in water and doses from 1 to 100 mGy (to water). A 90 Sr/ 90 Y beta source, calibrated against a 60 Co secondary standard, was used for calibration purposes. For OSL, we used both continuous-wave OSL measurements (CW-OSL, using green light stimulation at 525 nm) and pulsed OSL measurements (POSL, using 532 nm stimulation from a Nd:YAG Q-switched laser). The efficiencies (eta HCP, gamma) of the different HCPs at producing OSL or TL were observed to depend not only upon the linear energy transfer (LET) of the HCP, but also upon the sample type (single crystal chip or Luxel(TM)) and the luminescence method used to define the signal [...] i. e. TL, CW-OSL initial intensity, CW-OSL total area, or POSL. Observed changes in shape of the decay <b>curve</b> <b>lead</b> to potential methods for extracting LET information of unknown radiation fields.

40|$|Deformation {{theory in}} its modern form {{arose from the}} work of Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer on complex {{analytic}} manifolds. The methods applied by Kodaira and Spencer have been later on translated by Alexander Grothendieck into the language of algebraic geometry. The motivation for this thesis comes from algebraic geometry. Given a curve with a finite group of its automorphisms, one may try to deform the curve together with the group action, that is {{in such a way that}} the deformation preserves symmetries of the curve. A point on a curve with a non-trivial stabilizer leads to a local action of a group in a formal neighbourhood of the point and deformations of the <b>curve</b> <b>lead</b> to deformations of the local actions. It follows from the local-global principle that all the obstructions to deforming a curve arise from obstructions to deforming these local actions. In order to classify all the deformations, one constructs a so-called local (infinitesimal) deformation functor. To this functor, one associates several invariants, in particular its versal deformation ring. In the case when the functor is pro-representable, the ring carries all of the information about the functor. We answer the question when precisely are the local deformation functors pro-representable in the case of weak ramification. It turns out that the non-pro-representable examples occur only in characteristic 2 when the group is elementary abelian of order 2 or 4. This came as a surprise, since local deformation functors have plenty of local automorphisms, which is often a hindrance to pro-representability. The main problem studied in this thesis is the problem of d鶩ssage for local deformation functors. Given a local action of a group G and a normal subgroup N of G, we can consider three deformation functors relative to the groups G, N and G/N. The cohomological invariants related to these functors are given by group cohomology and are related by several group cohomological morphisms, in particular by the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. We show that many of these operations lift to the level of deformation functors. On this basis, we formulate a conjectural relation between the three functors. In order to motivate this conjecture, we study deformations on a higher level, deforming not the actions, but a morphism between deformation functors. Our main result states that the morphism between the deformation functor of G and the product of the deformation functors of N and G/N has the expected obstruction space in the sense of Fantechi and Manetti. Tangential to the main interests of the thesis, we study an example of a deformation functor of a linear representation due to Bleher and Chinburg, whose versal deformation ring is not a complete intersection ring. We give an elementary proof of this result using deformation theory, but not modular representation theory, which plays a role in the original proof...|$|E

40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} are worldwide diffused environmental contaminants, {{mainly as}} consequence of their extensive past use as biocides in antifouling paints. In spite of law restrictions, due to unwanted effects, organotin still persist in waters, being poorly degraded, easily resuspended from sediments and bioaccumulated in exposed organisms. The widespread toxicity {{and the possible}} threat to humans, likely to be organotin-exposed through contaminated seafood, make organotin interactions with biomolecules an intriguing biochemical topic, apart from a matter of ecotoxicological concern. Among organotins, tributyltin (TBT) is long known as the most dangerous and abundant chemical species in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to its amphiphilic nature, provided by three lipophilic arms and an electrophilic tin core, TBT can be easily incorporated in biomembranes and affect their functionality. Accordingly, it {{is known as a}} membrane-active toxicant and a mitochondrial poison. Up to now the molecular action modes of TBT are still partially unclear and poorly explored in bivalve mollusks, even if the latter play a not neglectable role in the marine trophic chain and efficiently accumulate organotins. The bivalve mollusk Mytilus galloprovincialis, selected for all experiments, is widely cultivated in the Mediterranean and currently used in ecotoxicological studies. Most work of this thesis was devoted to TBT effects on mussel mitochondria, but other possible targets of TBT were also considered. A great deal of literature points out TBT as endocrine disrupter and the masculinization of female marine gastropods, the so-called imposex, currently signals environmental organotin contamination. The hormonal status of TBT-exposed mussels and the possible interaction between hormones and contaminants in modulating microsomal hydroxilases, involved in steroid hormone and organotin detoxification, were the research topics in the period spent in Barcelona (Marco Polo fellowship). The variegated experimental approach, which consisted of two exposure experiments and in vitro tests, and the choice of selected tissues of M. galloprovincialis, the midgut gland for mitochondrial and microsomal preparations for subsequent laboratory assays and the gonads for the endocrine evaluations, aimed at drawing a clarifying pattern on the molecular mechanisms involved in organotin toxicity. TBT was promptly incorporated in midgut gland mitochondria of adult mussels exposed to 0. 5 and 1. 0 μg/L TBT, and partially degraded to DBT. TBT incorporation was accompanied by a decrease in the mitochondrial oligomycin-sensitive Mg-ATPase activity, while the coexistent oligomycin-insensitive fraction was unaffected. Mitochondrial fatty acids showed a clear rise in n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids after 120 hr of TBT exposure, mainly referable to an increase in 22 : 6 level. TBT was also shown to inhibit the ATP hydrolytic activity of the mitochondrial F 1 FO complex in vitro and to promote an apparent loss of oligomycin sensitivity at higher than 1. 0 μM concentration. The complex dose-dependent profile of the inhibition <b>curve</b> <b>lead</b> to the hypothesis of multiple TBT binding sites. At lower than 1. 0 μM TBT concentrations the non competitive enzyme inhibition by TBT was ascribed to the non covalent binding of TBT to FO subunit. On the other hand the observed drop in oligomycin sensitivity at higher than 1. 0 μM TBT could be related to the onset of covalent bonds involving thiolic groups on the enzyme structure, apparently reached only at high TBT levels. The mitochondrial respiratory complexes were in vitro affected by TBT, apart from the cytocrome c oxidase which was apparently refractory to the contaminant. The most striking inhibitory effect was shown on complex I, and ascribed to possible covalent bonds of TBT with –SH groups on the enzyme complexes. This mechanism, shouldered by the progressive decrease of free cystein residues in the presence of increasing TBT concentrations, suggests that the onset of covalent tin-sulphur bonds in distinct protein structures may constitute the molecular basis of widespread TBT effects on mitochondrial complexes. Energy production disturbances, in turn affecting energy consuming mechanisms, could be involved in other cellular changes. Mussels exposed {{to a wide range of}} TBT concentrations (20 - 200 and 2000 ng/L respectively) did not show any change in testosterone and estrogen levels in mature gonads. Most hormones were in the non-biologically active esterified form both in control and in TBT-treated mussels. Probably the endocrine status of sexually mature mussels could be refractory even to high TBT doses. In mussel digestive gland the high biological variability of microsomal 7 -benzyloxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin-O-Debenzyloxylase (BFCOD) activity, taken as a measure of CYP 3 A-like efficiency, probably concealed any enzyme response to TBT exposure. On the other hand the TBT-driven enhancement of BFCOD activity in vitro was once again ascribed to covalent binding to thiol groups which, in this case, would stimulate the enzyme activity. In mussels from Barcelona harbour, a highly contaminated site, the enzyme showed a decreased affinity for the 7 -benzyloxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin (BCF) substrate with respect to mussel sampled from Ebro Delta, a non-polluted marine site. Contaminant exposure may thus alter the kinetic features of enzymes involved in detoxification mechanisms. Contaminants and steroid hormones were clearly shown to mutually interact in the modulation of detoxification mechanisms. The xenoestrogen 17 α-ethylenyl estradiol (EE 2) displayed a non-competitive mixed inhibition of CYP 3 A-like activity by a preferential bond to the free enzyme both in Barcelona harbour and Ebro Delta mussels. The possible interaction with co-present contaminants in Barcelona harbour mussels apparently lessened the formation of the ternary complex enzyme-EE 2 -BCF. The whole of data confirms TBT as membrane toxicant in mussels as in other species and stresses TBT covalent binding to protein thiols as a widespread mechanism of membrane-bound-enzyme activity modulation by the contaminant...|$|E
