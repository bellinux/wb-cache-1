5|$|The Gerald Ratner Athletics Center is a $51 million {{athletics}} facility {{within the}} University of Chicago campus in the Hyde Park community {{area on the}} South Side of Chicago, Illinois in the United States. The building was named after University of Chicago alumnus, Gerald Ratner. The architect of this suspension structure that is supported by s, cables and <b>counterweights</b> was César Pelli, who {{is best known as}} the architect of the Petronas Towers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine <b>counterweights.</b> At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in <b>counterweights</b> {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
50|$|Trebuchet: There {{are five}} major {{components}} of a trebuchet: beam, <b>counterweight,</b> frame, guide chute, and sling. After the <b>counterweight</b> drops from a platform on the frame, gravity pulls the <b>counterweight</b> and pivots the beam. Without the <b>counterweight,</b> the beam could not complete the arc that allows the sling to accurately release the projectile.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Counterweight</b> - is a mass {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} the forklift truck frame. The purpose of the <b>counterweight</b> is to counterbalance the load being lifted. In an electric forklift the large lead-acid battery itself may serve as part of the <b>counterweight.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Counterweight</b> arbors are {{commonly}} between 8 and 12 {{feet in length}} and can often support stacks of weights between 1500 and 2400 pounds, or beyond. In order to avoid unreasonably tall <b>counterweight</b> stacks at high capacity line sets, arbors may employ more than one <b>counterweight</b> stack. Such arbors use multiple-width top and bottom plates with a tie bar and pair of connecting rods provided at each <b>counterweight</b> stack.|$|R
5|$|The ideal he {{expressed}} in a work of the period, Equilibru între antithesi ("A Balance between Antitheses") was moderate progressivism, with the preservation of social peace. In Tudor Vianu's view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, Equilibru, with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of <b>counterweights,</b> evidenced strong influences from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Nonetheless, his system parted with Hegelianism in that, instead of seeking {{a balance between the}} Geist and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (Thesis, antithesis, synthesis) the reflection of a mystical number favored throughout history.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Khiêm was {{involved}} in the plot, Khánh had him exiled to Washington as ambassador, and eased General Dương Văn Minh out of the political scene, thereby removing the other two nominal members of the ruling triumvirate. However, concerned that Kỳ and Thi had become too powerful, Khánh had Phát and Đức acquitted at their military trial in an attempt to use them as political <b>counterweights.</b> Despite his survival, the coup was seen by the historian George McTurnan Kahin as the start of Khánh's ultimate political decline. Due to the intervention of Kỳ and Thi, Khánh was now indebted to them, and in an attempt to maintain his power in the face of increasing military opposition, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the Vietnam War. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Khánh became increasingly strained and he was deposed in February 1965 with US connivance.|$|E
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include <b>counterweights</b> for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of space {{elevator}} designs. Almost every design includes a base station, a cable, climbers, and a <b>counterweight.</b> Earth's rotation creates upward centrifugal force on the <b>counterweight.</b> The <b>counterweight</b> is held down by the cable while the cable is held up and taut by the <b>counterweight.</b> The base station anchors the whole system {{to the surface of the}} Earth. Climbers climb up and down the cable with cargo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The paper {{presents}} a failure analysis on a <b>counterweight</b> assembly installed on crank shaft {{which resulted in}} an in-flight shutdown of a piston aeroengine. The <b>counterweight</b> assembly failure includes <b>counterweight</b> block material loss and fractured washer {{which is the most}} crucial part for in-flight shutdown in this type of aeroengine. Macro observation, fractography analysis, metallograp-hy analysis and hardness test were conducted on the failed <b>counterweight</b> assembly. The result shows that failure mechanism of <b>counterweight</b> block and washer is fatigue. The washer failure is likely due to inappropriate heat treatment process and continuous impact in flight by slightly tilted roller. Count-erweight material loss is attributed to stress concentration, low structure strength and impact came from the tilted roller. Finally some safety suggestion on design and maintenance is given...|$|R

5|$|During {{her second}} commission, Indiana {{spent most of}} her time laid up in the reserve fleet, {{occasionally}} participating in practice cruises. In January 1907 she helped provide relief {{in the aftermath of the}} 1907 Kingston earthquake. In 1908, the /40 caliber guns and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the <b>counterweights</b> added to the main battery turrets and because the ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops. At the same time a cage mast was added. By 1913 it was speculated that the ship might soon be used for target practice, but instead, the ship was decommissioned on 23 May 1914. After the United States entered World War I, Indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island and in the York River, and placed under the command of George Landenberger.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. <b>Counterweights</b> and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|The eight 8-inch {{guns were}} mounted in pairs in four wing turrets {{placed on the}} superstructure. Their arc of fire, {{although}} big on paper, was in reality limited. Adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if the gun was trained alongside it, a defect also suffered by the 13-inch guns. The smaller 6-inch guns were mounted in twin wing casemates midships on the main deck level, with a 6-pounder in between. The other Hotchkiss 6-pounders lined the superstructure and bridge decks. Four of the 1-pounders were placed in hull casemates at the bow and stern {{of the ship and}} two more in the fighting tops of the masts. In 1908, all the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the <b>counterweights</b> added to the main battery and because ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50-caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops.|$|E

5|$|In March 1901 the {{battleship}} grounded again, {{this time in}} the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, but the ship was able to continue her trip. A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of the Maine. Another accident happened in August of that year, when Massachusetts grounded on a rock in Frenchman Bay, Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock. In December 1904 yet another lethal accident took place aboard Massachusetts: three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken gasket caused steam to fill the boiler room. On 8 January 1906 {{the battleship}} was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to her sister ship Indiana, which had completed a three-year modernization. Massachusetts now received the same upgrades, including twelve 3"/50 caliber gun single-purpose guns to replace the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns, new Babcock & Wilcox boilers, <b>counterweights</b> to balance her main turrets, a lattice mast and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.|$|E

40|$|Background. The <b>Counterweight</b> Programme is {{a proven}} {{model for the}} {{management}} of obesity in the UK, evaluated over 5 years (2000 – 05) and demonstrating clinical and cost effectiveness. The Scottish Government commissioned three phases of <b>Counterweight</b> implementation during the period 2006 – 08. The first two phases linked the <b>Counterweight</b> Programme to a primary care cardiovascular disease prevention programme; the third phase was commissioned independent of other interventions. Aim. To assess the implementation of the <b>Counterweight</b> Programme in 13 Health Boards in Scotland and compare 12 -month outcomes with published <b>Counterweight</b> data. Methods. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or BMI ≥ 28 kg/m 2 with at least one co-morbidity were screened for the <b>Counterweight</b> Programme. Patients were asked to attend nine structured appointments with a trained <b>Counterweight</b> Programme practitioner over 12 months. Results. Six thousand seven hundred and fifteen patients from 184 general practices, 16 pharmacies and one centralized community-based service in 13 Health Boards, with a mean BMI of 37 kg/m 2 were enrolled in the <b>Counterweight</b> Programme. Twenty-six per cent had a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2. Attendance for patients at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up was 55 %, 37 % and 28 %. Of those who attended at 12 months, 35. 2 % had maintained a weight loss of ≥ 5 % compared to 30. 7 % in the original evaluation. Conclusions. Evaluation of the <b>Counterweight</b> Programme in Scotland demonstrated consistency in characteristics of patients enrolled into the programme. There was evidence of higher loss to follow-up in a population not routinely engaging with primary care but evidence of greater weight losses among those who attended. All funding for this work conducted between 2006 and 2010 was provided by the Scottish Government...|$|R

25|$|The {{construction}} of the Montmartre funicular was decided upon by the Paris municipal council in 1891. It was built to serve the Sacré-Cœur Basilica at {{the summit of the}} outlier of Montmartre and was inaugurated on 5 June 1891. If built according to the plan of the project selected initially the funicular would have used electrical traction and had a much longer route, serving six stations as well as two termini. It ended up being far more modest with only two terminal stations, and using water-filled <b>counterweights</b> for motion.|$|E

25|$|A single viaduct segment located {{over each}} column {{was cast in}} place using forms. Pairs of precast span segments, {{fabricated}} in Stockton, California, were barged to the location and lifted into place with a specialized cantilever lift. (Cantilever lifts, <b>counterweights</b> and other equipment and materials were lifted either by a barge crane or by a jack-up crane located between adjacent columns.) Once in the proper location, the opposing segments could then be joined with through tendons (cables within conduits that are tensioned with jacks), forming a balanced cantilever over the column. Eventually, the gap in spans between columns was closed, forming a tendon-reinforced beam.|$|E
25|$|During the Manhattan Project {{to develop}} the nuclear bomb in the early 1940s the {{chemical}} toxicity of uranium was an issue. It was found that uranium oxides stick very well to cotton cloth, and did not wash out with soap or laundry detergent. However, the uranium would wash out with a 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate. Clothing can become contaminated with toxic dust of depleted uranium (DU), which is very dense, and hence used for <b>counterweights</b> in a civilian context, and in armour-piercing projectiles. DU is not removed by normal laundering; washing with about 6 ounces (170 g) of baking soda in 2 gallons (7.5 l) of water will help to wash it out.|$|E
25|$|By 1904 the Weaver Navigation Trustees {{faced the}} {{prospect}} of closing the boat lift for a considerable period to repair the hydraulic rams. They asked their Chief Engineer Colonel J. A. Saner, to investigate alternatives to hydraulic operation. Saner proposed electric motors and a system of <b>counterweights</b> and overhead pulleys {{that would allow the}} caissons to operate independently of each other. Although this solution involved many more moving parts than the hydraulic system, these would be above ground and accessible thus making maintenance easier and cheaper and having a longer working life. Other advantages of the conversion listed by Saner included a {{reduction in the number of}} operating attendants by one and the avoidance of costly boiler repairs. Saner promised to achieve the conversion with only three short periods of closure to traffic. This was important because it minimised disruption to traffic and the loss of revenue during conversion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{floating}} arm trebuchet uses a <b>counterweight</b> held {{on top of}} a tall drop {{channel to}} transfer potential energy into kinetic energy. A projectile is loaded into a sling {{at the end of the}} throwing arm. Upon releasing the trigger, the <b>counterweight</b> is allowed to drop through the channel. This causes the wheel on the axle of the arm to impact the glide track, which is usually held steady with strong support beams. While this is happening, the wheel is moved backwards by the torque acting on the arm from the <b>counterweight.</b> [...] The arm then jerks forward and releases the projectile from the sling. To reset the device, the <b>counterweight</b> must be raised back to the original height and locked in with the trigger mechanism.|$|R
