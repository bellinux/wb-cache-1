5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired.

The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day.

In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time <b>Chairwoman</b> of the National Energy Foundation.

5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee <b>Chairwoman</b> Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group <b>chairwoman</b> Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the {{attribution}} of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
