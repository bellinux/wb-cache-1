Also, in these meetings, the addicts are confronted by their families. The girl's mother want to remove her from the program because it upsets her that their daughter is being forced to associate with addicts who admit to stealing and trading sex for drugs. They remain in denial until their daughter admits at a family <b>confrontation</b> <b>meeting</b> the extent of her drug addiction. After this, {{they are able to}} address their own feelings about being the family of a hardcore drug addict.

50|$|Applying {{evolutionary}} biology perspectives to humans and human society has often resulted in periods of controversy and debate, {{due to their}} apparent incompatibility with alternative perspectives about humanity. Examples of early controversies include the reactions to On the Origin of Species, and the Scopes Monkey Trial. Examples of later controversies more directly connected with inclusive fitness theory and its use in sociobiology include physical <b>confrontations</b> at <b>meetings</b> of the Sociobiology Study Group and more often intellectual arguments such as Sahlins' 1976 book The use and abuse of biology, Lewontin et al.'s 1984 Not in Our Genes, and Kitcher's 1985 Vaulting Ambition:Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. Some of these later arguments were produced by other scientists, including biologists and anthropologists, against Wilson's 1975 book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, which was influenced by (though not necessarily endorsed by) Hamilton's work on inclusive fitness theory.|$|R

25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s {{many of the}} anti-revisionist parties of the 1960s and 1970s in Canada and internationally began to fade. Partly, the {{rigorous}} discipline demanded of members of these groups including tithes for membership dues, frequent long <b>meetings,</b> <b>confrontation</b> with the police and harassment, all took its toll and as young students became the parents of young families. As neo-conservatism rose, the revolutionary optimism which seemed justified {{a few years ago}} started to appear less realistic. Many of the smaller anti-revisionist groups simply folded. In 1983, Roger Rashi's Workers' Communist Party imploded over the question of Cambodia and Pol Pot as well as alleged internal party sexism within the leadership. In Struggle! (En Lutte!) had already suffered a similar fate in 1982.|$|R
50|$|However, the Texans {{never gave}} up on finding {{every last one of}} the {{children}} and women captured during the Great Comanche raid and subsequent ones in the following years. Although hundreds were either ransomed or eventually rescued in Texas Ranger and Scout expeditions, many others remained {{in the hands of the}} Comanche. In reprisal, the Texans launched a series of retaliatory attacks on Comanche settlements, finally forcing the war-chiefs to sue for peace. The negotiations for the end of hostilities and the return of the captives was to take place in San Antonio. However at the subsequent negotiations, the Comanches' aggressive posture and known behavior of quickly attacking anyone led to series of <b>confrontations</b> during the <b>meeting</b> and full scale violence. Peta Nocona's wife and children were captured and his band scattered on December 18, 1860 by Captain Lawrence Sullivan Ross and his Texas Rangers and Militia at the Battle of Pease River.|$|R

In the more serious second confrontation, on 26 August 1964, the ministers present presented Banda with a list of grievances including his failure to Africanise, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position. Banda decided not to agree to the ministers' demands, and on 1 September, he advised the Governor-General of his intention re-form the cabinet replacing a number of them by his close followers. He sacked three cabinet members including Bwanausi on 7 September 1964. Banda apparently thought that the others would remain in office, but on the same day three other cabinet ministers resigned in sympathy, precipitating the Cabinet Crisis of 1964.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the impact}} of the Representation of the People Act (1918) on the {{political}} culture of the west midland region in the inter-war years, the elements of continuity in the politics of the region are striking. The Labour Party failed to dislodge the Unionists’ political control in the region (with the exception of the Black Country) for most of the 1920 s and 1930 s, despite the presence of a significant industrial working class population in the bulk of the region’s constituencies. The article argues that the lack of significant redistribution of seats in the region, despite wartime growth in all urban areas, enabled the well-organised and well-funded Unionist organisations controlled by Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain to adapt the cross-class, non-denominational message to appeal to the newly enlarged electorate. Although the Labour Party appeared {{on the brink of a}} breakthrough in the west midlands, owing to this ‘franchise factor’, the Unionists adapted better to the new age of mass communications and political sloganeering which replaced the Edwardian politics of <b>confrontation</b> and public <b>meetings.</b> The Representation of the People Act of 1918 may have changed the political culture of elections in Britain, but, in the west midlands at least, it did not alter the Unionists’ ability to manage the outcomes of the elections...|$|R

They were able to hide on the island for a few days until they found some natives willing to paddle them to Cape Cod. Once Holder and Copeland were dropped ashore, they proceeded overland until arriving at Sandwich. The town had just lost its minister, and many of the people were receptive to the Quaker message presented by Holder and Copeland. Here the two Quaker ministers orchestrated the first Friends' meeting in America. While they may have met at the house of a receptive member, they also found a place to meet outside. They gathered by a stream in the woods at a place that was subsequently named [...] "Christopher's Hollow", and the location was still known by that name two and a half centuries later.The two ministers moved on to Plymouth where they met with much more adverse circumstances than in Sandwich. Following several <b>confrontations,</b> including a <b>meeting</b> with the governor, they were served with a warrant directing them to depart the jurisdiction of the Plymouth Colony. They were marched five miles towards Rhode Island, and then left there.|$|R

In 1987, the BBC Panorama program Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom? featured an interview with former member Don Larson, who described Miscavige's physical violence towards a staff member. In a 1995 interview for ITV, Stacy Young, Miscavige's former secretary and the ex-wife of Hubbard's former public relations spokesman, Robert Vaughn Young, had previously asserted that Miscavige emotionally tormented staff members on a regular basis. [...] "His viciousness and his cruelty to staff was unlike anything that I had ever experienced in my life," [...] she said. [...] "He just loved to degrade the staff." [...] In an incident also witnessed and supported by Amy Scobee, Jeff Hawkins, a former marketing guru for Scientology, claimed to have attended a meeting where Miscavige [...] "jumped up on the conference room table, like with his feet right on the conference room table, launched himself across the table at me—I was standing—battered my face, and then shoved me down on the floor". Church executive David Bloomberg confirmed that there was a physical <b>confrontation</b> during the <b>meeting</b> but stated that it was Hawkins who became belligerent and attacked Miscavige.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the conditions of emergence of ideological and individualistic patterns of electoral participation among the Negev Bedouins {{at the end of}} the 1990 ’s. It evaluates the significance of these new patterns of electoral participation for the readjustments of power relations [...] both among the Bedouin and between them and the dominant Israeli society. The analysis is based on ethnographic data collected during the municipal and the Israeli parliamentary campaigns that took place in the Bedouin town of Rahat in 1998 and 1999. The object of study and methodology were chosen for two reasons. First, despite their sentiment of political, economic and social marginality, and despite the enduring forms of domination and solidarity, the Bedouin of the Negev invest more and more the electoral process without using it solely as a means of social and economic mobility for individuals or limited groups. Second, electoral campaigns constitute a place and a time of intense competition between different modes of representation and practice of power coming from the dominant Israeli society on the one hand and the local Bedouin society on the other hand. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part is a historic reconstitution of the relationships between the Bedouin, and successive States in the region in order to provide a better understanding of the context in which Bedouin approach the electoral process {{at the end of the}} 1990 ’s. The first chapter is dedicated to the social, economic and political upheavals in which the Bedouin were involved from the end of the 19 th century. It focuses on the changing modes of social, economic and political integration of what is commonly referred to as the “tribal organization,” but which, I show, is in fact prompted by the successive frames imposed by the States who dominated the region. The second chapter deals more specifically with the pattern of juridical and political integration of the Bedouin in the State of Israel during the last fifty years as compared with the other Israeli Palestinians. I focus here on ways by which the Israeli authorities introduced the electoral technique among the Bedouin as a means of control and how progressively Bedouin elites re-appropriated this mechanism to promote their own interests. This preliminary analysis stresses that the “tribal organization” cannot be merely apprehended as a socio-historical construction deeply influenced by its broad administrative, economic and social environment, but as a set of power configurations pervaded by modes of practices and representation of power coming from the dominant society. Furthermore, it shows that the responses developed by the Bedouin to face the changing economical, social and political context in which they are living are frequently grounded on reconstructed “traditions” in the frame imposed by the dominant surrounding society. The second part is dedicated to the municipal electoral campaign of 1998. Chapter three presents an analysis of the sociopolitical mobilization for the constitution of the competing factions for the control of the municipality, tracing them to networks based on kinship, patronage, friendship and ideological relations. The fourth chapter investigates the patterns of organized and spontaneous mise en scene of power and <b>confrontations</b> through electoral <b>meetings</b> and agonistics exchanges. Finally, the fifth chapter deals with the local re-codifications of the civic ritual that aim at strengthening its symbolic efficiency. It also addresses the physical conflict generated by the announcement of the results and the struggles between different groups of elites to keep a prime role in its resolution. Thus, this analysis shows the emergence of new elites on the local scene; more significantly, it highlights the way these new actors work to enforce new definitions and news ways to think the “politic” as an autonomous field of activity in order to legitimize their exclusive power. The investigation of these negotiations provides a unique perspective on the processes by which representations and practices of power are reconstituted and hybridized. In the third part, the analysis of the 1999 parliamentary campaign offers a way to track how Bedouin further integrate the Israeli state system, why local power centers are multiplied, and why political activities have become specialized. Here, as the stakes for the real or classificatory kin groups are less important, individual voters are less solicited by corporate solidarities. Thus, even if enduring forms of domination and solidarities are still playing a significant role, political mobilization shows itself to be more influenced by ideological factors. The question of the relation between those two modes of affiliation is here more acute than during the municipal campaign. The observation of private visits where candidates and activists intend to draw the support of local voters shows that the chains of patronage and kinship mediation are the main channels for the dissemination of a strongly ideological and individualistic political culture. In order to evaluate the impact of the transmission of this political culture in these specific conditions, I first examine the trajectories of young activists and then those of voters. Specific attention is given to the way by which individuals articulate different models of authority and solidarity to rethink their relations with the political sphere. In this perspective I study different innovative rituals of symbolic contestation aiming at reversing the equation dominant/dominated. These rituals involve both the Bedouin and the dominant society and the Bedouin and their local elites. They play a major role in compensating the lack of influence the Bedouin have on the national leaders. But these rituals are not merely significant as means of expressing but rather as means of producing alternative forms of collective consciousness. This lead to reconsider the local re-appropriations of the civic ritual and more especially the electoral fraud that is less significant as a way for modifying the results than as a means to put on stage the power of the local activists and voters. For, as it sanctions the enfranchisement of the local community from the tutelage of the authorities, the electoral fraud can give rise to alternative forms of public-spiritedness. Finally, by deciphering the sense of local political practices, this analysis allows a better perspective on the degree of participation of the local electorate as well as on the sense the Bedouin voters attribute to the content and the form of their vote. The study of the confrontation and the articulation of different modes of representation and practices of power, which produces highly hybrid political practices and cultures, highlights several processes at work in the Bedouin society beyond the electoral sphere. It allows another perspective on the relations of cultural domination between the Israeli surrounding society and the Negev Bedouin. It also provide with a better understanding on the political positioning of this population in a bi-national environment. Furthermore, by showing that politicization processes work mainly through channels (such as patronage networks, or rituals of contestation) that are often considered as obstacles to the emergence of “political modernity”, this analysis challenges both the taken-for-granted antinomy between on the one hand kinship and patronage allegiances and ideological/individualistic modes of political mobilization. Finally, it questions the theories asserting the limits of Arab societies to foster more “democratic” political arrangements. Cette thèse s’interroge sur les conditions d’émergence de formes de participation électorales plus individuelles et idéologiques chez les Bédouins du Néguev à la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix, ainsi que sur leur pertinence dans les réajustements de rapports de pouvoir au sein de cette société, de même qu’entre ses membres et l’Etat d’Israël. En dépit de leur sentiment de marginalité sociale, économique et politique, et malgré la persistance des formes de domination et de solidarité inscrites dans « l’ethos tribal », les Bédouins investissent davantage le processus électoral, sans pour autant l’utiliser de manière uniquement pragmatique pour assurer la promotion d’individus ou de groupes restreints. L’analyse porte sur les données recueillies au cours des campagnes électorales municipales et législatives qui se sont tenues dans la ville bédouine de Rahat respectivement en 1998 et en 1999. Plusieurs comparaisons sont effectuées avec les élections législatives et municipales dont j’ai pu observer le déroulement lors de mes séjours sur le terrain de janvier à juillet 1996, ainsi que de janvier 1998 à février 2001. La thèse s’articule en trois parties. La première envisage les bouleversements sociaux économiques et politiques dans lesquels ont été impliqués les Bédouins du Néguev depuis le 19 e siècle. L’accent est mis sur les modes d’intégration de la tribu dans les différents Etats qui se sont succédés pour montrer jusqu’à quel point il est impossible à la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix d’appréhender la société bédouine dans un rapport d’extériorité à l’Etat et à la société israélienne. De même, afin de mieux comprendre l’approche que les Bédouins développent à l’égard du mécanisme électoral dans les années quatre-vingt-dix, cette première partie se consacre à l’étude des modalités d’introduction de cette technique politique depuis les cinquante dernières années au sein de cette société. La seconde partie porte sur la campagne électorale municipale de 1999. Après une analyse du contenu des relations de pouvoir fondées sur les rapports de parenté, de clientélisme, de voisinage, d’amitié et d’affinités idéologiques qui constituent les factions en compétition pour le contrôle de la mairie, je présente les modes de mises en scène de|$|R
