5|$|Tuber oregonense <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> Tuber gibbosum, which {{grows in}} the same habitats, but may be {{distinguished}} by the structure of its peridium, and differences in spores size and shape. Further, Tuber gibbosum grows from January to June.|$|E
5|$|HIV-2’s closest {{relative}} is SIVsm, {{a strain}} of SIV found in sooty mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially homologous to HIV-1 and more <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> that of SIVsm.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum fruit bodies {{contain the}} {{pigments}} hydnuferrigin (dark violet) and hydnuferruginin (yellow), {{as well as}} small amounts of the polyphenol compound atromentin. Hydnuferrigin has a chemical structure that <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> that of thelephoric acid, a pigment found in other species of Hydnellum and Hydnum, and they may originate from a common precursor compound.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the cane}} toad <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|M1 {{is similar}} to M2, but {{somewhat}} smaller. The ectoflexus is less apparent, the stylar shelf is narrower, there is no crest behind the metaconule, and the lingual cingulum is continuous. The condition of the parastyle more <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> that in Afrotarsius.|$|E

5|$|A.coccinea <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the results}} of an Ipsos Pulse of the People survey {{published}} in February 2014, the DA is the most multi-racial party while the ANC has 96% black supporters and the EFF has 99% black supporters, relative to 76% black survey respondents. The age profile of ANC supporters <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> the age profile of voters, while DA supporters are slightly older overall and EFF supporters are significantly younger overall.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> {{the other}} {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila, {{commonly}} known as the tumbling puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. A temperate species, it is widely distributed in North America, where it grows on the ground on road sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> the European B.nigrescens, from which it can be reliably distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|It <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> its relative, the Moreton Bay fig (F.macrophylla). Having similar ranges in the wild, {{they are}} often confused. The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves of F.rubiginosa are the easiest {{distinguishing}} features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (F.obliqua), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12mm long and 4–11mm in diameter, compared with 7–17mm long and 8–17mm diameter for F. rubiginosa.|$|E
