5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (<b>ClONO2,</b> vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more {{as though it were}} chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E
50|$|The High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) is an {{instrument}} {{on board the}} NASA Aura. It follows in the heritage of LRIR (Nimbus-6), LIMS and SAMS (Nimbus-7), ISAMS and CLAES (UARS). It was designed to observe global distribution of temperature and concentrations of O3, H2O, CH4, N2O, NO2, HNO3, N2O5, CFC-11, CFC-12, <b>ClONO2,</b> and aerosols in the upper troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.|$|E
50|$|Trace gases {{can react}} with each other, leading to {{imbalances}} that can deeply affect the life on Earth. For example, certain halogen species, such as odd-chlorine species (ClO, HCl, HOCl, <b>ClONO2)</b> or iodine and bromine species {{are involved in}} the destruction of ozone, through chemical reactions. On the other hand, nitrogen compounds can play a part both in the destruction and creation of ozone and a balanced can be reached.|$|E

5000|$|NDSC observations. The Network for the Detection for Stratospheric Change (NDSC) {{is a set}} of {{high-quality}} remote-sounding research stations for observing and understanding the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere. Ozone and key ozone-related chemical compounds and parameters are targeted for measurement. The NDSC is a major component of the international upper atmosphere research effort and has been endorsed by national and international scientific agencies, including the International Ozone Commission, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The primary instruments and measurements are: Ozone lidar (vertical profiles of ozone from the tropopause to at least 40 km altitude; in some cases tropospheric ozone will also be measured). Temperature lidar (vertical profiles of temperature from about 30 to 80 km). Aerosol lidar (vertical profiles of aerosol optical depth in the lower stratosphere). Water vapor lidar (vertical profiles of water vapor in the lower stratosphere). Ozone microwave (vertical profiles of stratospheric ozone from 20 to 70 km). H2O microwave (vertical profiles water vapor from about 20 to 80 km). ClO microwave (vertical profiles of ClO from about 25 to 45 km, depending on latitude). Ultraviolet/Visible spectrograph (column abundance of ozone, NO2, and, at some latitudes, OClO and BrO). Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (column abundances of a broad range of species including ozone, HCl, NO, NO2, <b>ClONO2,</b> and HNO3).|$|E
40|$|Atmospherically-relevant surface {{reactions}} were studied. These {{reactions were}} investigated to {{provide insight into}} the products formed on sea salt atmospheric particle surfaces, the quantitative distribution of species on the surface of model sea salt particles, and the molecular environment of the interfacial region of HNO₃/H₂O ices. The reactions of model sea salt particles (NaCl) exposed to mineral acids (HNO₃ and H₂SO₄) were studied using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The reaction of powdered NaCl with HNO₃ was studied using Raman spectroscopy. NaNO₃ growth was monitored as a function of HNO₃ exposure in a flow cell. Mode-specific changes in the NO₃- vibrational mode intensities with HNO₃ exposure suggest a rearrangement of the NaNO₃ film with coverage. In the absence of H₂O, intensities of NaNO₃ bands increase with HNO₃ exposure until a capping layer of NaNO₃ forms. The capping layer prevents subsequent HNO₃ from reacting with the underlying. The reaction of NaCl with H₂SO₄ is investigated using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman spectra are consistent with the formation of NaHSO 4 with no evidence for Na₂SO₄. The spectra indicate that the phase of NaHSO₄ varies with the amount of H₂O in the H₂SO₄. The reaction produces anhydrous β-NaHSO₄ which undergoes a phase change to anhydrous α-NaHSO₄. AFM measurements on NaCl (100) show the formation of two distinct types of NaHSO 4 structures consistent in shape with α-NaHSO₄ and β-NaHSO₄. Model sea salt particles were gown from solution to determine the surface Br/Cl of crystals grown from solution. These studies show surface Br concentration is 35 times that of the bulk concentration. This data is useful in the understanding of enhanced volatile Br compounds in the Arctic troposphere. Thin films of model polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) surfaces were studied in ultrahigh vacuum. Low temperature data show the preferential orientation of HNO₃ on crystalline H₂O ice. Thermodynamically-stable HNO₃ · 3 H₂O is formed at ∼ 170 K, and subsequently desorbs from the surface. These studies show the chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy in this chemical system. Studies of <b>ClONO₂</b> adsorption onto crystalline H₂O ice suggest that <b>ClONO₂</b> is weakly adsorbed...|$|E
40|$|The {{scheme of}} multiwave laser source, {{suitable}} for simultaneous probing ozone and chemicals critically related to ozone (such as HCl, <b>ClONO₂,</b> N₂O₅, HNO₃) participating in its formation and destruction, when using differential absorption with scattering method (DIAS) for sounding, is suggested. Such a source may consist of excimer laser complex complemented with a converter implementing Stimulated Raman Scattering phenomena. Both complex and converter are assembled and operate using “oscillator-amplifier” optical scheme, which provides simultaneous generation at few wavelengths {{in a wide}} spectral range due to discrete Raman conversion with its fine tuning due to complex implementation. Experimental pattern of 3 -waves laser source elaborated with this scheme is described. In our attempt laser source consists of XeCl*-excimer laser complex supplemented with SRS-converter with dense hydrogen. Possibilities of simultaneous generation at three lines - 308, 353 nm {{and one of the}} wide set: 414, 499, 635 or 855 nm – with fine tuning of all lines within up to 1 nm are demonstrated. The advantages of offered scheme and difficulties in its realization are discussed...|$|E
