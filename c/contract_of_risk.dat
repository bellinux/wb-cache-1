This paper attempts to empirically investigate the link between institutional quality and economic performance in a group of 72 countries during 1980 – 2001, using the dynamic panel data analysis. Five institutional indicators that represent the overall institutional infrastructure of an economy are employed, namely corruption, rule of law, bureaucracy, repudiation <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> expropriation. The empirical results demonstrate that institutions variables are statistically significant determinants of economic performance. The finding also suggests that the effects of institutional quality vary according to the level of economic development, where institutions are more responsive in the low-income and middle-income countries.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the labour market has {{undergone}} a profound transformation, with precarious employment conditions {{a fact of life}} for an increasingly large section of the workforce.  Elizabeth Cotton explains how this change has been driven by the <b>contracting</b> out <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and duties <b>of</b> the employer vis-a-vis employees onto others. However there are problems within the existing literature on the subject, which are likely to impede meaningful social responses unless they are addressed.   The debate about regulating precarious work is a defining one in the field of employment relations, challenging established management practices and questioning the entire contents of business school libraries. Despite the trend of flexibilisation and development of global production systems being in evidence since the 1970 s, the precarious work debate is a relatively young one, in part trying to understand this process of externalization. Externalisation is the trend of obtaining labour from outside a corporation’s boundaries, linked to the strategy <b>of</b> outsourcing and <b>contracting</b> out.

Although subjective probabilities and Bayesian methods are applied successfully in other industries to manage 'subjective' risks similar to those encountered in construction contracts, very little is reported on the application of such methods for analysing risks in construction contracts. An investigation has been carried out into using subjective expert opinions and Bayesian methods in construction contract {{risk analysis}}.
