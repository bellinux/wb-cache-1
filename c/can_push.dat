5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she <b>can</b> <b>push</b> her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material <b>can</b> <b>push</b> directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|Daniel persuades Amy {{to return}} and she {{introduces}} Paul to her son Jimmy (Darcy Tadich). Paul and Jimmy bond, but when he buys Jimmy expensive presents, Amy returns them. Paul fires Kyle from the council's beautification project after he fails to reprimand a handyman for sexually harassing Amy. She convinces him to give Kyle his job back. Paul learns that Sheila {{had a crush on}} him, after Jimmy blackmails her. They later clear the air. Paul gives Amy a job as his executive assistant, but she quits after making a mistake which costs Lassiter's money. Paul proposes to Naomi and she accepts, but she soon has doubts. After an argument, she has a one-night stand with Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Paul forgives Naomi and they agree to call off their engagement. He then decides to get revenge on Josh by getting his good behaviour bond revoked by paying someone to plant illegal peptides in his bag. Naomi breaks up with Paul and leaves for a job overseas. Paul pays Jimmy's father to leave town, resulting in Jimmy not wanting to spend time with him. Paul plans to close Erinsborough High and sell the land to Eden Hills Grammar, so he <b>can</b> <b>push</b> through a luxury housing development. Paul is blackmailed and his personal emails are sent to the media, resulting in him receiving death threats. He hires Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to be his bodyguard. Amy finds a petition to save the school in Paul's penthouse and he confesses to stealing it from Susan's office {{on the day of the}} fire. He is later fired as mayor and the bank calls in his loans, leaving him in financial difficulty.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh {{is prone}} to floods, tornadoes and cyclones. Also, there is {{evidence}} that earthquakes pose a threat to the country, and that tectonics have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically. It has also been shown that rainy-season flooding in Bangladesh, on the world's largest river delta, <b>can</b> <b>push</b> the underlying crust down by as much as 6centimetres, and possibly perturb faults.|$|E

25|$|Long legs {{increase}} {{the time and}} distance over which a jumping animal <b>can</b> <b>push</b> against the substrate, thus allowing more power and faster, farther jumps. Large leg muscles can generate greater force, resulting in improved jumping performance. In addition to elongated leg elements, many jumping animals have modified foot and ankle bones that are elongated and possess additional joints, effectively adding more segments to the limb and even more length.|$|E
25|$|Cooling between 2006 and 2008, for instance, {{was likely}} driven by La Niña, the {{opposite}} of El Niño conditions. The area of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures that defines La Niña conditions <b>can</b> <b>push</b> global temperatures downward, if the phenomenon is strong enough. Even accounting {{for the presence of}} internal climate variability, recent years rank among the warmest on record. For example, every year of the 2000s was warmer than the 1990 average.|$|E
25|$|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player {{controls}} {{one of three}} characters at various points in the game: Frodo Baggins, Aragorn, and Gandalf, each of whom has their own weapons and abilities. Frodo is the only character who can jump, shimmy along ledges and sneak. Only Frodo and Gandalf <b>can</b> <b>push</b> and pull items. Gandalf is the only character who has access to magic. Aragorn has the most health, is physically the strongest character and has more melee combat moves.|$|E

25|$|We treat R1 as an {{inference}} rule, {{even though}} it is like an axiom in having no premises, because it is a domain-independent rule along with R2 and R3 common to all equational axiomatizations, whether of groups, rings, or any other variety. The only entity specific to Boolean algebras is axiom schema A1. In this way when talking about different equational theories we <b>can</b> <b>push</b> the rules to one side as being independent of the particular theories, and confine attention to the axioms as {{the only part of the}} axiom system characterizing the particular equational theory at hand.|$|E
25|$|A pet door (also {{known as}} a cat flap or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a rubber flap, {{or it may be}} an actual door hinged on the top that the pet <b>can</b> <b>push</b> through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only {{allowing}} pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to heavy}} pollution, the East River is {{dangerous}} to people who fall in or attempt to swim in it, although as of mid-2007 the water was cleaner {{than it had been}} in decades. As of 2010, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) categorizes the East River as Use Classification I, meaning it is safe for secondary contact activities such as boating and fishing. According to the marine sciences section of the DEP, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots, just as it does in the Hudson River on the other side of Manhattan. That speed <b>can</b> <b>push</b> casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.|$|E

25|$|Each {{character}} class features special abilities unique to that class, {{as well as}} a shared set of attributes which can be developed by performing tasks and completing quests. In general, for a particular game the maximum value which can be reached for an ability is 100*. Quest for Glory V allows stat bonuses which <b>can</b> <b>push</b> an attribute over the maximum and lets certain classes raise certain attributes beyond the normal limits. Quest for Glory V also features special kinds of equipment which lower some stats while raising others. At the beginning of each game, the player may assign points to certain attributes, and certain classes only have specific attributes enabled, although skills can be added for an extra cost.|$|E
25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait. The blue runner {{has a reputation as}} an excellent gamefish on light tackle, taking both fish baits, as well a variety of lures including hard-bodied bibbed lures, spoons, metal jigs and soft plastic jigs. The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and <b>can</b> <b>push</b> 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
25|$|In Zombi U, a first-person {{survival}} horror game set in London, {{the player}} is {{a survivor of}} a zombie apocalypse. They are contacted by the Prepper, a mysterious figure who tasks them {{to find a cure}} for the infection. The player has a number of ways to deal with enemies, and can confront the zombies with firearms, land mines, and Molotov cocktails. They can use an unbreakable cricket bat, which does less damage than other weapons. There are several types of zombies, including those which explode, are armored, or spill corrosive fluid. The zombies are sensitive to light, and are attracted to a player who is using a flashlight or flare. Sound produced by firearms will also attract nearby enemies to a player, who <b>can</b> <b>push</b> them away with their weapon. The player can also use stealth to avoid being noticed by enemies.|$|E
