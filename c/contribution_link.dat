50|$|Whereas a <b>contribution</b> <b>link</b> from {{a studio}} to a DTH uplink centre is usually {{provided}} {{within a single}} satellite footprint, the Astra 4A/Sirius 4 satellite provides for an innovative intercontinental <b>contribution</b> <b>link</b> service using a single Ka-band transponder with a European footprint and a Ku-band transponder serving southern Africa. Contribution feeds can be transferred from one region to the other, and in one frequency band to the other, in a single satellite hop.|$|E
50|$|A Satellite <b>contribution</b> <b>link</b> {{or service}} is a means to {{transport}} video programming by a satellite link from a remote source (such as an outside broadcast unit) to a broadcaster's studio or from the studio to a satellite TV uplink centre (for onward distribution by DTH, cable etc.).|$|E

A theoretical elaboration on the actual meaning and recent history of the concepts 'CSR' and 'development' is combined with two existing theoretical <b>contributions</b> <b>linking</b> CSR to development.

Such a fund could be similar to the option presented above in the sense of <b>contributions</b> <b>linked</b> to GDP but could probably be also linked to the output gap as a measure of cyclical conditions. The key problem of such an indicator is that the “real-time output gap” is not very reliable. This fund, however, on the expenditure side could finance large-scale public investments to boost the economic potential of the area.|$|R

Different goal evaluation algorithms (using qualitative values, quantitative satisfaction values between − 100 and + 100, or a mix of both types) for GRL are discussed by Amyot et al. ([2010]).|$|R
40|$|Do {{incumbent}} cable TV firms act {{to deter}} entry by cities? I use {{variation in the}} costs for a city to enter and operate in local cable TV markets to show that incumbent cable TV firms use system upgrades to deter entry by cities. Interestingly, incumbent cable TV firms do not use system upgrades to deter entry by private firms. My research demonstrates that private incumbents actively engage in behavior designed to deter potential entry by public agencies. This <b>contribution</b> <b>links</b> two important bodies of literature: privatization and entry deterrence. This result also suggests that threat of entry may be a mechanism that a public agency can use to control incumbent firm behavior...|$|R
40|$|The Hall {{effect has}} been studied {{in a series of}} AuFe samples in the {{re-entrant}} concentration range, as well as in part of the spin glass range. An anomalous Hall <b>contribution</b> <b>linked</b> to the tilting of the local spins can be identified, confirming theoretical predictions of a novel topological Hall term induced when chirality is present. This effect can be understood in terms of Aharonov-Bohm-like intrinsic current loops arising from successive scatterings by canted local spins. The experimental measurements indicate that the chiral signal persists, meaning scattering within the nanoscopic loops remains coherent, up to temperatures of the order of 150 K.

40|$|Goal models allow {{software}} {{engineers to}} model software system requirements and stake holder objectives {{at a high}} level of abstraction. We extend the use of goal models by presenting a probability model for them. The probability model can be used to compute the probability of satisfaction and denial of goals, and may have other applications as well. In our probability model, goal satisfaction and denial is expressed as a function of leaf level tasks being satisfied and denied given that all <b>contribution</b> <b>links</b> are satisfied. We also translate goal models to Bayesian networks that satisfy our probability model. Using Bayesian networks allows for the probability to be calculated efficiently, which we demonstrate in our experimental evaluation. Furthermore, using Bayesian networks allows the research on Bayesian networks to be applied on goal models. ...|$|R

Most current revisions of SMPTE 372M, SMPTE 424M and EBU Tech 3299 require YCbCr color space and 4:2:2 chroma subsampling for transmitting 1080p50 (nominally 2.08 Gbit/s) and 1080p60 signal. Studies from 2009 show that for digital broadcasts compressed with H.264/AVC, transmission bandwidth savings of interlaced video over fully progressive video are minimal even when using twice the frame rate; i.e., 1080p50 signal (50 progressive frames per second) actually produces the same bit rate as 1080i50 signal (25 interlaced frames or 50 sub-fields per second).|$|R

40|$|This <b>contribution</b> <b>links</b> {{psychological}} {{models of}} emotion regulation to sociological accounts of emotion work {{to demonstrate the}} extent to which emotion regulation is systematically shaped by culture and society. I first discuss a well-established two-factor process model of emotion regulation and argue that a substantial proportion of emotion regulatory goals are derived from emotion norms. In contrast to universal emotion values and hedonic preferences, emotion norms are highly specific to social situations and institutional contexts. This specificity is determined by social cognitive processes of categorization and guided by framing rules. Second, I argue that the possibilities for antecedent-focused regulation, in particular situation selection and modification, are not arbitrarily available to individuals. Instead, they depend on economic, cultural, and social resources. I suggest that the systematic and unequal distribution of these resources in society leads to discernible patterns of emotion and emotion regulation across groups of individuals...|$|R
