40|$|Abstract: This paper {{estimates}} the indirect <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> workplace accidents in New Zealand for 1995. A ratio of indirect to direct <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> 1 : 2. 9 is established. Given that this ratio is generally {{lower than that}} in other studies, explanations for its magnitude are explored. Literature review Several writers have long argued that the full <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> accidents greatly exceed the obvious, insurance costs (see e. g. Heinrich, 1959). They have also claimed that studies which identify and publicise the additional costs would raise the awareness of employers, in particular, and motivate more aggressive efforts at accident prevention (Klen, 1989; Laufer, 1987; Leathers and Williams, 1984; Leopold and Leonard, 1987). This belief has prompted many researchers to study the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> accidents and to compare the magnitude of non-insurance and insurance costs. Most researchers {{have focused on the}} <b>work</b> accident <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> particular industries, and have solicited work accident victims and their supervisors for information on costs. Other researchers have focused on the <b>work</b> accident <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> whole economies, and have relied on large-scale surveys and a host of assumptions to make <b>cost</b> estimates. Studies <b>of</b> industries have generally found that the non-insurance <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> accidents are no more than a third <b>of</b> insurance <b>costs</b> (Laufer, 1987...|$|R

40|$|Unpredictable {{events are}} typical for {{construction}} projects, {{and therefore the}} use {{of knowledge and skills}} applicable to project control is essential for improved consequent larger chance of achieving planned scope. The thesis presents theoretical background of construction project time and cost management, and the basics of Earned Value Method (EVM). A method is used for integrating project scope, schedule and cost (resources), and for objectively measuring project performance and progress. Performance is measured by determining the budgeted <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> performed (i. e., earned value) and comparing it to the actual <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> performed (i. e., actual cost). Progress is measured by comparing the earned value to the budgeted <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> scheduled (i. e., planned value). The second part of the thesis presents the application of the theoretical background to a case study. It can be concluded that several advantages are introduced in the control system when using EVM; it enables comprehensive project follow-up and provides more realistic view on a state of a project than any other schedule or cost information itself. However, {{it is also important to}} determine the cause of a variance in schedule and cost varience determination and to decide, if corrective action is required...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to managing technical and schedule performance, large and complex projects require that cost performance be monitored and reviewed at regular intervals. To measure cost performance, planned value (or BCWS - Budgeted <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> Scheduled) and earned value (or BCWP - Budgeted <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> Performed) {{must be in}} units of currency (the same units that actual costs are measured.) In large implementations, the planned value curve is commonly called a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) and may be arranged in control accounts, summary-level planning packages, planning packages and work packages. In large projects, establishing control accounts is the primary method of delegating responsibility and authority to {{various parts of the}} performing organization. Control accounts are cells of a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix, which is the intersection of the project WBS and the organizational breakdown structure (OBS). Control accounts are assigned to Control Account Managers (CAMs). Large projects require more elaborate processes for controlling baseline revisions, more thorough integration with subcontractor EVM systems, and more elaborate management of procured materials.|$|R
