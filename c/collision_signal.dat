40|$|According to the ISO 18000 - 6 C passive RFID standard, {{the tags}} rely on limited energy {{harvested}} from the reader carrier wave {{rather than an}} internal power supply to perform logic functions and backscatter signals. The reader receives the tag's backscattered response, and then decodes the tag signal in order to access the tag information. However, in a tag intensive environment, when multiple tags receive the reader Query command and respond simultaneously, the reader may receive multiple responses giving what is termed a <b>collision</b> <b>signal.</b> Because the <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> violates the encoding as specified in the standard, the reader {{is not able to}} decode it using its built-in circuitry that is designed for non-colliding tag responses. Therefore, the reader fails to complete the inventory for tags in the field in this case, which degrades the overall performance of the passive RFID system requiring retries. This research focuses on resolving the two-tag <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> with extensions to more tags. A preliminary tag data acquisition system has been developed along with an ISO 18000 - 6 C conformance test platform, which consists of an FPGA-based software defined reader. The <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> is obtained from the data acquisition system and processed by the FPGA in real time. Two types of collision resolving algorithms based on phase and amplitude characteristics of the <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> are developed and simulated using LabVIEW on a host PC and then realized with a National Instruments FPGA development board NI 5640 R. These two algorithms deal with the two-tag collision situation with and without a distinct phase shift individually, and they can be unified. As an extension to multiple tag collision resolution, an advanced statistical signal processing method using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is researched for the three-tag collision situation. The ICA simulation is performed using LabVIEW on the host PC, and then implemented on the target FPGA development board. Performance analysis and comparison are presented to prove the efficiency and timing conformance of the proposed methods to the standard. Finally, the collision signals acquired from moving tags are resolved using the amplitude mapping method to prove the method compatibility on dynamic tags...|$|E

The collision energy was tuned in three different ways: (1) by changing {{the temperature of the}} valve that releases the argon atoms, (2) by changing the velocity of the stored packets of ammonia, and (3) by choosing which part of the argon packet, dispersed during its 1.2 m traversal from the valve to the synchrotron, is probed by the ammonia molecules.

Our next goal is to determine the relative (integral, total) cross sections from the measured loss rates. In order to determine these, a detailed understanding of how the ammonia molecules move through the argon packets is required. Which parts of the argon packet do the ammonia molecules encounter? What are the velocities of the argon atoms in these parts? What is the density of the argon beam in these parts? To answer these questions, trajectory simulations will be performed. The goal of the simulations is to find (1) an expectation value for the amount of encountered argon atoms, and (2) the corresponding distribution of collision energy.|$|E
40|$|A cross-layer scheme, namely ALOHA With Collision Resolution (ALOHA-CR), is {{proposed}} for high throughput wireless communications in a cellular scenario. Transmissions {{occur in a}} time-slotted ALOHA-type fashion but with an important difference: simultaneous transmissions of two users can be successful. If more than two users transmit in the same slot the collision cannot be resolved and retransmission is required. If only one user transmits, the transmitted packet is recovered with some probability, depending {{on the state of}} the channel. If two users transmit the collision is resolved and the packets are recovered by first over-sampling the <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> and then exploiting independent information about the two users that is contained in the signal polyphase components. The ALOHA-CR throughput is derived under the infinite backlog assumption and also under the assumption of finite backlog. The contention probability is determined under these two assumptions in order to maximize the network throughput and maintain stability. Queuing delay analysis for network users is also conducted. The performance of ALOHA-CR is demonstrated on the Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP) test-bed containing five software defined radio nodes.

40|$|Most {{artificial}} learning systems converge after {{a certain}} number of interations but the final weight distribution cannot be predicted or calculated from the initatial conditions. In several cases general boundary conditions can be devised to guarantee convergence (e. g. Hopfield networks). In this study we use the Isotropic Sequence Order (ISO) learning rule to show that the final weights of an agent which learns in complex environment can be calculated analytically. The ISO learning rule is a differential Hebbian learning rule for temporal sequence learning. Weight change is defined as the correlation between the band-pass filtered input ui and the derivative of the output v: dρi/dt = μ ui v ´ where μ is the learning rate. Ultimately the temporal difference between two input signals T drives the learning (Fig. 1 a). In our experiments we use a simulated robot with vision and collision sensors to this end. The robot has a built-in retraction reflex as soon as it touches an obstacle. Its goal is to avoid this by using the signals from its vision sensors for steering. Consequentially their weights are initially zero and will develop through ISO-learning. Temporal intervals T are determined as the differences between the earlier vision signal and the later following <b>collision</b> <b>signal.</b> In an older study (Porr and Wörgötter, 2003) we have shown {{that it is possible to}} calculate eac...|$|E

30|$|Although several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to create samples of cold molecules [7 – 10], the obtained densities are low (typically 108 molecules/cm 3). As the cross sections of collisions involving neutral molecules or atoms are small (typically below 500 Å 2), the main challenge to studying cold collisions is to reach a sufficiently high sensitivity. In recent years, several experiments have managed to measure low energy collisions by leveraging the unique properties of the systems they study. For instance, by exploiting the extreme state-purity of Stark-decelerated beams combined with sensitive ion-detection techniques, van de Meerakker and co-workers have measured quantum-state changing collisions of OH and NO molecules with rare gas atoms to temperatures as low as 5 K [11 – 14]. Costes and co-workers have studied inelastic collisions of O 2 and CO with H 2 molecules and helium at energies between 5 and 30 K using cryogenically cooled beams under a small (and variable) crossing angle [15 – 17]. Even lower temperatures have been obtained by using magnetic or electric guides to merge two molecular beams. Narevicius and co-workers and Osterwalder and co-workers have exploited the advantages of metastable helium to study Penning ionization reactions with various atoms and molecules [18 – 26]. In a similar fashion, Merkt and co-workers have measured collisions between ground-state hydrogen molecules and hydrogen in highly excited Rydberg states that were merged on a chip [27]. Finally, cold collision have been studied by sending slow beams of atoms and molecules through trapped samples of calcium ions [28, 29], lithium atoms [30] and OH radicals [31], exploiting the fact that <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> can be accumulated over long time-intervals.|$|E

Transmission {{occurs in a}} time-slotted ALOHA-type fashion with a caveat: simultaneous transmissions of two users can be successful. The wireless channel {{is assumed to be}} flat fading and constant over the duration of one time slot. A user i with a non-empty queue transmits a packet with some probability p in the beginning of each time slot, after waiting for a random time interval τi. If more than two users transmit in the same slot, the collision cannot be resolved, the packets are discarded and the users are asked to retransmit at a later time. If only one user transmits, the transmitted packet is recovered with some probability, depending {{on the state of the}} channel. If two users transmit, the collision can be separated and the packets recovered by first oversampling the <b>collision</b> <b>signal</b> and then exploiting independent information about the two users that is contained in the signal polyphase components. The properties of the user delays τi’s are determined so that the probability of user separation is maximized. The ALOHA-CR throughput is derived under the infinite backlog assumption, i. e., the network users always have data in their queues, and also under the assumption of finite backlog. In the infinite backlog assumption, the optimal contention probability is calculated, which maximizes the system throughput. In the finite backlog assumption, the region of contention probability is determined based on the packet arrival rate. Queuing delay of network users are also derived. The performance of ALOHA-CR is demonstrated on a WARP testbed containing five software defined radio nodes.
