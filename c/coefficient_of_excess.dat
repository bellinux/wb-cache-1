As part of the verification study, the scatterer density was determined from the kurtosis of the reverberation quadrature pdf. A statistical analysis of this procedure points to reduced estimate accuracy with decreasing kurtosis. Additional computer simulations show that the chosen pdf family, developed under the assumption of a Poissonscatterer distribution, is flexible enough to fit reverberation data generated by non‐Poisson scatterer distributions exhibiting a degree of clustering or regularity.

This work introduces a new in-dex that measures the interobserver variability, which is {{defined in terms of}} the distances among the ‘true values ’ assigned by different observers on the same subject. The new coefficient of interobserver variability (CIV) is defined as the ratio of the interobserver and the total observer variability. We show how to estimate the CIV and how to use bootstrap and ANOVA-based methods for inference. We also develop a <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> observer variability, which compares the total observer variability to the expected to-tal observer variability when there are no differences among the observers. This coefficient is a simple function of the CIV. In addition, we show how the value of the CIV, estimated from an agreement study, can be used in the design of measurements studies.

40|$|Fuels {{derived from}} biomass are an {{alternative}} {{solution for the}} fossil fuel shortage. Usually this kind of fuels is called low calorific value fuels, due to the large proportion of inert components in their composition. The most common is carbon dioxide, and its proportion in biogas can be different, from 10 up to 40 %, or even more. The presence of inert component {{in the composition of}} biogas causes the problems that are related with flame blow off limits. One of the possibilities for efficient combustion of biogas is the combustion in swirling flow including a pilot burner, aimed to expand the borders of stable combustion. This paper presents an analysis of the influence of the carbon dioxide content to the nitrogen oxides emissions. Laboratory biogas was used with different content of CO 2 (10, 20, 30 and 40 %). Investigation was carried out for different nominal powers, coefficients of excess air and carbon dioxide content. With increasing content of carbon dioxide, emission of nitrogen oxides was reduced, and this trend was the same throughout the whole range of excess air, carried out through measurements. Still, the influence of carbon dioxide content is significantly less than the influence of excess air. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> air greatly affects the production of radicals which are essential for the formation of nitrogen oxides, O, OH and CH.

40|$|The use of {{stochastic}} process theory in a structural dynamic analysis is usually restricted to normal processes. Recent {{studies have shown}} that the influence of nonnormality on both fatigue failures and first-excursion failures cannot be neglected. Basically, the aim of this study is to understand the effects of nonnormality on structural dynamics and fatigue, particularly as related to offshore structures. Several related aspects of the problem are studied. The fourth order cumulant function is taken as a reasonable measure of the departure of a process from normality. However, in practice, it is not easy to see the degree of nonnormality of a process directly from the fourth order cumulant function, because of its multidimensional nature. Therefore, the kurtosis or the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> is used as a simpler index to represent the degree of nonnormality. The study significantly extends the usual description of wave forces by deriving a description for the nonnormal part of the wave force. An approximation for the fourth cumulant function (and corresponding three-dimensional power spectral density) of a wave force is obtained. Because the degree of nonnormality of the response of a linear structure subjected to a wave force is not easily obtained, analytical studies are also made for a linear SDF structure subjected to somewhat simpler nonnormal forces. An efficient technique for calculating the response kurtosis is derived. Another aim of this study is to estimate the effect of nonnormality of fatigue damage. Both analytical and simulation results confirm that the effect of nonnormality should not be neglected. Simulation studies are also made for the dynamic response of an idealized structure subjected to a stochastic wave force. It is found the degree of nonnormality of the response is quite substantial, but never exceeds the degree of nonnormality of the excitation, at least for the situations considered...|$|E

40|$|Response nonnormality is {{investigated}} for a yielding primary structure and a linear secondary system (P-S) {{subjected to a}} normally distributed ground acceleration. The nonlinearity considered is bilinear hysteretic (BLH) yielding in the primary structure. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> (COE), which is a normalized fourth cumulant function, {{is used as a}} measure of the nonnormality in the current study. An initial effort focuses on the nonnormality of primary absolute acceleration, since this is the base excitation of a light secondary system. Analytical and numerical results for a nonlinear but nonhysteretic substitute structure are shown to be in good agreement with those from simulation for both mean squared levels and COE of response. It is shown that the acceleration of the primary system can be significantly nonnormal in some situations. Linear substitute methods are used for analytically evaluating the nonnormality of secondary response. The basic concept is to use a linear model with nonnormal excitation to replace the nonlinear primary element with normal excitation, with the goal of matching the trispectrum for the acceleration of these two systems. The trispectrum is the frequency decomposition of the fourth cumulant function. Periodogram analysis (a special FFT technique for obtaining polyspectra) is developed for evaluating the trispectral function of BLH primary acceleration. A two filters model (with a more narrowband fourth cumulant filter) gives good approximations for the COE values of secondary response in most cases including both cascade and noncascade analysis. The probability of failure of secondary response affected by nonnormality due to nonlinearity in the primary is investigated. A nonnormality correction factor (NCF) which is equal to the ratio of the expected life for a Gaussian process to the expected life for the non-Gaussian process is used as an index of the nonnormality effect. Analytical approaches based on knowledge of the first four response cumulants are developed to approximate the NCF values. It is shown that the NCF for first-passage failure generally is more significant than for fatigue failure based on the cases in this study, and both failure modes can be significantly affected by the nonnormality in some situations...|$|E

The values of αE and (∂HmE/∂P) T for ternary mixture { 1 -butanol+cyclohexylamine+n-heptanes} are determined and the experimental data are correlated {{as a function of}} the mole fraction by using the equations of Cibulka, Jasinski and Malanowski, Singe et al., Pintos et al., Calvo et al., Kohler, and Jacob–Fitzner. The results show that the Calvo et al. equation is better than others...|$|R

For the purpose of analysis, nonhomogeneous soils of two layers which have various values <b>of</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability and <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> consolidation were assumed and analyzed by the developed program. According to the results obtained by the analysis, <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> consolidation has great effect on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> pore water pressure and the consolidation settlement whereas <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability has little effect on the characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Densities, viscosities, {{and speed}} of sound have been {{determined}} at T[*]=[*](303. 15, 308. 15, and 313. 15) [*]K for the binary mixtures of methyl benzoate with tetrahydrofuran, 1, 4 -dioxane, anisole, and butyl vinyl ether over {{the entire range of}} composition. Using these measured values, excess volume VE, deviation in viscosities Δη, excess Gibb’s free energy of activation for viscous flow ΔG*E, and deviation in isentropic compressibility Δks have been calculated. These calculated binary data have been fitted to Redlich-Kister equation to determine the appropriate <b>coefficients.</b> The values <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> volume VE and deviation in viscosities Δη are negative over the entire range of composition for all the binary systems at the studied temperatures. The behavior of these parameters with composition of the mixture has been discussed in terms of molecular interactions between the components of liquids...|$|R
40|$|Differences {{in major}} and minor {{histocompatibility}} antigens between donor and recipient trigger powerful graft-versus-host reactions after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The clinical effects of alloreactivity present a Janus-face: detrimental graft-versus-host disease increases non-relapse mortality, beneficial graft-versus-malignancy may cure the recipient. The ultimate consequences on long-term outcome remain a matter of debate. We hypothesized that increasing donor-recipient antigen matching would decrease the negative effects, while preserving antitumor alloreactivity. We analyzed retrospectively a predefined cohort of 32 [*] 838 such patients and compared it to 59 [*] 692 patients with autologous HSCT as reference group. We found a significant and systematic decrease in non-relapse mortality with decreasing phenotypic and genotypic antigen disparity, paralleled by a stepwise increase in overall and relapse-free survival (Spearman correlation <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> cumulative <b>excess</b> event rates at 5 years 0. 964; P< 0. 00; respectively 0. 976; P< 0. 00). We observed this systematic stepwise effect in all main disease and disease-stage categories. The results suggest that detrimental effects of alloreactivity are additive with each step of mismatching; the beneficial effects remain preserved. Hence, {{if there is a}} choice, the best match should be donor of choice. The data support an intensified search for predictive genomic and environmental factors of 'no-graft-versus-host disease'...|$|R
