The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical features of pulmonary TB in diabetics in our region. Methods: The present prospective observational study was carried out on all consecutive smear-positive pulmonary TB patients with DM admitted in department of pulmonary medicine, Guru Gobind Sing Hospital & Shree M. P. Shah Medical College, Jamnagar, between October 2005 to September 2006. Results: Total 38 cases were included in study. The male: female ratio was 2. 8 : 1. The mean (&# 177; standard deviation) age of was 50. 5 (&# 177; 13. 5) years. The majority of patients were between 51 - 60 years. The incidence was started to rise from the age of 30 years and declined from the age 61 years. Elderly patients (age > 50 years) had less incidence of fever, chest pain, haemoptysis and higher incidence of dyspnoea as compared to young adults (age < 50 years). Conclusion: A diagnosis of TB should be considered in diabetics with an abnormal chest radiograph, in the presence or absence of specific clinical symptoms, in endemic regions. Level of blood sugar and age doesn&# 8217;t affect much in <b>bacteriological</b> <b>and</b> <b>radiological</b> presentation of pulmonary TB except the cavities which is more common in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.

Patients and methodsA retrospective study was conducted over 21 years on files of hospital patients admitted for infectious sacroiliitis. ResultsOf the 2995 patients admitted, 359 suffered from infectious arthritis, and 18 cases suffered from infectious sacroiliitis (5 %). The mean age at admission of those 18 patients (seven men, eleven women) was 34. 22 ± 13. 5 years while the mean disease duration was 22. 05 ± 41. 9 days. The onset was sudden in 14 patients. The sacroiliitis was essentially unilateral (17 patients). The pain which was essentially inflammatory (16 patients), had irradiated in 14 patients. Fever was observed in 16 patients while weight loss was seen in 11. The infectious gate {{has been found in}} 15 patients (88. 3 %) with a post-partum period in five patients (27. 8 %). Limpness has occurred in 12 patients. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was high in 13 patients with a mean of 78. 83 ± 15. 21 mm/ 1 st hour. Of the 18 patients, pathogenic agents were isolated in 8 (Staphylococcus aureus: 7 cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis: 1) and probable infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in another. Pathogenic agents were detected by cytobacteriological examination of vaginal sample in 5, urine in 2, sputum in 1 and psoas puncture in another. The mean antibiotic therapy duration was 3. 25 ± 3. 1 months. Followed up 6 -months later the patients improved well.

40|$|Abstract * * World wide, {{bacterial}} {{indicators are}} used to detect the possible contamination of water with faecal matter, and therefore potentially disease causing organisms. One {{of the most common}} indicators used is the so called faecal coliforms. The faecal coliform group contains organisms including E. coli which are found in the gut of warm blooded animals. However, the group also contains organisms which are definitely not of faecal origin and are not pathogenic. Internationally, there has been a movement towards using E. coli itself as the faecal indicator as it gives a better correlation with the epidemiology of gastrointestinal and other diseases contracted through exposure to water.

40|$|Summary: A {{study of}} plasma copper and zinc level was {{conducted}} in 46 normal subjects and 94 patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. 64 patients had received specific anti-tuberculosis therapy for over one month and 30 were previously untreated. Plasma copper and zinc levels were recorded initially in all patients and subsequently after 1, 2 & 3 months chemotherapy in the latter group ouly. Itwas found that pulmonary tuberculosis is characterised by rise in level of plasma copper and decline in plasma zinc level. Only 14 patients did not register any alteration in their levels Highly significant correlation was established between the level of these trace elements {{and the presence of}} acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, extent of pulmonary involvement, and the nature of lesions seen on chest X-ray.
