The design and experimental performance results from a 0. 1 -full scale model of the highest speed corner (M = 0. 35) are presented and discussed along with some two dimensional inviscid analyses of two vaned corners. With a vane designed by an inverse two dimensional technique, the overall <b>corner</b> <b>loss</b> was about 12 % of the inlet dynamic pressure of which about 4 % was caused by vane skin friction.

40|$|Abstract. The {{flat plate}} {{collector}} {{is one of}} the most widely used device for harnessing solar energy. Measurement of various losses occurring in a flat plate collector is important for design as well as evaluation for efficiency under different conditions. The major part of overall heat loss is the top heat loss. The various losses such as bottom loss, side loss, edge loss, <b>corner</b> <b>loss,</b> sealing loss & top loss etc, are measured as well as recorded. There are forty eight thermocouples located at different points. In the present paper, a flat plate collector of size 1. 21 m x 0. 71 m x 0. 16 m is used. The various losses are measured & evaluated under steady state conditions. The losses are measured at constant heat input flux by keeping wind velocity & tilt angle at zero value...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] The {{tests were}} made by {{replacing}} the existing centre six thick vanes at the first corner of the 4 x 3 -ft wind tunnel by vanes of sheet metal. The thin vanes reduced the-corner loss, estimated from a wake traverse behind one vane, without any deterioration in outflow, and are therefore recommended for use in future wind tunnels. 1. Introducgion. [...] The cascades fitted {{at the corners of}} return-circuit wind-tunnels are usually composed of vanes of an appreciable thickness, giving passages of approximately constant area round the corners. Such vanes, whilst quite satisfactory in operation, are difficult and expensive to construct. A need, therefore, was felt for further information on the use of thin vanes made of sheet metal, under actual operating conditions, tests 1, 2 at low Reynolds number having shown that there is little difference in the <b>corner</b> <b>loss</b> for thick and thin vanes. Accordingly, comparative tests were made on thick and thin vanes fitted at the first corner of the 4 x 3 -ft wind tunneP. Originally, thick vanes (Fig. la) were fitted, there being fourteen vanes of gap: chord ratio 0. 25. The six centre thick vanes were replaced by sheet metal vanes following the lines of the convex surface of the thick ones (Fig. lb). The tunnel section approaching the corner is circular and has a diameter of 6 ft...|$|E

40|$|In {{urban and}} dense {{suburban}} environments where future cells {{will be reduced}} in size, accurate propagation prediction in microcells will play an important role. Such propagation prediction for the line-of-sight (LOS) path in microcells is already well developed. However, the situation for the non-LOS (NLOS) path, such as that around corners and parallel streets, is much less well understood. In this thesis an investigation into techniques for improving NLOS microcell propagation prediction is provided. Specifically, two approaches are investigated, {{one of which is}} based on ray tracing whilst the other is based on empirical modelling. In the ray tracing approach, the formalism of a high frequency electromagnetic approximation known as the Uniform Theory of Diffraction is applied to the microcell environment. Rays reflected from the building walls and road in conjunction with diffraction from corners are utilised to give an estimate of the field strength. In the empirical approach, the already well established LOS model is adapted to incorporate additional <b>corner</b> <b>loss</b> factors and also side street path loss for NLOS propagation prediction. The computer implementation of these models is also detailed and simulation results are also provided. These are used to illustrate the effects of corners, side streets and material parameters on the propagation characteristics. Finally, comparisons of the simulation results to actual DCS 1800 microcell propagation measurement results from Hong Kong are made. These allow the accuracy of our models to be established...|$|E

This periodicity {{allow us}} to manipulate light in ways {{that have not been}} possible before. As a result, photonic crystal waveguide components {{play a significant role in}} integrated optical circuit design because waveguides allow only certain electromagnetic wave modes to propagate inside the structure. There are many corresponding applications that rely on total internal reflection. However, with total internal reflection, there is a problem in guiding light through sharp <b>corners,</b> large optical <b>losses</b> occur around tight curves with a small bending radius. A simple explanation for these losses is that the angle of the incident light too low for total internal reflection when wave turns through a sharp corner. Thus, an unacceptable fraction of the electromagnetic energy is radiated out of the waveguide. To overcome this difficulty, in this thesis, we demonstrate a novel method for guiding light through sharp corners, using a 1 photonic crystal slab waveguide for the straight sections, and assisted by 2 D Line Defect Waveguide at the corners. Plane Wave Method and Supercell Method are used to Figure out parameters and obtain the guided mode for our proposed structure. Then, numerical simulations (FDTD) reveal nearly perfect transmission at certain frequency ranges. Also, in this thesis different corner elements are used to show highly efficient transmission of light through sharp corners. Thus, light can be guided through a 90. <b>corner,</b> almost without <b>loss,</b> by using different corner elements.

However, the energy input {{was high and}} flow mixing was poor. Thus, the ARID-HV (High Velocity Algae Raceway Integrated Design) raceway was developed to reduce energy input requirements and improve flow mixing. This was accomplished by improving pumping efficiency and using a serpentine flow pattern in which the water flows through channels instead of over barriers. A prototype ARID-HV system was installed in Tucson, Arizona, and the constructability, reliability of components, drainage of channels, and flow and energy requirements of the ARID-HV raceway were evaluated. Each of the electrical energy inputs to the raceway (air sparger, air tube blower, canal lift pump, and channel recirculation pump) was quantified, some by direct measurement and others by simulation. An algae growth model {{was used to determine}} the algae production rate vs. flow depth and time of year. Then the electrical energy requirement of the most effective flow depth was calculated. Channel hydraulics was evaluated with Manning's equation and the <b>corner</b> head <b>loss</b> equation.

40|$|The {{photo scale}} or the ground {{sampling}} distance (GSD) usually is the dominating {{factor for the}} specification of photo flights. For a comparison of cameras not only the nominal number of pixels is important, also the image quality has an influence. The effective resolution, respecting the image quality, can be determined by edge analysis. A sudden change of the brightness in the object space is causing a continuous change of the gray values in a profile across the edge. A differentiation of the gray value profile lead to the point spread function, including the information of effective resolution. DMC, UltraCamD and UltraCamX-images as well as analog aerial photos have been investigated. Of course the effective resolution is depending upon the illumination condition, expressed by the sun elevation, and the atmospheric condition. For the DMC only in one case with 20 ° sun elevation the effective GSD was 5 % larger than the nominal value; this is different for both UltraCam. The calibration reports shows lower modulation transfer functions in the image corners. Under optimal light conditions, with 60 ° sun elevation, the UltraCamD in the center has a loss 4 % of the effective GSD against the nominal value, but in the image <b>corners</b> a <b>loss</b> of 28 % exists.

Lv and Wang [14] designed an image hashing using Fast Johnson Lindenstrauss transform (FJLT) and Fourier Mellin transform (FMT). The author first constructed hash using only FJLT, then combined with FMT to enhance the performance in case of rotation. This method is sensitive to Gaussian low pass filtering and gamma correction.

However, an optical fiber is limited to delivering light to a single target within the three-dimensional structure of the brain. We here demonstrate a multiwaveguide probe capable of independently delivering light to multiple targets along the probe axis, thus enabling versatile optical control of sets of distributed brain targets.

The waveguide array accepts light from a set of sources at the input end and guides the light down each waveguide to an aluminum corner mirror that efficiently deflects light away from the probe axis. Light losses at each stage are small (input coupling loss, 0 : 4 0 : 3 dB; bend loss, negligible; propagation loss, 3 : 1 1 dB=cm using the outscattering method and 3 : 2 0 : 4 dB=cm using the cutback method; <b>corner</b> mirror <b>loss,</b> 1 : 5 0 : 4 dB); a waveguide coupled, for example, to a 5 mW source will deliver over 1 : 5 mW to a target at a depth of 1 cm. © 2010 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 170. 0170, 130. 2755, 130. 3120, 130. 3990, 230. 3990, 230. 7370.

The problem of large deformation is overcome by applying the Eulerian formulation. The problems concerning number of degrees of freedom, calculation time can be overcome by simplifying the model especially at the bearing corner. On the one hand, detailed modeling of the bearing corner will increase {{the complexity of the}} analysis. On the other hand, simplified modeling of the bearing corner will face problems such as locking of the bearing <b>corner</b> node and <b>loss</b> of flow conservation. A sharp corner and modified corner geometry are examples of the simplified modeling. Moreover, boundary conditions will be applied at the bearing corner node in order {{to solve the problem of}} its locking and to satisfy the flow conservation condition.

Nowadays GB-SAR plays prominent role in the studies of many natural phenomenon {{as well as in}} studying some artificial infrastructure or terrain. It is a cost effective solution for the target scenes where it needed continuous monitoring. In this thesis GB-SAR system is experimented to detect moving targets. It should be emphasized that detection of moving target using GB-SAR is very new idea in the research field. As in conventional SAR, defocusing and/or displacement errors for moving target occur during image formation process in GB-SAR too. To detect the moving target, we need to test different Normalized Relative Speed (NRS) until the best focusing of moving target is reached. The research has been carried out in the following way. Firstly several simulations were tested on MATLAB with ideal condition. Secondly real experiments with moving targets were implemented based on the simulation results to collect real SAR data. Finally the data retrieved in the experiments was processed for moving target detection. The experiment was conducted at the Radio Communication Laboratory of Blekinge Institute of Technology. The radar is developed with a vector network analyzer (ENA 5071 C), a double ridge guide horn antenna, a <b>corner</b> reflector, low <b>loss</b> high frequency cables and a antenna positioner. The movement of the radar is determined by a linear track. The developed GB-SAR system is configured as an ultra wideband–ultra wide beam (UWB) system.

Among these floods are common. Flooding refers to an overflow of an expanse of water that submerges land. It is usually due to the volume of water within a body of water, such as a river or lake, exceeding the total capacity of the body, {{and as a result}} some of the water flows or sits outside of the normal perimeter of the body.

60|$|III. A third {{attempt was}} made by a {{different}} method, upon the lineations of a finger print drawn on about a twenty-fold scale. It had first been enlarged four times by photography, and from this enlargement the axes of the ridges had been drawn with a five-fold enlarging pantagraph. The aim now was to reconstruct the entire finger print by two successive and independent acts of interpolation. A sheet of transparent tracing-paper was ruled into six-ridge-interval squares, {{and every one of}} its alternate squares was rendered opaque by pasting white paper upon it, giving it the appearance of a chess-board. When this chequer-work was laid on the print, exactly one half of the six-ridge squares were masked by the opaque squares, while the ridges running up to them could be seen. They were not quite so visible as if each opaque square had been wholly detached from its neighbours, instead of touching them at the extreme <b>corners,</b> still the <b>loss</b> of information thereby occasioned was small, and not worth laying stress upon. It is easily understood that when the chequer-work was moved parallel to itself, through the space of one square, whether upwards or downwards, or to the right or left, the parts that were previously masked became visible, and those that were visible became masked. The object was to interpolate the ridges in every opaque square under one of these conditions, then {{to do the same for}} the remaining squares under the other condition, and finally, by combining the results, to obtain a complete scheme of the ridges wholly by interpolation.
