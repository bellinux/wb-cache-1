Under many franchising arrangements in the fashion industry, to avoid <b>channel</b> <b>conflicts</b> and cannibalization between the franchisee and the brand owner, the brand owner will first supply the product for the franchisee to sell offline in the first period. After that, the brand owner will sell the product online directly in the second period. We explore this online-offline model with the focal points on the choice of franchising contract and the ordering time. By modelling the choices under four different scenarios, we derive the analytical conditions in which one scenario is preferred to another scenario with respect to contract type and ordering time option. We examine the problem {{from the perspectives of}} the brand owner, the franchisee and the supply chain. We identify the situations in which the optimal choices of the brand owner and the supply chain are the same, as well as the conditions when Pareto improvement is achievable.

In this paper, we consider the following question: can free spectrum be shared efficiently? We study this problem {{in the context of}} 802. 11 or WiFi networks. Each access point (AP) in a WiFi network must be assigned a channel for it to service users. There are only finitely many possible channels that can be assigned.

Our algorithms use virtual channels to improve performance by controlled use of <b>channel</b> <b>conflicts.</b> We compare our algorithms to the best known store-and-forward algorithms, cut-through algorithms, and lower bounds.

First, it suggests that the newer, systems-based and inclusive approaches to organizational development practice and theory may overcome shortcomings of earlier approaches to planned change. Second, it argues that co-evolutionary approaches that use complex adaptive systems thinking will more effectively structure such third-generation interventions by focusing on issues at the institutional level. Third, the article examines a dialectical model of institutional change which incorporates activist input and <b>channels</b> <b>conflict</b> into innovative outcomes. Finally, it presents a case example of how a dialectical model combined with a co-evolutionary perspective could foster the institutional change required to facilitate the integration of ecological priorities into the human systems of organizations. 15 page(s...|$|R

Such high-risk conflicts generally occur when one channel targets customer segments already served by an existing channel. This leads to such a deterioration of channel economics that the threatened channel either retaliates against the manufacturer or simply stops selling its product. The result is disintermediation, in which the manufacturer suffers.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to enhance the {{understanding}} of the impact of distribution <b>channel</b> <b>conflicts</b> on the <b>channel</b> efficiency, which has hitherto received little attention in distribution channel literature. Although ‘channel conflict’ as a construct is fairly well researched and its relationship with channel efficiency is explored to some extent, yet the moderating effect of the conflict resolution strategies on the channel efficiency is largely absent in the channel literature. From a behavioral science perspective, the article models the channel conflict-efficiency relationship, for three different types of conflict resolution methods-problem solving, bargaining and politics, in the context of asymmetric power relationships. The managerial implications of these conceptual models lie in making organizations (channel captains), dealing with their channel partners, foresee the possible impacts of their adopted conflict resolution strategies, on their channel efficiency and accordingly maximize returns on the channel investments. ...|$|R
