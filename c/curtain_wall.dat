50|$|Construction of the Falca Lines began {{sometime}} after 1723, {{and they were}} complete by 1732. They consisted of a bastion in the centre, flanked by <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> on either side. The <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> contained several redans.|$|R
5000|$|Later, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of trace italienne fortifications, the height of the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> was reduced, and beyond the ditch, additional outworks such as ravelins and tenailles were added to protect the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> from direct cannonading.|$|R

50|$|Snow {{loads and}} live loads are not {{typically}} {{an issue in}} <b>curtain</b> <b>walls,</b> since <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> {{are designed to be}} vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.|$|R
500|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>walls</b> were {{defensive}} walls enclosing a bailey. They {{had to be}} {{high enough}} to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand bombardment from siege engines which, from the 15thcentury onwards, included gunpowder artillery. A typical wall could be [...] thick and [...] tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> were sometimes given a stone skirt around their bases. Walkways along {{the tops of the}} <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies below, and battlements gave them further protection. <b>Curtain</b> <b>walls</b> were studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall. Arrowslits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13thcentury, for fear that they might compromise the wall's strength.|$|R

5|$|Warkworth Castle is an {{irregular}} enclosure. The keep {{is at the}} north end, overlooking the town, with the bailey to the south. The current keep was built on an earlier mound, known as a motte. The <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> of the bailey dates from the early 13thcentury. There are four towers: Carrickfergus Tower in the south-west corner, Montagu Tower in the south-east, a postern tower in the west wall (north of the kitchen), and Grey Mare's Tail Tower attached to the east wall. Against the east <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> was a stable. In the northern half of the bailey, aligned east–west, was an unfinished 15th-century collegiate church; it was cleared away in the early 16thcentury. Immediately west of the church was the kitchen, situated in {{the angle of the}} <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> as it changes from its north–south alignment and turns towards the keep. Along the west <b>curtain</b> <b>wall,</b> south of the kitchen, were the pantry, great hall, and withdrawing chambers. In the south-west was a chapel. Apart from the north side, the castle was surrounded by a moat.|$|E

A test facility with 3 -storey in height was constructed using steel frame to perform full-scale tests.

To characterize potential threats from window-ejected flame and plume to the glass <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> of upper floors, temperature, heat flux and air velocity at different heights above the opening upon <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> were measured during each test.

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the medieval}} period some castles were {{modified}} to make them defensible against cannons. Glacis consisting of earthen slopes faced with stones were placed in front of the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> and bastions (towers) to absorb the impact of cannon shots or to deflect them. Towers were lowered to the same height as the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> and converted into gun platforms.|$|R
5000|$|During the Eighty Years War (1568-1648) Dutch {{military}} engineers {{developed the}} concepts further lengthening the faces and shortening the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> of the bastions.
