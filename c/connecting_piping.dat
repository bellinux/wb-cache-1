40|$|Abstract — The {{load and}} stress imposed from a <b>connecting</b> <b>piping</b> system can greatly affect the {{reliability}} of an equipment; these loads either from expansion of a pipe or from other source can cause shaft misalignment as well as shell deformation interfering with the internal moving parts. Therefore {{it is important to}} design the piping system to impose a little stress as possible on the equipment, ideally, it is not possible. This project work is focused on to stress analysis of a pump piping system as per process piping codes B 31. 3 by CAESAR-II and rethinking the nozzle allowable loads provided by the pump manufacture, to optimize the design and reduced the design, material as well as manufacturing cost. To achieve this, implement various methods. The loads which are imposed on the pump nozzle can be reduced by possible re-routing the piping system with less modification. But this re-routing of a piping has its practical & layout limitation, so as to overcome this difficulty, explores the methods for setting a higher allowable loads without changing pump manufacturer design consideration and size of pump. A more realistic allowable should be established as per API 610 standard to better balance equipment cost against piping engineering. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{septic tank}} is an {{underground}} engineered tank consisting of single or multiple units, together {{with one or}} more <b>connecting</b> <b>piping</b> systems installed in appropriate soils to receive wastewater flow from one or more residences or public buildings. Wastewater is pretreated in the septic tank before being discharged to a final treatment system. Annually or semi-annually, liquids and solids retained in the tank are pumped into a tank vehicle which transports sewage to a final treatment site. A septic tank is a traditional wastewater treatment technology using a tank as the primary treatment and holding device. A system to handle multiple residences may be designed as a collection of individual holding tanks with a community treatment and disposal system or a community collection and treatment system. The decision on which type to use is based on available land, existing systems, and maintenance issues. Figure 1 illustrates a septic tank with a leaching field downstream. The primary device in treatment is the tank, an enclosed watertight container that collects and provides primary treatment of wastewater by holding wastewater in the tank and allowing settleable solids to settle to the bottom while floatable solids (oil and greases) rise to the top. The tank should retain the wastewater for at least 24 hours. Some solids are removed from the wastewater, some are digested, and some are stored in the tank. Up to 50 percent of the solids retained in the tank Source: U. S.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, closed CO 2 cycles are {{investigated}} for potential application in existing nuclear power stations, referring {{in particular to}} Mochovce power station currently under construction in Slovak Republic. Three different CO 2 cycles layouts are explored {{in the range of}} temperatures offered by the nuclear source and of the existing cooling towers. The investigation shows that the common opinion that S-CO 2 cycles are well suited in the medium to a high temperature range only (higher than about 450 °C) seems unjustified. For a primary heat source with a maximum temperature of 299 °C and a heat sink with a minimum temperature of 19 °C and reasonable assumptions about advanced turbomachines and heat exchanger performances, the supercritical recompressed reheated regenerative CO 2 cycle would yield a net efficiency of 34. 04 %, which compares well with the 33. 51 % net efficiency of the existing Rankine cycle. The estimated length of the complete turboset (2 turbines, 1 pump and 1 compressor) would be less than 11 m (versus two wet steam turbines of 22 m each for the same power), resulting in a factor of 10 reduction in the footprint of the balance of plant. The total CO 2 cycle equipment and main pipelines would have a combined weight of 3957 tons, while in the Mochovce 3 NPP existing Rankine cycle, the main components and <b>connecting</b> <b>piping</b> weigh nearly 7377 tons, thus a 40 % reduction. These results suggest that the adoption of CO 2 in nuclear power stations would not penalize the plant efficiency and would yield significant savings on installation costs and construction times from the much more compact balance of plant...|$|E

In addition, this project advances EERE's efforts to establish geothermal energy as an economically competitive contributor to the US energy supply. For this grant, WCU will extend piping for its geo-exchange system. The work involves excavation of a trench approximately 8 feet wide and 10 - 12 feet deep located about 30 feet north of the curb along the north side of West Rosedale for a distance of approximately 1, 300 feet. The trench will then turn north for the remaining distance (60 feet) to connect into the mechanical room in the basement of the Francis Harvey Green Library. This project will include crossing South Church Street near its intersection with West Rosedale, which will involve coordination with the Borough of West Chester.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{scope of}} the present R&D is to develop an {{innovative}} support, with an integrated cooling and based on carbon composites, for the electronic sensors of the Silicon Pixel Tracker, to be installed into the ATLAS Experiment on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The inner layer of the detector is installed immediately outside the Beryllium beam pipe {{at a distance of}} 50 mm from the Interaction Point, where the high energy protons collide: the intense radiation field induce a radiation damage on the sensors so that a cooling system is necessary to remove the electrical power dissipated as heat, maintaining the sensor temperature sufficiently low. The task of the support system is to hold the detector modules in positions with high accuracy, minimizing the deformation induced by the cooling; this must be done with the lower possible mass because there are tight requirements in terms of material budget. An evaporative boiling system to remove the power dissipated by the sensors is incorporated in the support: thermal contact is made through a very conductive light carbon foam to maintain the sensor temperature sufficiently low, to limit the leakage currents and so the thermal run-away. The coolant should be CO 2, with a cooling pipe design pressure of 10 MPa. The number of pipes could be 1 or 2 and the pipe material should be carbon fiber or titanium. The structural strength of the 800 mm long support stave is given fro m a carbon fiber laminate omega shaped. The design is based on thermal/mechanical/thermo-structural analysis of assemblies made of carbon fiber composites. One R&D key element is thr production of the Carbon Fiber or Titanium pipe and of the relative joints versus the external <b>connecting</b> <b>piping,</b> having suitable mechanical and tightness properties...|$|E
40|$|Within {{offshore}} installations, making pipe couplings {{to conduct}} electricity is a developing interest. Being {{able to use}} tubing structures to carry the drive electric power, that is necessary downhole, helps to avoid installation of cables and lines. The challenge {{is to be able}} to make the connection good enough so that the necessary power is transferred to the <b>connected</b> <b>piping</b> dowhole with minimum possible loss. At the same time, the connection has to secure the transfer of the voltage at the output side of the piping without any danger of overheating the connection. An overheating can eventually result in a welded connection between the mating piping. As the capability of the connection to transfer power through the piping is based on the size of the contact area, the material type, the surface topography and most importantly, the connection strength, contact resistance is a limiting design factor in electrical contact design. This paper presents the result of a study performed on the electrical contact resistance of pipe couplings intended for offshore installations.

50|$|In a {{pressurized}} water reactor plant, the pressurizer is basically a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends, mounted with the long axis vertical and directly connected by a single run of piping to the reactor coolant system. It is located inside the reactor containment building. Although {{the water in the}} pressurizer is the same reactor coolant as {{in the rest of the}} reactor coolant system, it is basically stagnant, i.e. reactor coolant does not flow through the pressurizer continuously as it does in the other parts of the reactor coolant system. Because of its innate incompressibility, water in a <b>connected</b> <b>piping</b> system adjusts equally to pressure changes anywhere in the connected system. The water in the system may not be at the same pressure at all points in the system due to differences in elevation but the pressure at all points responds equally to a pressure change in any one part of the system. From this phenomenon, it was recognized early on that the pressure in the entire reactor coolant system, including the reactor itself, could be controlled by controlling pressure in a small interconnected area of the system and this led to the design of the pressurizer. The pressurizer is a small vessel compared to the other two major vessels of the reactor coolant system, the reactor vessel itself and the steam generator(s).|$|R

5000|$|In {{high-pressure}} gas systems, it {{is recommended}} that the outlet of the relief valve is in the open air. In systems where the outlet is <b>connected</b> to <b>piping,</b> the opening of a relief valve will give a pressure build up in the piping system downstream of the relief valve.

This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the openings area of the valve. If the valve is opened the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other relief valves are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in exhaust pipe system increases. This may cause undesired operation.|$|R
