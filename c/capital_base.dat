5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low <b>capital</b> <b>base</b> in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in {{quality of life and}} income of people cutting across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.|$|E

Each year, it distributes between $7 and $10million in the region, not including the large sums given to sports franchises and building projects and since its inception has distributed close to $140million in grants.|$|E
25|$|The Tuscan {{order has}} a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple <b>capital,</b> <b>base,</b> and frieze. It is a {{simplified}} adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it {{is similar to the}} Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.|$|E

From 1992 to 1993 there was a 6 percent increase in real national income, the <b>capital</b> <b>base</b> of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks’ consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be -1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars, Lebanon's economy was in a miserable state.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the preceeding {{operator}} of the yard, Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works {{had a good}} <b>capital</b> <b>base</b> and could directly invest on new machinery. Under Bergroth's determined leadership, the company started a significant investment programme. As docking of ships was considered the core business, the company bought neighbouring houses to get more area around the dry dock, which had very constricted space. The yard area was enlarged towards the city during the following years. In 1896 the company invested on a 30-tonne masting crane. Wooden sheds were gradually replaced by brick buildings, which reduced both fire risk and insurance costs.|$|E
25|$|Limited risk of catastrophically large losses: Insurable {{losses are}} ideally {{independent}} and non-catastrophic, {{meaning that the}} losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their <b>capital</b> <b>base.</b> Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the United States, flood risk is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, {{it is possible to}} find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market.|$|E

25|$|Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made to increase human <b>capital</b> <b>base</b> through improved education system, still the quality of education experience is low and unequally distributed. Due to lack of good quality education at the basic and secondary levels, there has been a mushrooming market for private tutoring. Now to take private tuition has become more of an obligation than a remedial activity. According to the Egypt Human Development Report (2005), 58 percent of surveyed families stated that their children take private tutoring. The CAPMAS (2004) survey showed that households spend on average around 61 percent of total education expenditure on private tutoring. In addition, per household expenditure of the richest quintile on private tutoring is more than seven times that of the poorest. Among the issues is the lack of sufficient education in public schools and the need for private tuition. As of 2005, 61-70% of Egyptian students attend private tuition. Other common issues include: theft of public educational funds and leakage of exams.|$|E

In June 1998, Olympus was subject of market rumours that it had suffered sizeable trading losses on derivatives which caused its shares to plunge by 11 percent. The rumours were emphatically denied by Olympus, which subsequently announced record profits. In September 2011, Olympus announced that it had written off part of a ¥45billion investment in emerging market bonds. The company further disclosed during its interim results in October 1999, that it had lost nearly ¥17billion from interest rate and currency swaps. The company also reported that it had lost ¥2.9billion in the Princeton Economics International Ponzi scheme. According to Bloomberg, the annual report of Olympus Corporation for the year ended 31 March 2010 showed a ¥15.5billion ($201million) prior period adjustment for [...] "loss related to the purchase of preference shares from [...] third party"; goodwill on its balance sheet also increased by ¥13.5billion yen to account for the purchase. BusinessWeek noted that ratio of a company's debt relative to its equity ranks Olympus among the top 2percent most highly geared of Japan's largest companies, while The Financial Times commented that its <b>capital</b> <b>base</b> – an equity ratio in 2011 of below 14percent – is the weakest among its peer group.

2500|$|Since its inception, the Dutch East India Company {{had been}} in {{competition}} with its counterpart, the English East India Company, founded two years earlier but with a <b>capital</b> <b>base</b> eight times smaller, for the same goods and markets in the East. [...] In 1619, the rivalry resulted in the Amboyna massacre, when several English Company men were executed by agents of the Dutch.

2500|$|The {{structure}} of large churches differed regionally and developed across the centuries. The use of piers of rectangular plan to support arcades was common, as at Mainz Cathedral and St Gertrude Nivelle, and remained usual in smaller churches across Europe, with the arcades often taking {{the form of}} openings through {{the surface of a}} wall. In Italy, where there was a strong tradition of using marble columns, complete with <b>capital,</b> <b>base</b> and abacus, this remained prevalent, often reusing existent ancient columns, as at San Miniato al Monte. A number of 11th-century churches have naves distinguished by huge circular columns with no clerestory, or a very small one as at St Philibert, Tournus. In England stout columns of large diameter supported decorated arches, gallery and clerestory, as at the nave of Malmesbury Abbey (see [...] "Piers and columns", above). By the early 12th century composite piers had evolved, in which the attached shafts swept upward to a ribbed vault or were continued into the mouldings of the arcade, as at Vézelay Abbey, Saint-Étienne, Caen, and Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E

2500|$|The VOC {{played a}} crucial role in the rise of {{corporate}}-led globalization, corporate governance, corporate identity, corporate social responsibility, corporate finance, modern entrepreneurship, and financial capitalism. During its golden age, the company made some fundamental institutional innovations in economic and financial history. These financially revolutionary innovations allowed a single company (like the VOC) to mobilize financial resources from a large number of investors and create ventures at a scale that had previously only been possible for monarchs. In the words of Canadian historian and sinologist Timothy Brook, [...] "the Dutch East India Company—the VOC, as it is known—is to corporate capitalism what Benjamin Franklin's kite is to electronics: the beginning of something momentous that could not have been predicted at the time." [...] The birth of the VOC is often considered to be the official beginning of the corporate globalization era with the rise of modern corporations as a powerful socio-politico-economic system In [...] "The Age of Uncertainty" [...] (1977), John Kenneth Galbraith, writes, [...] "The institution that most changes our lives we least understand or, more correctly, seek most elaborately to misunderstand. That is the modern corporation. Week by week, month by month, year by year, it exercises a greater influence on our livelihood and the way we live than unions, universities, politicians, the government." [...] that significantly affect humans lives in every corner of the world today. As the world's first publicly traded company and first listed company (the first company to be ever listed on an official stock exchange), the VOC was the first company to issue stock and bonds to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) multinational corporation, the VOC was also the first permanently organized limited-liability joint-stock company, with a permanent <b>capital</b> <b>base.</b> The VOC shareholders were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern corporate governance and corporate finance. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern corporations, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as corporate identity (first globally-recognized corporate logo), entrepreneurial spirit, legal personhood, transnational (multinational) operational structure, high and stable profitability, permanent capital (fixed capital stock), freely transferable shares and tradable securities, separation of ownership and management, and limited liability for both shareholders and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy.|$|E
