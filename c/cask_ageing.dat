40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to estimate radiation doses received by personnel working in the Aging Facility performing operations to transfer <b>aging</b> <b>casks</b> to the <b>aging</b> pads for thermal and logistical management, stage empty <b>aging</b> <b>casks,</b> and retrieve <b>aging</b> <b>casks</b> from the <b>aging</b> pads for further processing in other site facilities. Doses received by workers due to <b>aging</b> <b>cask</b> surveillance and maintenance operations are also included. The specific scope of work contained in this calculation covers both collective doses and individual worker group doses on an annual basis, and includes the contributions due to external and internal radiation from normal operation. There are no Category 1 event sequences associated with the Aging Facility (BSC 2004 [DIRS 167268], Section 7. 2. 1). The results of this calculation {{will be used to}} support the design of the Aging Facility and to provide occupational dose estimates for the License Application. The calculations contained in this document were developed by Environmental and Nuclear Engineering of the Design and Engineering Organization and are intended solely {{for the use of the}} Design and Engineering Organization in its work regarding facility operation.

Waste for subsurface emplacement at the repository includes US Department of Energy (DOE) high-level radioactive waste (HLW), DOE SNF, commercial fuel in dual-purpose canisters (DPCs), uncanistered bare fuel, naval fuel, and other waste types. Table 1 - 1 lists the types of radioactive materials that may be aged at YMP, and those materials {{that will not be}} placed in an <b>aging</b> <b>cask</b> or module. This plan presents the strategy for design development of the Aging system. The Aging system will not handle naval fuel, DOE HLW, MCOs, or DOE SNF since those materials will be delivered to the repository in a state and sequence that allows them to be placed into waste packages for emplacement. Some CSNF from nuclear reactors, especially CSNF that is thermally too hot for emplacement underground, will need to be aged at the repository...|$|R

40|$|The {{airborne}} yeast flora {{associated with}} four different areas in a Spanish winery was analyzed monthly {{over the course}} of one year (February 2008 –January 2009), in order to characterize the yeasts in this particular ecosystem, an aspect relatively unknown until now. The sampling areas were: vinification, bottling, <b>cask</b> <b>aging</b> and bottle cellar aging. 382 yeasts were identified from two different culture media: one generic for yeasts and the other selective for the Brettanomyces/Dekkera genus. The levels of yeasts present in the air throughout the year were low and the highest presence of yeasts was in the bottling area. Most of the yeasts isolated were members of the non-Saccharomyces groups. Yeasts of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae species were only detected in the air in the vinification area during the vinification period. Sporidiobolus and Cryptococcus were the dominant genera in the air and they were found continuously in every area analyzed. The spoilage yeast Brettanomyces/Dekkera was not detected in any sampling made. This study has been undertaken with a grant from the Government of La Rioja, Spain (FOMENTA 2007 / 04 Project).

25|$|After distillation, the unaged brandy {{is placed}} into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are <b>aged</b> in oak <b>casks</b> (single-barrel <b>aging).</b> Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.|$|R

40|$|The spent {{nuclear fuel}} (SNF) aging system at the {{proposed}} Yucca Mountain repository will provide site-specific <b>casks</b> and <b>aging</b> pads for thermal management of commercial SNF with a heat rate {{in excess of the}} waste package thermal output limit. An aging pad can accommodate 1, 000 MTHM of SNF, containing a total of 100 <b>aging</b> <b>casks</b> with a horizontal module of 20 casks, and 80 vertical site-specific casks arranged in a 2 x 40 array. The proposed aging system will provide five aging areas in two separate locations. The first location will contain a single pad designated as Aging Area 17 A (1, 000 MTHM capacity). The second location will contain Aging Areas 17 B through 17 E (20, 000 MTHM total capacity), each consisting of five aging pads arranged in a compact rectangular configuration. This paper presents calculated dose rates as a function of distance from Aging Areas 17 A and 17 B through 17 E.

50|$|Cask {{strength}} {{is not the}} highest proof that a whisky can be. Still-strength whisky is a higher proof, which {{comes out of the}} still at about 70% abv.

50|$|When the <b>casks</b> used to <b>age</b> Oloroso Sherry are retired, {{they are}} often sent to Scotland and Ireland, where {{they are used to}} age fine whisky.

40|$|The {{airborne}} yeast flora {{associated with}} four different areas in 3 Spanish wineries was analyzed {{over the course}} of a year (winter, spring, summer and fall) in order to distinguish the yeast species present in this ecosystem and to evaluate the risk of air as a means of wine contamination by spoilage yeasts. Sampling was conducted in the vinification, bottling, <b>cask</b> <b>aging</b> and bottle aging areas. 367 yeasts were identified from two different culture media: 258 in a generic medium for yeast species and 109 in a more selective medium for the Brettanomyces/Dekkera genus. Low levels of yeasts were found in the air with different values depending on the activity being performed at the time: the population in the bottling area increases when bottling is being carried out, and it also increases in the air present in the winemaking premises during vinification. Most of the isolated yeasts were members of the non-. Saccharomyces group. Yeasts from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae species were only detected in the air present in the vinification area during the vinification period. Aureobasidium and Cryptococcus were the dominant genera in the air and they were found permanently in the 3 wineries in every area analyzed. The highest level of yeast cells was found in the bottling line, which makes it the area in the winery that requires the greatest vigilance. However, the types of yeast detected are not a real risk to the quality of the wine being bottled. Spoilage yeast Brettanomyces/Dekkera was detected in the air present in the cask area of one winery when wine containing these yeast species was being handled. This suggests that air can be a means for these yeast cells to spread in the wineries and that yeast dissemination is associated with the handling of the wine containing them. No significant differences were found between the wineries, neither in the count of yeasts in the air nor in the main genera present. Therefore, this data establishes an initial description of the yeast levels in the air, the genera and species usually present and the risk to the stability of the wine and its spoilage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
