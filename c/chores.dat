40|$|We {{study the}} {{proportional}} <b>chore</b> division problem where a protocol wants to divide a negatively valued object, called <b>chore,</b> among n different players. The {{goal is to}} find an allocation such that cost of the <b>chore</b> assigned to each player be at most 1 /n of the total cost. This problem is the dual variant of the cake cutting problem in which we want to allocate a desirable object. Edmonds and Pruhs showed that any protocol for the proportional cake cutting must use at least Ω(n n) queries in the worst case, however, finding a lower bound for the proportional <b>chore</b> division remained an interesting open problem. We show that <b>chore</b> division and cake cutting problems {{are closely related to}} each other and provide an Ω(n n) lower bound for <b>chore</b> division. We also consider the problem when players have unequal entitlements and show that any protocol for <b>chore</b> division and cake cutting must use an unbounded number of queries. Finally, we present a simple algorithm that allocates a <b>chore</b> among the players with unequal entitlements using an unbounded but finite number of queries...|$|R

40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} response element (<b>ChoRE)</b> is a {{cis-acting sequence}} {{found in the}} promoters of genes induced transcriptionally by glucose. The <b>ChoRE</b> is composed of two E box-like motifs that are separated by 5 bp and is recognized by two basic helix–loop–helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) proteins, ChREBP and Mlx, which heterodimerize to bind DNA. In this study, we demonstrate that two ChREBP/Mlx heterodimers interact to stabilize binding to the tandem E box-like motifs in the <b>ChoRE.</b> Based on a model structure that we generated of ChREBP/Mlx bound to the <b>ChoRE,</b> we hypothesized that intermolecular interactions between residues within the Mlx loop regions of adjacent heterodimers are responsible for stabilizing the complex. We tested this hypothesis by preparing Mlx variants in which the loop region was replaced with that of another family member or mutated at several key residues. These Mlx variants retained their ability to bind to a single perfect E-box motif as a heterodimer with ChREBP, but no longer bound to the <b>ChoRE</b> nor supported glucose responsive activity. In summary, our results support a model in which the loop regions of Mlx play an important functional role in mediating the coordinate binding of ChREBP/Mlx heterodimers to the <b>ChoRE...</b>|$|R
