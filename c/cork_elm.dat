50|$|Ulmus thomasii, {{the rock}} elm or <b>cork</b> <b>elm,</b> is a {{deciduous}} tree native {{primarily to the}} Midwestern United States. The tree ranges from southern Ontario and Quebec, south to Tennessee, west to northeastern Kansas, and north to Minnesota.|$|E
5000|$|According to the San Francisco Chronicle, on December 2, after {{a special}} {{meeting of the}} city council heard {{testimony}} in support of leaving the tree as a monument and warning to evildoers, the council approved the cutting down of the <b>cork</b> <b>elm</b> by city workers. Police were required to keep off a crowd of souvenir hunters seeking a twig or branch of the infamous [...] "gallows tree", the bark and lower branches having been hacked and stripped for mementos.|$|E
50|$|Ulmus thomasii grows as a tree from 15 - 30 m tall, and {{may live}} {{for up to}} 300 years. Where forest-grown, the crown is {{cylindrical}} and upright with short branches, and is narrower than most other elms. Rock elm is also unusual among North American elms {{in that it is}} often monopodial. The bark is grey-brown and deeply furrowed into scaly, flattened ridges. Many older branches have 3-4 irregular thick corky wings. It is for this reason the rock elm is sometimes called the <b>cork</b> <b>elm.</b>|$|E

The level street is wide and lined with parked {{automobiles}} as well as old <b>Cork</b> <b>Elms.</b> The New York Hotel {{can be seen on}} the right with a coffee shop just behind it. A building with two stories sits on the left with a protruding sign. Lines on electrical poles connect {{the two sides of the}} street while a large building sits at the end of the road in the distance. In the 1880 's this town was one of the most important supply towns for the mines of Trinity and Shasta Counties...|$|R

40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of Morgan's "City Hotel," Columbia, ca. 1930. A large <b>Cork</b> <b>Elm</b> stands center shading {{the sidewalk}} in front of the lightly-colored brick building. Two sets of double doors, which are raised a step above the sidewalk, can be seen on either side of the <b>Cork</b> <b>Elm</b> with signs labeling them. A third, single door is unlabeled on the left. Two men sit reading papers on two separate benches along the sidewalk with fliers posted on the wall behind them. Above them a second floor can be seen through the leaves of the <b>Cork</b> <b>Elm.</b> "To the right is the entrance to the saloon where the girls danced on the bar"...|$|E
40|$|The {{aboveground}} {{carbon sequestration}} rate (ACSR) reflects {{the influence of}} climate change on forest dynamics. To reveal {{the long-term effects of}} climate change on forest succession and carbon sequestration, a forest landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS Pro 7. 0) was used to simulate the ACSR of a temperate forest at the community and species levels in northeastern China based on both current and predicted climatic data. On the community level, the ACSR of mixed Korean pine hardwood forests and mixed larch hardwood forests, fluctuated during the entire simulation, while a large decline of ACSR emerged in interim of simulation in spruce-fir forest and aspen-white birch forests, respectively. On the species level, the ACSR of all conifers declined greatly around 2070 s except for Korean pine. The ACSR of dominant hardwoods in the Lesser Khingan Mountains area, such as Manchurian ash, Amur <b>cork,</b> black <b>elm,</b> and ribbed birch fluctuated with broad ranges, respectively. Pioneer species experienced a sharp decline around 2080 s, and they would finally disappear in the simulation. The differences of the ACSR among various climates were mainly identified in mixed Korean pine hardwood forests, in all conifers, and in a few hardwoods {{in the last quarter of}} simulation. These results indicate that climate warming can influence the ACSR in the Lesser Khingan Mountains area, and the largest impact commonly emerged in the A 2 scenario. The ACSR of coniferous species experienced higher impact by climate change than that o...|$|R
