His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had {{made it clear that he}} wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed in}} 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The animals were <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> the Dentzel Carousel Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E
5|$|Endecott {{used some}} of his {{properties}} to propagate fruit trees; a pear tree he planted still lives in Danvers, Massachusetts. He also engaged {{in one of the}} earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in the colonies when copper ore was found on his land. His name is found on a rock in Lake Winnipesaukee, <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony's northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E

5|$|Federal Hill is made {{primarily}} of brick fired on-site and {{laid in the}} Flemish bond pattern. The mansion possesses a foundation crafted of limestone native to the surrounding countryside. The windowsills and mantels were finely <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> a free black craftsman. The mansion is designed in the Federal Style. Federal Hill has three floors traversed by a staircase located within a central hallway on each floor and an English basement. The first floor's main rooms are a dining room, parlor, and library. The second floor consists of three bedrooms similarly spaced to the rooms below.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Noh {{masks are}} treasured by Noh {{families}} and institution, {{and the powerful}} Noh schools hold {{the oldest and most}} valuable Noh masks in their private collections, rarely seen by the public. The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's Style and the Flower written in the 14th century.|$|E

Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert, Saint Paul in Athens and the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Victoria {{is roughly}} {{described}} as the area around Victoria station. It includes the conservation areas of Broadway and Christchurch Gardens, Grosvenor Gardens and the environs of Westminster Cathedral.

A great deal of public art by recent graduates of art schools in London was incorporated into Cardinal Place, a development of 2005.|$|E

So, the paper shows indirectly that these systems, under certain assumptions, can be considered a model for hypercomputation...|$|R
5|$|Gilbert {{built the}} Garrick Theatre in 1889. The Gilberts moved to Grim's Dyke in Harrow in 1890, which he {{purchased}} from Robert Heriot, {{to whom the}} artist Frederick Goodall had sold the property in 1880. In 1891, Gilbert was appointed Justice of the Peace for Middlesex. After casting Nancy McIntosh in Utopia, Limited, {{he and his wife}} developed an affection for her, and she eventually gained the status of an unofficially adopted daughter, moving to Grim's Dyke to live with them. She continued living there, even after Gilbert died, until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936. A statue of Charles II, <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber in 1681, was moved in 1875 from Soho Square to an island in the lake at Grim's Dyke, where it remained when Gilbert purchased the property. On Lady Gilbert's direction, it was restored to Soho Square in 1938.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E
5|$|In the Market Square {{stands the}} Gothic St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). It was rebuilt in the 14th-century and {{features}} the famous wooden altar (Altarpiece of Veit Stoss), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world, <b>carved</b> <b>by</b> Veit Stoss. From the church's main tower a trumpet call (hejnał mariacki), is sounded every hour. The melody, {{which used to}} announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly in midstream. According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. He was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces whilst playing, the bugle call breaking off {{at the moment he}} died. The story was recounted in a book published in the late-1920s called The Trumpeter of Krakow, by Eric P. Kelly, which won a Newbery Award.|$|E
