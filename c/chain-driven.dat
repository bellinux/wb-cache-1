5|$|The {{completion}} of the final locomotive, No. 34110 66 Squadron, in January 1951 was delayed for several months pending consideration of proposals from British Railways management for a major modification to a standard two-cylinder design without the <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear., but the locomotive entered service as Bulleid intended.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The <b>chain-driven</b> {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with <b>chain-driven</b> single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
25|$|The no. 700316 6C 2300 tipo Turismo straight-six engine placed {{behind the}} driver was Alfa Romeo: 2,309cc, iron block, light alloy head, <b>chain-driven</b> dual {{overhead}} camshafts, spur gears, wet sump lubrication.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} several {{companies}} manufacturing aftermarket internal combustion engine (ICE) motor conversion kits for conventional bicycles. These include both four-stroke and two-stroke gasoline engine designs. Among these, Golden Eagle Bike Engines currently produces a rear-engine (rack-mounted) kit using a belt to drive the rear wheel. Staton-Inc., a motorized bicycle manufacturer of long standing, also uses a rack-mount with either a tire roller-mount (friction drive) or a <b>chain-driven,</b> geared transmission. Other manufacturers produce kits using small two- or four-stroke gas engines mounted in the central portion of the bicycle frame, and incorporating various types of belt- or <b>chain-driven</b> transmissions and final drives. Some of these brands include Jiangdu Flying Horse Gasoline Engine Factory Ltd., EZ Motorbike Company, Inc., Mega Motors Inc., and Grubee Inc.|$|E
25|$|For 1908, de Dietrich {{offered a}} line of <b>chain-driven</b> touring fours, the 18/28hp, 28/38hp, 40/45hp, and 60/80hp, priced between ₤550 and ₤960, and a 70/80hp six at ₤1,040. The British version differed, having shaft drive. That year, {{the names of the}} {{automotive}} and aero-engine divisions were changed to Lorraine-Dietrich.|$|E
25|$|The bicycle's {{invention}} has had {{an enormous}} effect on society, {{both in terms of}} culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually {{played a key role in}} the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, <b>chain-driven</b> sprockets and tension-spoked wheels.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Duff {{began his}} racing career at Brooklands, a 2.6mile long {{concrete}} track with concave banking. He drove a Fiat S.61, a 10-litre <b>chain-driven</b> car built in 1908. By August 1920, he was lapping {{in the same}} range as Henry Segrave, {{one of the great}} Brooklands and Grand Prix drivers of the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|After 1903 the Clément-Gladiator name {{continued}} to be used on the shaft-drive cars made at the Pre-Saint-Gervais factory, whilst <b>chain-driven</b> vehicles were marketed as Gladiators. The Clément name was dropped in 1907 and in 1909 another French manufacturer, Vinot et Deguingand, took over Gladiator and transferred production to Puteaux. At this time the Pre-Saint-Gervais factory reverted to making bicycles.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, when John Dunlop re-invented the {{pneumatic}} tire for his son's tricycle, the high wheel was made obsolete. The comfortable ride once found only on tall wheels {{could now be}} enjoyed on smaller <b>chain-driven</b> bicycles. By 1893, high-wheelers were no longer being produced. Use lingered into the 1920s in track cycling until racing safety bicycles were adequately designed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} automobile from Honda was the T360 mini pick-up truck, {{which went}} on sale in August 1963. Powered by a small 356-cc straight-4 gasoline engine, it was classified under the cheaper Kei car tax bracket. The first production car from Honda was the S500 sports car, which followed the T360 into production in October 1963. Its <b>chain-driven</b> rear wheels pointed to Honda's motorcycle origins.|$|E
25|$|Giraffe, a <b>chain-driven</b> unicycle. {{use of a}} chain or {{multiple}} wheels in a gear-like configuration can make the unicycle much taller than standard unicycles (note that multi-wheel unicycles {{can be described as}} giraffes). Standard unicycles don't have a chain, which limits the seat height based on how long the rider's legs are, because there the crank is attached directly to the wheel axle. Giraffe unicycles can range in heights from 3 feet to over 10 feet high.|$|E
25|$|On August 3, 2013, Polaris {{announced}} three all-new Indian-branded motorcycles {{based on}} the traditional styling of the Indian marque, along with the Thunder Stroke 111 V-twin engine. The motor has a triple-cam design with a <b>chain-driven</b> center cam turning front and rear cams via gears, permitting parallel placement of the pushrods to give a similar appearance to older Indian designs. It is air cooled, with large traditional fins and an airbox in the cast aluminum frame. All Indians using the Thunder Stroke 111 engine share this aluminum frame design, though the wheelbase and front end rake vary depending on model. The integrated transmission is also gear-driven.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first <b>chain-driven</b> bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was <b>chain-driven.</b> The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner <b>chain-driven</b> transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the <b>chain-driven</b> camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E
500|$|A <b>chain-driven</b> Case was {{the first}} {{gasoline}} power buggy driven in Paynton by Eddie Langier followed by Alex McKay's McLaughlin automobile. ...when this was a Local Improvement District ... men worked out the taxes by building up the road with pick and shovel {{and a team of}} horses and what we called a scraper.|$|E
500|$|The {{enlarged}} [...] OHV {{engine of}} the 1963 C200 was used on the 1965 CM90 step-through. New in 1965 was a [...] engine with a <b>chain-driven</b> overhead camshaft (OHC). This was used in two new models: the C65, a step-through with , and the S65, with a frame like the C110/C200 and [...] @ 10,000rpm.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating {{a number}} of new {{developments}} in British steam locomotive technology, the design of the Merchant Navy class {{was among the first to}} use welding in the construction process; this enabled easier fabrication of components during the austerity of the war and post-war economies. In addition the locomotives featured thermic syphons in their boilers and the controversial Bulleid <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear. [...] The class members were named after the Merchant Navy shipping lines involved in the Battle of the Atlantic, and latterly those which used Southampton Docks, a publicity masterstroke by the Southern Railway, which operated Southampton Docks during the period.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{had also}} begun to write the children's book Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. The car itself {{was based on a}} {{composite}} of two cars: Fleming's own [...] Standard Tourer, which he had driven in Switzerland in the late 1920s, and Chitty Bang Bang, a <b>chain-driven</b> customised Mercedes with a 23-litre 6-cylinder Maybach aero-engine. Fleming had seen the car's owner, Count Louis Zborowski race at the Brooklands race track. The origin of the name “Chitty Bang Bang” is disputed, but may also have been inspired by early aeronautical engineer Letitia Chitty. Like Zborowski, Fleming names his car because of the noise it made—and the noise a car made was important to Fleming.|$|E
500|$|Each {{of the two}} bogies {{had three}} cylinders, with the driving wheels {{connected}} by chains enclosed in an oil-bath, based upon Bulleid's <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear on his Pacific locomotives. The valve gear used the unusual sleeve valve arrangement that was also tested on the ex-LB H1 class Hartland Point in parallel {{with the construction of}} the first Leader locomotive. The Leader was the first steam locomotive to use a form of sleeve valve since Cecil Paget's locomotive of 1908 and the concurrent testing of the principle on Hartland Point hints at the rushed nature of the locomotive's conception. The locomotive sat on the unusual Bulleid Firth Brown wheels, which were lighter, yet stronger, than the spoked equivalent.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{problems}} experienced with the class, and following {{the success of the}} rebuilt Merchant Navy class designed by R. G. Jarvis, British Railways ordered the rebuilding of sixty locomotives to a more conventional design at Eastleigh between 1957 and 1961. The first locomotive to be rebuilt was No. 34005 Barnstaple, which adopted many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes. The casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, boiler pressure reduced to [...] and the <b>chain-driven</b> valve gear was replaced with modified Walschaerts valve gear fitted both outside as well as between the frames. The rapid onset of the 1955 Modernisation Plan during the early 1960s meant that the remaining fifty locomotives were not rebuilt, and continued in as-built condition until withdrawal.|$|E
2500|$|Valve gear: DOHC (<b>chain-driven),</b> 4 valves per {{cylinder}} (40 valves total), {{variable valve}} timing on intake camshafts, sodium-cooled exhaust valves ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "eight" [...] was {{a typical}} American built engine for its time, a side-valve L-head, or [...] "flathead", with a <b>chain-driven</b> cam. It was {{naturally}} aspirated through a Carter [...] "W" [...] series single or dual-venturi (one- or two-barrel) downdraft carburetor.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{shape and}} {{configuration}} {{of a typical}} upright or [...] "safety bicycle", has changed little since the first <b>chain-driven</b> model was developed around 1885. But many details have been improved, especially {{since the advent of}} modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, the cycles {{available}} were the relatively dangerous penny-farthings and high-wheel tricycles. J.K. Starley made history in 1885 by producing the Rover Safety bicycle—a rear-wheel-drive, <b>chain-driven</b> cycle with two similar-sized wheels, {{making it more}} stable than the previous high-wheel designs. Cycling Magazine said the Rover had [...] "set the pattern to the world"; the phrase was used in their advertising for many years. Starley's Rover is usually described by historians as the first recognisably modern bicycle.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} obvious safety {{problems}}, the high-wheeler's direct {{front wheel drive}} limited its top speed. One attempt to solve both problems with a <b>chain-driven</b> front wheel was the dwarf bicycle, exemplified by the Kangaroo. Inventors also tried a rear wheel chain drive. Although Harry John Lawson invented a rear-chain-drive bicycle in 1879 with his [...] "bicyclette", it still had a huge front wheel and a small rear wheel. Detractors called it [...] "The Crocodile", and it failed in the market.|$|E
2500|$|Attempts {{were made}} to diversify: a {{contract}} to build fishing boats was accepted, and another for a motorcycle which was produced at Suresnes. [...] At the 15th Paris Motor Show, in October 1919, [...] the company was promoting a motorcycle then in 1921 a stylish little cyclecar with a 2-cylinder 750cc two-stroke engine and shaft drive. The French Blériot cyclecars are sometimes confused with the Blériot-Whippet <b>chain-driven</b> cycle cars made at the Blériot-owned factory in Addlestone, England, {{but in fact the}} two vehicles had [...] "little save size in common".|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 the petrol {{units were}} upgraded. An {{enlarged}} four-cylinder engine was introduced. This [...] engine {{shared the same}} block and cooling system (as well as other ancillary components) as the diesel unit. Unlike the diesel engine, this new 2.5-litre petrol engine retained the <b>chain-driven</b> camshaft of its 2.25-litre predecessor. At the same time, the [...] V8 was also made available in the 90- {{the first time a}} production short-wheelbase Land Rover had been given V8 power. The V8 on both models was now mated to an all-new five-speed LT85 manual gearbox.|$|E
