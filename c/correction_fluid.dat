This information is important because TCE {{has the potential to}} cause negative health effects. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance depend on the dose, duration, how you are exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. What is trichloroethylene? Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a nonflammable, colorless liquid with a somewhat sweet odor and a sweet, burning taste. It is used mainly as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts, but it is also an ingredient in adhesives, paint removers, typewriter <b>correction</b> <b>fluids,</b> and spot removers. Trichloroethylene is not thought to occur naturally in the environment.
