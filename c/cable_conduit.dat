The contract to build the tunnel and all other earthwork on the section from Solstad to Hønsveien was awarded to Mika, with the tunneling costing NOK425 million. The tunnel was built using the drilling and blasting method using two points of entry, the entrance on the Asker side and from a crosscut at Skaugum. Work started in February 2002 and was concluded in May 2005. Construction involved blasting [...] of earthwork [...] and drilling [...] of holes for pre-injection.

However, there was still water dripping into the tunnel, which caused several types of damage. Some places the water dripped onto the track, causing rust; other places water dripped onto electrical equipment. There was also issues with water running down the walls and collecting in the <b>cable</b> <b>conduit,</b> and the water with limestone dripping on the ballast and mixing the ballast with limestone. By 2011, the emergency lighting system had to be replaced because of the high humidity. The National Rail Administration has stated that savings made to the specifications in the water and frost methods have caused higher maintenance costs because the small leaks which are present do a lot of harm. In addition, areas with leaks suffer from icing. This has been part of a national trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance-free, while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs.|$|E

50|$|The cars brakes {{themselves}} were insufficient to stop and/or hold {{the car in}} the event of a cable break. Each of the two cars were provided with a wheel brake that acted on all four wheels, and two grip brakes (one for each end) that acted on the central <b>cable</b> <b>conduit</b> slot. However, they were actuated manually (the wheel brake by a lever, the grip brake by a handwheel and chain in a manner similar to conventional tramcar brakes). The latter was too slow to apply {{in the event of a}} car runaway, and the former was found to be insufficient to hold the car when the rails were slippery.|$|E
50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell Stud contact system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the electric power <b>cable</b> <b>conduit.</b> This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of air through the conduit, clearing it of any gas.|$|E

50|$|Next, the offshore-lift-platform {{could pick}} up the upper storeys which were still stored at Kiel (Fig. 6) to join them with the tower-shaft in the North Sea. Under {{favourable}} weather conditions the upper storeys were placed {{on top of the}} tower without complications (Fig. 7). Now, the completing works such as installation of the optics including the corresponding blinds and the installation of the standby sets were implemented. The power supply of the lighthouse demanded special attention. A 6 kV cable was run from the “Robbenplate” lighthouse (Fig. 1) towards “Alte Weser”, jetted in using a special device (“Einspuelstiefel”, Fig. 8) and threaded into the tower through a protective <b>cable</b> <b>conduit.</b> In addition, measures had to be taken to adopt the same cable for the planned “Tegeler Plate” lighthouse (see below). The foundation of the building was safeguarded with stone ballast poured down on bush mats against rinsing and water erosion. In 1964 the light of “Alte Weser” lighthouse went into service (Fig. 9). In 1972 the four keepers were displaced when the lighthouse became automated.|$|E

50|$|Part of {{the system}} nearly became cable-hauled, as the Hallidie Cable Company offered to build and run a section. However, having laid a <b>cable</b> <b>conduit</b> between the tracks and begun work on the {{foundations}} of a building to hold the winding-engine, they {{pulled out of the}} project, and the Corporation ran steam trams along the tracks. Horse trams were used on the route to Moldgreen until 1888, when they were replaced by steam trams. The tram engines were four-wheeled Wilkinson type machines. Wilkinson owned an engineering works in Wigan, and tried out a vertical-boilered locomotive on the local tramway. He secured sufficient orders that manufacture of his designs were carried out by Beyer, Peacock and Company in Manchester, Thomas Green & Son in Leeds and Black, Hawthorn & Company in Gateshead. Passengers were carried in four-wheeled, open-top cars. Those from the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd could seat 38, and those from the Starbuck Car and Wagon Company could seat 34. As patronage {{of the system}} increased, the Corporation ordered some larger tramcars from G.F. Milnes & Co. of Birkenhead. These were bogie vehicles with a covered upper deck, and could seat 62 passengers. The tram engines were underpowered to haul the new tramcars, and so 15 new locomotives were ordered from Kitson and Company of Leeds, with another 10 from Thomas Green & Son. When the system opened, the main depot was in Northumberland Street, but a new depot on Great Northern Street was opened in July 1887, with capacity for 30 locomotives and 30 tramcars. The depot included engineering facilities, as the Corporation built two additional locomotives there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Cable</b> <b>conduit</b> {{actuation}} {{provides a}} simple yet dexterous mode of power transmission for remote actuation. However, {{they are not}} preferred because of the nonlinearities arising from friction and cable compliance which lead to backlash type of behavior. Unlike most of the current research in backlash control which generally assumes no knowledge {{of one of the}} intermediate states, the controller design in this case can be significantly simplified if output feedback of the system is available. This paper uses a simple feedforward control law for backlash compensation. A novel smooth backlash inverse is proposed, which takes the physical limitations of the actuator in consideration, unlike other designs, and thus makes it more intuitive to use. Implementation of this inverse on physical systems can also improve the system performance over the theoretical exact inverse, as well as other existing smooth inverse designs. Improvement in the performance is shown through experiments on a robot arm of Laprotek surgical system as well as on an experimental setup using polymeric cables for actuation. N I...|$|E
