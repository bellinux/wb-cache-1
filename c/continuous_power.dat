25|$|The main {{advantage}} of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit {{is that the}} antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. Another advantage is that nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>power</b> transmission is immediately available {{as soon as the}} first space power station is placed in orbit; other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>power.</b> A collection of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO (Geostationary Orbit) space-based solar power.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} {{framework}} for <b>continuous</b> time <b>power</b> control algorithm under time varying long term fading wireless channels is developed. This contrasts {{most of the}} power control algorithms introduced in the literature that assume power control takes place in discrete time intervals and can only be used {{as long as the}} time duration for successive adjustments of transmitter powers is less than the coherence time of the channel. In <b>continuous</b> time <b>power</b> control, there is no restriction on how fast the wireless channel is varying. Moreover, a sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal <b>continuous</b> time <b>power</b> is derived. The optimal <b>continuous</b> time <b>power</b> control algorithm is developed under time varying long term fading wireless channels, which are based on stochastic differential equations.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{critical}} exponent (CE) for conventional, <b>continuous</b> <b>powers</b> of $n$-by-$n$ doubly nonnegative (DN) matrices is $n- 2 $. Here, we consider the larger class of diagonalizable, entry-wise nonnegative $n$-by-$n$ matrices with nonnegative eigenvalues (GDN). We show that, again, a CE exists {{and are able to}} bound it with a low-coefficient quadratic. However, the CE is larger than in the DN case; in particular, 2 for $n= 3 $. There seems to be a connection with the index of primitivity, {{and a number of other}} observations are made and questions raised. It is shown that there is no CE for <b>continuous</b> Hadamard <b>powers</b> of GDN matrices, despite it also being $n- 2 $ for DN matrices...|$|R

The DCT {{is made up}} of two dry clutches, each fitted with {{electric}} motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables <b>continuous</b> <b>power</b> delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.|$|E

25|$|Reactors used {{in nuclear}} marine {{propulsion}} (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot be run at <b>continuous</b> <b>power</b> {{around the clock}} {{in the same way}} that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate burnable neutron poison in the fuel rods. This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.|$|E
25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even <b>continuous)</b> <b>power,</b> and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E
25|$|The cruise stage {{carried the}} MSL {{spacecraft}} through the void {{of space and}} delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The cruise stage has its own miniature propulsion system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own electric power system, consisting of a solar array and battery for providing <b>continuous</b> <b>power.</b> Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a cable cutter separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell. Then the cruise stage was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the cruise stage was located by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since the initial size, velocity, density and impact angle of the hardware are known, it will provide information on impact processes on the Mars surface and atmospheric properties.|$|E

25|$|Saturation of {{the sample}} with energy applied at the {{resonant}} radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; {{in the first case}} (CW) this happens by using too much <b>continuous</b> <b>power</b> that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples with very few nuclei with spins greater than zero, (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more on the range of one second.|$|E
25|$|The Khabur River valley {{became the}} heart of the Hurrian lands for a {{millennium}}. The first known Hurrian kingdom emerged around the city of Urkesh (modern Tell Mozan) during the third millennium BCE. There is evidence that they were initially allied with the east Semitic Akkadian Empire of Mesopotamia, indicating they had a firm hold on the area by the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254–2218 BCE). This region hosted other rich cultures (see Tell Halaf and Tell Brak). The city-state of Urkesh had some powerful neighbors. At some point in the early second millennium BCE, the Northwest Semitic speaking Amorite kingdom of Mari to the south subdued Urkesh and made it a vassal state. In the <b>continuous</b> <b>power</b> struggles over Mesopotamia, another Amorite dynasty had usurped the throne of the Old Assyrian Empire, which had controlled colonies in Hurrian, Hattian and Hittite regions of eastern Anatolia since the 21st century BCE. The Assyrians then made themselves masters over Mari and much of north east Amurru (Syria) in the late 19th and early 18th centuries BCE. Shubat-Enlil (modern Tell Leilan), was made the capital of this Old Assyrian empire by Shamshi Adad I {{at the expense of the}} earlier capital of Assur.|$|E
