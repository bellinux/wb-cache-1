5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's <b>crash</b> <b>barrier.</b> The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E

25|$|Until 2005, many {{motorways}} and dual carriageways in Ireland did {{not have}} <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> in the central reservation, the policy being to use a wider median instead. <b>Crash</b> <b>barriers</b> are now mandatory for such routes, and wire cabling or full <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> (depending {{on whether or not}} the route is a motorway, and median width) have been fitted to existing routes.|$|R
25|$|The Boeing XF6B-1 / XBFB-1 was Boeing's last biplane {{design for}} the United States Navy. Only the one prototype, Model 236, was ever built; {{although}} first flying in early 1933, it rammed into a <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> in 1936 and the design was not pursued further.|$|E
25|$|Between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay, SH 1 and the North Island Main Trunk {{rail line}} travel along a {{narrow strip of}} land between the hills and the sea. The Centennial Highway, as it is known, is a narrow two-lane road that was highly {{accident}} prone until a centreline wire rope <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> was installed. Travelling through Pukerua Bay, the road becomes dual carriageway once more to Plimmerton, narrowing to single carriageway through the northern suburbs of Porirua to Paremata.|$|E
25|$|At {{around this}} time, the Eagle engine was {{cancelled}} {{and it was}} found that there were insufficient pre-production engines available to complete all the prototype and pre-production aircraft. Specification N.12/45 was therefore issued for the Wyvern TF.2, to be powered by a turboprop engine: either the Rolls-Royce Clyde or the Armstrong Siddeley Python. A single Clyde-powered prototype was ordered along with two with Pythons. A Clyde-powered TF.2 first flew on 18 January 1949. Both the piston-powered and turboprop versions shared many common components including wing and tail units, and essentially the same basic cockpit structure. The flight was cut short to only three minutes when shortly after takeoff, the cockpit filled with smoke from a fuel leak onto the exhaust ducting. Clyde development was subsequently cancelled by Rolls-Royce after only 50 hours of flight time for the TF.2, and the aircraft was delivered to Napier & Son to be fitted with the Nomad turbo-compound engine. The latter engine never materialised, however and this aircraft was used for <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> trials.|$|E

25|$|At {{the season}} finale held in Australia, Häkkinen's car {{suffered}} a tyre failure during the event's first qualifying session on Friday, which resulted in his car becoming airborne and crashing sideways into the <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> {{on the outside of}} Brewery corner, the fastest corner of the Adelaide Street Circuit, at an estimated speed of 120mph. The session was suspended with Häkkinen being critically injured due to sustaining a skull fracture, internal bleeding and a blockage of his airway. His life was saved by the efforts of the trackside medical team which included doctors from the Royal Adelaide Hospital, one of whom performed an emergency cricothyroidotomy at the trackside. Häkkinen was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Royal Adelaide Hospital which was luckily located only about half a kilometre from the circuit. There he remained in a critical condition under care of the Trauma Service, the Neurosurgical Unit, and the Intensive Care Unit and remained in the hospital for approximately two months. He eventually made a remarkable recovery. Häkkinen finished the season seventh in the Drivers' Championship, with 17 points.|$|E
500|$|One squadron, VF-66, {{received}} its first Fireballs in March 1945, {{but they never}} saw combat. On 1 May, three of the squadron's aircraft were craned aboard the carrier [...] to attempt to qualify seven pilots, {{but two of the}} fighters were damaged while landing. One missed the arresting gear and hit the <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> while the other aircraft's nose gear collapsed. The following month the pilots qualified and were on pre- leave when the Japanese surrendered. The squadron was ed on 18 October with all pilots and aircraft transferred to VF-41.|$|E
500|$|Upon impact, a {{joint in}} the <b>crash</b> <b>barrier</b> parted, the {{suspension}} of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a stanchion head-on. The front end was destroyed. Rindt was {{in the habit of}} using only four points on the five-point harness then available and did not wear the crotch straps, as he {{wanted to be able to}} exit the car quickly in the event of fire. [...] As a result, upon impact he slid under the belts and suffered fatal throat injuries. Later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car's right front brake shaft, but that Rindt's death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.|$|E
50|$|Traffic <b>barriers</b> (sometimes called <b>crash</b> <b>barriers,</b> or Armco barriers, {{also known}} in North America as {{guardrails}} or guard rails and in Britain as <b>crash</b> <b>barriers)</b> keep vehicles within their roadway and prevent vehicles from colliding with dangerous obstacles such as boulders, sign supports, trees, bridge abutments, buildings, walls, and large storm drains. Traffic barriers are also {{installed at the}} roadside to prevent errant vehicles from traversing steep (non-recoverable) slopes or entering deep water. Traffic barriers are installed within medians of divided highways to prevent errant vehicles from entering the opposing carriageway of traffic and help to reduce head-on collisions. Some of these barriers, designed to be struck from either side, are called median <b>barriers.</b> <b>Crash</b> <b>barriers</b> {{can also be used}} to protect vulnerable areas like school yards, pedestrian zones, and fuel tanks from errant vehicles.|$|R

40|$|The {{presented}} work analyses {{the methodology}} and {{approach of the}} legislation. It presents in the press presented results of numerical modelling {{of the impact of}} vehicles <b>crashed</b> into <b>barriers</b> that are being solved in the Czech Republic and worldwide. It presents a recommendation of a methodology for assessing <b>crash</b> <b>barriers.</b> The methodology follows the basic principles used in the TP 101 and EN 1991 - 1 - 1. The kinetic energy of the vehicle at the moment of impact is replaced with substitute static force, whose effects are comparable with those of a vehicle collision. The supporting structure of <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> is implemented in compliance with means of statics. The calculation includes the vehicle deformation, which represents the real distribution of the energy absorbed by the deformation of the vehicle and the energy that <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> need to absorb. The proposed methods allow to take into account non-linear behaviour of the structure both in terms of geometry and in terms of material nonlinearity. The work also deals with the interpretation of various types of support structures in the computational model. A specific case is used for a demonstration of a way of modelling the elastic supporting column of <b>crash</b> <b>barriers</b> in the soil, or modelling the friction of a loose concrete block over the surface. To ensure the proper position of interconnected loose blocks corresponding to the reality, a method of modelling the place of a possible contact of the breakthrough is drafted. A significant contribution to the more accurate calculation is achieved by sequential increase of the load on the construction by using load increment and measurement of energy increases absorbed by the deformation in each step. The presented methodology is an effective tool to assess <b>crash</b> <b>barriers.</b> For the application of this tool, using common resources and facilities available to almost every designer dealing with statics of structures is sufficient. In conclusion, the knowledge obtained f...|$|R

2500|$|... 1965 saw Clay Regazzoni {{behind the}} wheel of an open-wheeled car for the first time, as he entered the European Formula Three {{championship}} with a Brabham. This first season brought moderate success, and improving form during 1966 (this time driving a De Tomaso) brought him to the attention of ambitious Italian constructor Tecno. Tecno offered Regazzoni the use of one of their F3 chassis for 1967, where his reliable, fast performances earned him the offer of a works Tecno drive in Formula Two for the following year. Despite this, Regazzoni continued to drive in Formula Three events during 1968 and, not for the last time, was lucky to survive a major accident. Exiting the chicane during the Monaco Grand Prix Formula 3 support race, Regazzoni lost control of his car and collided heavily with the <b>crash</b> <b>barrier.</b> The diminutive size of the Formula 3 machine allowed it to pass under the rail, the sharp metal edge of the Armco slicing {{across the top of the}} open cockpit. Regazzoni managed to duck down low enough in the driving seat for the rail to pass above him, missing his head by a tiny margin. The car eventually came to a halt when the roll hoop, behind Regazzoni's head and significantly lower than the top of his helmet, wedged itself underneath the barrier.|$|E
