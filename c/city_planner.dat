50|$|When {{creating}} a development project plan <b>city</b> <b>planners</b> {{take into consideration}} and look at other buildings site plans to see what characteristics it has that helped get their building or renovation approved. <b>City</b> <b>planners</b> must look at different aspects that may affect the citizens around them {{because they are the}} ones living next to this. <b>City</b> <b>planners</b> must take into consideration height of a building, walking space, parking for cars/bikes and does it stand out from the cities other building types, design wise. These are all things that have to be considered because citizens are not going to want buildings blocking certain views/sunlight, customers/ new residents taking up parking current residents parking and having a building style that looks out of place and like it doesn't belong because <b>city</b> <b>planners</b> wanted a new/modern style building.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) plans a woodshop {{expansion}} {{in his home}} and seeks the approval of <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> Mark (Paul Schneider). Mark informs Ron that an inspection is needed {{to ensure that the}} facility meets all current zoning code standards, and an obviously lying Ron claims it does, clearly underscoring his vexation with governmental regulations. During the inspection, Mark finds numerous code violations, including oily rags placed above a wood-burning fireplace and a long-outdated fire extinguisher. Later, Mark takes a half-day off so that he can help his friend's woodshop meet city code. Ron thanks Mark by building a wooden canoe and leaving it in his office.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 million that was needed for a $800 million program for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city could spend $500 million on subway construction, but this request was denied.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham had in mind a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season two returned {{for the third}} season, including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider, who previously played <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider departed from the series {{at the end of}} season two. Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons, were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three, although they still do not appear in the opening credits. Adam Scott, who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season, became a regular cast member starting in season three, and Rob Lowe, who appeared in the same two second-season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger, also joined the cast in season three. Lowe was originally meant only to make a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show, but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season, having signed a multi-year contract to remain on the show. After actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen, but they proved unfounded.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{figure in}} Fair Park's development was landscape architect and <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> George Kessler. In 1906, {{he was responsible}} for the first formal plan for the park influenced by the City Beautiful Movement. The City Beautiful Movement advocated well planned public spaces, tree-lined boulevards, monuments, public art, and fountains which would ‘beautify’ the city.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, Laurel {{anticipated}} massive {{growth from}} Fort Meade and NSA. The town still used the Patuxent River to drain sewage, and filed urban grants {{for water and}} sewage infrastructure. 5,000 houses were planned in the adjacent 1,200-acre Maryland City development. <b>City</b> <b>Planner</b> Harry Susini anticipated the National Capitol Planning Commission would use clustered development to prevent tightly massed population in Laurel by the year 2000.|$|E

50|$|In 1958, however, Springfield's <b>city</b> <b>planners</b> - {{seemingly}} {{without regard}} for West Springfield's economy, or foresight for their own city's economy - campaigned vociferously for Interstate 91 to occupy Springfield's riverfront. Their reasoning {{at the time was}} that Springfield, being a more populous city than West Springfield, should have a major highway routed through it. Indeed, Springfield's 1958 <b>city</b> <b>planners</b> advocated that the construction of I-91 on Springfield's riverfront would catalyze economic growth comparable to that experienced during the great railroad expansion of the mid-19th century.|$|R

Schneider left the cast after the second season and the character is not referenced at any point during the remainder of the show.|$|E
25|$|John Wilkinson {{was born}} on February 11, 1868. He {{was a native of}} Syracuse and a member of one of the city's {{prominent}} families. His grandfather, John Wilkinson, Sr., was one of the original settlers in Syracuse. As a young man, Wilkinson Sr. took inspiration from a poem about an ancient city and named the new village Syracuse. He was also an early <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> and laid out and named the village streets.|$|E
25|$|Horace Harding Expressway {{was once}} a turnpike called Nassau Boulevard, which went from Elmhurst to Flushing, Bayside, and Little Neck. It was renamed for Horace J. Harding (1863–1929), a finance magnate who {{directed}} the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York Municipal Railways System; Harding encouraged <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> Robert Moses's system of parkways on New York, and after Harding died, the boulevard—now the service road of the Long Island Expressway—was renamed after him.|$|E

25|$|The Long-Bell company {{contracted}} with George Kessler, a <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> based in St. Louis, {{to build the}} city that would support the two mills that were now planned. Longview was officially incorporated on February 14, 1924. At {{the time of its}} conception, Longview was the only planned city of its magnitude to have ever been conceived of and built entirely with private funds. A number of prominent buildings in Longview were purchased with R. A. Long's personal funds, including R. A. Long High School, the Longview Public Library, the YMCA building and the Monticello Hotel.|$|E
25|$|Two {{proposals}} for the route were made. The company chose the proposal made by Ferdinand Bjerke, and engineer {{working for the}} Norwegian State Railways. A suggestion from the <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> Trygve Thesen was rejected. It would run in a loop via Dyrborg, making the line longer. However, more of the track was offered to be built and paid by the city, increasing the leasing costs from NOK 7,000 to 12,000. Construction for the company would be cheaper (NOK 1,300,000 vs. NOK 1,630,000). In July 1917, a Nordic architecture competition for the estates was announced. Of nineteen suggestions, Hoff from Kristiania won. The resulting regulation plan was passed in the city councils in 1918.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s and 1960s, {{the area}} went into decline, {{in line with}} a trend of general urban {{deterioration}} in Manhattan. As middle-class residents left for the suburbs, buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were divided into small units for new low-rent tenants, many of them originally from Puerto Rico. Urban renewal programs, headed by <b>city</b> <b>planner</b> Robert Moses, called for several city blocks to be demolished in order to construct the Frederick Douglass Houses in the superblock where they stand today. The development of the Douglass Houses greatly increased the density of low-income renters without providing {{much in the way}} of amenities (food shops, clubs, restaurants, and open space) for them to use. Rampant graft and corruption associated with the project blighted their opening and brought ill repute on the neighborhood, and the debacle contributed strongly to Moses's fall from power and ouster. Although community groups, such as the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation, tried to find alternative solutions for the housing shortage in the area, the city's 1976 fiscal crisis caused many of these alternate plans to be shelved.|$|E
