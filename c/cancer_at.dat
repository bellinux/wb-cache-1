5000|$|One 2012 study listed 147 {{specific}} genes with colon cancer-associated hypermethylated promoters, {{along with}} {{the frequency with which}} these hypermethylations were found in colon <b>cancers.</b> <b>At</b> least 10 of those genes had hypermethylated promoters in nearly 100% of colon cancers.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair with sequences in messenger RNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. On average, each microRNA represses several hundred target genes.

40|$|Background: Familial {{clustering}} of incident {{prostate cancer}} and some <b>cancers</b> <b>at</b> other discordant sites has been reported. Less {{is known about}} familial clustering of fatal prostate cancer with any fatal discordant cancers. Estimates on familial aggregation based on mortality are free from bias of overdiagnosis. Patients and methods: We used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for incident prostate cancer for relatives of patients with any common cancer and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for death in prostate cancer for relatives of individuals who died from cancer. Similar risks were determined for any common cancer when relatives were affected by prostate cancer. Results: We observed familial aggregation of incident and fatal prostate cancers. Familial clustering (SIRs increased) of prostate cancer and of <b>cancers</b> <b>at</b> discordant sites was found for breast, ovarian, and kidney cancers and melanoma. Also, fatal prostate cancer clustered with these and cervical cancers (SMRs increased). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that familial aggregation of prostate and breast cancers are not due to shared screening habits. The data on the association of <b>cancers</b> <b>at</b> discordant sites might be useful for clinical counseling and for mechanistic studies searching explanations to the familial clustering between discordant cancers...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective {{information}} about cancer incidence {{is important for}} planning control programs. We examined the distribution of cancer cases recorded in Denizli province, Turkey. A total of 2185 cancer cases reported to the Denizli Province Health Ministry’s Cancer Early Diagnosis Center during the years 2000 - 2004 were evaluated for sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette use, family history, and organ systems. Among these cases, 56 % were male and 44 % were female; 45. 1 % of the patients had smoked cigarettes at some time {{and there was a}} 10 -fold increase in lung cancer and a 4 -fold increase in urinary cancers among cigarette smokers (P < 0. 001). We found that 34. 4 % of the cancer cases were diagnosed as localized, 27. 9 % had a more extensive distribution and 21. 8 % were in metastasis. The most frequent types were urinary <b>cancers</b> <b>at</b> 26. 4 %, gastrointestinal <b>cancers</b> <b>at</b> 19. 2 % and respiratory <b>cancers</b> <b>at</b> 18. 9 %; there was a significant increase in gastrointestinal, blood and skin cancers over the years. Lung (14. 9 %), breast (14. 1 %), bladder (8. 0 %), prostate (5. 3 %), and lymphatic (4. 8 %) cancer cases were the most common...|$|R
