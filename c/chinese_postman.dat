50|$|A natural {{strategy}} {{to search for}} a stationary target in a graph is to find a minimal closed curve L that covers all the arcs of the graph. (L is called a <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> tour). Then, traverse L with probability 1/2 for each direction. This strategy seems to work well if the graph is Eulerian. In general, this random <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> tour is indeed an optimal search strategy if and only if the graph consists of a set of Eulerian graphs connected in a tree-like structure. A misleadingly simple example of a graph not in this family consists of two nodes connected by three arcs. The random <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> tour (equivalent to traversing the three arcs in a random order) is not optimal, and the optimal way to search these three arcs is complicated.|$|E

50|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of {{mathematics}} and computer science, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> problem (CPP), postman tour or route inspection problem {{is to find a}} shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected graph. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution. Otherwise, the optimization problem is to find the smallest number of graph edges to duplicate (or the subset of edges with the minimum possible total weight) so that the resulting multigraph does have an Eulerian circuit.

40|$|Abstract. The talk {{presents}} two non-standard extensions for single-vehicle arc-routing problems a. k. a. postman problems: First, street seg-ments {{that require}} a service {{on both sides of}} the street can be covered either by two separate services or by a single zigzag service. Instead of deciding the type of service beforehand, we propose to take into account the zigzagging option when designing a tour. We present MIP models for the extension of Undirected <b>Chinese</b> and Rural <b>Postman</b> Problem (UCPP, URPP). We show that these models can be solved reasonable well using a cutting-plane or branch-and-cut algorithm. Second, capacitated postman problems occur as subproblems in column-generation and Lagrangian-relaxation approaches of the capacitated arc-routing problem. In order to model these and similar subproblems or submodels, we present the Profitable Capacitated Rural Postman Prob-lem (PCRPP) : In the PCRPP, edges that are serviced give a profit, but deadheading through edges generates costs. Both service and deadhead-ing consume time. The task is to find a tour that maximizes the difference of profits and costs, while the overall duration of the tour must not ex-ceed a given bound. The solution approach for this problem is again based on branch-and-cut...|$|R
50|$|This {{problem is}} named after the postman and his {{challenge}} to deliver mail in any order he may choose, but minimizing his costs such as time or travel distance. It is also sometimes called the undirected <b>chinese</b> <b>postman</b> problem. The undirected rural postman problem (URPP) aims to minimize {{the total cost of}} a route that maps the entire network, or in more specific cases, a route that maps every edge that requires a service. If the whole network must be mapped, the route that maps the entire network is called a covering tour. In the case where only certain edges need to be mapped, the problem aims to solve the route that optimizes the demands, crossing over into non-required routes a minimal number of times.|$|E

40|$|Arc routing is {{concerned}} with the traversal of edges of a graph network. This thesis discusses the directed <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> problem (DCPP), a type of arc routing problem on a directed graph. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> problem {{is concerned}} with a mailman that starts at the post office, traverses every street in his territory at least once and then returns to the post office. The objective being, while delivering mails, to walk as little as possible. Incidentally, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>postman</b> problem is the ‘edge’ equivalent of the traveling salesman problem. Unlike the traveling salesman problem however, the <b>chinese</b> <b>postman</b> problem on undirected graphs has polynomial running time algorithm; which makes it an appealing choice for some application domains. In some ways, the DCPP relates to the problem of household waste collection due to the fact that, waste bins are located along street edges and a collection truck essentially needs to traverse streets to get to the bins.
