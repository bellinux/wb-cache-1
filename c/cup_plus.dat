We randomly assigned patients with migraine into <b>cupping</b> therapy <b>plus</b> serkangabin group (30 patients) and conventional treatment group (30 patients). An investigator assessed the severity of headache, frequency of attacks in a week and duration of attacks per hour in 5 visits (at the end of 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months). Generalized estimating equations approach was used to analyze repeated measures data to compare outcomes in both groups. Results: Average age for cupping therapy group and conventional treatment group were 31. 7 (± 7. 6) and 32. 6 (± 12. 7) years, respectively (P = 0. 45).
