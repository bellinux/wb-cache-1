5000|$|Thermal energy {{applications}} for switchgrass {{appear to be}} closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications. For example, switchgrass can be pressed into fuel pellets that are subsequently burned in pellet stoves used to heat homes (which typically burn corn or wood pellets). Switchgrass has been widely tested as a substitute for coal in power generation. The most widely studied project to date has been the Chariton Valley Project in Iowa. [...] The Show-Me-Energy Cooperative (SMEC) in Missouri is using switchgrass and other warm-season grasses, along with wood residues, as feedstocks for pellets used for the firing of a coal-fired power plant. In Eastern Canada, switchgrass is being used on a pilot scale as a feedstock for commercial heating applications. Combustion studies have been undertaken and it appears to be well-suited as a <b>commercial</b> <b>boiler</b> fuel. Research is also being undertaken to develop switchgrass as a pellet fuel because of lack of surplus wood residues in eastern Canada, as a slowdown in the forest products industry in 2009 is now resulting in wood pellet shortages throughout Eastern North America. Generally speaking, the direct firing of switchgrass for thermal applications can provide the highest net energy gain and energy output-to-input ratio of all switchgrass bioconversion processes. Research has found switchgrass, when pelletized and used as a solid biofuel, is a good candidate for displacing fossil fuels. Switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6:1 energy output-to-input ratio, which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland. [...] As a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6-13 tonnes per hectare of CO2. In contrast, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, respectively.|$|E

The strength of cold-worked austenitic stainless steels was reviewed and compared to the strength and ductility of advanced austenitic stainless steels. The advanced stainless steels were found to retain their strength to very long times at temperatures where cold-worked standard grades of austenitic stainless steels became weak. Further, the steels exhibited better long-time stability than the stabilized 300 series stainless steels in either the annealed or cold worked conditions.

40|$|The global {{pressure}} for recycling and ecological energy production increases steadily {{in combination with}} the demand of cost-effective application of materials. However, some severe corrosion problems, associated with the high internal/intergranular corrosion rates in boiler components need to be avoid. Some <b>commercial</b> <b>boiler</b> materials contain a Cr content of 0. 55 (wt. (%)) - 2. 25 (wt. (%)). This Cr concentration in the alloys is not sufficient for the formation of a complete dense Cr 2 O 3 scale. Hence, high oxidation kinetics may result. In this study, pure Fe and the steel 2. 25 Cr 1 Mo were oxidized in laboratory air at 550 °C using a thermobalance system. The surface as well as the cross section of oxidized specimens were analysed using scanning electron microscopy in order to quantify several factors (e. g. surface finishing, cold working and grain size) on the overall oxidation kinetics. For alloys with low Cr content, a decreasing in the grain size leads to an acceleration of the oxidation rate by facilitating the oxygen diffusion along alloy grain boundaries leading to an inward oxide layer formation. The study of effects of surface finish and cold working yielded results revealing that the oxidation process is complex and comparison of results from different laboratories is difficult and should be done...|$|E

Under the direction of DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), the Procurement Challenge's goal is to create efficiency recommendations for all energy-using products that could substantially impact the government's energy reduction goals, like commercial boilers. A typical 5, 000, 000 Btuh boiler, with a thermal efficiency of 83. 2 %, can have lifetime energy cost savings of $ 40, 000 when compared to a boiler with a thermal efficiency of 78 %. For the federal market, which makes up 2 % of the boiler market, this means lifetime energy cost savings of over $ 25, 600, 000.
