5|$|<b>Cognitive</b> {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common <b>cognitive</b> deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, <b>cognitive</b> flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other <b>cognitive</b> difficulties include slowed <b>cognitive</b> processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cognitive</b> {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of <b>cognitive</b> flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of <b>cognitive</b> flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, <b>cognitive</b> shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of benzodiazepines {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased risk of <b>cognitive</b> impairment, but its relationship with dementia remains inconclusive. The association of a past history of benzodiazepine use and <b>cognitive</b> decline is unclear, with some studies reporting a lower risk of <b>cognitive</b> decline in former users, some finding no association and some indicating an increased risk of <b>cognitive</b> decline.|$|E
5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and <b>cognitive</b> retraining, is {{the reduction of}} <b>cognitive</b> deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, <b>cognitive</b> retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving <b>cognitive</b> capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once <b>cognitive</b> impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild <b>cognitive</b> problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of <b>cognitive</b> and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of <b>cognitive</b> processes that allow the <b>cognitive</b> control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and <b>cognitive</b> inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with <b>cognitive</b> flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple <b>cognitive</b> processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E
5|$|The {{study on}} how {{language}} is represented, processed, and {{acquired by the}} brain is called neurolinguistics, which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from <b>cognitive</b> neuroscience, <b>cognitive</b> linguistics, and psycholinguistics.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{assessments}} {{are appropriate for}} distinguishing between different levels of <b>cognitive</b> flexibility at different ages. Below are the common tests used to assess <b>cognitive</b> flexibility {{in the order of}} the developmentally appropriate age.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cognitive</b> {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of <b>cognitive</b> intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), <b>cognitive</b> flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the <b>cognitive</b> skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{he helped}} in {{founding}} the <b>Cognitive</b> Science Laboratory at Princeton. Eventually {{he became a}} professor emeritus and senior research psychologist at Princeton. He also directed the McDonnell-Pew Program in <b>Cognitive</b> Science.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} <b>cognitive</b> theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an {{extraneous}} <b>cognitive</b> load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous <b>cognitive</b> load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available <b>cognitive</b> resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required <b>cognitive</b> resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at <b>cognitive</b> load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the <b>cognitive</b> load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low <b>cognitive</b> load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high <b>cognitive</b> load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the <b>cognitive</b> load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} diets {{supplemented}} with MFGM and its components, including gangliosides and sphingomyelin, {{have aimed to}} address measures of <b>cognitive</b> development in pediatric populations. In some of the studies, MFGM supplementation to infant formula was shown to narrow the gap in <b>cognitive</b> development between breastfed and formula-fed infants.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} normal aging, {{education}} {{was found to be}} related to levels of <b>cognitive</b> functioning but unrelated to rates of <b>cognitive</b> change, suggesting that <b>cognitive</b> reserve reflects the persistence of earlier differences in <b>cognitive</b> functioning rather than differential rates of age-associated <b>cognitive</b> declines. Studies controlling for practice effects indicate that education is not a direct cause of <b>cognitive</b> reserve.|$|E
25|$|Executive {{functions}} (collectively {{referred to}} as executive function and <b>cognitive</b> control) are a set of <b>cognitive</b> processes that are necessary for the <b>cognitive</b> control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include basic <b>cognitive</b> processes such as attentional control, <b>cognitive</b> inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and <b>cognitive</b> flexibility. Higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence (i.e., reasoning and problem solving).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cognitive</b> {{linguistics}} {{emerged as}} a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like Ronald Langacker and George Lakoff, <b>cognitive</b> linguists propose that language is an emergent property of basic, general-purpose <b>cognitive</b> processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, <b>cognitive</b> linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in <b>cognitive</b> linguistics include <b>cognitive</b> grammar, frame semantics, and conceptual metaphor, all of which are {{based on the idea that}} form–function correspondences based on representations derived from embodied experience constitute the basic units of language.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} is to consider <b>cognitive</b> biology only as a subset of <b>cognitive</b> science. For example, a major publisher’s website displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: “Cognitive science {{is the study of}} how the mind works, addressing <b>cognitive</b> functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.” Upon its selection from the display, the <b>Cognitive</b> Science page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: <b>Cognitive</b> Biology, Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the <b>Cognitive</b> Biology page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from <b>cognitive</b> ethology through evolutionary epistemology; cognition and art; evo-devo and <b>cognitive</b> science; animal learning; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated {{a cornucopia of}} data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision to append <b>cognitive</b> to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the <b>cognitive</b> biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named <b>cognitive</b> sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied <b>cognitive</b> models—before appending biology to a body of <b>cognitive</b> research, e.g. the <b>cognitive</b> science of artificial life.|$|E
25|$|Most {{proponents of}} <b>cognitive</b> liberty agree however that <b>cognitive</b> liberty should be {{expressly}} {{recognized as a}} human right in order to properly provide protection for individual <b>cognitive</b> autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} {{father of the}} independent Psychology major, available {{from the turn of}} the millennium, is Professor Csaba Pléh, member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, who organized the <b>Cognitive</b> Science Group at the Department of Psychology, and in 1999, started the <b>Cognitive</b> Science and Neuropsychology Program of Szeged, or in short, the <b>Cognitive</b> Program. He laid the foundation for a professional psychology training course at the University of Szeged. The university's Medical Faculty and the <b>Cognitive</b> Science Group, led by Csaba Pléh, organized the VIII. Conference of the Hungarian <b>Cognitive</b> Science Association (MAKOG), titled The Development and Disorders of <b>Cognitive</b> Functions for 4–6 February 2000 in Szeged.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cognitive</b> {{inhibition}} {{refers to}} the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. <b>Cognitive</b> inhibition can be done either {{in whole or in}} part, intentionally or otherwise. <b>Cognitive</b> inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of <b>cognitive</b> science.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cognitive</b> {{musicology}} can be differentiated {{from the}} fields of music cognition and <b>cognitive</b> neuroscience of music by a difference in methodological emphasis. <b>Cognitive</b> musicology uses computer modeling to study music-related knowledge representation and has roots in artificial intelligence and <b>cognitive</b> science. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.|$|E
25|$|In <b>cognitive</b> theory, {{behavior}} is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. <b>Cognitive</b> theories are theories of personality that emphasize <b>cognitive</b> processes, such as thinking and judging.|$|E
25|$|A review {{about the}} <b>cognitive</b> {{advantages}} of chewing gum by Onyper et al. (2011) found strong evidence of improvement {{for the following}} <b>cognitive</b> domains: working memory, episodic memory and speed of perception. However the improvements were only evident when chewing took place prior to <b>cognitive</b> testing. The precise mechanism by which gum chewing improves <b>cognitive</b> functioning is however not well understood.|$|E
25|$|On {{a broader}} level, <b>cognitive</b> science is an {{interdisciplinary}} enterprise of <b>cognitive</b> psychologists, <b>cognitive</b> neuroscientists, researchers in artificial intelligence, linguists, human–computer interaction, computational neuroscience, logicians and social scientists. Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.|$|E
25|$|Elements of behaviorism and <b>cognitive</b> {{psychology}} were synthesized to form <b>cognitive</b> behavioral therapy, a form {{of psychotherapy}} modified from techniques developed by American psychologist Albert Ellis and American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck. <b>Cognitive</b> psychology was subsumed along with other disciplines, such as philosophy of mind, computer science, and neuroscience, under the cover discipline of <b>cognitive</b> science.|$|E

25|$|Both {{block and}} event-related designs {{are based on}} the {{subtraction}} paradigm, which assumes that specific <b>cognitive</b> processes can be added selectively in different conditions. Any difference in blood flow (the BOLD signal) between these two conditions is then assumed to reflect the differing <b>cognitive</b> process. In addition, this model assumes that a <b>cognitive</b> process can be selectively added to a set of active <b>cognitive</b> processes without affecting them.|$|E

25|$|There are {{at least}} two major {{approaches}} to understanding <b>cognitive</b> change during adolescence. One is the constructivist view of <b>cognitive</b> development. Based on the work of Piaget, it takes a quantitative, state-theory approach, hypothesizing that adolescents' <b>cognitive</b> improvement is relatively sudden and drastic. The second is the information-processing perspective, which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain <b>cognitive</b> development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} on whether eating prior to a <b>cognitive</b> recall test can affect <b>cognitive</b> functioning. One example was {{a study of the}} effect of breakfast timing on selected <b>cognitive</b> functions of elementary school students. Their results found that children who ate breakfast at school scored notably higher on most of the <b>cognitive</b> tests than did students who ate breakfast at home and also children who did not eat breakfast at all.|$|E

25|$|GH {{has also}} been studied {{in the context of}} <b>cognitive</b> function, {{including}} learning and memory. GH in humans appears to improve <b>cognitive</b> function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with <b>cognitive</b> impairment that is a result of GH deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Second, the {{psychology}} of <b>cognitive</b> development involves understanding how <b>cognitive</b> change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable <b>cognitive</b> competence to develop. Education also capitalizes on <b>cognitive</b> change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower {{to a higher level}} of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or mental actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of <b>cognitive</b> development may be used to facilitate learning.|$|E
