25|$|The {{high-pressure}} minerals, seifertite, stishovite, and <b>coesite,</b> though, {{have higher}} densities and indices of refraction than quartz. This is {{probably due to}} the intense compression of the atoms occurring during their formation, resulting in more condensed structure.|$|E
25|$|Microscopic {{pressure}} deformations of minerals. These include fracture {{patterns in}} crystals of quartz and feldspar, and formation of high-pressure {{materials such as}} diamond, derived from graphite and other carbon compounds, or stishovite and <b>coesite,</b> varieties of shocked quartz.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a mineral}} may change its crystal {{structure}} {{as a consequence}} of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO2 polymorphs, such as tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, and <b>coesite</b> at high pressures.|$|E
25|$|Tridymite and {{cristobalite}} are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 {{that occur}} in high-silica volcanic rocks. <b>Coesite</b> is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.|$|E
25|$|Although tektites are superficially {{similar to}} some {{terrestrial}} volcanic glasses (obsidians), they have unusual distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from such glasses. First, {{they are completely}} glassy and lack any microlites or phenocrysts, unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in silica (>65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of shales and similar sedimentary rocks and {{quite different from the}} bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, tektites contain virtually no water (<0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Fourth, the flow-banding within tektites often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial volcanic glasses. Finally, a few tektites contain partly melted inclusions of shocked and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. quartz, apatite, and zircon, as well as <b>coesite.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1960 that later {{research}} by Eugene Merle Shoemaker confirmed Barringer's hypothesis. The key discovery was the presence in the crater of the minerals <b>coesite</b> and stishovite, rare forms of silica found only where quartz-bearing rocks have been severely shocked by an instantaneous overpressure. It cannot be created by volcanic action; the only known mechanisms of creating it is naturally through an impact event, or artificially through a nuclear explosion. Shoemaker was uniquely aware of this {{as he had been}} researching the shocked mineral formations that were formed after the nuclear detonation testing in the Nevada desert. Therefore, when similar minerals were seen at the Barringer Crater, he was certain that a similar kind of sudden shock compression was responsible for the crater, which effectively ruled out the then more mainstream view that the crater {{was the result of a}} comparatively less sudden volcanic eruption.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common <b>coesite</b> and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and <b>coesite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} silica {{are made of}} infinite arrangements of {SiO4} tetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken {{to allow for the}} arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and vitrification, or the formation of a glass, is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550°C) or β-tridymite (1703°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as <b>coesite</b> and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes, forming glassy lechatelierite. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide (SiS2) and silicon diselenide (SiSe2): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{interpreted}} as an asteroid impact structure because of its high degree of circularity, the Richat Structure is now regarded by geologists as a highly symmetrical and deeply eroded geologic dome. After extensive field and laboratory studies, no credible evidence has been found for shock metamorphism or any type of deformation indicative of a hypervelocity extraterrestrial impact. While <b>coesite,</b> an indicator of shock metamorphism, had initially been reported as being present in rock samples collected from the Richat Structure, further analysis of rock samples concluded that barite had been misidentified as <b>coesite.</b> In addition, the Richat Structure lacks the annular depression that characterizes large extraterrestrial impact structures of this size. Also, it {{is quite different from}} large extraterrestrial impact structures in that the sedimentary strata comprising this structure is remarkably intact and [...] "orderly" [...] and lacking in overturned, steeply dipping strata or disoriented blocks. A more recent multianalytical study on the Richat megabreccias concluded that carbonates within the silica-rich megabreccias were created by low-temperature hydrothermal waters, and that the structure requires special protection and further investigation of its origin.|$|E
2500|$|In {{physical}} terms, a {{shock wave}} originates {{from the point}} of contact. [...] As this shock wave expands, it decelerates and compresses the impactor, and it accelerates and compresses the target. Stress levels within the shock wave far exceed the strength of solid materials; consequently, both the impactor and the target close to the impact site are irreversibly damaged. [...] Many crystalline minerals can be transformed into higher-density phases by shock waves; for example, the common mineral quartz can be transformed into the higher-pressure forms <b>coesite</b> and stishovite. [...] Many other shock-related changes take place within both impactor and target as the shock wave passes through, and some of these changes can be used as diagnostic tools to determine whether particular geological features were produced by impact cratering.|$|E
2500|$|Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO2) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure <b>coesite,</b> and ultra-high pressure stishovite. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed {{so much that it}} had changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO2). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a [...] "kinking" [...] of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{physicist}} Luis Alvarez; his son, geologist Walter Alvarez; {{and nuclear}} chemists Frank Asaro and Helen V. Michael from the University of California, Berkeley discovered unusually {{high concentrations of}} iridium in a specific layer of rock strata in the Earth's crust. Iridium is an element that is rare on Earth but relatively abundant in many meteorites. From the amount and distribution of iridium present in the 65-million-year-old [...] "iridium layer", the Alvarez team later estimated that an asteroid of [...] must have collided with the earth. This iridium layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary has been found worldwide at 100 different sites. Multidirectionally shocked quartz (<b>coesite),</b> which is normally associated with large impact events or atomic bomb explosions, has also {{been found in the}} same layer at more than 30 sites. Soot and [...] at levels tens of thousands times normal levels were found with the above.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continental}} crust on the downgoing {{plate is}} deeply subducted {{as part of}} the downgoing plate during collision, defined as buoyant crust entering a subduction zone. [...] An unknown proportion of subducted continental crust returns to the surface as ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes, which contain metamorphic [...] <b>coesite</b> and/or diamond plus or minus unusual silicon-rich garnets and/or potassium-bearing pyroxenes. [...] The presence of these minerals demonstrate subduction of continental crust to at least 90–140km deep. [...] Examples of UHP terranes are known from the Dabie–Sulu belt of east-central China, the Western Alps, the Himalaya of India, the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, the Bohemian Massif of Europe, the North Qaidam of Northwestern China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, and Mali. [...] Most UHP terranes consist of an imbricated sheets or nappes. [...] The fact that most UHP terranes consist of thin sheets suggests that much thicker, volumetrically dominant tracts of continental crust are more deeply subducted.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, {{a natural}} {{occurrence}} of <b>coesite</b> {{was reported by}} Edward C. T. Chao, in collaboration with Eugene Shoemaker, from Barringer Crater, in Arizona, US, which was evidence that the crater must have been formed by an impact. After this report, the presence of <b>coesite</b> in unmetamorphosed rocks was taken as evidence of a meteorite impact event or of an atomic bomb explosion.

50|$|<b>Coesite</b> {{is a form}} (polymorph) {{of silicon}} dioxide SiO2 that is formed when very high {{pressure}} (2-3 gigapascals), and moderately high temperature (700 °C F), are applied to quartz. <b>Coesite</b> was first synthesized by Loring Coes Jr., a chemist at the Norton Company, in 1953.|$|E
50|$|The {{very high}} {{pressures}} associated with impacts {{can lead to}} the formation of high-pressure polymorphs of various minerals.

50|$|In {{metamorphic}} rocks, <b>coesite</b> {{was initially}} described in eclogite xenoliths from {{the mantle of}} the Earth that were carried up by ascending magmas; kimberlite {{is the most common}} host of such xenoliths. In metamorphic rocks, <b>coesite</b> is now {{recognized as one of the}} best mineral indicators of metamorphism at very high pressures (UHP, or ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism). Such UHP metamorphic rocks record subduction or continental collisions in which crustal rocks are carried to depths of 70 km or more. <b>Coesite</b> is formed at pressures above about 2.5 GPa (25 kbar) and temperature above about 700 °C. This corresponds to a depth of about 70 km in the Earth. It can be preserved as mineral inclusions in other phases because as it partially reverts to quartz, the quartz rim exerts pressure on the core of the grain, preserving the metastable grain as tectonic forces uplift and expose these rock at the surface. As a result, the grains have a characteristic texture of a polycrystalline quartz rim (see infobox figure).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coesite</b> is a tectosilicate {{with each}} silicon atom {{surrounded}} by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedron. Each oxygen atom is then bonded to two Si atoms {{to form a}} framework. There are two crystallographically distinct Si atoms and five different oxygen positions in the unit cell. Although the unit cell is close to being hexagonal in shape ("a" [...] and [...] "c" [...] are nearly equal and β nearly 120°), it is inherently monoclinic and cannot be hexagonal. The crystal structure of <b>coesite</b> {{is similar to that}} of feldspar and consists of four silicon dioxide tetrahedra arranged in Si4O8 and Si8O16 rings. The rings are further arranged into chains. This structure is metastable within the stability field of quartz: <b>coesite</b> will eventually decay back into quartz with a consequent volume increase, although the metamorphic reaction is very slow at the low temperatures of the Earth's surface. The crystal symmetry is monoclinic C2/c, No.15, Pearson symbol mS48.|$|E

50|$|As {{observed}} {{in and around}} astroblems such as impact craters, ordinary silica or quartz crystals may alter to the minerals stishovite and <b>coesite</b> {{as a result of}} meteorite impacts producing an extreme pressure and high temperature environment.|$|E
