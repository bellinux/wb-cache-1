A Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based method {{was developed to}} identify intracity <b>truck</b> <b>crash</b> zones, capture spatial data within 0. 25 -, 0. 5 - and 1 -mile buffers for each selected zone, and examine relationships between demographic, socio-economic, land-use, and on-network characteristics and intracity <b>truck</b> <b>crashes.</b> Non-linear <b>truck</b> <b>crash</b> estimation models (Negative Binomial with log-link) were then developed using selected independent variables that are not correlated to each other. The working of the method and development of models is illustrated using 2008 data {{for the city of}} Charlotte, North Carolina located in the United States. Spatial characteristics extracted using 0. 5 -mile buffer width was observed to provide more statistically meaningful results to model intracity <b>truck</b> <b>crashes.</b> They were found to be positively correlated to industrial areas and areas with large residential lots but negatively correlated to densely populated areas. Zones with a median and inadequate turning radius seem to be more prone to intracity <b>truck</b> <b>crashes.</b> The method and findings from this research assists practitioners to proactively identify potential high risk areas, to understand the role of various factors on intracity <b>truck</b> <b>crashes,</b> and to develop plans to enhance safety...|$|R

Hobby Airport, (Texas) on November 16, 1942, {{as part of the}} 319th Army Air Force Women's Flying Training Detachment (AAFWFTD). This was just after the WAFS had started their orientation in Wilmington, Delaware. Unlike the WAFS, the women that reported to Houston did not have uniforms and had to find their own lodging. The [...] "Woofteddies" [...] (WFTD) also had minimal medical care, no life insurance, <b>crash</b> <b>truck,</b> or fire truck, and the ambulance was loaned from the Ellington Army Airfield, along with insufficient administrative staff, and a hodgepodge of aircraft—23 types—for training. As late as January 1943, when the third class was about to start their training, the three classes were described by Byrd Granger in On Final Approach, as [...] "a raggle-taggle crowd in a rainbow of rumpled clothing", while they gathered for morning and evening colors.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1964, the Sterling Volunteer Rescue Squad {{was created}} as a [...] "Jaycees" [...] project in a newly {{developed}} planned community in Eastern Loudoun County, following a tragic pedestrian accident in which bystanders {{had to wait for}} an ambulance from Loudoun Rescue, which was then headquartered in Hamilton, Virginia. The first station was co-located with the Library in the 200 block of N. Sterling Blvd, in 1968 a <b>crash</b> <b>truck</b> was purchased under a highway safety grant, that unit (Sterling 1) was housed at the Shell gas station in Sterling Park. A year earlier the membership of Sterling Rescue would be active in forming the Sterling Vol. Fire Company. In the early 1970s, both Sterling Rescue and the Sterling Fire Company would work together to build its first station to house both organizations in Sterling Park. Both organizations continue to be independent corporations, co-located in the same stations. Later, that same decade, Sterling Rescue would be instrumental in implementing Advance Life Support care within the Loudoun County system.|$|E
5000|$|The federal {{government}} purchased 142 acres of farmland in 1941 {{to build an}} outlying airfield supporting operations at Naval Air Station Alameda. A 4,000-foot asphalt-paved runway was oriented 070-250 and crossed at its midpoint by a second 3,800-foot asphalt runway oriented 130-310. Each runway had a parallel taxiway, and a third taxiway connected the easterly ends of the two runways to an intermediate concrete apron. An additional 75 acres acquired in June, 1943, allowed construction of an operations building with a two-story control tower, a fire and <b>crash</b> <b>truck</b> garage, two gasoline storage tanks, an oil storage building, a small arms ammunition magazine, a well for the airfield water supply, and a backstop used for small arms practice and aircraft machinegun collimation. [...] Simultaneous development of NALF Santa Rosa was more extensive because poor site drainage caused periodic flooding of the Cotati field. Touch-and-go landing practice became the primary activity at the Cotati satellite airfield of the Santa Rosa Auxiliary Naval Air Station. Runway damage from 1945 flooding terminated military flight operations at Cotati despite continuing use of NALF Santa Rosa.|$|E

Crashes on adverse pavement conditions such as snow, ice, and slush were less severe in comparison to crashes on pavements of different conditions. Crashes reported on local roads were less severe compared to those reported on other highways. The researchers recommend strengthening the ongoing focus on reducing the occurrence of driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as an in-depth investigation of <b>truck</b> <b>crashes</b> involving farm equipment.

The Mercedes-Benz Unimog and snowplough (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new Mack was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of 'Esso' (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman Crane Truck (1154). A new Berliet cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport <b>Crash</b> <b>Truck</b> (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976. The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in 'Esso' livery (1157) or 'Gulf' livery (1160), and later in February 1982 in the livery of 'Guinness' (1169). A new Car Transporter (1159) was issued in November 1976 using the new Ford Transcontinental cab, and two more construction site orientated vehicles were issued, the JCB Crawler Loader (1110) in June 1976 and the Volvo BM Concrete Mixer (1156) in January 1977. The Dolphinarium (1164) was issued in April 1980 and featured the Berliet cab and a flatbed trailer which carried a large plastic water tank. Once the tank was filled a plunger attached to a jet nozzle within the tank could be pumped forcing two model dolphins attached to a plastic guide to jump {{out of the water and}} through the air.|$|E

40|$|One-ninth of all traffic {{fatalities}} in the United States have involved large trucks {{in the past}} five years, although large trucks contributed to only 3 % of registered vehicles and 7 % of vehicle miles travelled. This contrasting proportion indicates that truck crashes in general tend to be more severe than other crashes though they constitute a smaller sector of vehicles on the road. To study this issue, fatal crash data from the FARS was used to analyze characteristics and factors contributing to truck-involved crashes. Driver, vehicle, and crash-related contributory causes were identified, and as an extension the likelihood of occurrence of these contributory causes in truck-involved crashes with respect to non-truck crashes was evaluated using the Bayesian Statistical approach. Likelihood ratios indicated that factors such as stopped or unattended vehicles and improper following have greater probability of occurrence in truck crashes than in non-truck crashes. Also, Multinomial Logistic Regression was used to model the type of fatal <b>crash</b> (<b>truck</b> vs. non-truck) to compare the relative significance of various factors in truck and non-truck crashes.
