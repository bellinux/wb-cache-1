The key employees with higher organizational performance characteristics are often entitled "talent" for their key networking status in creating the organizational intelligent capital values during the intellectual era. This paper intend to be a fair and balanced assessment standard of employee's performance characters, synthesize a conceptual scale that provides a relatively comprehensive, yet parsimonious, explanation of key degree of talents' performance characters. Especially in <b>cross-industries</b> sampling, {{it is not only}} in favor of catching characteristic performance features possessed by talents in creating organizational values but also revealing the internal relations between talents' performance features and their organizational behaviors based on social capital theory...|$|R
40|$|The paper empirically {{investigates the}} issue of {{financial}} constraints to investment, focusing on its relationship with innovation activities. The study {{is based on the}} analysis of a <b>cross-industries</b> panel of 804 Italian companies, observed through the years 1995 - 2000. The main objective of the study is to highlight whether there are financial determinants underlying the strong bias of patenting activity towards larger companies in the Italian economy. By applying a dynamic panel analysis, we found that only the firms showing lower financial constraints are able to keep a sustained patenting profile through time. Our evidence suggests the existence of an imperfect capital market in the Italian economy, particularly in the case of medium-sized companies, which tend to delay inefficiently the start of in-house R&D activitie...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to account for <b>cross-industries</b> differences in technological efforts; most of them have been accomplished along the lines of the structure-conduct-performance hypothesis. It is our purpose to reverse such an approach in the light of the latest theoretical and empirical contributions. We study the effects on the market structure of differences in firms' innovative effort within different technological environments, defined in terms both of the technological opportunity and of the appropriability of the innovations' returns. Results from a panel of Italian industrial sectors for the period 1978 - 1993 confirm previous evidence from other countries: technological efforts prove to have a negative impact on the level of concentration. Moreover, such a relationship may be modified depending on the technological conditions prevailing in each industry. The higher the potential knowledge available (better opportunity conditions), the lower the entry barriers and the more decentralising is the effect of technological activity. At the same time, the better the appropriability conditions, the more successfully innovative behaviour conveys greater quotas of the market, increasing its concentration.

40|$|The {{understanding}} {{the effects of}} financial reforms on financial constraints and firm investment {{is an important issue}} from both microeconomics and macroeconomics perspectives. This study empirically investigates the impact of financial reforms introduced in the 90 s have succeeded in relaxing financial constraints to investment. The analysis is mainly based on the <b>cross-industries</b> panel of 501 Indian and Chinese non-financial large firms for the period from 2000 to 2009. By applying an Euler investment model, we examine the whether financial reforms have relaxed the constraints faced by firms for domestic and foreign investment decision. In particular, impact of financial reforms is measured through two ways: credit supply and foreign listing. Results find that firms are financially constrained in their investment decision. Intensity of financial constraints to investment is higher for Indian firms. Firms from both economies face financial constraints to their domestic as well as foreign investment. Further, results show that financial constraints to overall investment in Indian market decreases with business group affiliation, while state-ownership is beneficial for Chinese firms to overcome market imperfections. Similar pattern emerges for corporate domestic and foreign investmen...|$|R
40|$|Applications of {{knowledge}} management in project management {{is an active}} area of research. There {{are at least three}} important reasons for this: re-use {{of knowledge}} can substantiate success rates of the projects significantly, projects can provide a sustainable competitive advantage to the organizations, employee turnover rates are climbing (Statistics, 2013) to the new heights due to globalizations and advancements in information and communication technologies. This research was initiated in the belief that successful completion of projects plays a vital role in maintaining sustainable competitive advantage for the organizations; which in turn relies on the efficient exploitation of 'intangible' assets of the organizations (Grant, 1991; Jugdev, Mathur, & Fung, 2007 b; Jugdev & Thomas, 2002). Successful completion of projects is of more importance when we talk about Information Technology (IT) organizations because IT organizations are unique in a way that these are totally dependent on projects. Projects, whether in IT organizations or in any other organization, are accomplished by implementing practices and processes of project management and combining various organizational assets and resources in some unique way. That is why assessment {{of the extent to which}} organizations are practicing such project management capabilities is considered important. To fulfill this need, researchers and management consultancy organizations around the world developed various project management maturity assessment models over the past three decades. These models assess various aspects of the organizations but lack in the assessment of the extent to which organizations are exploiting successfully their 'intangible' assets. The Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM 3 ®) is one of the leading models (PMI, 2011) developed by Project Management Institute (PMI®) to assess organizational project management maturity. This model, although the most comprehensive models of its kind, still lacks the capability to assess 'intangible' assets of the organizations. Therefore, the objective of my research is to bridge this deficiency and enhance the capability of OPM 3 ® by making it capable of assessing the extent to which organizations are managing their 'intangible' assets. Organizations possess a breadth of 'intangible' assets and some of these assets are not directly measurable while others are difficult to measure. One of such 'intangible' 9 assets is 'knowledge' which is possessed and created by the organizations of all types. Careful assessment and management of that knowledge is of critical importance for the organizations. This knowledge lies in organizations at different places and in various forms such as in their processes, practices, documents, culture, human capital, etc. This study will not only help the IT organizations in Pakistan but also to the organizations worldwide by creating awareness of the best practices to follow for managing their knowledge efficiently. The researcher divided this study in two major phases for data collection and its analysis. In the first phase, open-ended qualitative interviews were conducted with senior project managers of IT organizations in two major cities of Pakistan in medium to large organizations to solicit and gather their opinions about best practices for knowledge management (KM). After performing qualitative data analysis on this data, we identified major themes and their respective best practices for KM. Based on these best practices, we developed hypotheses and collected data again from various organizations from IT sector, both in-country and out-of-country, to validate the results and verify the applicability of best practices in different industrial sectors and in four countries: Pakistan, UAE, Canada and USA. Various statistical tests were conducted on these data to look for correlations and variances among groups of respondents to finally suggest the best practices which are of real worth. The output of the study is a collection of globally and <b>cross-industries</b> validated knowledge management best practices capable of guiding organizations 'what to do' if they want to harness one of their intangible assets i. e. knowledge. We recommend that these best practices should be incorporated in OPM 3 ® as they have been statistically tested to have applicability in the organizations worldwide...|$|R
