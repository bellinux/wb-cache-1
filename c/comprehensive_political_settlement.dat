This policy briefing is based on case studies from Egypt and Kenya which confirm that <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> that only focus on formal actors and spaces {{at the national level}} are crucially flawed. Beyond this confirmation, the research also demonstrates that the viability of <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> can be shaped by local-level dynamics and determined by citizens, who might re-kindle the violence if excluded from the settlement. To be stable, political arrangements and leaders need to enjoy legitimacy and credibility conferred by citizens.

There are numerous definitions of <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> and elite pacts, often including an emphasis on understandings between elites that bring about the conditions to end conflict, or maintain peace.

50|$|The Paris Peace Accords were in 1991, {{and sought}} to settle {{once and for all}} the {{political}} violence that had plagued Cambodia since the 1960s. It was designed {{to put an end to}} the civil war in Cambodia, usher out the occupying Vietnamese army and establish free, fair and peaceful elections. Parties to that accord, namely Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Soviet Union, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, created the Agreement on a <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Settlement</b> of the Cambodia Conflict, a far ranging document that outlined the reconstruction effort. The mandates for that agreement were, as articulated in the nine parts thereof, Arrangements During the Transitional Period, Transitional Period, United Nations, Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Supreme National Council, Withdrawal of Foreign Forces and its Verification, Cease-fire and Cessation of Outside Military Assistance, Elections, Human Rights, International Guarantees, Refugees and Displaced Persons, National Communities, Communes and Representation.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Louis O’Neill was {{confirmed}} by the Belgian Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe as OSCE Ambassador and Head of Mission to Moldova.The OSCE Mission to Moldova's Mandate calls for facilitating the achievement of a lasting, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> of the Transnistrian conflict in all its aspects, as well as advancing human and minority rights, democratic transformation, {{freedom of the press}} and fighting the scourge of human trafficking. It also requires ensuring transparency of the removal and destruction of Russian ammunition and armaments from Moldova.Ambassador O’Neill pushed hard for fulfillment of this Mandate - which was approved by all OSCE participating States - and for reconciliation of the Moldovan and Transnistrian sides. He brought them together in a seminar on Confidence and Security Building measures in October 2007, on the margins of which the 5+2 negotiating format (OSCE, Russia, Ukraine, EU, US, Moldova and Transnistria) {{met for the first time}} in some 18 months. O’Neill did much to encourage the sides to disarm, including providing financial aid for the destruction of surplus weapons, and organizing seminars on proper storage and stockpile management.|$|E

The end of the Cold War has engendered a new spirit of multi-lateral activism in the international community. Intervention in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country is deemed legitimate, necessary, and desired to secure more worldly goals of peace, stability and respect for human rights. The United Nations-sponsored peacemaking process brought to Cambodia sought to achieve these goals by establishing a cease-fire and setting Cambodia upon the road of a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> through democratic self determination {{in the form of}} elections in May 1993. The analysis of this study has identified the Cambodian peace plan as flawed in content and context as an externally imposed solution to an internal problem entrusted to an institution without the ability to enforce peace and order. The mandate establishing the UN mission in Cambodia simply did not vest it with the proper authority to enforce compliance with the terms of the peace plan. Cambodian political culture possesses a dynamic which is resistent to national reconciliation. The winner-take-all mentality of the Khmer deva-rajas is poor soil for democratic pluralism to take root. Restoring peace and stability and establishing democracy in Cambodia will require more than an eighteen-month lull in the fighting, a single election, and the new constitution that the United Nations can bring to the situation. As such, the UN mandated peacekeeping plan for Cambodia, as it has unfolded, has exposed so many shortcomings of good intentions gone awry that it cannot be adopted as the universal model for a peacemaking process in the new world order.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn this thesis, I {{demonstrate that the}} ability of a peace enforcement operation to deter spoilers determines the progress of a <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> to a conflict. Using the method of difference, I examine how two case studies with similar security environments obtained divergent results in <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> to their respective conflicts. In Somalia, Operation Restore Hope provided a strong peace enforcement operation, but ultimately failed to deter spoilers to United Nations negotiations for a <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> to the conflict. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Operation Artemis succeeded in deterring spoilers to the implementation of a <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> to that country's civil war. Peace enforcement operations like Artemis, which offer highly credible military capabilities in direct support of the political negotiating process, prove to be effective in deterring spoilers and thus ensuring forward momentum for a <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> to the conflict.

40|$|Why do similar sets {{of formal}} {{institutions}} often have such divergent outcomes? An analysis of <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> goes {{some way to}} answering this question by bringing into focus the contending interests that exist within any state, which constrain and facilitate institutional and developmental change. It provides a framework to analyse how the state is linked to society and what lies behind the formal representation of politics in a state. The <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> and the elite bargains from which it emerges are central to patterns of state fragility and resilience. The role of political organisation within the <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> is crucial to both {{the stability of the}} settlement and the direction in which it evolves over time. The elite bargains that may lead to the establishment of what might be considered a resilient <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> may also act as a barrier to progressive developmental change. Analysis of <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> suggests that state-building is far from a set of technical formulas, but is a highly political process. Creating capacity within a state to consolidate and expand taxation is fundamentally determined by the shape of the <b>political</b> <b>settlement</b> underlying the state. This is true as well for the development of service delivery or any other function of the state. This analytical framework provides a window for donors to grasp the politics of a place in order to design more effective interventions...|$|R

40|$|Since 1991, Western {{bilateral}} and multilateral democracy promotion assistance, especially for civil society development, has increased dramatically.

The inclusivity of <b>political</b> <b>settlements</b> can determine who receives funding and who does not and also influences the representativeness of political institutions. In contexts with noninclusive <b>political</b> <b>settlements,</b> where certain groups are excluded from the settlement and the settlement enjoys minimal support, democracy promotion efforts are more likely to exacerbate polarization, thereby weakening the quality of civil society.
