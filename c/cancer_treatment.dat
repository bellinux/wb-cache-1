5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment.</b> For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for <b>cancer</b> <b>treatment,</b> but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
