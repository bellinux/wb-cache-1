50|$|Leaving the Alien {{on board}} the Marion, the {{remaining}} survivors — Hoop, Ripley, Sneddon, Baxter, Kasyanov and Lachance — fly {{to the surface of}} LV-178 in the Samson and enter the mine. As they descend into the complex, Ash (who has now infected the Marions <b>computers)</b> <b>sabotages</b> the elevator and sends them plunging to the very lowest level of the mine, where the miners originally stumbled upon the Xenomorphs. The elevator is smashed beyond repair, and the survivors are forced to trek through the complex to reach a second elevator at the far side. They soon stumble upon a Xenomorph Hive, as well as a massive derelict spacecraft buried underground. With the Xenomorphs pursuing them, they {{have no choice but to}} head inside the ship.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, Tim Lloyd, an 11-year {{employee}} of OMEGA {{and a network}} administrator within the company, was fired. Three weeks after he was fired, he unleashed a hacking [...] "time bomb" [...] within OMEGA's computer systems, deleting the software that ran all of OMEGA's manufacturing operations at its factory in Bridgeport, New Jersey. OMEGA spent nearly $2 million repairing the programs and lost nearly $10 million in revenue, resulting in 80 employee layoffs, though Lloyd's lawyer stated that OMEGA's losses were far smaller. Tim Lloyd was later convicted of <b>computer</b> <b>sabotage</b> {{and was sentenced to}} 41 months in Federal prison. The Tim Lloyd hacking case {{is considered one of the}} largest employee sabotage cases in United States history. The case also aired in a Forensic Files episode [...] "Hack Attack", episode 39 of season 8.|$|E
5000|$|Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a {{thousand}} fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of [...] "the Farewell dossier": how a CIA campaign of <b>computer</b> <b>sabotage</b> {{resulting in a}} huge explosion in Siberia — all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss — helped us win the Cold War.Under normal circumstances, success has {{a thousand}} fathers and failure is an orphan; {{in the world of}} intelligence gathering, {{nothing could be further from}} the truth. Weiss worked down the hall from me Safire in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president — detente notwithstanding — to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the USSR.|$|E

50|$|Koenig asks {{if that is}} why the Guardian has <b>sabotaged</b> their <b>computer.</b> The servant {{explains}} that the <b>computer</b> was not <b>sabotaged,</b> merely taken over for the Guardian's use. Of all things on Alpha its mind was most nearly perfect and it most readily accepted the will of the Guardian. Koenig argues that it may be alright for the computer because it's a machine, but the Alphans are human beings - they can't exist on Pirian terms. The servant responds that perfection is absolute; the Alphans must be made perfect. Koenig walks away and makes his way to the remaining Eagle. He pilots it back to Piri.|$|R
50|$|On 2 May 2007, a {{criminal}} investigation was opened into the attacks under {{a section of the}} Estonian Penal Code criminalising <b>computer</b> <b>sabotage</b> and interference with the working of a computer network, felonies punishable by imprisonment of up to three years. As a number of attackers turned out to be within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, on 10 May 2007, Estonian Public Prosecutor's Office made a formal investigation assistance request to the Russian Federation's Supreme Procurature under a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) existing between Estonia and Russia. A Russian State Duma delegation visiting Estonia in early May in regards the situation surrounding the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn had promised that Russia would aid such investigation in every way available. On 28 June, Russian Supreme Procurature refused assistance, claiming that the proposed investigative processes are not covered by the applicable MLAT. Piret Seeman, the Estonian Public Prosecutor's Office's PR officer, criticized this decision, pointing out that all the requested processes are actually enumerated in the MLAT.|$|E
40|$|Within the IS {{security}} field, employee {{computer crime}} has received increased attention. Indeed, {{a number of}} researchers have focused their attention on the behaviour of the ‘insider’, both prior to and during the perpetration. Despite this, there is currently an absence of academic insight into the problem of workplace disgruntlement and how this may motivate employee computer crime. To address this deficiency, this paper draws on a body of knowledge called ‘organisational justice’, which examines how perceptions of fairness are formed. Under this umbrella term are four constructs which relate to different organisational phenomena and influence employees’ fairness perceptions. It is believed that these constructs, entitled distributive, procedural, interactional and informational justice, and the theories which underpin them, can not only assist in understanding, but also in mitigating disgruntlement. To illustrate this, a case of employee <b>computer</b> <b>sabotage</b> is analysed, highlighting which forms of organisational justice occurred, and how they could have been addressed. The discussion section notes how mitigating disgruntlement provides a new area for safeguard implementation, with the final part of the paper discussing the conclusions and potential for future research...|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 1968, the New York Central {{was absorbed}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad, forming the new Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company that was {{eventually}} renamed the Penn Central Transportation Company, with the NYC's Alfred Perlman as president. Penn Central was quickly saddled with debt when the ICC forced the money-losing New Haven into the railroad in 1969. In addition, the merger was handled in a haphazard manner with no formal merger plan implemented. The two companies' competing corporate cultures, union interest, and incompatible operating and <b>computer</b> systems <b>sabotaged</b> any hope for a success. Additionally {{in an effort to}} look profitable, the board of directors authorized the use of the railroad's reserve cash to pay dividends to company stockholders. Nevertheless, on June 21, 1970 Penn Central declared bankruptcy, the largest private bankruptcy in the United States to that time. Under bankruptcy protection many of Penn Central's outstanding debts owed to other railroads were frozen, while debts owed to Penn Central by the other roads were not. This sent a trickle effect throughout the already fragile railroad industry forcing many of the other Northeastern railroads into insolvency, among them the Erie Lackawanna, Boston and Maine, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Reading Company, and the Lehigh Valley.|$|R
5000|$|While Dai is {{the major}} author of INEW doctrine, the {{strategy}} stems from both U.S. and Soviet IW doctrine. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union had a doctrine called Radio-Electronic Combat (REC), which the U.S. Army describes as “the total integration of electronic warfare and physical destruction resources to deny us the use of our electronic systems.” [...] Multiple authors call INEW “REC on steroids.” This is because INEW adds additional dimensions to REC, specifically INEW moves beyond the tactical and theater realms of operations where REC was applied by elevating the INEW doctrine to a strategic level of war. Additionally, INEW adds cyber attacks and kinetic attacks on satellites to the REC doctrine. INEW also implements U.S. IW strategy from the AirLand Battle doctrine, the U.S. response to REC that integrated airpower, special operations forces, artillery, armor, and EW. Additionally, INEW implements lessons learned from U.S. information operations in Kosovo, the Balkans, and Iraq. Lessons learned from these U.S. military engagements may have influenced China's decision to apply IW doctrine at the strategic war level. INEW integrates the use of “EW, CNO, and limited kinetic strikes against key command, control, communication, and computer nodes to disrupt the enemy's battlefield network information systems.” CNO include computer network attack, defense, and exploitation. Aligning with Dai's ideology, INEW unites offensive and defensive IW under a single authority, specifically 4PLA. [...] One {{of the most important}} aspects of INEW is that it integrates IW into larger PLA operations, [...] calling for kinetic attacks that make use of opportunities created by IW operations, as Dai discussed above. [...] For example, INEW doctrine combines precision strikes and IW operations, likely targeting command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) targets in line with INEW doctrine. [...] INEW applies a variety of methods, to include the disruption and destruction of systems, creation of false realities through falsified information, electronic jamming, deception, and suppression, computer network attacks, <b>computer</b> intrusions to <b>sabotage</b> information processing, and impeding information transmissions. The goal of INEW is to weaken and/or paralyze an opponent's decision making capabilities and the political, economic, and military component's of the enemy's war infrastructure. [...] To do this, INEW doctrine calls for IW operations to seize control of opponent's information flows and maintain information dominance during campaigns. IW operations also aim to achieve information dominance that would result in denying the opponent access to information that is vital to continuing the conflict. [...] This dominance should be maintained throughout conflicts. INEW continues to be the dominant doctrinal core of PLA IW operations today, with 4PLA likely in the authoritative position to implement this strategy.|$|R
