40|$|We {{compared}} {{the growth of}} 10 strains of rumen bacteria in an anaerobic medium reduced with <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> dithiothreitol, or titanium (III) citrate. The redox potential of medium reduced with <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was - 167. 8 mV; with dithiothreitol it was - 175. 8 mV; and with titanium(III) citrate it was - 302. 4 mV at a concentration of 5 X 10 (- 4) M titanium and - 403. 9 mV at 2 X 10 (- 3) M titanium. Maximum growth of the strains was generally lower with dithiothreitol or titanium(III) citrate than with <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> although growth was greater than in medium lacking an added reducing agent. Strains for which cysteine was required or markedly stimulatory grew only poorly with titanium(III) citrate. No strain grew in medium with sodium citrate as the energy source.

40|$|Spinach leaves {{purchased}} from local markets of Khartoum State in winter season were tested as reducing agents in culture media (solid and liquid) for cultivation of anaerobic bacteria. In the present work, ferredoxin was {{extracted from the}} locally grown spinach leaves. The spinach ferredoxin was purified through the Diethyl amino ethyl (DEAE) – cellulose column chromatography at 4 oC and 15 oC and was sterilized by filtration. Spinach ferredoxin activity {{was determined by the}} absorbancy measuerment (UV. Spectrophotometer) in ultraviolet (UV) - visible region. Different concentrations of sterilized spinach ferredoxin were added to the Reinforced Clostridial Agar (RCA) and Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM) as substitutes for <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> The modified RCA and RCM media were then used for cultivation of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium chauvoei strains. Absorbancy measurment and viable counts of some of the above mentioned anaerobic bacteria on spinach ferredoxin media gave better counts than the control media (RCA) and (RCM). The highest growth occurred with 1 % spinach ferredoxin added to both (RCA) and (RCM). Moreover, spinach ferredoxin supported the anaerobic bacterial growth even in its lowest concentration (0. 1 %). Generally, some of the tested anaerobic bacteria produced larger colonies on media prepared from the spinach ferredoxin. The redox-potential (E 0) was measured by platinum electrode during the growth of Clostridium chauvoei strain (Kad 1) on modified RCM without <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> + 1 % spinach ferredoxin, RCM (control) and RCM without <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or spinach ferredoxin.

Prereduced Trypticase soy broth with no added reducing agents exhibited a potential of - 141 mV. Ascorbic acid at 0. 2 to 0. 005 % and sodium thioglycolate at concentrations below 0. 05 % produced an Eh 7 {{higher than the}} prereduced Trypticase soy broth containing no added reducing agents. The addition of <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> 2 -mercaptoethanol, and sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate to prereduced Trypticase soy broth resulted in a reduction of Eh 7 compared to the system without added reducing agents. The order of relative reducing intensity (from highest to lowest) for the reducing agents when comparing molar concentration was: sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, 2 -mercaptoethanol, <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> sodium thioglycolate, and ascorbic acid.

Ther. 192 : 179 - 194, 1975. It is thought that a derivative of ethacrynic acid (EA) must possess an intact a, / 3 -un-saturated ketone group {{in order to be}} capable of eliciting a diuretic response. The 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propanol and the cysteine adducts of ethacrynic acid lack such a functional group and still have diuretic activity, especially the cysteine adduct.

METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of C difficile, 17 strains of other Clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with MIC determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of Clostridium sp and 15 isolates of Bacteroides sp. Using C difficile agar base with 0. 5 g/l of <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile after direct faecal culture. RESULTS: Norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of Bacteroides sp tested, together with Clostridium sp other than C difficile. Using the antibiotics in combination (CDMN), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of C difficile were unaffected. When CDMN medium was compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea, the CDMN agar isolated 20 % more strains and {{reduced the number of}} contaminating colonies by 30 %.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Compounds {{belonging}} to the vitamin K family possess anti-hemorrhagic property, and are used in treating patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia and obstructive jaundice. Some of these compounds also exhibit marked antimicrobial activity toward various microorganisms. Vitamin K₅, 4 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -naphthol hydrochloride, a water-soluble analog of vitamin K {{has been shown to}} possess such an antimicrobial activity toward many bacteria, molds, and yeasts. Much of the work reported in literature is on its use as a possible food preservative, and little information is available on the mechanism of its action on the microorganisms. In this study, the mode of action of vitamin K₅ on Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated. Its effect on yeast cells, with and without sodium chloride; its color reactions with trisodium pentacyanoaminoferroate; its influence on certain enzyme systems of the yeast cell as indicated by 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride; and the antagonistic effect of <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> toward it were studied. In addition, the sulfhydryl groups of yeast cells were estimated by amperometric titration, and carbon dioxide production by yeast cells from different substrates was determined manometrically. The results showed that vitamin K₅ did not inhibit the yeast cells immediately on coming into contact with them. Vitamin K₅, with sodium chloride, produced 76 percent inhibition of yeast cells in 50 minutes as compared to 50 percent inhibition produced during the same time when used alone. <b>Cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> reacted with vitamin K₅ and stopped it from producing a blue color with trisodium pentacyanoaminoferroate. <b>Cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> also antagonized the antifungal activity of vitamin K₅, since in its presence vitamin K₅ failed to stop the reduction of 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride by dehydrogenase systems. The yeast cells which had previously been inhibited by vitamin K₅ could not be revived by treatment with <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> These cells had developed a dark pink color which could not be removed by repeated washings. The sulfhydryl groups of yeast cells were reduced quantitatively when they were exposed to vitamin K₅. The reduction was not immediate and followed the same pattern as in case of total counts. Higher concentrations of vitamin K₅ inhibited carbon dioxide production by yeast cells to a greater extent in the three substrates used in this study. The action of vitamin K₅ is not immediate, the coloration picked up by the cells cannot be washed off, and its action is hastened in the presence of sodium chloride. All these seem to indicate that permeability of the cell is involved in some manner in the inhibition process. Higher concentrations of vitamin K₅ produce greater inhibition which shows that this compound also combines with sulfhydryl groups of the yeast cells. These findings suggest that the mode of action of vitamin K₅ is most likely due to an alteration of cell permeability as well as by combining with sulfhydryl groups of the yeast cells...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, good quality freezable semen was not {{utilized}} effectively due to less knowledge about the freezability of semen.

So the study of pre-freezing and post thaw seminal parameters like viability, motility, acrosomal integrity, lipid peroxide assay, vanguard distance traveled by sperm, mitochondrial membrane potential, velocity and motility parameters (CASA) and field fertility trial helped to assess the effectiveness of the additives. The conception rate was better in reduced glutathione than the <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> treated group.

This thesis discusses the means used to mechanically transmit pear viruses, the properties of those viruses and their relationships with latent viruses of apple. Herbaceous plant virus indicators did not develop symptoms when they were grafted with infected pears. Virus was only mechanically transmitted to herbaceous plants when the reducing agent <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and a chelator of the copper in polyphenol oxidase, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, {{were added to the}} grinding medium, phosphate buffer. A virus was mechanically transmitted to Chenopodium amaranticolor from four pear species inoculated with one virus source, and Bartlett pear (B- 13) previously inoculated with seven virus sources. C. amaranticolor developed local lesions, systemic oakleaf patterns and chlorosis, and was the only genus which became infected. All virus sources were positive for ring mosaic and vein yellows symptoms. The virus which incited ring mosaic symptoms was filtered through inoculated Prunus spp. and in this way was separated from the vein yellows virus. Similar symptoms were incited in C. amaranticolor by a virus mechanically transmitted from pear showing only ring mosaic symptoms. The pear virus isolates incited two local lesion types on C. quinoa. "Type 1 " lesion was water-soaked, tan and 2 to 3 mm in diameter. "Type 2 " lesion was brown and 1 mm in diameter. The two pear virus isolates were partially purified by homogenizing infected C. quinoa tissue in phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and a clarifying agent, bentonite, and concentrating the suspension with one low and one high speed centrifugation.

This medium contained 1. 0 % glucose, 1. 0 % Bacto Peptone (Difco), 0. 5 % yeast extract (BBL), 0. 5 % meat extract (Difco), 0. 25 % gelatin (Difco), 0. 5 % calcium lactate, 0. 05 % sorbic acid, 75 ppm of sodium azide (Sigma), 0. 25 % sodium acetate, 0. 1 % (vol/vol) Tween 80, 15 % tomato juice, 30 micrograms of vancomycin (Sigma) per ml, 0. 20 microgram of tetracycline (Serva) per ml, 0. 5 mg of <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> per ml, and 1. 5 % agar (Difco). LUSM medium was used successfully for isolation and enumeration of Leuconostoc spp. in dairy products and vegetables. Of 116 colony isolates obtained from fresh raw milk, curdled milk, or various vegetables, 115 were identified {{as members of the}} genus Leuconostoc. A total of 89 of these isolates were identified to species; 13. 5 % of the isolates were Leuconostoc cremoris, 7. 9 % were Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, 11. 2 % were Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum, 16. 9 % were Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. paramesenteroides, 10. 1 % were leuconostoc lactis, and 40. 4 % were Leuconostoc oenos.

40|$|The maximum {{growth rate}} of Bacteroides ruminicola B 14 was {{significantly}} improved when either Trypticase or acetate and C 4 -C 5 fatty acids were added to defined medium containing macrominerals, microminerals, vitamins, hemin, <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and glucose. The organism was unable to grow with peptides as the sole energy source, but growth yields from glucose were significantly improved when Trypticase was added to batch cultures containing basal medium, acetate, and C 4 -C 5 volatile fatty acids. During periods of rapid growth, very little peptide was deaminated to ammonia, but after growth ceased there was a linear increase in ammonia. Fifteen grams of Trypticase per liter resulted in maximum ammonia production. In glucose-limited chemostats, ammonia production from peptides was inversely proportional to the dilution rate, and 87 % {{of the variation in}} ammonia production could be explained by retention time in the culture vessel. Chemostats receiving Trypticase had higher theoretical maximum growth yields and lower maintenance energy expenditures than similar cultures not receiving peptide. Cells from the Trypticase cultures contained more carbohydrate, and this difference was most evident at rapid dilution rates. When corrections were made for cell composition and the amount of peptides that were fermented, it appeared that peptide carbon skeletons could be used for maintenance energy. B. ruminicola B 14 was unable to grow on peptides alone because it was unable to utilize peptides at a fast enough rate to meet its maintenance requirement...|$|E
40|$|This study {{initially}} {{involved the}} isolation {{of a number of}} bifidobacteria from either the lumen or the epithelium of a porcine cecum. A total of 160 isolates were selected at random on MRS plates containing <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (0. 5 g/liter) and mupirocin (50 mg/liter). All were identified as bifidobacteria based on fructose- 6 -phosphate phosphoketolase activity. Following genomic digestion with the restriction enzyme XbaI and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the isolates produced 15 distinct macro-restriction patterns. Several of the PFGE patterns differed by only 1, 2, or 3 DNA fragments and were grouped as related patterns into seven PFGE types, termed A through G. The related patterns appeared to show genomic plasticity within the isolates arising from chromosomal mutations or possibly horizontal transfer of plasmids. The relative frequency of each PFGE type was maintained within each cecal sample, with PFGE type E representing approximately 50 % of the isolates. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, cell morphology, whole-cell protein profiling, 16 S ribosomal DNA sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization were used to determine if the seven apparently unrelated PFGE types represented genetically distinct isolates. Four groups were identified: PFGE types A, C/D/G, B/E, and F, and these appeared to represent Bifidobacterium minimum, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two new species, respectively. The data demonstrate the presence of considerable genomic diversity within a relatively simple bifidobacteria population, consisting of 15 distinct strains representing four groups, which was maintained throughout the porcine cecal contents and epithelial layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of both (L- and D-) enantiomeric {{forms of}} cysteine {{on the silver}} electrode surface was studied by surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS) {{as a function of}} electrode potential and pH value of the solution. It was demonstrated that at potentials more positive than- 0. 7 V (for pH 3) or- 0. 8 V (for pH 2 or lower), in acidic environment L-cysteine molecules are adsorbed mainly as PH (gauche) conformer, in zwitterionic form with the COO- groups close to the surface. At more negative potentials, NH 3 + groups deprotonate at the surface with simultaneous weakening of the interaction of the carboxylic groups with the surface. Spectroscopic evidence for at least partial protonation of the COO- groups at strongly acidic solutions was given by observing the CdO stretching band at frequency lowered by about 30 cm- 1 in comparison with that observed for crystalline <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> It points to the considerable enhancement of the strength of hydrogen bonds and may be ascribed to the formation of cyclic L-cysteine dimers at the electrode surface. In neutral and alkaline solutions, adsorbed L-cysteine molecules have deprotonated amino groups at wide potential range. Similar spectroelectrochemical experiments were performed for D-cysteine and for a racemic mixture of D,L-cysteine. As expected, results for D-cysteine were similar to those for L-cysteine. However, for racemic mixture at acidic pH, the spectral effects corresponding to potential-induced transition from adsorbed zwitterions to neutral molecule were considerably smaller. This effect was discussed in terms of stereoselective dimerization of cysteine molecule at the electrode surface...|$|E
40|$|A direct {{enrichment}} procedure {{was developed to}} selectively recover small numbers of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and nalidixic acid-resistant thermophilic Campylobacter from foods. The procedure includes an enrichment medium composed of brucella broth, 7 % lysed horse blood, 0. 3 % sodium succinate, 0. 01 % <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> vancomycin (15 micrograms/ml), trimethoprim (5 micrograms/ml), polymyxin B (20 IU/ml), and cycloheximide (50 micrograms/ml) that is inoculated with 10 or 25 g of food and incubated with agitation under microaerophilic conditions at 42 degrees C for 16 to 18 h. After incubation, the medium is plated directly onto Campy-BAP agar plates (M. J. Blaser et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 91 : 179 - 185, 1979), and resulting colonies that resemble Campylobacter are identified by conventional tests. The foods evaluated included raw milk, hamburger, and chicken skin which had aerobic plate counts of 10 (5) to 10 (9) bacteria/g. The procedure was effective in recovering as few as 0. 1 cell of Campylobacter per g of food. Of the 50 isolates of Campylobacter evaluated, all were recovered from raw milk and hamburger {{at a level of}} 1 to 4 cells/g, and 41 and 40 isolaes were recovered from the hamburger and milk, respectively, at 0. 1 to 0. 4 cell/g. The enrichment was least effective for recovering campylobacters from chicken skin, as 7 and 26 of 50 isolates were not recovered at 1 to 4 and 0. 1 to 0. 4 cell/g, respectively.

40|$|Methanococcus maripaludis, a facultatively {{autotrophic}} archaebacterium {{that grows}} with H 2 or formate as the electron donor, does not assimilate sugars and other complex organic substrates. However, glycogen is biosynthesized intracellularly and commonly reaches values of 0. 34 % of the cellular dry {{weight in the}} early stationary phase. To determine the pathway of glycogen catabolism, specific enzymes of sugar metabolism were assayed in cell extracts. The following enzymes were found (specific activity in milliunits per milligram of protein) : glycogen phosphorylase, 4. 4; phosphoglucomutase, 10; glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase, 9; 6 -phosphofructokinase, 5. 6, fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, 10; fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate aldolase, 4. 2; triosephosphate isomerase, 44; glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, 26; phosphoglycerate kinase, 20; phosphoglycerate mutase, 78; enolase, 107; and pyruvate kinase, 4. 0. Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase was NADP+ dependent, and the pyruvate kinase required MnCl 2. The 6 -phosphofructokinase had an unusually low pH optimum of 6. 0. Four nonoxidative pentose-biosynthetic enzymes were found (specific activity in milliunits per milligram of protein) : transketolase, 12; transaldolase, 24; ribulose- 5 -phosphate- 3 -epimerase, 55; and ribulose- 5 -phosphate isomerase, 100. However, the key enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the reductive pentose phosphate pathway, and the classical and modified Entner-Duodoroff pathways were not detected. Thus, glycogen appears to be catabolized by the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. This result is in striking contrast to the nonmethanogenic archaebacteria that have been examined, among which the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is common. A dithiothreitol-specific NADP(+) -reducing activity was also found (8. 5 mU/mg of protein). Other thiol compounds, such as <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> reduced glutathione, and 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, did not replace dithiothreitol for this activity.

Basically, radiopharmaceuticals in liquid form are not different from the dry kit. However in the manufacturing of liquid-phase kit, lyophilization process was not done. To improve the stability of liquid kit, a reformulation of the components was conducted by using two separate vials (Formulation 2) and the characteristics were compared with the one-vial formulation (Formulation 1). The MIBI Formulation 2 consists of two vials, vial A containing 0. 06 mg of SnCl 2 2 H 2 O and 2. 6 mg Sodium Citrate 2 H 2 O and vial B containing 0. 5 mg of [Cu(MIBI) 4]BF 4, 1 mg of <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and 20 mg of mannitol.

40|$|THE {{importance}} of sulfhydryl compounds {{in the process}} of morphogenesis was pointed out by Brachet (1950). Using specific inhibitors of-SH such as chloro-acetophenone, {{it has been shown that}} embryos develop a number of malforma-tions when the activity of-SH groups is interfered with (Beatty, 1951; Deuchar, 1957; Lakshmi, 1962 a). It has been observed that the abnormalities are mainly in the nervous system and these findings are in agreement with the distribution of-SH groups in embryos of amphibia (Brachet, 1950) and chick (Rulon, 1935). These studies have vindicated the {{importance of}}-SH containing proteins stressed by Brachet. In the present report are described some studies using chloroaceto-phenone (CAP) as an-SH inhibitor and cysteine to reverse its action. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fresh fertilized hen's eggs were incubated to obtain the desired stage of development and explanted in vitro by the method described by New (1955). A stock solution of 0 01 M co-chloroacetophenone (BDH) was prepared in 50 per cent, ethyl alcohol. This solution was freshly diluted with Pannett-Compton glucose saline (PC saline) to 5 • 10 ~ 4 M. For normal (untreated) controls 50 per cent, alcohol was similarly diluted for use in place of the CAP solution. <b>Cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (BDH) was freshly dissolved in PC saline to prepare a 2 • 5 jug. /ml. solution.

40|$|THE {{importance}} of sulphydryl (-SH) {{groups in the}} metabolism of cells and tissues has been under discussion {{for many years and}} estimations of tissue-SH have been carried out on numerous occasions. Absence of a method of-SH determination suitable for use on small samples, or on material of low-SH content, has limited the extent and value of such work. The development by Calcutt and Doxey (1959) of a method giving reasonably accurate and reliable-SH values on tissue samples of 50 - 200 mg. weight has made possible the determination of the amount of-SH present in the contents of a single tissue-culture bottle. EXPERIMENTAL Cultures used were of the HeLa cells and chick fibrocytes. The cells were washed off the walls of the culture bottles by means of a pipette, centrifuged down and twice washed with normal saline, being finally centrifuged to a compact mass. This was allowed to drain for a few minutes, weighed and the cells suspended in 50 ml. of 5 x 10 - 5 M p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (CMB) in 0 033 M phosphate buffer (pH 7. 3). After 30 minutes standing to allow for penetration of the reagent into the cells and reaction with the-SH groups, the suspension was made up to 100 ml. with phosphate buffer and 25 ml. aliquots titrated against a 2 x 10 - 4 M solution of <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> The end-point was determined potentiometrically, using a transistorised instrument based on the design of Stock (1958). For each batch of cysteine solution (prepared fresh each day) a control titration against the standard CMB was carried out. RESULTS Measurements of the-SH content of 40 samples of HeLa cells taken at 1 - 4 days after feeding gave a mean value of 10 - 1 ± 1 - 9,ug. per 100 mg. wet weight. On 10 samples of chick fibrocytes the mean value was 8 1 ± 2 - 6,ug. per 100 mg. wet weight. Measurement of the-SH level at intervals of 1, 2, 3 and 4 days after feeding (feeding took place 7 days after sub-culturing) was carried out on 6 batches of HeLa cells. Results are shown in Fig. 1. The-SH level rises to a peak 2 days after feeding, returning to approximately the 1 -day level on the 3 rd and 4 th days. SULPHYDRYL CONTENT OF TISSU...|$|E
40|$|Due to the finicky {{nature of}} the {{domestic}} cats' feeding habits, palatability is a highly complex area of feline nutrition, but one which is vitally important, with pet owners today selecting a brand based on palatability rather than nutritional value (Trivedi and Benning 1999). To date there is little published literature about the specific compounds and ingredients responsible for the palatability of cat foods, however, some animal by-products, particularly fish offals have been reported as being highly palatable to the cat (MacDonald et al. 1984). There is much interest {{in the use of}} synthetic diets for palatability testing because these diets can be easily manipulated to control specific properties of the diet. The aims of this study, using the domestic cat as the test species were to: (1) test the efficacy of using synthetic diets in palatability trials, (2) determine the palatability of various fish by-products when included in synthetic and commercially canned diets, (3) develop a method suitable for fractionating fish by-products and fractionate selected by-products. (4) determine the palatability of the fish by-product fractions obtained and (5) determine the palatability of various pure compounds when dissolved in pet milk. All palatability trials carried out used the two bowl free choice testing method. The freeze dried forms of hoki, mussel, salmon and jack mackerel by-products were included in a synthetic diet and compared to an un-supplemented synthetic diet. Hoki, mussel, salmon and barracouta by-products and the three fish by-product fractions (salmon oil, salmon water and barracouta water) were included fresh in commercially made canned diets and compared to a common commercial diet (control). Finally various pure compounds (amino acids, malic acid, salts, urea, creatinine, creatine, etc.) were dissolved in pet milk and compared to un-supplemented pet milk (control). Feed intakes were recorded daily for all of the trials. The test animals used were domestic short haired cats obtained from the Centre for Feline Nutrition (Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand) and all were in excellent health before testing began. The panels of cats used were either all castrated males aged three to nine years old, or a mixture of castrated males, entire females and entire males aged two to eleven years old. The feed intake data collected during the trials were analysed using t tests, and repeat measures ANOVA. Feed intakes were low overall during the synthetic trial due to the un-supplemented control diet itself not being very palatable. These low feed intakes resulted in weight losses in the cats and the study had to be abandoned prematurely. Therefore, the results are only based on a sample size of two and are of limited value as such. The other three trials were highly successful, with all cats remaining healthy, apart from two which were taken from the milk trial due to health reasons unrelated to these trials. Salmon and jack mackerel by-products were both significantly (P 0. 05) from the control when they were included in synthetic diets. When the fish by-products were included in commercial diets, the salmon and mussel by-products were the most palatable of the test diets, however, the salmon, mussel and barracouta by-products were not significantly different (P> 0. 05) from the control in terms of palatability. The hoki by-product was significantly (P 0. 05) different from the control in terms of palatability. Lastly, the trials involving the testing of pure compounds highlighted that at the 0. 3 % dose proline, lysine (lysine hydrochloride), histidine, cysteine (<b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride),</b> glycine and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were all significantly (P 0. 05) than the control at this inclusion level. In conclusion, salmon by-product was liked and hoki by-product was disliked by the cats when included in both synthetic and commercial diets. Mussel by-product was palatable when included in the commercial diets, but was no more palatable than the control when tested in the synthetic diet. Jack mackerel by-product was palatable in the synthetic diet and barracouta by-product was no more palatable than the control in the commercial diet. Salmon oil and the compounds proline, lysine hydrochloride, histidine, glycine, <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were highly palatable to the cat. If future work with synthetic diets occurs it needs to be aimed at pre-weaned kittens as {{it would be easier to}} wean young inexperienced kittens onto a synthetic diet than older cats which are used to receiving a commercially made diet. The fish by-products tested here, along with other New Zealand fish species need to be further investigated. It may also be of use to test the fish by-products and their fractions in a different type of base diet in order to determine how this affects their palatability. The dose dependency of the compounds found palatable in the milk trials also needs to be established, in order to find an optimum dose for them to be used as palatability enhancers...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{knowledge about the}} sporozoan genus Sacocystis (Protozoa: Apicomplexa) are reviewed and studies on the production, excystation and viability of sporocysts of Sarcocystis gigantea, undertaken. Investigation of a sedimentation/floatation procedure for the mass recovery of S. gigantea sporocysts from cat faeces showed that the greatest yields were obtained when a proportion of faeces to floatation medium of 5 % and a centrifugal force of 6000 x g for at least 5 min were used. Ninety-six percent of the sporocysts recovered {{were obtained from the}} first centrifugation in aqueous NaCl solution, specific gravity 1. 2. Although neither sieving nor additional washing of homogenised samples prior to floatation significantly affected sporocyst recovery both reduced the amount of debris present. A considerable reduction in the amount of debris resulted from feeding infected cats on tinned fish rather than tinned meat. The addition of CCl 4 to the NaCl solution also improved sporocyst purity but with a marked reduction in the numbers recovered. A technique for determining the concentration of sporocysts in faeces, using a modification of the mass recovery procedure and a haemocytometer, was developed. This was shown to be more accurate and reliable than the McMaster method for performing faecal sporocyst counts. It resulted in a mean sporocyst recovery of 75. 5 % and was used to obtain information about patterns of sporocyst excretion and numbers of S. gigantea sporocysts shed by 28 experimentally infected cats. In all cats, sporocyst excretion commenced 10 or 11 days post-infection(PI). Peak production occurred between 13 and 22 days PI, in most instances on days 17 and 18. Peak numbers (rounded) ranged from 550 to 260, 000 (mean = 53, 000) sporocysts per gram of faeces or from 38, 000 to 6. 6. million (mean = 1. 7 million) sporocysts per day. The number of days sporocysts were shed ranged from 26 to at least 60 days PI but in 26 of the 28 infections examined, more than 80 % of the total sporocyst yield was produced within 30 days of infection. The total numbers of sporocysts produced by individual cats over the patent period ranged from 164, 000 to 56. 6 million (mean = 12. 7 million). These numbers tended to increase with increasing infective dose and to be greater in those cats receiving multiple rather than equivalent single doses. Neither the sex of the cat, nor experience of one or two previous infections, had any significant effect on the numbers of sporocysts shed. Studies on the in vitro excystation of S. gigantea sporocysts revealed that pretreatment before exposure to trypsin and bile was an essential pre-requisite. However, in contrast to S. tenella and S. capracanis, incubation in <b>cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> under CO 2 was largely unsuccessful for excysting S. gigantea: of the pretreatments tested only exposure to sodium hypochlorite proved effective. Excystation from sodium hypochlorite-pretreated S. gigantea sporocysts took place in trypsin and bile between temperatures of 30 ° and 43 °C and occurred rapidly at 39 °C. While the presence of bile or bile salts was essential for this process, that of trypsin was not although more sporocysts excysted in its presence than in its absence. Excystation occurred in the presence of all bile types tested but not when 'Tween 80 ' was substituted for bile. The highest levels of excystation were recorded when cattle or sheep bile or sodium taurocholate were used and the lowest when chicken or pig bile were employed. Neither the concentration of sheep bile above 2. 5 %, nor hydrogen ion concentration (pH range 5. 0 to 10. 0) appeared to have any marked effect on the level of excystation obtained. The excystation process for S. gigantea was similar to that described for other Sarcocystis species and for other coccidian genera that lack sporocyst Stieda bodies. Sporozoites escaped following the collapse of the sporocyst wall and its eventual separation into four elongated pieces. In vivo studies on excystation of S. gigantea indicated that this process was, as in vitro, diphasic involving pretreatment and treatment phases. They also tended to support in vitro observations that the requirements for the excystation of S. gigantea and S. tenella sporocysts were quite different. Although the results suggested that for neither species was the pretreatment stimulus likely to be provided by conditions in the rumen alone, exposure to abomasal conditions only, induced moderate levels of excystation in both when they were subsequently treated with trypsin and bile. For S. gigantea, 0. 25 to 4 hr abomasal exposure was most effective,for S. tenella 24 hours. The stimuli necessary to complete the excystation process could, apparently, be provided by 1 hr placement in the duodenum for S. gigantea but not for S. tenella. Using in vitro excystation as a measure of viability, it was found that at 4 °C, S. gigantea sporocysts survived considerably better in tap water (85 % excystation after 174 days) than in either 2. 5 % potassium dichromate (15 % excystation after 174 days) or 2 % sulphuric acid (0 % excystation after 5 days). Although they were able to resist 48 hr suspension at room temperature in most laboratory reagents, disinfectants and anti-coccidial drugs tested, six (sulphuric acid, ammonia, methanol, ethanol, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, 16 % synergistic mixture of five chlorinated phenols.) had major sporocysticidal properties. Further investigation with three of these, showed that sporocyst excystation was reduced from 65 % to less than 10 % following contact with 2. 5 % sulphuric acid for 1 hr or with 2 % ammonia or 4 % Medol for 4 hours. Sporocysts were either killed, or their ability to excyst severely impaired, by heating to 60 ° and 55 °C for 5 and 60 min, respectively, by exposure to ultraviolet radiation at a dose of 4000 ET, or by prolonged storage in water at 24 °C. Sporocysts exposed to either constant or intermittent freezing at - 18 °C suffered a comparatively slow decline in excystation rate with time as did those subjected to desiccation. The duration of survival of desiccated sporocysts was inversely related to relative humidity and after 245 days at 33 % RH and temperatures of 15 or 24 °C, 60 % of such sporocysts excysted. Studies on the survival of S. gigantea sporocysts in faeces outdoors showed that, viability declined most rapidly over the summer months and suggested that they were unlikely to remain infective for more than one year. Possible associations between the reported findings and both the epidemiology of S. gigantea infection and some of the previous unsuccessful or equivocal attempts to experimentally infect sheep with this species, are discussed...|$|E
