While the empirical literature has studied two of these <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangements</b> – the royalty rate and the up-front franchise fee – this work expands the analysis to another important source of revenues for franchisors: the sales of inputs to franchisees at prices greater than marginal costs. Consistent with predictions suggested by agency theory, the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangements</b> studied appear to function as substitutes. The results also reveal {{that the value of}} the services provided by franchisors to franchisees strongly affects the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangements</b> studied, so a capital goal of these arrangements is to recover the costs of the services offered by franchisors.

The degree to which firms choose to spread risk and sacrifice efficiency incentives depends upon risk preferences, for which data are typically unavailable. We use a unique dataset on medical group practice to investigate this tradeoff. Risk aversion leads to <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangements,</b> which spread risk through greater sharing of revenues. We find that <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangements</b> with greater degrees of revenue sharing significantly reduce physician effort.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} compensatory arrangements for health related expenses. It is important that these are executed correctly, to prevent {{that people who are}} entitled to compensation do not receive the compensation and that people claim the compensation who are not entitled to receive a compensation. In 2008, the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the obligatory deductible has been introduced. This compensation is paid automatically. People who do not receive the compensation but regard themselves as rightful claimants can ask for the compensation. An evaluation of the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the Dutch Healthcare Authority shows that many requests for compensation of the obligatory deductible are not justified (85 %). This high number of not-justifiable requests leads to unnecessary cost of work. Current research shows that people who regard themselves as rightful claimants and ask for the compensation do not exactly know {{the ins and outs of}} the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement.</b> They also hardly look for information about this arrangement. To reduce the percentage of not-justifiable requests and the extra cost of work this causes, it is important to provide people with more information about the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the obligatory deductible. This is expected to reduce also the number of people who are entitled to compensation but do not receive it...|$|E

40|$|North Sea divers {{have worked}} in a high-risk {{environment}} for 45 years. Little {{is known about the}} psychological consequences of deep sea diving. One third of the entire population of 375 male North Sea divers was thoroughly assessed as part of a health examination requested by the Norwegian government. As many as 96 % had experienced at least one potentially traumatic event (PTE). The pressurized environment causes PTEs to be particularly dangerous, increasing likelihood of diagnostic criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to be fulfilled. High rates of possible PTSD were found; 48 % - 70 % measured with the symptom measure Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), and 8 % - 35 % measured with the Keane PTSD scale, a part of the personality measure Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 (MMPI- 2). This indicates that North Sea divers are at severe risk for PTSD, and that this is probably due to the conditions they work under. The related litigation and economic <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> spurred suspicion of malingering, but we found no differences in symptoms or personality in those tested before or after the <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangement</b> was established.

To improve the transparency of executives' retirement payments and benefits, we propose several changes in current disclosure requirements. Among other things, firms should be required to report to investors each year the dollar value of all the retirement benefits to which their executives become entitled. For example, firms should disclose to investors the annual buildup in the actuarial value of executives' retirement plans, as well as the tax savings reaped by executives at the company's expense through the use of deferred <b>compensation</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Firms should also disclose to investors each year the present value of all the retirement benefits their top executives have accumulated and the text of any compensation agreements entered into with their executives...|$|R
