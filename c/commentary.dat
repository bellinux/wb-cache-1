5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's <b>commentary</b> system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio <b>commentary.</b> Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of <b>commentary.</b> Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. <b>Commentary</b> tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called <b>commentary</b> nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with <b>commentary</b> disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with <b>commentary</b> enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the <b>commentary</b> system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E
