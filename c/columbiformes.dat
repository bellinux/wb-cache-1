In chapter 1, I present an example of innovative feeding anecdotes by describing for the first time bread "hunting" and kleptoparasitisim at experimental patches by the Gray Kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis). In chapter 2, I compare three Passeriforme (the Carib Grackle, Quiscalus lugubris; the Shiny Cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis; the Lesser-Antillean Bullfinch, Loxigilla noctis) and two <b>Columbiforme</b> species (the Zenaida Dove, Zenaida aurita, the Common Ground Dove, Columbina passerina) on three measures of foraging flexibility presented in the field and in captivity: habituation to mew food patches, willingness to feed near unfamiliar objects (neophobia) and ability to obtain food from a new apparatus. In chapter 3, the two nectar-feeding species in the opportunistic "guild" of Barbados, the bullfinch and the Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), were given a neophobia test in the field, using dissolved sugar as food.

500|$|Pigeons and doves {{constitute}} the bird family Columbidae {{and the order}} <b>Columbiformes,</b> which includes about 42 genera and 310 species. The related word [...] "columbine" [...] refers to pigeons and doves. Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and short slender bills that, in some species, feature fleshy ceres. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. This family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones. Pigeons and doves are likely the most common birds in the world.|$|E
500|$|The family Columbidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Columbidae is the only living family in the order <b>Columbiformes.</b> The sandgrouse (Pteroclididae) were formerly placed here but were moved to a separate order Pteroclidiformes based on anatomical differences (e.g., they are unable to drink by [...] "sucking" [...] or [...] "pumping"); they are now considered to be more closely related to shorebirds. Recent phylogenomic studies support the grouping of pigeons and sandgrouse together, along with mesites, forming the sister taxon to Mirandornithes.|$|E
500|$|The Pteroclididae was {{formerly}} {{included in the}} Galliformes due to the similarities the family shares with the true grouse. However, it was later discovered that these similarities are superficial and a result of convergent evolution. Sandgrouse were later placed near the <b>Columbiformes</b> largely due to their reported ability to drink by the [...] "sucking" [...] or [...] "pumping" [...] action of peristalsis of the esophagus, an unusual characteristic. More recently, {{it has been reported}} that they cannot suck up water in this way, and they are now treated separately in the order Pteroclidiformes. They have been considered near passerine birds and are considered by some to be closer to the shorebirds (Charadriiformes).|$|E
40|$|For birds, plumage color {{perception}} {{is critical in}} social interactions such as courtship, in both monochromatic and dichromatic species. In the Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata), perhaps the most abundant South American <b>Columbiforme,</b> the plumage {{of males and females}} looks alike and both sexes share the same melanistic coloration with gray and pink tones. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether evident sexual dichromatism exists in the plumage of the Eared Dove using a spectrophotometry technique in the avian-visible range (300 - 700 nm). The results of the classic colorimetric variables analysis (hue, chroma and brightness) show that males are in general brighter and have higher UV chroma values than females. The avian visual model points to differences in achromatic and chromatic levels between males and females in body regions possibly involved in sexual selection (e. g. the crown). The model also indicates chromatic or achromatic differences in body regions not subject to sexual selection such as the black spots on the wing coverts and white tail bands, both of which may be involved in intra- or inter-gender-specific communication...|$|R
40|$|Birds that forage on {{the ground}} have been studied {{extensively}} in relation to behavioral trade-offs between foraging and scanning for predators; however, we know little about the topography of their retinas, which can influence how they gather visual information. We characterized the density of retinal ganglion cells across the retina and estimated visual acuity of four Passeriformes (European starling Sturnus vulgaris, brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater, house sparrow Passer domesticus, house finch Carpodacus mexicanus) and one <b>Columbiforme</b> (mourning dove Zenaida macroura) that forage {{on the ground}}. We used cresyl violet to stain retinal ganglion cells and estimated visual acuity based on cell density and eye size. All species contained a single area centralis, where cell densities were > 20, 000 cells/mm 2. The proportion of the retina that fell in each of five cell density ranges varied between species. European starlings and house finches had the largest area of high cell density, mourning doves had the smallest. The largest proportion of the retina (> 35 %) of brown-headed cowbird and house sparrow was in the second-lowest cell density range. Considering the 25 th percentile of highest cell densities, house finches and European starlings showed the highest cell densities and mourning doves the lowest. Estimated visual acuity increased from house finch, house sparrow, brown-headed cowbird, European starling to mourning dove, and was associated with both retinal area and cell density. Our findings suggest that these ground foragers do not have highly specialized retinas {{in relation to other}} types of foragers (e. g. tree foragers), probably because foraging on seeds and insects from the ground is not as visually demanding; however, the studied species showed variability in retinal topography that may be related to foraging techniques, eye size constraints, and size of the area centralis...|$|R
40|$|Avian haemophili demonstrating {{in vitro}} satellitic growth, also {{referred}} to as the V-factor or NAD requirement, have mainly been classified with Avibacterium paragallinarum (Haemophilus paragallinarum), Avibacterium avium (Pasteurella avium), Avibacterium volantium (Pasteurella volantium) and Avibacterium sp. A (Pasteurella species A). The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the taxonomic position of 18 V-factor-requiring isolates of unclassified Haemophilus-like organisms isolated from galliforme, anseriforme, <b>columbiforme</b> and gruiforme birds as well as kestrels and psittacine birds including budgerigars by conventional phenotypic tests and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. All isolates shared phenotypical characteristics which allowed classification with Pasteurellaceae. Haemolysis of bovine red blood cells was negative. Haemin (X-factor) was not required for growth. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis including bootstrap analysis showed that six isolates were related to the avian 16 S rRNA group and were classified as Avibacterium according to 16 S rRNA sequence analysis. Surprisingly, the other 12 isolates were unrelated to Avibacterium. Two isolates were unrelated to any of the known 16 S rRNA groups of Pasteurellaceae. Two isolates were related to Volucribacter of the avian 16 S rRNA group. Seven isolates belonged to the Testudinis 16 S rRNA group and out of these, two isolates were closely related to taxa 14 and 32 of Bisgaard, whereas four other isolates were found to form a genus-like group distantly related to taxon 40 and one isolated remained distantly related to other members of the Testudinis group. One isolate was closely related to taxon 26 (a member of Actinobacillus sensu stricto). The study documented major genetic diversity among V-factor-requiring avian isolates beyond the traditional interpretation that they only belong to Avibacterium, underlining the limited value of satellitic growth for identification of avian members of Pasteurellaceae. Our study also emphasized that these organisms will never be isolated without the use of special media satisfying the V-factor requirement...|$|R

50|$|A large {{proportion}} of viral pathogens that have emerged recently in humans are considered to have originated from various animal species. This is shown by several recent epidemics such as, avian flu, Ebola, monkey pox, and Hanta viruses. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} some diseases can potentially be re-introduced to human populations through animal hosts after they have been eradicated in humans. There is a risk of this phenomenon occurring with morbilliviruses as they can readily cross species barriers. CST can also {{have a significant effect on}} produce industries. Genotype VI-Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (GVI-PMV1) is a virus that arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to <b>Columbiformes,</b> and has become prevalent in the poultry industry. CST of rabies virus variants between many different species populations is a major wildlife management concern. Introduction of these variants into non-reservoir animals increases the risk of human exposures and threatens current advances toward rabies control.|$|E

Most of birds of the Reserve belong to migratory breeding species or to nomadic breeding species. Some species are vagrants in the Reserve and in the Moscow Region (nutcracker Nicifraga caryocatactes (L.), etc.). Birds, nesting in central parts of Russia and on {{the territory}} of the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve, in autumn are migrating to south-west.
