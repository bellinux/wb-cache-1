The study aimed {{to report on}} the course of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth within the Chinese health-care system over a period of 3. 5 years. METHODS: Selection of high caries risk {{children}} for inclusion in a sealant comparison study was based on the presence of <b>cavitated</b> dentine lesions in their primary teeth. At the 6 -month sealant evaluation point many of these <b>cavitated</b> dentine lesions had not been treated. This necessitated monitoring these <b>cavitated</b> teeth 6 -monthly for those exfoliated, restored, with a cavity left open, having caused toothache (symptom) and having (or having had) an abscess or fistulae (symptom). Care-seeking instruction was given at every evaluation point. anova and t-test were used in analysing the data. RESULTS: A total of 1012 <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth in 305 children (7. 6 to 9. 3 years old), were followed for 3. 5 years. A total of 92. 9 % of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth were left open, while 7. 1 % were restored at some stage during the observation period; 98. 5 % of restored teeth and 95. 5 % of <b>cavitated</b> teeth left open exfoliated and 93. 9 % of restored teeth and 81. 5 % of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth left open exfoliated without any symptoms. Having (or having had) toothache was the symptom most frequently related to exfoliated restored teeth and to exfoliated <b>cavitated</b> teeth left open. Restored primary teeth survived statistically significantly longer than <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth left open: 1. 99 +/- 0. 07 years and 1. 68 +/- 0. 03 years, respectively.

A high-pressure plunger pump is usually applied to generate a <b>cavitating</b> jet. However, such a system is inefficient for large amounts of water treatment. Therefore, we wish to use a <b>cavitating</b> vortex to treat contaminated water. A <b>cavitating</b> vortex is easily generated by using a volute casing. We observed collisions of opposing counter rotating <b>cavitating</b> vortices by using a high-speed video camera. We found that the end portion of the vortices whirl, the vortices never collide head-on with each other, and that the vortices are divided into four small vortex strings. Thus, obtaining high impact pressure by the collision of opposing <b>cavitating</b> vortices may be difficult.

Methods: Three hundred and three Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) subjects met inclusion criteria for interval between dental examination and the responses from the IFS (ages 13. 5 to 17. 0) and the Block Kids Food Frequency (ages 13. 0 to 17. 0) questionnaires, respectively. The analyses focused on the outcome variables of net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and net <b>cavitated</b> caries increment counts, respectively. The independent IFS questionnaire variables related to demographics, fluorides, oral hygiene, beverage intakes, dental visits, sealants and previous caries incidence variables, respectively, whereas, Block 2 ̆ 7 s questionnaire variables related to intakes of solid foods and beverages, respectively. Two sets of analyses, logistic and negative binomial regression analyses, were conducted to assess the associations between risk factors and net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and increment counts from 13 to 17, respectively. Results: In multivariable logistic regression analyses, significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) negative associations were found between age 13 to 17 net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and greater frequency of consumption of vegetables, greater brushing frequency and greater frequency of sugar-free beverage consumption. Additionally, significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) positive associations were found between age 13 to 17 net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and both net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence from 9 to 13 and frequency of consumption of solid-foods in the combined category of presumed moderate cariogenicity. The significant interaction effect showed {{that the effect of}} the presence/ absence of sealants varied for girls vs. boys. In multivariable negative binomial analyses assessing the association between net <b>cavitated</b> caries increment count from 13 to 17 and risk factors, significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) positive associations were found with greater intake of foods predominant in starch, presence of sealants, greater baseline age, <b>cavitated</b> caries increment count from 9 to 13, and greater frequency of consumption of foods predominant in added sugar, respectively. Significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) negative associations were found between net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and greater frequency of consumption of foods predominant in fiber and natural sugar and greater daily fluoride intake from water. However, daily fluoride intake from water was not statistically significant with the significant interaction effect included between baseline age and net <b>cavitated</b> caries increment count from 9 to 13 (dichotomized as Y/N). Conclusion: Presence of sealants, frequency of consumption of vegetables and previous <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence from 9 to 13 were associated with outcomes of incidence and extent of <b>cavitated</b> caries observed among IFS adolescents. The differences in findings for {{risk factors for}} incidence and extent of <b>cavitated</b> caries are {{due in part to the}} nature of the outcome variables (count vs. dichotomous), emphasizing the need to consider both outcomes in future studies of adolescent caries...|$|R

When water is confined by hydrophilic (hydroxylated silica) plates, it remains in the liquid phase at all P and d studied.

The average orientation of water molecules next to the hydrophobic plates does not change upon pressurization. In contrast, in the presence of hydrophilic plates, water structure is insensitive to P.

The {{theory and}} use of double-piston cells and {{conventional}} dilatometry for the determina-tion of the melting and liquid thermal expansion characteristics of metals and alloys have been evaluated and are reviewed in detail. The technique has been successfully applied to aluminium alloys with a boron nitride cell, and to cast iron and nickel alloys with an alumina cell. The technique has permitted the density {{as a function of}} temperature to be determined through the so-called `mushy ' zone and into the liquid state. Partial success has been obtained with a machi-nable glass-ceramic cell. For successful operation of the technique a number of criteria have to be satisfied, and these are described. On heating, the melting behaviour is followed only over the temperature range above that at which the dendritic network has no strength. On cooling from a fully molten condition, once the temperature has dropped below this dendrite collapse point, the force typically applied to the cell to avoid leakage is then insufficient to continue to deform the developing crystalline network.

30|$|The {{development}} of the neural tube {{can be divided into}} three phases [10]. The first phase, gastrulation, begins in the 2 nd to 3 rd weeks of gestation; in this phase, the two layers of the embryonic plate divide into three definitive layers (the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm). In the second phase, neurulation, which takes place in the 3 rd to 4 th weeks of gestation, the cells that will become the notochord interact with the overlying ectodermic tissue, causing this tissue to thicken, fold over and fuse, thus forming the neural tube. The fusion begins in the medial dorsal zone of the embryo and progresses in a zipper-like fashion cranially as the rostral neuropore and caudally as the caudal neuropore. The closure of the two ends does not occur simultaneously: the cranial end closes before the caudal end. The final phase, secondary neurulation, takes place in the 5 th to 6 th weeks of gestation; in this phase a secondary neural tube forms from the cells of Hensen’s node, which is a mass of totipotent cells located dorsally that intervene {{in the formation of the}} notochord and later migrate caudally to the presacral region. This secondary neural tube is initially solid; it undergoes a process of retrogressive differentiation called canalisation in which it <b>cavitates</b> to form the medullary cone and the filum terminale.

Glucose (20 mM), EDTA (1 - 25 mM), and physiologic concentrations of NaCl or KCl {{had little or no}} inhibitory effect on ADBF. ADBF killed both Gram-positive and Gram- negative virulent clinical isolates, including listeria, staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, under these conditions of cell disruption, fractionation, extraction, and assay, almost all BF in human PMN appeared to be localized to the membrane of azurophilic granules as a highly potent, broad-spectrum, rapidly acting protein(s) effective in physiologic medium. Some of these properties appear to distinguish ADBF from previously described PMN bactericidal proteins...|$|E

This paper describes the erosive intensity measurement of a <b>cavitating</b> jet with various nozzle configurations. Two cross-shaped nozzles, one circular nozzle with two cross wires, and two nozzles with swirl vanes, were tested. The authors expected an increase of erosive intensity to come about {{by the use of}} these nozzles, {{as a result of the}} deformation of the vortex ring in the <b>cavitating</b> jet. However, the experimental results reveal a decrease of erosive intensity contrary to expectations...|$|R
