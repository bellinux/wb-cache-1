5000|$|Work {{began at}} the quarry in the mid 18th century and grew after it {{was taken over by}} Francis Flower and Sons in 1928 {{producing}} stone for lime-burning. [...] The quarry closed in 1947 and was reopened in 1951 by John Yeoman of Foster Yeoman. The next owner was City Sand and Gravel Co. and taken over by Morris & Perry (Gurney Slade) Ltd. who still operate the quarry. A Concrete plant was installed in 1963 and a <b>coated</b> <b>macadam</b> plant in 2001. The site is now capable of supplying up to 2 Million Tonnes Per Annum of Carboniferous Limestone aggregate. Francis Flower have a facility adjacent to the quarry which processes filler by-product from several Mendip quarries.|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on an {{experimental}} design of low-noise asphalt mixtures. The theoretical part describes the problems of noise and methods for noise measurements. There are also specified the characteristics of various low-noise asphalt mixtures. The practical part addresses the experimental design of SMA 8 LA. Subsequently, the mixture is exposed to functional testing {{and the results are}} afterwards compared with the conventional type of stone mastix asphalt SMA 8 S. The second part is focused primarily on an experimental mixture design of a specific asphalt mixture type - <b>coated</b> <b>macadam.</b> There is especially solved the issue ofbinder drainage and the proportion of cracked grains during the compaction. The advantage of this mixture is the lower price demands cause by lower binder content and a smaller amount of fine aggregate. This mixture should be used as a base layer for low-loaded (traffic) roads. In the conclusion are thereafter evaluated the knowledge and the experience with the testing and designing of individual mixtures gained during the testing...|$|E
40|$|A 5. 8 mile {{section of}} Dubuque County (Iowa) Road D- 53 was {{selected}} for this project, the objective of which were to: 1. identify a cost effective asphalt emulsion bound macadam typical cross section; 2. determine the effectiveness of engineering fabric placed under macadam roadbeds; and 3. evalaute the use of emulsions in surface seal coats. A number of conclusions were reached: 1. The minus # 200 sieve material for the macadam stone should be held to a minimum. For the emulsion used on this project, the minus # 200 material had less than 4 percent to achieve satisfactory <b>coating</b> of the <b>macadam</b> stone. 2. The placement of the emulsion treated macadam required no additional equipment or time than the plain macadam placement. 3. Emulsion treating the macadam stone for the shoulder base appears unnecessary. 4. The emulsion treated macadam base beneath an asphaltic concrete wearing surface yielded a higher structural rating than the plain macadam beneath a comparable ashaltic concrete surface. 5. The performance of the fabric between the subgrade and the macadam base to prevent soil intrusion into the base could not {{be determined by the}} non-destructive testing conducted. 6. When no choke stone is used over the macadam base, allowance for ac mix overrun should be made. 7. Use of an emulsion instead of a cutback asphalt saved money and energy. However, the poor performance of the seal coat negated any real savings...|$|R
