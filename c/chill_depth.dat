The thermal performance, defined by the melting rate and energy consumed per ton of iron was improved. Operating costs were reduced by more than $ 2. 60 per ton due to lower coke and limestone consumption. Production was increased by 20 % due to supplemental natural gas firing. There were no significant changes in metal composition, <b>chill</b> <b>depth</b> or temperature.

40|$|Inoculation {{can reduce}} the <b>chill</b> <b>depth</b> of a chilled iron, and {{therefore}} influence the microstructure and properties of the iron. In this paper, the effect of rare earth Lanthanun (La) on the microstructure and properties of a chilled iron camshaft was studied. The {{results show that the}} La addition efficiently enhances the mechanical properties, yet with the unfavorable effect of decreasing the chilled depth and hardness. Moreover, La promotes graphite concentration and results in large graphite size, as well as A-type graphite. It is also found that excessive La destroys the interconnection and directivity of ledeburite. According to the experimental results, the optimum adding content of La should be no more than 0. 02 wt. %...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The introduction of overhead camshaft valve train systems some 25 years ago has resulted in improved engine performance and efficiency, this in turn however, has caused increased wear problems. In {{order to understand the}} tribological behaviour of overhead camshaft systems, test engines and dynameter test methods have been extensively used. These are however, time consuming and expensive, a cheaper and quicker method of camshaft material and lubricant appraisal is therefore required and this has resulted in the design and construction of a simulative overhead camshaft test rig. A range of commercially available camshaft and follower materials have been tested using both a fully formulated and a -mineral base -equivalent. The most commonly encountered cam and follower wear failures of scuffing, pitting and polishing were reproduced. Results showed scuffing wear to be associated with all of the camshaft materials using the mineral base oil under high load, boundary lubrication conditions. Scuffing also occurred under low load, mixed lubrication conditions using the case-hardened steel cam and chilled white iron follower combinations. The remaining cam materials, carbonitrided and induction hardened grey flake iron did not fail under similar test conditions due to the presence of free graphite in the icrostructure. The fully formulated oil generally suppressed the onset of scuffing under all test conditions due to the presence of the zinc-dialkyldithiophosphate (Z. D. D. P) anti-wear additive in the oil. Pitting failure was associated with the chilled white iron follower using the fully formulated oil under high load conditions. This failure could have been initiated by either a surface, sub-surface or stress - corrosion mechanism. Analysis of this type of failure is complicated by the difference in both <b>chill</b> <b>depth</b> and hardness and also the presence. of cracks within, samples prior to examination and testing. Standardisation of chilled white irons therefore needs to be carried out in order to understand fully the wear behaviour of such materials. Polishing wear was associated with the fully formulated oil at low loads, and appeared to occur by a chemical reaction between the contacting surfaces and the additives present in the oil. The use of the acetate replica technique proved a satisfactory method of analysing the change in surface topography of cam surfaces. Using the fully formulated oil the cam surface 'ran in' satisfactorily, by a process of plastic deformation and fracture, whilst the mineral base oil caused instanteous scuffing of the cam surface. Once the surfaces had 'run in' satisfactorily by using either the additives in the oil or by a diamond lapping operation, the cams continued to run without scuffing in the mineral base oil under continuous, non stop test conditions. An intermittent, stop/start operating cycle however results in eventual scuffing due to additive film depletion and repeated surface interaction under boundary lubrication conditions. From a range of 'new' materials tested for follower application the ceramics, {{with the exception of the}} toughened zirconia, exhibited the best wear characteristics using a case hardened steel cam as a standard and tested under mineral base oil conditions. The silicon carbide and sialon ceramics both exhibited a low frictional resistance and wear rate, whilst the metallic follower materials of cobalt and nickel base hard facing alloys and a ceramic fibre reinforced aluminium/silicon alloy all suffered some form of material.

40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} {{properties of}} camshaft {{were affected by}} many factors such as pouring temperature and inoculation which were studied in this paper. The results showed that {{with the increase of}} the pouring temperature, the <b>chilled</b> <b>depth</b> and hardness decrease. However, at a very low pouring temperature, the cooling velocity was fast and the formation of dissociative carbonide precipitate was easily; even the whole cam may become white iron, so the optimal pouring temperature is 1375 - 1450. Moreover, when the bearing location of camshaft is less than 15 % carbonide, reducing the inoculants contents may cause the graphite amount decreasing, and the improvement of chilled hardness. While, reducing the amount of inoculants can improve the chilled sensibility of molten metal, which is favorable for production control. The experimental results showed that the optimum adding content is no more than 0. 3 % Si-Ba...|$|R

It’s also the western gateway to the Ross Ice Shelf cavity - an enormous, essentially unknown, body of water. The cavity is a major source of supercooled water, i.e. water <b>chilled</b> at great <b>depths</b> under the ice shelf which is then released to find itself colder than the freezing temperature. Such water influences sea ice growth which in turn affects climate processes at a global scale.|$|R

Designers need guidelines {{on the effects of}} design parameters such as the flow rate and temperature of the <b>chilled</b> water, the <b>depth</b> of the beds of produce {{and the size of the}} produce on the operation of cooling systems. This three-phase system remains somewhat mathematically intractable on the length scales of the inter-produce pores. Hence, contemporary correlations of heat and momentum transfer in the pores of packed beds have been used in conjunction with a model of conduction heat transfer within the individual pieces of produce. This gives rise to a 'semi-continuum' model. Parameters used in the analysis include the fraction of water within the bed of produce, the degree of wetting of the produce, the produce/water heat transfer coefficient, and an expression has been invoked for the thermal dispersion within the bed. The governing equations for each phase are formulated and a scaling analysis is used to simplify them. Results from the analysis suggest that the conventionally used flow rate of water, namely 10 kg/(m 2. s), appears to be technologically sound. At this flow rate the fraction of produce that is wetted exceeds 0. 95, and the water/produce heat transfer coefficient is sufficiently high to not be the rate limiting step in cooling the produce. It is shown that the power consumption of hydrocoolers can be several hundred kilowatts, and that the chilled water must be recycled and treated to maintain its potability. These requirements provide opportunities for engineers to make contributions in an area usually dominated by biologists and chemists...|$|R
