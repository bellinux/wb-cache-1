40|$|Because home {{composting}} is a prevention option in managing biowaste at local levels, {{the objective of}} the present study was to contribute to the knowledge of the process evolution and compost quality that can be expected and obtained, respectively, in this decentralized option. In this study, organized as the research portion of a provincial project on {{home composting}} in the territory of Pesaro-Urbino (Central Italy), four experimental <b>composters</b> were first initiated and temporally monitored. Second, two small sub-sets of selected provincial <b>composters</b> (directly operated by households involved in the project) underwent quality control on their compost products at two different temporal steps. The monitored experimental <b>composters</b> showed overall decreasing profiles versus composting time for moisture, organic carbon, and C/N, as well as overall increasing profiles for electrical conductivity and total nitrogen, which represented qualitative indications of progress in the process. Comparative evaluations of the monitored experimental <b>composters</b> also suggested some interactions in home composting, i. e., high C/N ratios limiting organic matter decomposition rates and final humification levels; high moisture contents restricting the internal temperature regime; nearly horizontal phosphorus and potassium evolutions contributing to limit the rates of increase in electrical conductivity; and prolonged biowaste additions contributing to limit the rate of decrease in moisture. The measures of parametric data variability in the two sub-sets of controlled provincial <b>composters</b> showed decreased variability in moisture, organic carbon, and C/N from the seventh to fifteenth month of home composting, as well as increased variability in electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and humification rate, which could be considered compatible with the respective nature of decreasing and increasing parameters during composting. The modeled parametric kinetics in the monitored experimental <b>composters,</b> along with the evaluation of the parametric central tendencies in the sub-sets of controlled provincial <b>composters,</b> all indicate that 12 – 15 months is a suitable duration for the appropriate development of home composting in final and simultaneous compliance with typical reference limits...|$|R

40|$|At local {{territorial}} levels, {{the combined}} option of segregating domestic biowaste {{at the source}} and directly destining it to home composting {{may be seen as}} a valuable prevention action contributing to reduce the generation of household waste. However, although the alternative and predominant recovery option of centralized composting of organic waste has been widely studied and developed at the industrial level and well addressed in international waste/biowaste management handbooks, biowaste home composting has only recently begun to be analyzed from a technical and scientific perspective. Therefore, the objective {{of the present study was}} to contribute to the knowledge of the process evolution and compost quality that can be expected and obtained, respectively, in this decentralized option. In this study, organized as the research portion of a provincial project on home composting in the territory of Pesaro-Urbino (Marche Region, Central Italy, Adriatic Sea side), four experimental <b>composters</b> were first initiated and temporally monitored. Second, two small sub-sets of selected provincial <b>composters</b> (directly operated by households involved in the project) underwent quality control on their compost products at two different temporal steps. For a realistic evaluation of the monitoring and control of biowaste home composting, the obtained results were compared with available reference limits for several of the characterized parameters. The monitored experimental <b>composters</b> showed overall decreasing profiles versus composting time for moisture, organic carbon, and C/N, as well as overall increasing profiles for electrical conductivity and total nitrogen, which represented qualitative indications of progress in the process. Comparative evaluations of the monitored experimental <b>composters</b> also suggested some interactions in home composting, i. e. : high C/N ratios limiting organic matter decomposition rates and final humification levels; high moisture contents restricting the internal temperature regime; nearly horizontal phosphorus and potassium evolutions contributing to limit the rates of increase in electrical conductivity; and prolonged biowaste additions contributing to limit the rate of decrease in moisture. The measures of parametric data variability in the two sub-sets of controlled provincial <b>composters</b> showed decreased variability in moisture, organic carbon, and C/N from the seventh to fifteenth month of home composting, as well as increased variability in electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and humification rate, which could be considered compatible with the respective nature of decreasing and increasing parameters during composting. The modeled parametric kinetics in the monitored experimental <b>composters,</b> along with the evaluation of the parametric central tendencies in the sub-sets of controlled provincial <b>composters,</b> all indicate that 12 - 15 months is a suitable duration for the appropriate development of home composting in final and simultaneous compliance with typical reference limits. Ideally, the derived duration of 12 - 15 months places the decentralized home composting approach near the upper limit of the total duration generally expected in the simplest of centralized composting approaches (i. e., the windrow process) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation model of community home composting behaviour based on distributions of individual households, each actively managing the organic fraction {{of their own}} domestic waste. The model predicts overall participation levels and the individual and collective flows and compositions of the materials diverted into the compost bin. The take up of home composting by new <b>composters</b> and the drop-out of existing <b>composters</b> are modelled through invoking staged or random discrete events which perturb the model attitudes, and other attributes held by individual householders. An attitude-behaviour model then determines whether these attitude changes result in behavioural change. Post-event evaluations of the compost produced are simulated by integrating an empirical, technical model of the composting process into the behavioural model. This was accomplished by matching the input/output requirements of the two models via a common vector of material flow, and by feeding back the technical process quality monitoring data into the social model, as instances of discrete events. The simulation results are compared with survey data, and simulation results are presented to predict the longer-term sustainability of home composting within the community.
