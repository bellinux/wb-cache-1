5|$|The Mountaineers and Maryland Terrapins {{have met}} on a semi-annual basis since 1919, {{recently}} rekindling a <b>cross-border</b> rivalry that was once the longest continuous non-conference series for these geographical neighbors. The Mountaineers lead the series 28–22–2.|$|E
5|$|The eastern border {{point of}} the former Chinese Eastern Railway, at Suifenhe/Grodekovo, sees {{significant}} use as well, with over 8 million tons of freight crossing the border there in 2007, and regular <b>cross-border</b> passenger service.|$|E
5|$|Agustin Irazustabarrena (Legra) {{belonged to}} the Sega cell of ETA military, {{according}} to Spanish police. He fled to France in 1982 and in 1984 he had been arrested by French police charged with possession of illegal weapons. His trial had still been pending {{at the time of}} his death. He was believed to be in charge of <b>cross-border</b> operations for ETA.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was {{dismissed}} from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after Dragon Rouge, ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville putting an end to the Simba rebellion. Pockets of Simba resistance continued to hold out in the eastern Congo, most notably in South Kivu where Laurent-Désiré Kabila led a Maoist <b>cross-border</b> insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Built at {{the same}} was Lam Tin Bus Terminus, located on the {{opposite}} side of Lei Yue Mun Road and housing platforms for franchised buses, minibuses, taxis and <b>cross-border</b> buses. It is also connected to Sceneway Plaza by staircases and escalators. Following the construction of these new facilities, Lam Tin gradually became a major transport interchange in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular <b>cross-border</b> incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a <b>cross-border</b> insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Financial markets on the {{continent}} {{are expected to be}} far more liquid and flexible {{than they were in the}} past. The reduction in <b>cross-border</b> transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{had been}} de facto leader since 1994, but had {{focused more on}} military, foreign affairs and the country's {{security}} than day-to-day governance. By 2000, {{the threat posed by}} <b>cross-border</b> rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E
5|$|McRaven {{hand-picked}} a team {{drawing from}} the most experienced and senior operators from Red Squadron, one of four that make up DEVGRU. Red Squadron was coming home from Afghanistan and could be redirected without attracting attention. The team had language skills and experience with <b>cross-border</b> operations into Pakistan. Almost all of the Red Squadron operators had 10 or more deployments to Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March Lee Bo {{returned}} to Hong Kong {{and asked the}} authorities to drop the case like his three colleagues did before. He said he would never again sell banned books, and was transported back into the mainland in a vehicle with <b>cross-border</b> licence plates the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1970, in {{response}} to a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a highly secret meeting was held at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam's (MACV) Saigon headquarters to discuss the possibility of an ARVN <b>cross-border</b> attack into southeastern Laos. According to General Creighton W. Abrams, the American commander in Vietnam, the main impetus for the offensive came from Colonel Alexander M. Haig, an aide to National Security Advisor Dr. Henry Kissinger. MACV had been disturbed by intelligence of a PAVN logistical build-up in southeastern Laos but was reluctant to let the ARVN go it alone against the North Vietnamese. The group's findings were then sent on to the Joint Chiefs in Washington, D.C. By mid-December, President Richard M. Nixon had also become intrigued by possible offensive actions in Laos and had begun efforts to convince both General Abrams and the members of his cabinet of the efficacy of a <b>cross-border</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|Operations in Borneo were {{extremely}} sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement {{of involvement in}} <b>cross-border</b> missions only occurred in 1996. Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.|$|E
5|$|Railways {{have been}} the primary way of linking {{countries}} in the Eurasian Economic Union since the 19th century. It {{has always been the}} main way of transport in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union up until today. The union ranks 2nd in {{the world in terms of}} railway trackage (about 7.8% of the world's share). However it is still looking to improve <b>cross-border</b> trade within the union.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member <b>cross-border</b> transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{used its}} F-16s {{extensively}} in its conflict with separatist Kurds in Kurdish parts of Turkey and Iraq. Turkey launched its first <b>cross-border</b> raid on 16 December 2007, {{a prelude to}} the 2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq, involving 50 fighters before Operation Sun. This {{was the first time}} Turkey had mounted a night-bombing operation on a massive scale, and also the largest operation conducted by Turkish Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Croatian and Hungarian {{high-ranking}} officials usually meet {{several times}} a year. Trade between Croatia and Hungary amounted $1.020 bln in 2012, largely consisting of Hungarian exports to Croatia. Hungarian tourists contribute significantly to Croatian tourism; in 2009, a total of 323,000 visited Croatia, including the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán who spends his summer holidays in Dalmatia for last few decades. Both countries coordinate the development of <b>cross-border</b> infrastructure. Pan-European corridors Vb and Vc connect Budapest to the Adriatic Sea via Zagreb and Osijek. Both countries have sizable minorities living across their common border, and both have passed laws to protect their minority rights.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} phases, British and Malaysian troops had {{attempted}} only {{to control the}} border, and to protect population centres. However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing borders to obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, <b>cross-border</b> operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching <b>cross-border</b> incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Kuwait by neighbouring Iraq in 1991, a total of eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War. RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently {{make use of the}} tanker to refuel prior to launching <b>cross-border</b> strikes inside of Iraq. Shortly after the Gulf War, the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993, at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service; retiring nine years after the last Vulcan, although the Vulcan had survived longer in its original role as a bomber.|$|E
5|$|Garner {{has also}} criticised Cochrane's {{rejection}} of liberty rights for animals; others to challenge this include Hadley and the philosophers Andreas T. Schmidt, Valéry Giroux, and Jason Wyckoff. Cochrane has developed his account in subsequent work, tying {{his work to}} cosmopolitan theory in a 2013 paper and developing an account of labour rights for animals in a 2016 paper. As of 2016, Cochrane {{is working on a}} book on the topic of animal rights and global justice, covering questions of <b>cross-border</b> obligations to nonhuman animals and the idea of international politics taking the rights of all sentient beings seriously. The book is intended for 2017 or 2018 release.|$|E
5|$|Having {{joined the}} Army as a boy, Large {{fought in the}} Korean War and was wounded and taken {{prisoner}} at the Battle of Imjin. He {{spent two years in}} a prisoner-of-war camp, where his injuries went untreated and he lost {{more than a third of}} his body weight. After his release and rehabilitation, he joined the Special Air Service (SAS) and went on to serve in various conflicts around the world, hunting communist guerrillas in Malaya, suppressing rebellions in Oman and Aden, and conducting deniable <b>cross-border</b> reconnaissance and raids during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 and 1948, {{a popular}} vote for Sikkim to join newly {{independent}} India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru {{agreed to a}} special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in <b>cross-border</b> trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.|$|E
5|$|In May 1974 unionists {{called a}} general strike to protest against the Sunningdale Agreement – an attempt at power-sharing, setting up a Northern Ireland Executive and a <b>cross-border</b> Council of Ireland, which {{would have given the}} Government of Ireland a voice in running Northern Ireland. During that strike on 17 May, the UVF carried out the Dublin and Monaghan car bombings, which killed 33 civilians. The Provisional IRA were {{suspected}} by British police of bombing two pubs in the English city of Birmingham the following November, resulting in 21 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} war on the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940. Bordering on the Italian colony of Libya was the Kingdom of Egypt. Although a neutral country, Egypt was occupied by the British {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt if the Suez Canal was threatened. A series of <b>cross-border</b> raids and skirmishes began on the frontier between Libya and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across the frontier into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome.|$|E
5|$|PLO <b>cross-border</b> raids against Israel grew {{during the}} late 1970s. One of the most severe—known as the Coastal Road massacre—occurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road {{connecting}} the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv-Yafo. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, {{with the goal of}} taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and Arafat withdrew PLO forces north into Beirut.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Lebanon War was a 34-day {{military}} conflict in Lebanon and northern Israel. The principal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary {{forces and the}} Israeli military. The conflict was precipitated by a <b>cross-border</b> raid by Hezbollah during which they kidnapped and killed Israeli soldiers. The conflict began on 12 July 2006 when Hezbollah militants fired rockets at Israeli border towns as a diversion for an anti-tank missile attack on two armored Humvees patrolling the Israeli {{side of the border}} fence, killing three, injuring two, and seizing two Israeli soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{first saw}} action in 1965 {{as part of}} the British Commonwealth force {{stationed}} in north Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. The SASR troopers operated alongside their British and New Zealand counterparts in operations aimed at stopping Indonesian infiltration into Malaysia, taking part in Operation Claret. 1 Squadron conducted reconnaissance patrols in Sarawak from February to July 1965, and <b>cross-border</b> operations between May and July. They suffered their first fatality on 2 June when a soldier was gored by an elephant. 1 Squadron completed operations on 1 August and returned to Australia. 2 Squadron arrived in Borneo in January 1966 for a four-month deployment, and despite the suspension of Claret operations it also conducted reconnaissance patrols and <b>cross-border</b> operations, undertaking a total of 45 patrols {{on both sides of the}} border. On 19 March two soldiers drowned during a river crossing. On 21 July, 2 Squadron was relieved by a British SAS squadron and returned to Australia in August. Despite often being deployed in the reconnaissance role, the SASR killed at least 20 Indonesian soldiers in a series of ambushes and contacts. Three SASR soldiers were killed. These operations mostly occurred in secret, and were never admitted during the war.|$|E
5|$|The US {{government}} {{was aware of}} these activities in Cambodia, but refrained from taking overt military action within Cambodia in hopes of convincing the mercurial Sihanouk to alter his position. To accomplish this, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert <b>cross-border</b> reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret Studies and Observations Group in order to gather intelligence on PAVN/NLF activities in the border regions (Project Vesuvius). This intelligence data would then {{be presented to the}} prince in an effort to change his mind.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} {{over a three-year}} period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with a contractor, and industrial action. The bridge was designed to carry the Mildura railway line over the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant <b>cross-border</b> traffic arising from the fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a single lane of road controlled by traffic lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} the Namibian War of Independence began when the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) {{military}} wing – the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) – began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating from bases in Zambia. The first attack was the battle at Omugulugwombashe on 26 August, and the war was a classic insurgent-counterinsurgent operation. PLAN initially established bases in northern Namibia; they were later {{forced out of the}} country by the South African Defence Force (SADF), subsequently operating from bases in southern Angola and Zambia. The intensity of <b>cross-border</b> conflict escalated, becoming known as the South African Border War and the Angolan Bush War.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the <b>cross-border</b> threat.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} a sport complex with badminton, tennis, volleyball and {{basketball}} courts, and two stadiums for hockey and football. In 2014, Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced {{formation of a}} National Sports Institute (ISN) in Tawau. It will be the third sports satellite centre in Sabah once completed in 2015. A <b>cross-border</b> sporting event was held in 2014 between the town and Nunukan in Indonesia. It has been proposed to be repeated annually to strengthen ties between the towns.|$|E
5|$|When Arusi is {{old enough}} to travel, Dabeeb and her band of women decide to take him to Zone Three to see Al•Ith. This <b>cross-border</b> {{excursion}} is not ordered by the Providers, and Ben Ata has grave misgivings about their decision. In Zone Three the women are shocked to find the deposed Al•Ith working in a stable near Zone Two. While Al•Ith is pleased to see her son, she too has misgivings about Dabeeb's action. The bumptious women's travels through Zone Three evoke feelings of xenophobia in the locals.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1820s, a fur trading route {{developed}} between the Red River Colony (in modern Manitoba) and the trading posts in Minnesota, first primarily at Mendota and later at Saint Paul. The system of ox cart trails {{came to be}} known as the Red River Trails and was used principally by the Métis as a way to avoid the fur trade monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company (which had absorbed the North West Company). Though this <b>cross-border</b> trade was entirely illegal and violated the policies of the Hudson's Bay Company, enforcement against the trade by American and British authorities was virtually non-existent. The trail system would reach its peak usage in the mid-19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company continued to expand its presence north of the U.S. border establishing new posts such as Fort Alexander and Rat Portage.|$|E
5|$|By 2014, OR-7 {{had settled}} in the Rogue River {{watershed}} in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but DNA tests of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves {{in two of the}} eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue Pack, the first wolf pack in western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack since then has depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous <b>cross-border</b> region, and relatives of OR–7 have formed two packs in northern California.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a <b>cross-border</b> insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E
