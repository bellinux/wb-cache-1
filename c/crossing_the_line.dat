5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river <b>crossing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{followed}} this {{up with a}} successful defence of his Olympic 200 metres title {{with a time of}} 19.32 seconds, followed by Blake at 19.44 and Warren Weir at 19.84 to complete a Jamaican podium sweep. With this, Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles. He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed his fingers on his lips, gesturing to silence his critics, and after <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> he completed five push-ups – one for each of his Olympic gold medals.|$|E
5|$|Just before half time, a try by Newport's Jack Wetter was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E

5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 2010, in {{the first}} Premier League match of the 2010–11 season, Rosický was brought on as a {{substitute}} when Arsenal were trailing by a goal to Liverpool at Anfield, producing a cross in the 89th minute that was diverted by Marouane Chamakh against the post. The ball then hit Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina before <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for the equalising goal as the game finished 1–1. He scored his only goal {{of the season in}} an FA Cup tie away to League One side Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road on 20 February 2011 with a 53rd-minute header, although the match finished in a 1–1 draw. On 27 February 2011, Rosický started the 2011 League Cup Final against Birmingham City at Wembley, playing the full 90 minutes as Arsenal were defeated 2–1. At the end of the campaign, Rosický had scored one goal and made 34 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{announced}} that he would not ride the Tour de France, concentrating on the world road championships instead. Before, he won the Isle of Man International in treacherous conditions where only sixteen out of seventy riders finished. At the road world championships in Ronse, Belgium, the Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: Henry Anglade (France) and Seamus Elliott (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson. They were caught; the race finished in a bunch sprint, with Simpson <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in 29th. Simpson's season ended with six-day races across Europe and an invitation only race on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, along with other European riders. He skipped his usual winter training schedule for his first skiing holiday at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in the Alps, taking Helen and his two young daughters, Jane and Joanne.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. <b>Crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
