5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion <b>controls,</b> {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the <b>controls.</b> 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion <b>controls</b> to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the <b>controls</b> as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the <b>controls</b> as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots.

5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like <b>controls</b> groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard <b>controls</b> were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard <b>controls.</b>|$|E
