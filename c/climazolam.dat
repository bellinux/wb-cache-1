50|$|<b>Climazolam</b> (Ro21-3982) was {{introduced}} under licence as a veterinary medicine by the Swiss Pharmaceutical company Gräub under the tradename Climasol. <b>Climazolam</b> is a benzodiazepine, specifically an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative developed by Hoffman-LaRoche. It {{is similar in}} structure to midazolam and diclazepam and is used in veterinary medicine for anesthetizing animals.|$|E
40|$|In {{veterinary}} practice intraveneous anaesthesia has numerous advantages. An important {{advantage is}} the ease and rapidity of induction. Compared to administration of inhalant anaesthetics, {{a minimum of}} apparatus is necessary in administration of intraveneous anaesthetic agents. The possibility of antagonization of certain drugs used as intraveneous anaesthetics increases the safety of anaesthesia. The unpleasant recovery period can also be shortened, which for a busy veterinarian and also the owner can be of great relief. Ideally, a postoperative patient should be conscious, co-operative, calm and free of pain. This will provide better homeostasis of vital functions, allow early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} complications and decrease the need for nursing care. The aim of these studies was to analyze the sedative/ analgetic / anaesthetic, cardiovascular and respiratory effects produced by a combination of medetomidine and <b>climazolam</b> at two different dose levels (1. 5 mg/kg and 3. 0 mg/kg). <b>Climazolam</b> was also combined with fentanyl. Antagonization followed anaesthesia, using atipamezole, nalorphine and a new benzodiazepine antagonist, sarmazenil. 7 laboratory beagles were used inthis experimental study. In combination with medetomidine, <b>climazolam</b> produced smooth anaesthesia and had only small effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Total analgesia was not achived. Intubation was easily performed. The antagonization proved to be fast and complete. When combining <b>climazolam</b> with fentanyl, dose levels were chosen according to previous studies (Erhardt et al., 1986). The anaesthesia was light and short, probably due to the short action of fentanyl. This combination depressed the respiratory system in a much larger scale than the combination of medetomidine and <b>climazolam</b> did. Antagonization was effective. Kirurgia. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} pulmonary {{and cardiovascular}} {{effects of a}} recruitment maneuver (RM) combined with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during total intravenous anesthesia in ponies. ANIMALS: 6 healthy adult Shetland ponies. PROCEDURE: After premedication with detomidine (10 microg/kg, IV), anesthesia was induced with <b>climazolam</b> (0. 06 mg/kg, IV) and ketamine (2. 2 mg/kg, IV) and maintained with a constant rate infusion of detomidine (0. 024 mg/kg/h), <b>climazolam</b> (0. 036 mg/kg/h), and ketamine (2. 4 mg/kg/h). The RM was preceded by an incremental PEEP titration and followed by a decremental PEEP titration, both at a constant airway pressure difference (deltaP) of 20 cm H 2 O. The RM consisted of a stepwise increase in deltaP by 25, 30, and 35 cm H 2 O obtained by increasing peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) to 45, 50, and 55 cm H 2 O, while maintaining PEEP at 20 cm H 2 O. Hemodynamic and pulmonary variables were analyzed at {{every step of the}} PEEP titration-RM. RESULTS: During the PEEP titration-RM, there was a significant increase in PaO 2 (+ 12 %), dynamic compliance (+ 62 %), and heart rate (+ 17 %) and a decrease in shunt (- 19 %) and mean arterial blood pressure (- 21 %) was recorded. Cardiac output remained stable. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although baseline oxygenation was high, Pa(O 2) and dynamic compliance further increased during the RM. Despite the use of high PIP and PEEP and a high tidal volume, limited cardiovascular compromise was detected. A PEEP titration-RM may be used to improve oxygenation in anesthetized ponies. During stable hemodynamic conditions, PEEP titration-RM can be performed with acceptable adverse cardiovascular effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial of}} the {{sedative}} effects of a novel benzodiazepine, <b>climazolam,</b> and of a mixture of c 1 imazolam and fentanyl-fluanisone was undertaken in male and female Sprague Dawley and Lewis strain rats (Rattus norvegicus) of different ages. At the recommended intra-venous therapeutic dosage of 0 · 25 mg/kg, c 1 ima-zolam sedated the rats but failed to inhibit the righting reflex or responses to painful stimuli. Even at 25 times the recommended dosage, there was no anaesthetic effect. Predictable and satisfactory surgical anaesthesia was not obtained with the mixture of c 1 imazolam and fentanyl-fluanisone administered intra peri-toneally. In contrast with diazepam and mida-zolam, c 1 imazolam failed to potentiate the sedative analgesic properties of fentanyl-fluanisone: indeed many animals retained their tail and pedal pinch reflexes. The results also revealed significant differences in effect related to strain and age but not to sex...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of an {{anaesthetic}} combination given either intramuscularly (IM) or intranasally (IN) for castration of piglets. Forty piglets aged 4 to 7 days were randomly assigned to receive a mixture of ketamine 15 mg kg- 1, <b>climazolam</b> 1. 5 mg kg- 1 and azaperone 1. 0 mg kg- 1, IN or IM, 10 minutes prior to castration. Physiological parameters were measured. Castration was videotaped for evaluation by 3 independent observers using a scoring system. Reaction and vocalization to the skin incision and cutting of spermatic cord was evaluated and scored (0 = no reaction, 16 = strong reaction). The IN group had a significantly higher (P < 0. 01) castration score, compared to the IM group. There was an association between castration score and room temperature in the IN group (with temperatures below 18 "C associated with a higher castration scores (P < 0. 001). Heart rate was significantly higher 10 minutes after castration in the IN group (P < 0. 05). Respiratory rate was significantly higher in the IM group at time points - 5, - 1, 10, 20 and 30 (P < 0. 05). The IN group was walking significantly (P < 0. 0001) faster than the IM group. In conclusion, this combination provides effective anaesthesia for routine castration of newborn piglets when administered IM. IN administration provided shorter recovery times but had significantly higher castration scores...|$|E
