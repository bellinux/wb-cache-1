5|$|The {{wealth of}} Fatimid {{architecture}} {{was found in}} the main cities of Mahdia (921–948), Al-Mansuriya (948–973) and <b>Cairo</b> (973–1169). The heartland of architectural activity and expression during Fatimid rule was at al-Qahira, the old city of <b>Cairo,</b> on {{the eastern side of the}} Nile, where many of the palaces, mosques and other buildings were built. Al-Aziz Billah (ruled 975–996) is generally considered to have been the most extensive of Fatimid builders, credited with at least thirteen major landmarks including the Golden Palace, the <b>Cairo</b> Mosque, a fortress, a belvedere, a bridge and public baths.|$|E

5|$|After al-Adil I {{seized the}} throne in <b>Cairo</b> {{and with it}} the sultanate of the Ayyubid oligarchy, the period of rivalry between Damascus and <b>Cairo</b> to become capital of the Ayyubid empire commenced. Under al-Adil and al-Kamil, Damascus {{continued}} as an autonomous province whose ruler reserved the right to designate his own heir, but during as-Salih Ayyub's rule, military campaigns against Syria reduced Damascus to a vassal of <b>Cairo.</b> In addition, Ayyub established new rules both in administration and government in order to centralize his regime; he conferred the most prominent positions of the state to his close confidants, instead of his Ayyubid relatives. His wife Shajar al-Durr, for example, managed the affairs of Egypt while he was in Syria. Ayyub officially delegated his authority to his dead son Khalil and made al-Durr act formally on Khalil's behalf.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad was in al-Karak at {{the time}} of Abu Bakr's {{execution}} and Qawsun called on him to report to <b>Cairo,</b> ostensibly to assume the sultanate. However, Ahmad viewed the invitation <b>Cairo</b> as a ruse by Qawsun to eliminate him. He responded in September 1341 that he would not report to <b>Cairo</b> unless the leading emirs of the sultanate appeared before him in al-Karak and gave him their oaths of loyalty and on the condition that his other brothers imprisoned in Qus would be relocated to al-Karak. Ahmad concurrently sent letters to the Mamluk emirs of Syria requesting their support against Qawsun, who proceeded to besiege al-Karak to coerce Ahmad to depart for <b>Cairo.</b> The siege was commanded by the Syrian emir, Qutlubugha al-Fakhri, while Ahmad had the support of al-Karak's inhabitants and the Bedouin tribes of the vicinity. Twenty days into his siege, Qutlubugha defected from Qawsun, recognized Ahmad as sultan and promised the latter his unconditional support. Qutlubugha was persuaded to defect from Qawsun by the Mamluk na'ib (governor) of Aleppo, Tashtamur. The latter argued that Qutlubugha should support Ahmad out of respect for the bonds of loyalty they owed to Ahmad's father, their master. From then on, Ahmad gained the honorific prefix of an-Nasir, like his father.|$|E

5|$|Back in Egypt, as-Sallar {{was assassinated}} in 1153 by his son Abbas, Abbas's son Nasr, and caliph az-Zafir, who, {{according}} to Usama, was Nasr's lover. Thirteenth-century historian Ibn al-Athir says that Usama was the instigator of this plot. Usama {{may also have been}} behind the assassination of az-Zafir by Abbas, in 1154. Az-Zafir's relatives called upon a supporter, Ibn Ruzzik, who chased Abbas out of <b>Cairo,</b> and Usama followed him. He lost his possessions in <b>Cairo,</b> and on the way to Damascus his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads, but in June 1154 he safely reached Damascus, which had recently been captured by Nur ad-Din. Ibn Ruzzik tried to persuade him to come back, as the rest of his family was still in <b>Cairo,</b> but Usama was able to bring them to Damascus, through crusader territory, in 1156. The crusaders promised to transport them safely, but they were attacked and pillaged, and Usama lost his entire library.|$|E

5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of <b>Cairo.</b> It comes close to the hamlet of <b>Cairo,</b> but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it runs around <b>Cairo,</b> the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E
