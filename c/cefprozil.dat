40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the safety and tolerance of <b>cefprozil,</b> to characterize the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefprozil</b> after administration of multiple doses of the drug, and to compare these pharmacokinetic parameters with those obtained with cefaclor. The volunteers received 28 doses of 250, 500, or 1, 000 mg of <b>cefprozil</b> or 500 mg of cefaclor every 8 h for 10 days. Serial blood samples and the total volume of urine voided by each individual were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation on days 1, 5, and 10. Both cephalosporins were well tolerated after multiple oral dosing. The peak levels in plasma (Cmax) of <b>cefprozil</b> ranged from 5. 7 to 18. 3 micrograms/ml after oral administration of 250 - to 1, 000 -mg doses. The regression analysis of Cmax on <b>cefprozil</b> dose showed a dose-linear response. The mean Cmax of cefaclor ranged from 15. 2 to 16. 7 micrograms/ml and did not change significantly on multiple dosing. The overall mean terminal half-life of <b>cefprozil</b> was 1. 2 h and was invariant with respect to dose or duration of dosing. The area under the plasma-concentration-versus-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC 0 -infinity) of <b>cefprozil</b> increased in a dose-proportional manner with an increase in dose. The overall urinary recovery (61 % of dose) and renal clearance values of <b>cefprozil</b> were generally invariant with respect to dose and duration of dosing. While <b>cefprozil</b> was apparently absorbed less rapidly and achieved lower Cmax values than cefaclor, the AUC 0 -infinity of <b>cefprozil</b> was nearly twofold greater than that of cefaclor. The half-life of <b>cefprozil</b> was also twofold longer than that observed for cefaclor. Although the urinary recovery of cefaclor (75 % of dose) was significantly higher than that of <b>cefprozil</b> (61 % of dose), the concentrations of <b>cefprozil</b> in urine remained significantly higher than those of cefaclor from 2 to 8 h postdosing. If the therapeutic concept is maintained that levels of beta-lactam antibiotics in plasma should exceed the MIC for the offending organisms over a period that approximates the dosing interval, then <b>cefprozil</b> would appear to be suitable for twice-daily administration, whereas cefaclor should probably be administered three or even four times a day...|$|E

The clinical responses in patients treated with <b>cefprozil</b> were significantly better than those in patients who received penicillin (95. 3 versus 88. 1 %; P = 0. 023). Eradication of the original serotype of group A streptococci was achieved in 91. 3 % of patients treated with <b>cefprozil</b> and 87. 4 % of patients treated with penicillin, the difference not being statistically significant (P = 0. 125). However, there were significantly more symptomatic patients among the bacteriological failures in the penicillin group (68. 4 %) than in the <b>cefprozil</b> group (26. 7 %). beta-Lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus was more frequently isolated from the throat flora during penicillin therapy than during <b>cefprozil</b> treatment. No difference in the incidence of adverse events probably related or of unknown relationship to the study drugs was observed in the two treatment groups (5. 2 % of those treated with <b>cefprozil</b> and 6. 0 % of those treated with penicillin). <b>Cefprozil</b> can be considered a safe and reliable drug for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis in children...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tissue}} penetration, as judged by skin blister fluid, of <b>cefprozil</b> and cefaclor {{were examined in}} 12 healthy male volunteers. Doses of 250 and 500 mg of each drug were given to fasting subjects in a crossover fashion. Serially obtained plasma, skin blister fluid, and urine samples were analyzed for <b>cefprozil</b> or cefaclor by validated high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods. After oral administration of 250 and 500 mg of <b>cefprozil,</b> mean concentrations in plasma rose to peak levels (Cmax) of 6. 1 and 11. 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, and those of cefaclor were 10. 6 and 17. 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life of <b>cefprozil</b> (1. 3 h) was significantly longer than that of cefaclor (0. 6 h), and as a result, the area under the curve for <b>cefprozil</b> was about two times greater than that for cefaclor. Both cephalosporins were primarily excreted unchanged in urine. The mean skin blister Cmax values were 3. 0 and 5. 8 micrograms/ml for <b>cefprozil</b> and 3. 6 and 6. 5 micrograms/ml for cefaclor after the 250 - and 500 -mg oral doses, respectively. The mean Cmax values in skin blister fluid for both cephalosporins were comparable and were {{significantly lower than the}} corresponding Cmax values in plasma. However, the levels of <b>cefprozil</b> and cefaclor in skin blister fluid declined more slowly than they did in plasma. The skin blister fluid half-life estimates for <b>cefprozil</b> were significantly longer than they were for cefaclor. Parallel to the observation in plasma, the mean skin blister fluid areas under the curve for <b>cefprozil</b> were significantly higher than they were for cefaclor. The plasma and skin blister fluid pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the exposure of humans to <b>cefprozil</b> is significantly greater than that to cefaclor at the same dose...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefprozil</b> and cefaclor. A group of 12 healthy male volunteers received a single 250 -mg dose of <b>cefprozil</b> or cefaclor under fasting conditions as well as after the intake of food. There was a 1 -week washout period between each treatment. Serial blood samples were collected and assayed for <b>cefprozil</b> or cefaclor by specific high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods. The mean +/- standard deviation peak concentration (Cmax) of <b>cefprozil</b> in plasma was 6. 13 +/- 1. 22 micrograms/ml under the fasting condition and 5. 27 +/- 1. 06 micrograms/ml after breakfast, and these values were not significantly different from each other. The corresponding median time to reach Cmax was prolonged after food intake, but this difference was not significant. The mean Cmax values of cefaclor decreased significantly from 8. 70 +/- 2. 72 micrograms/ml under the fasting condition to 4. 29 +/- 1. 52 micrograms/ml after breakfast, and the corresponding median times to reach Cmax were significantly prolonged. The mean half-lives of <b>cefprozil</b> and cefaclor were nearly identical for the two treatments, suggesting that the elimination kinetics of these cephalosporins remained unaltered when the drugs were administered with food.

Also, changes in organism susceptibility and development of resistant subpopulations were evaluated. Simulated pediatric dosage regimens and target peak concentrations in the central compartment were as follows: penicillin V-potassium, 26 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h (q 6 h) and 14 micrograms/ml; cefaclor, 13. 4 mg/kg q 8 h and 16 micrograms/ml; loracarbef, 15 mg/kg q 12 h and 19 micrograms/ml; <b>cefprozil,</b> 15 mg/kg q 12 h and 11 micrograms/ml; and cefixime, 8 mg/kg q 24 h and 4 micrograms/ml. Targeted half-lives of each agent were 1 h for penicillin, cefaclor, and loracarbef; 1. 3 h for cefprozil; and 3. 5 h for cefixime. Growth controls were performed at two different pump rates, 0. 8 and 2. 0 ml/min (half-lives = 3. 5 and 1 h, respectively). Each isolate demonstrated autolysis at the lower rate which was attributed to a decreased supply of fresh nutrients available to the organisms in the infection compartment. Against the susceptible isolate, the time to 99. 9 % killing was statistically significant between penicillin V-potassium and both cefaclor and cefixime (P < 0. 029). Loracarbef never achieved a 99. 9 % reduction in the inoculum. At 48 h penicillin, <b>cefprozil,</b> and cefaclor were equivalent in extent of killing. Against the intermediately resistant isolate, <b>cefprozil</b> was superior to all other regimens with respect to rate of killing (P < 0. 013) and extent of killing at 24 h (P < 0. 0003). At 48 h penicillin, <b>cefprozil,</b> and cefaclor were equivalent in extent of killing. All of the regimens exhibited inferior activity against this penicillin-resistant isolate. A 99. 9 % kill was never obtained with any of the regimens, nor was there an appreciable decrease in the colony counts. In conclusion, it appears that <b>cefprozil,</b> penicillin, and cefaclor are effective therapies against sensitive and even intermediately sensitive isolates of S. pneumoniae. However, none of the oral therapies appear to be of any benefit against penicillin-resistant isolates. The in vitro model may be an effective tool in evaluating other multiple-dose therapies against this fastidious organism, since the continual supply of fresh medium maintains the viability of S. pneumoniae with minimal stationary-phase autolysis...|$|E

40|$|Three {{members of}} the tribe Proteeae (Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii) were tested against five newer orally {{administered}} cephalosporins (cefdinir, <b>cefprozil,</b> cefuroxime, cefetamet, and loracarbef) by the disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution methods. One hundred strains of these organisms were tested to confirm the excessive interpretive error rates that previously had been noted for the disk diffusion test. The {{results indicate that the}} suggested disk diffusion breakpoints for cefetamet and cefuroxime were without serious interpretive errors. In contrast, loracarbef, cefdinir, and <b>cefprozil</b> results exceeded acceptable interpretive error rates, with very major (false-susceptible) errors of 4, 5, and 9 % respectively.

40|$|The in vivo {{effects of}} {{penicillin}} and <b>cefprozil</b> therapy on {{the interaction between}} organisms commonly recovered from inflamed tonsils were studied by using a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. These organisms were group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), Streptococcus salivarius (which is capable of interfering with GABHS), and Staphylococcus aureus. In mice infected with GABHS and S. salivarius alone or in combination, penicillin eliminated both organisms and <b>cefprozil</b> eliminated GABHS and S. aureus but not S. salivarius. Penicillin did not, however, {{reduce the number of}} GABHS or S. salivarius in the presence of S. aureus. The present study demonstrated the ability of 1 -lactamase-producing S. aureus to protect GABHS from penicillin. However, no such protection was present following the administration of <b>cefprozil.</b> Further-more, the preservation of S. salivarius that interferes with GABHS growth may provide protection from reinfection with GABHS. This study supports and provides an explanation for the increased efficacies of cephalosporins administered orally over that of penicillin when treating patients with acute GABHS pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

We examined 53 child patients aged 6 months — 14 years with acute community-acquired pneumonia. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 st group — 26 patients who treated with cefuroxime sodium intramuscularly, and 2 nd — 27 patients who treated with cefuroxime sodium in first 3 days and then from the 4 th day — with <b>cefprozil</b> suspension orally. Both groups of patients were comparable by forms and course of pneumonia. In the clinic to all patients were conducted conventional clinical and laboratory investigations. Complex therapy was not different in both groups. Efficacy of treatment was assessed in dynamics. When comparing the effectiveness of two antibiotic regimens (cefuroxime sodium parenterally and sequential regimen with replacement by <b>cefprozil</b> orally) {{there were no differences}} in the dynamics of clinical course, laboratory and radiological data. Finding of the conducted investigations before treatment showed that majority of patients had clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia: fever, cough, shortness of breath, tachycardia, physical and radiological changes in the lungs. Evaluation of treatment efficacy showed {{that by the end of}} treatment in both groups of patients there was a positive clinical and radiological dynamics of the disease, the body temperature returned to normal, symptoms of intoxication, physical changes in the lungs disappeared, focal and infiltrative changes disappeared completely. Thus, sequential therapy with cephalosporins of II generation, cefuroxime and <b>cefprozil,</b> in the treatment of acute community-acquired pneumonia in children is a quite effective and safe method with good tolerability and no side effects...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cefprozil</b> {{is a new}} oral {{cephalosporin}} {{with activity}} against the most common pathogens isolated in acute otitis media. This randomized study enrolled 361 patients (mean age 29 months). Physical examination and culture via tympanocente-sis were required less than 48 h before therapy. One hundred and ninety-one patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy; 99 received <b>cefprozil</b> (20 mg/kg/day bd) and 92 received amoxycillin/clavulanate (13 - 3 mg/kg/day tid). Duration of treatment was 7 - 9 days for 81 patients, 10 days for 105 patients and 11 - 16 days for five patients. The treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographics, severity of infection and number of previous episodes. Clinical evaluations of efficacy were based on physical examination including otoscopy within a 14 day period after therapy. Satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 84 % of cefprozil-treated patients and 87 % of amoxycillin/clavulanate-treated patients. Pathogens most commonly isolated included Haemophilus influenzae (33 %) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 %). All 361 patients were evaluable for safety. Adverse clinical events were reported in 13 % (24) of cefprozil-treated patients and 20 % (36) of amoxycillin/clavulanate-treated patients. <b>Cefprozil,</b> administered twice a day, is comparable to a regimen of amoxycillin/clavulanate {{three times a day}} in the treatment of acute otitis media in children...|$|E
30|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} scintigraphy (NMS) {{techniques are}} proving valuable {{in understanding the}} disease processes at molecular levels without the inconvenient invasive procedures, if a specific ligand is provided for a pathological process. The role of NMS in the diagnosis of infection and its discrimination from non-infective inflammatory processes and tumors {{at an early stage}} is clinically vital for appropriate management (Wouter et al. [2010]; Sandip et al. [2009]; David-Axel et al. [2006]; Carrino et al. [2006]). The radiolabeled leucocytes can be considered as gold standard for the identification of inflammatory foci in the intestine and bone tissues (Weiner [1990]). The development of new radiopharmaceuticals that do not require the manipulation of blood and are able to differentiate between inflammatory and infectious processes with high sensibility and specificity is considered as the object of recent research. Therefore, other preparations such as 99 mTc-nanocolloid, 67 Ga-citrate, and 99 mTc or 111 In-labeled human polyclonal immunoglobulin are currently being tested (Buscombe et al. [1991]). However, none of the preparations is capable of distinguishing between infections and inflammatory lesions in a clinically useful manner. Recently, a new proposal is based on the use of radiolabeled antibiotics. One of the most important radiopharmaceuticals which are now currently available for imaging infection, the antimicrobial agent ciprofloxacin labeled with 99 mTc, has probably shown significant benefits. The fundamental problems of 99 mTc-ciprofloxacin preparation discussed in the literature (Mcafee et al. [1991]; (Akhtar et al. [2005, 2004]; Nibbering et al. [2004]; El-Ghany et al. [2007]) are related to radiochemical purity {{as well as to the}} stability of the labeled complex. So, other antimicrobial agents such as levofloxacin (El-Ghany et al. [2005]), pefloxacin (Motaleb [2007 a, b]), lomefloxacin (Motaleb [2007 a, b]), cefoprazone (Motaleb [2007 a, b]), cefuroxime (Yurt Lambrecht et al. [2008]), rifampicin (Syed et al. [2010]), and amoxicillin (Motaleb and Sanad [2012]) were labeled with 99 mTc to be used for imaging sites of infection and to overcome the drawback of 99 mTc-ciprofloxacin (Kleisner et al. [2002]; Yang et al. [2009]). <b>Cefprozil</b> is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. <b>Cefprozil</b> is a cis and trans isomeric mixture (≥ 90 % cis). The chemical name of <b>cefprozil</b> is (6 R, 7 R)- 7 -[(R)- 2 -amino- 2 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]- 8 -oxo- 3 -propenyl- 5 -thia- 1 -azabicyclo [4.2. 0] oct- 2 -ene- 2 -carboxylic acid (Petropoulos et al. [2009]; Shaikh et al. [2008]). <b>Cefprozil</b> has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The bactericidal action of <b>cefprozil</b> results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis (Breier et al. [2002]; Can [2011]). In this paper, <b>cefprozil</b> was labeled with the most widely used imaging radionuclide, 99 mTc.
