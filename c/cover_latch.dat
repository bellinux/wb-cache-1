25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was no fire, but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a safety recommendation to replace the slide <b>cover</b> <b>latch</b> brackets on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with the latch brackets installed on later models.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1961, {{two other}} Royal {{typewriters}} - the [...] "Tab-O-Matic" [...] and the [...] "All-American" [...] - were built to similar specifications as the Futura but without {{features such as}} [...] "Magic Margins" [...] or [...] "Touch-Control". A different color scheme was used for these models and they lacked design details such as the corrugated steel front panel and a push-button <b>cover</b> <b>latch.</b> As with the Futura 400 and 600, the [...] "1" [...] and [...] "!" [...] characters {{were not part of}} the standard typeface. However, unlike the lower-end Futura's, this typeface did include [...] "+" [...] and [...] "=". Both the Tab-O-Matic and the All-American were sold at a substantially lower price point than was advertised for the Futura.|$|E
50|$|With {{only minor}} {{additions}} in 1999, the motorcycle remained unchanged {{until it was}} redesigned in 2002. Larger-capacity panniers (left capacity increased from 18 to 24 litres; right capacity increased from 16.7 to 19.5 litres) with more secure <b>cover</b> <b>latches</b> and hinges were fitted. The engine was overhauled with lighter pistons and other engine modifications to reduce vibration. A catalytic converter was fitted to ensure compliance with the stricter EU emissions laws. A combined braking system was fitted and the front brakes were upgraded to 3-piston calipers.|$|R

The three {{separate}} mechanisms that comprise the CDLM {{will be discussed in}} this paper in addition to a focus on heritage adoption lessons learned and specific examples. These lessons learned will be valuable to any project considering the use of heritage designs...|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} aperture <b>cover</b> and <b>latch</b> {{were developed}} for the Thermal Ion Detection Experiment (TIDE). The latch utilized a high-output paraffin (HOP) linear motor to supply the force to operate the latch. The initial approach for the cover was to use a heat-treated, coiled strip of 0. 05 mm (. 002 -inch) -thick beryllium-copper as the cover. Development test results showed that {{one end of the}} cover developed a trajectory during release that threatened to impact against adjacent instruments. An alternative design utilizing constant force springs and a flexible, metallized Kapton cover was then tested. Results from development tests, microgravity tests, and lessons learned during the development of the aperture cover are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A cover {{mechanism}} {{for use on}} the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) cryostat was developed. The IBSS IR-instrument is scheduled for STS launch in early 1991 as a payload of the Shuttle Payload Satellite (SPS) 2. The cover is hinged, with a motorized rope drive. During ground processing, launch, entry, and landing, the cryostat, which houses the IR-instrument, is required to be a sealed vacuum tight container for cooling purposes and contamination prevention. When on orbit, the cover is opened to provide an unobstructed field of view for the IR-instrument. A positive seal is accomplished {{through the use of}} <b>latch</b> mechanism. The <b>cover</b> and the <b>latch</b> are driven by a common redundant actuator consisting of dc motors, spur gears, and a differential gear. Hall probe limit switches and position sensors (rotary variable transformer) are used to determine the position of the <b>cover</b> and the <b>latch.</b> The <b>cover</b> mechanism was successfully qualified for thermal vacuum (- 25 to 35 C), acoustic noise, vibration (6 Gs sine, 9. 7 G RMS) and life cycles. Constricting requirements, mechanical and electronic control design, specific design details, test results of functional performance, and environmental and life tests are described...|$|R

The approach taken was to adopt and scale the CDLM design as used on the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) project. The three separate mechanisms that comprise the CDLM will be discussed in this paper in addition to a focus on heritage adoption lessons learned and specific examples. These lessons learned will be valuable to any project considering the use of heritage designs...|$|R
5000|$|After {{electrical}} disc-playing machines started {{appearing on}} the market {{during the second half}} of the 1920s, usually sharing the same cabinet with a radio receiver, the term [...] "record player" [...] was increasingly favored by users when referring to the device. Manufacturers, however, typically advertised such combinations as [...] "radio-phonographs". Portable record players (no radio included), with a <b>latched</b> <b>cover</b> and an integrated power amplifier and loudspeaker, were fairly common as well, especially in schools and for use by children and teenagers.|$|R
5000|$|Interior doors {{should be}} closed and secured to {{restrict}} a child's {{access to such}} areas as garages, basements, laundry rooms, home offices & gyms, bathrooms, or any other potentially hazardous area. Many different types of door latches are available from simple door knob <b>covers</b> to top-of-door <b>latches</b> that can be operated {{from both sides of}} the door. Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the drawer or cabinet.|$|R

The upper portion is more {{traditional}} Mission style, however constructed from wood rather than adobe brick. The square bell tower, four-stories high, has a dome on top. A picket fence encloses a courtyard at right. Part of another two-story building is visible at far right. A short palm tree grows in the yard {{in front of the}} mission.

40|$|In {{three main}} {{divisions}} the  book <b>covers</b> combinational circuits, <b>latches,</b> and asynchronous sequential circuits. Combinational circuits have  no memorising ability, while sequential circuits {{have such an}} ability to various degrees. Latches are the simplest sequential circuits, ones with the shortest memory. The presentation is decidedly non-standard.         The design of combinational circuits is discussed in an orthodox manner using normal forms and in an unorthodox manner using set-theoretical evaluation formulas relying heavily on Karnaugh maps. The latter approach allows for a new design technique called composition.          Latches are covered very extensively. Their memory functions are expressed mathematically in a time-independent manner allowing the use of (normal, non-temporal) Boolean logic in their calculation. The theory of latches is then {{used as the basis}} for calculating asynchronous circuits.         Asynchronous circuits are specified in a tree-representation, each internal node of the tree representing an internal latch of the circuit, the latches specified by the tree itself. The tree specification allows solutions of formidable problems such as algorithmic state assignment, finding equivalent states non-recursively, and verifying asynchronous circuits...|$|R
