40|$|Ghana {{has often}} been {{regarded}} as one of the major success stories in sub-Saharan Africa in respect of the implementation of economic reform programmes during the 1980 s and 1990 s. However analyses of responses in terms of poverty reduction seem to indicate that structural adjustment may not be benefiting all segments of society. The aim of this paper is to carry out some counterfactual, numerical simulation experiments using variants of a stylised SAM-based CGE model, to ascertain possible effects on poverty of a range of revenue-neutral redistributive policies. The analysis is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Ghana compiled for the year 1993. This SAM not only has a <b>detailed</b> <b>commodity</b> and activity accounts within a structure in line with the recommendations of the 1993 SNA but it also has some quite detailed representations of factor and household accounts.

However the model design and experiments are also influenced by recent exchange by De Maio, Stewart and van der Hoeven (1999) and Sahn, Dorosh and Younger(1999) with a view to examining the sensitivity of the experimental results to alternative specifications and closures within broadly similar, general SAM-based model structures...|$|R
40|$|The partial {{revenue from}} each {{indirect}} tax {{and the total}} revenue from all indirect taxes on consumer goods are derived as functions of all commodity prices, the tax rates of each commodity, total expenditure and demographic variables using a complete demand system.

The macro demand system is based on exact aggregation across all households in the economy, and on exact aggregation across <b>commodities</b> within a <b>detailed</b> non-homogeneous utility tree. An empirical application for Norway with 55 commodity groups is presented. For beer, wine, spirits and tobacco, consumers can choose among buying at home, cross-border shopping/ tax-free shopping and smuggling. These substitution possibilities increase substantially the price elasticities for these goods. The partial revenue from wine as function of the tax share on wine has a single maximum value close to the actual tax rate in Norway in 1999, conditioned on all the other exogenous variables. The total revenue {{as a function of}} the tax share on wine also has a single maximum value, larger than that for the partial revenue. The same results are valid for spirits.

A Japanese architect Kon Wajiro (1888 - 1973) attempted to reconstruct architectural paradigm by questioning {{the idea of}} architecture from fundamental and empirical viewpoints. He studied Western philosophies and theories extensively, and critically examined them by returning to concrete knowledge of reality in fieldwork, developing comparative cultural studies of history, and by expanding architectural ideas with interdisciplinary studies: ethnography, geography, social science, psychology, craft and mode. He started his study from on Japanese peasant houses looking for the origin of Japanese architecture, and, since he believed {{in the existence of}} primary disciplines in everyday fluid phenomena and in the potential of common people, he gradually developed a theory of everyday life from his phenomenological fieldwork. In the application of his theory to house redevelopment project, Kon offered an alternative architectural paradigm reviving heteronomous taxonomies of architecture and discovering creative meanings in place, habit, mode, imitation, <b>commodity,</b> trivial <b>details</b> and adapting modification in craft, which had been lost in modernist discourse. Especially, with his fieldwork drawings and other projects, he indicated that architectural creation was based on imaginative 2 ̆ 2 understanding 2 ̆ 2 : the unification of objective and sympathetic knowledge of man 2 ̆ 7 s way of being. Thus, in his architectural paradigm, he exemplified the idea of design as the unification and development of theory and practice by fieldwork. ^ Through his students his influence continued into the present. However, for the ambiguities and lack of structure in his argument, his works had not been recognized as architectural consistent works. His learning of Western theories was not fully examined. This study aims to reconstruct Kon 2 ̆ 7 s works from 1910 to 1950 with a hypothesis that he attempted to create architectural theory with overarching concept: 2 ̆ 2 architecture as a container of everyday life, 2 ̆ 2 based on the fragmented materials from his archive. Particularly, by situating Kon 2 ̆ 7 s works in a wider cross-cultual context of architectural modernization, and by explaining how and from what he was influenced, how he interpreted known theories and applied them to his facing realities would be examined.

40|$|The {{size of the}} South African tobacco {{industry}} has been shrinking over the last 20 years. Tobacco production has decreased by 54 % between 1990 and 2014. Along with {{the decline in the}} area of tobacco planted, the number of primary producers and tobacco processors have dwindled. South Africa serves as a case study to support the working committee for economically sustainable alternatives to tobacco growing (COP 6) in understanding the factors that impact producers exit decisions and the agricultural commodities that producers introduce once they leave tobacco production. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control seeks to find practical and cost effective control measures to reduce both the demand and supply of tobacco products. To achieve these ambitions, the working group for economically sustainable alternatives to tobacco growing was established. This working group seeks to understand all the elements of tobacco growing and the elements that drive the demand of alternative crops. The findings of this study supports the working group for economically sustainable alternatives to tobacco growing by providing insights on the factors that drive production and exit decisions. Additionally, it also identifies alternative crops that former tobacco producers have introduced. At the time of this study no literature detailed the effects of the restructuring of the South African {{tobacco industry}}. This study details the impact that the restructuring of the South African tobacco industry had on tobacco producers and their production decision. Globally no research existed on the factors that drive tobacco producers exit decisions and the enterprises that they have switched to after they left tobacco production. This study investigates which agricultural commodities former producers have changed to and what impacted their decision to make this change. Although profitability was cited as the primary reason to leave tobacco production and to change to the production of another crop; only 18 % of producers were making a loss with tobacco {{at the time of their}} exit from tobacco production. The study found that the profit margin realised on tobacco had declined when compared to other crops. Further investigation found that the profitability of tobacco was influenced by a number of variables, in particular low producer prices, the rising cost of inputs and the availability of alternative crops. Another factor that impacted producers tobacco production decision was co-operative politics this had a major impact on producers decision to leave tobacco production; not only had a number of former producers declined to participate in the survey because of co-operative politics but a number of current producers had left tobacco production during the restructuring of the South African tobacco industry. The events during the restructuring of the South African tobacco industry (the merger of three co-operatives and the closure of two co-operative owned processing facilities) created instability in the industry. While investigating the alternative crops that producers had introduced, once they had left tobacco production or had diversified to while producing tobacco, it was found that there were regional differences in the agricultural commodities that were introduced and that there is no clear trend of the commodities that producers have introduced. Along with profitability other factors impacting producers' decisions to change to the production of an alternative agricultural <b>commodity</b> is <b>detailed</b> in the study.

The 1990 s {{marked the beginning}} of a period of proliferating regional trade agreements (RTAs) around the world. This dissertation analyzes the effects a RTA in South America, Mercosur, has had on Paraguayan import flows. The analyses are carried out at both aggregate and disaggregate levels of detail in order to identify patterns of trade creation and trade diversion on the Paraguayan economy as a whole, as well as more <b>detailed</b> <b>commodity</b> levels. Mercosur (Common Market of the Southern Cone) was signed in 1991 between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is well know that the share of foreign trade with respect to GDP is larger for small countries. Consequently, the effects of a trade agreement between large and small countries are likely to be larger in small economies. In the first chapter, I use a variant of the gravity model employing a re-parameterization of the difference-in-difference estimator to analyze Paraguayan import values of merchandise from 155 countries over a 41 year period (1970 - 2010), at the single digit level of detail (SITC Rev. 1). Additionally, I explicitly include zero trade flows and implement a Heckman sample selection bias correction with country fixed effects. I find the creation of Mercosur has increased average regional imports by 266 % since 1995 without decreasing imports {{from the rest of the}} world, which is evidence of trade creation. The greatest import expansions have been in Beverages & Tobacco and Animal and Vegetable Oils & Fats. In the second chapter, the sensitivity of the estimates are tested by comparing the results of the traditional OLS estimator and the Heckman sample selection approach to a recently recommended technique in the literature, the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) estimator. The specification of the three estimators is implemented using country fixed effects panel analysis of the same data and period. I include additional refinements such as real exchange rate data and controls for major macroeconomic and political shocks. I also test the sensitivity of the estimates to varying sample sizes. Finally, the dissertation analyzes the dynamic time path effects of Mercosur on Paraguayan import flows in an interval analysis. Qualitatively, the results of great trade creation and no trade diversion are consistent across the estimators and the sample sizes. Quantitatively, the Poisson measures of trade creation are well below those of the other two techniques and even reveal some evidence of small trade diversion when the specification is estimated on Paraguay’s 19 major trading partners only...|$|R
40|$| {{decline in}} prices, wheat and barley {{production}} experienced some decline in production. Canola production declined as well. The decline in barley price {{did not result}} in an increase in domestic demand for this grain. The increase in the price of canola caused the domestic demand for this oilseed to fall by 4. 19 %. Canola exports increased by 60 %, which probably explains the increase in canola price. Wheat exports also increased by 10. 78 %. However, this change in export volume was not enough to result in a rise in wheat price. The changes in wheat and canola exports appear to be more pronounced than the changes in production of the commodities. The effects on barley were quite minimal. Although the price of barley declined by 2. 81 %, domestic demand declined and production did not increase. This solution may appear counter-intuitive but considering the fact that barley is used as feed for the livestock industry, we observe that the production of cattle and hogs does not increase. Changes in the hog industry were modest and it appears that the cattle industry was not affected by the increase in domestic wheat demand. In terms of welfare, producer profits declined by 5. 77 %, which may be attributed to the unrealized increase in farm prices, particularly for the grains. Effects of a 20 % Increase in Domestic Demand for Canola A 20 % increase in the domestic demand for canola caused an increase in the price of canola by 5. 45 % but a decline in the price of wheat and barley. With an increase in price, canola production increased by 21. 06 %. The production of wheat and barley declined which may be attributed to the decline in price and to substitution effects in production with canola. Exports of canola increased by 50 %. The decline in wheat price, however, caused an increase in domestic demand for wheat by 21. 69 %. The effect on barley was not significant. Unlike wheat, a significant amount of canola is processed locally. Thus, the finding of an increase in canola price and production with an increase in domestic demand may be in order. An increase in the domestic demand for canola resulted in an increase in hog price but a decrease in cattle price. Nonetheless, the production of both cattle and hogs decreased by 0. 32 and 11. 11 percent, respectively. The domestic demand for the two commodities also declined and for exports, hogs exported increased by 3. 25 % while export of cattle decreased by 5. 88 %. Effects of a 20 % Increase in Domestic Demand for Cattle With a 20 % increase in domestic cattle demand, the price of cattle declines by 1. 14 %. The price decline is contrary to what would be expected. Nevertheless there is an increase in cattle production by 16. 9 % suggesting a positive net effect for the cattle industry. Export of cattle decreased by 64. 71 %. The price of hogs fell by 0. 18 % but hog production increased by 4. 86 %. However, the decrease in hog price resulted in a 42. 86 % increase in the domestic demand for hogs. Export of hogs decreased by 1. 63 %. Changes in the prices and production of the crops were modest but adjustments in the quantities exported were significant. The price of barley was unchanged yet production and domestic demand decreased. This solution appears counter-intuitive when assessed relative to the increased production of both cattle and hogs, as it was expected that an increase in the production of cattle and hogs would result in an increase in domestic demand for barley. In terms of producer welfare, total profits increased by 5. 09 %. The significant increase in the production of cattle and hogs coupled with the relatively stable livestock prices, {{may have contributed to the}} increase in farmers' welfare. This solution may suggest that farmers would be better off with increased investments and capacity-expansions in the domestic cattle slaughtering industry. Effects of a 20 % Increase in Domestic Demand for Hogs Generally, a 20 % increase in domestic demand for slaughter hogs resulted in price increases for all five commodities, ranging from 0. 09 % to 1. 13 %. The price rise did not cause significant change in commodity supply except for hog production. The production of hogs increased by 2. 78 %. There was no change in hog exports. With a price increase, the domestic demand for wheat, canola and cattle decreased. The export quantities for canola and cattle increased by 20 and 2. 94 %, respectively. The effects on barley were minimal. In terms of producer welfare, total profits increased by 4. 72 %, which may be attributed to the resulting increases in commodity prices. This solution is consistent with the solution from the cattle scenario above, in which farmers may be better off with capacity expansions in the domestic meat processing industry. Simulation of the Impact of Value-Adding on the Farm Sector using the Canadian Regional Agricultural Model (CRAM) : The Canadian Agricultural Regional Model (CRAM) is a spatial equilibrium policy analysis model developed and maintained by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. It provides significant regional and <b>commodity</b> <b>detail</b> of the Canadian agricultural sector and is an important instrument for the analysis of policy changes on the Canadian agriculture industry at a disaggregated level, in terms of the impacts on production (i. e., supply) and demand. In this study, two case situations were analyzed using CRAM: (a) the domestic demand for each of the commodities, wheat (high quality), beef (high quality), and pork was increased by 5 % and by 10 % and (b) the domestic demand for all three commodities was increased simultaneously by 5 % and by 10 %. The results obtained generally confirmed those from the dual model. An increase in the domestic demand for individual commodities {{did not result in}} any change in the relevant variables compared to a simultaneous increase in all commodities. In the latter scenario, results suggest that, in each case, producer and consumer welfare declined but by less than 1 %. In the model, increases in domestic demand were all accounted for from export demand by the rest of the world. This may have contributed to the decline in welfare. Specifically, with a simultaneous 10 % increase in production, we observe a 1. 79 % decline in world demand for high quality wheat, 14. 46 % decline in world demand for Heifers & steers, a 3. 1 % increase in world demand for low quality dressed beef, and a 3. 77 % decline in export demand for pork. There was no significant change in production for any of the commodities. Any changes in production were less than 1 % from the base results. However, for beef, a simultaneous increase in domestic demand resulted in an increased in beef slaughter in Alberta. In the case of a simultaneous 5 % increase in domestic demand, there was a 2 % increase in Alberta beef slaughter. With a simultaneous 10 % increase in domestic demand, there was a 4 % increase in Alberta beef slaughter. Other minor changes that are observed, particularly with a simultaneous 10 % increase in domestic demand, are changes in production and input use (i. e., fertilizer, chemicals and fuel). Overall the impact of increased domestic demand for primary agricultural products on farm incomes was minimal. Conclusions It is clear from the results that the volume of Canadian agricultural commodities traded on the world market is too small to permit Canada to influence world price. On an individual commodity basis, however, Canada may be able to influence prices received by farmers. The results from the simulation exercises indicate that farmers' welfare is increased with increased commodity price. Prices are determined by the market. Therefore, there is the need for strategies directed at specific markets to effect an increase in price. In foreign markets, strategies could be directed at increasing market share. Canada's average market shares in the world market for wheat and barley from 1988 to 1997 are approximately 18 % and 19 %, respectively (Canadian Wheat Board 1999; Food and Agriculture Organization 1999; International Grains Council 1999). Canada's share of the world market for canola is approximately 48 %. However this would not lead to a larger economic sector devoted to further processing. Canada's potential to influence prices on the world market depends critically on the world demand for commodities, which is erratic. Consequently, domestic value-added processing has been seen as an opportunity for guaranteed markets that would facilitate high prices of commodities. Adding value to enhance the price of commodities will be effective when an appreciable proportion of domestic production is processed domestically and a smaller proportion of the commodity is exported. The current development of new value-added processing opportunities on the prairies (e. g., canola crushing plants and livestock slaughter facilities) will provide some economic activity in the prairies. However, these activities will not enhance the price of commodities at the farm gate, which will continue to be set by the world price, net of transportation costs. The loss of direct support from the government means that farmers will continue to face the full impact of downturns in agricultural commodity prices. Increasing the value of processing and related activities to $ 20 billion will have minimal direct impact on the welfare of primary agriculture producers who are engaged in producing the typical commodities such as wheat or beef. The domestic market will replace some of the export demand for Alberta commodities. If primary agricultural producers are to benefit directly from increased processing in Alberta and Canada, then these producers will have to participate directly in value-adding industries, through direct ownership or through cooperatives. Alternative structures may be alliances between various players in the sectors or primary agricultural producers may have to move into niche markets where current demand exceeds the supply. However, typically, niche markets, unless consumer demand is growing rapidly, are often rapidly saturated and any "excess profits" at the farm gate removed. Although farmer involvement in processing can take many forms, the formation of new structures of co-operation and vertical co-ordination in the food chain must be given special attention. New management structures are required to meet the challenges of the new agricultural economy. The "New Generation Co-operatives" (NGCs) initiated in the US in North Dakota and Minnesota provide a potential model that may be followed. "New Generation Co-operatives" integrate farmers into domestic processing activities, with focus on vertical integration between these levels. Such arrangements provide farmers with a set price for their primary commodities as well as earnings from the processing and value adding activities. Thus, NGCs may have the potential with respect to first, their inherent ability to compete in value-added products market and second, providing ways of generating and sustaining producers' revenues from the marketplace.
