6000|$|About a {{year after}} he had {{returned}} from the continent (in June, 1766,) he again visited his native country, where he had the satisfaction to find his mother and sister still living. At Edinburgh {{he met with the}} two Humes, Robertson, Adam Smith, Blair, and Ferguson; but the bodily ailments, under which he was labouring, left him little power of enjoying the society of men who had newly raised their country to so much eminence in literature. To his friend, Dr. Moore, then a chirurgeon at Glasgow, who accompanied him from that place, to the banks of Loch Lomond, he wrote, in the February following, that his expedition into Scotland had been productive of nothing but misery and disgust, adding, that he was convinced his brain had been in some measure affected; for that he had had a kind of <b>coma</b> <b>vigil</b> upon him from April to November, without intermission. He was at this time at Bath, where two chirurgeons, whom he calls the most eminent in England, and whose names were Middleton and Sharp, had so far relieved him from some of the most painful symptoms of his malady, particularly an inveterate ulcer in the arm, that he pronounced himself to be better in health and spirits than during any part of the seven preceding years. But the flattering appearance which his disorder assumed was not of long continuance. A letter written to him by David Hume, on the 18th of July following, shews that either the state of his health, or the narrowness of his means, or perhaps both these causes together, made him desirous of obtaining the consulship of Nice or Leghorn. But neither the solicitations of Hume, nor those of the Duchess of Hamilton, could prevail on the Minister, Lord Shelburne, to confer on him either of these appointments. In the next year, September 21, 1768, the following paragraph in a letter from Hume convinced him that he had nothing to expect from any consideration for his necessities in that quarter. [...] "What is this you tell me of your perpetual exile and of your never returning to this country? I hope that, as this idea arose from the bad state of your health, it will vanish on your recovery, which, from your past experience, you may expect from those happier climates to which you are retiring; after which, the desire of revisiting your native country will probably return upon you, unless the superior cheapness of foreign countries prove an obstacle, and detain you there. I could wish that means had been fallen on to remove this objection, and that at least it might be equal to you to live anywhere, except when the consideration of your health gave the preference to one climate above another. But the indifference of ministers towards literature, which has been long, and indeed almost always is the case in England, gives little prospect of any alteration in this particular." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Following a coma, some {{patients}} may “awaken ” without voluntary interaction or {{communication with the}} environment. More than 40 years ago this condition was coined <b>coma</b> <b>vigil</b> or apallic syndrome and later became worldwide known as “persistent vegetative state”. About 10 years ago {{it became clear that}} some of these patients who failed to recover verbal or non-verbal communication did show some degree of consciousness – a condition called “minimally conscious state”. Some authors questioned the usefulness of differentiating unresponsive “vegetative ” from minimally conscious patients but subsequent functional neuroimaging studies have since objectively demonstrated differences in residual cerebral processing and hence, we think, conscious awareness. These neuroimaging studies have also demonstrated that a small subset of unresponsive “vegetative” patients may show unambiguous signs of consciousness and command following inaccessible to bedside clinical examination. These findings, together with negative associations intrinsic to the term “vegetative state ” as well as the diagnostic errors and their potential effect on the treatment and care for these patients gave rise to the recent proposal for an alternative neutral and more descriptive name: unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. We here give an overview of PET and (functional) MRI studies performed in these challenging patients and stress the need for a separate ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis code and MEDLINE MeSH entry for “minimally conscious state ” as the lack of clear distinction between vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and minimally conscious state may encumber scientific studies in the field of disorders of consciousness...|$|E
40|$|É relatado um caso da doença de Creutzfeldt-Jakob cujo diagnóstico foi comprovado mediante estudo anátomo-patológico. São analisadas as diversas formas clínicas da doença e {{particular}} ênfase é dada aos aspectos eletrencefalográficos. No que respeita aos aspectos neuropatológicos é ressaltada a importância, para o diagnóstico, da presença de degeneração neuronal ao lado de hipertrofia da astroglia; o estado espongioso pode ocorrer em elevado número de casos. O paciente do presente registro, do sexo masculino, apresentou aos 52 anos de idade um quadro rapidamente evolutivo, caracterizado por instabilidade à marcha, mutismo, mioclonias generalizadas e <b>coma</b> <b>vigil,</b> vindo a falecer 5 meses após o início da doença. O estudo anátomo-patológico evidenciou lesões difusas nas regiões corticais, sub-corticais, no tronco do encéfalo e na medula espinhal, caracterizadas por degeneração neuronal, hipertrofia da astroglia e presença do estado espongioso. A case of peculiar form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease — the subacute disseminated encephalo-myelopathy one — is reported. The {{diagnosis was}} ascertained by necroscopic study. The clinical and electroencephalographic aspects are analysed. The patient here concerned, a man aged fifty two, during the clinical {{course of the}} disease showed stupor, decorticate posture, myoclonic jerks, epileptic seizures, muscular wasting in the left leg, exaggerated tendon reflexes in the face, tendon reflexes not elicitable in the legs. The electroencephalographic findings, during the downhill course of the disease, showed a pattern of irregularly depressed background rhythm with the periodic synchronous high voltage wave. The post-mortem findings revealed mild atrophy {{of the brain and}} the histological study revealed neuronal degeneration, astroglial hypertrophies and status spongiosus. The microscopic examination showed that the areas most affected were the frontal and occipital lobes, the basal nuclei, the mesencephalon, the pons and the anterior horns. In the cerebelum the granular cells were reduced. Pathogenetic and etiological considerations remained inconclusive, but the slow-virus concept applicable to other neurological diseases (Kuru, subacute sclerosing leuco-encephalitis) should not be dismissed from etiopathogenetic considerations of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Clinical {{picture of}} severe glyphosatesurfactant {{poisoning}} is manifested by gastroenteritis, respiratory disturbances, altered mental status, hypotension refractory to the treatment, renal failure, shock. Single case report indicated possible neurotoxic sequels of glyphosatesurfactant exposure with white matter lesions {{and development of}} Parkinsonism. We described a patient with massive white matter damage which led to <b>vigil</b> <b>coma</b> and lethal outcome. Case report. A 56 -year old woman ingested about 500 mL of herbicide containing glyphosate isopropylamine salt. The most prominent manifestation of poisoning included hypotension, coma, hyperkaliemia, respiratory and renal failure. The patient was treated {{in intensive care unit}} by symptomatic and supportive therapy including mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient survived the acute phase of poisoning, but she developed <b>vigil</b> <b>coma.</b> Nuclear magnetic imagining revealed extensive bilateral lesions of the brain stem white matter and pons. Conclusion. The outcome of reported poisoning may be the consequence of glyphosate-surfactant neurotoxic effect or/and ischemia, especially in the episodes of marked hypotension during hemodialysis. Considering recommendation of early hemodialysis as the treatment of choice, even before renal failure development, we point out the importance of careful planning of dialysis modality in hemodynamically instable patient and recommend continuous dialysis methods...|$|R
