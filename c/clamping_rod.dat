40|$|Fraturas e luxações vertebrais decorrente de trauma consistem afecção neurológica frequente na prática clínica veterinária, sendo a coluna tóraco-lombar a mais comumente afetada em cães, e em muitos casos o tratamento cirúrgico é de eleição. Existem diversas técnicas propostas a realizar estabilização vertebral, entretanto, estudos em coluna tóraco-lombar não foram realizados para avaliar as propriedades biomecânicas de cada técnica. Baseado nisso, nossa pesquisa teve como objetivo fazer uma avaliação biomecânica comparando a força e rigidez promovidas por cinco diferentes técnicas de estabilização em coluna toracolombar (Pinos com Cimento Ósseo, Técnica Segmentar Modificada, Placa Bloqueada e <b>Clamp</b> <b>Rod</b> Internal Fixation utilizando parafusos monocorticais e bicorticais) frente às forças de compressão e flexão. Foram utilizadas 34 colunas tóraco-lombares de cães, divididas em cinco grupos. Para realização dos testes biomecânicos, foi utilizada a máquina de ensaios Kratos (modelo KE 3000 MP) e célula de carga de 100 kg. Para cada corpo de prova, três testes biomecânicos foram realizados, o controle, no segmento íntegro, após desarticulação de T 13 /L 1 e após realização de uma das técnicas de estabilização propostas. Os dados foram exportados para análise estatística para o programa Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) versão 18. 0. Os resultados permitiram concluir que, apesar de não haver diferença estatística significativa, a Placa Bloqueada foi a técnica que promoveu maior rigidez e estabilidade nas vértebras lesionadas, seguida do CRIF bicortical, técnica Segmentar Modificada e Pinos e Cimento Ósseo. Estatisticamente, a Placa Bloqueada e o CRIF com parafusos bicorticais apresentaram maior rigidez e estabilidade em T 13 /L 1 quando comparados com a técnica CRIF monocortical, que por sua vez, não alcançou rigidez necessária para adequada estabilização das vértebras. Spinal {{fractures}} and luxations {{resulting from}} trauma consist frequent disorder in clinical veterinary practice, being thoracolumbar spine {{the region that}} is the most commonly affected in canines, thus in many cases surgical treatment is necessary. There are several proposed techniques of implants to perform spinal stabilization; however, few studies of the thoracolumbar spine were carried out to evaluate the biomechanical properties of each technic. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to analyze biomechanical effects comparing the strength and the stiffness promoted by five different technics of stabilization in the thoracolumbar spine (pin with bone cement, modified segmental stabilization, locking plate and <b>clamp</b> <b>rod</b> internal fixation) under compression and bending forces. In the study, thirty four thoracolumbar dog spines were used, dividing the specimens in five groups. In order to perform the biomechanical tests, it was used a Kratos testing machine (model KE 3000 MP) and loading cell of 100 Kg. Each body of proof was submitted to three biomechanical tests, the control, in the segment intact, after disarticulation of the T 13 /L 1 and after the realization of one of the proposed technics. Data were exported to statistical analyses to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18. 0. The results led to the conclusion that despite there was no statistically significant difference between the techniques, the Locking Plate was the technique that promoted greater rigidity and stability in the injured vertebrae, followed by the <b>Clamp</b> <b>Rod</b> Internal Fixation bicortical, Modified Segmental Instrumentation and Pins with Bone Cement. Statistically, the locking plate and the <b>Clamp</b> <b>Rod</b> Internal Fixation with bicortical pins showed more stiffness and stability in T 13 /L 1 when compared to the <b>Clamp</b> <b>Rod</b> Internal Fixation monocortical, which did not achieved the adequate rigidity for the stabilization of the vertebrae...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Cattle (n= 22) with long-bone fractures. METHODS: Records for cattle with long-bone fractures repaired between 1999 and 2004 with CRIF 4. 5 / 5. 5 were reviewed. Quality of fracture repair, fracture healing, and clinical outcome were investigated by means of clinical examination, medical records, radiographs, and telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: Successful long-term outcome was achieved in 18 cattle (82 %); 4 were euthanatized 2 - 14 days postoperatively because of fracture breakdowns. Two cattle had movement of <b>clamps</b> on the <b>rod.</b> Moderate to severe callus formation was evident in 11 cattle 6 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Movement of <b>clamps</b> on the <b>rod</b> was recognized as implant failure unique to the CRIF. This occurred in cattle with poor fracture stability because of an extensive cortical defect. The CRIF system may not be ideal to treat metacarpal/metatarsal fractures because its voluminous size makes skin closure difficult, thereby increasing the risk of postoperative infections.

50|$|During a {{study with}} Richard Walk {{in which they}} looked at the role of the {{environment}} in development of rats, Gibson {{came up with the idea}} of a second task.

Gibson then tested lambs, goats, chickens, dogs, pigs, monkeys and newborn children on a larger apparatus which led to the same results. These tests led to the belief that perception of depth was innate in many species but not all. Kittens that were raised in the dark would walk indiscriminately on both sides of the visual cliff, therefore learning from the environment had to occur.|$|R

40|$|Vertebrate photoreceptors {{respond to}} light with a graded hyperpolarization from a {{membrane}} {{potential in the}} dark of approximately - 35 mV. The present work investigates the physiological role of the Ca 2 +-activated K+ current in the photovoltage generation in mechanically isolated rods from salamander retina. Membrane current or voltage in isolated rods was recorded from light- and dark-adapted rods under voltage- or current-clamp conditions, respectively. In light-adapted rods of the salamander, selective blockade of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels by means of charybdotoxin depolarized the plasma membrane of current-clamped rods by approximately 30 mV, from a resting potential of approximately - 35 mV. A similar depolarization was observed if external Ca 2 + (1 mM) was substituted with Ba 2 + or Sr 2 +. Under control conditions, the injection of currents of increasing amplitude (up to - 100 pA, to mimic the current entering the rod outer segment) could not depolarize the membrane potential beyond a saturating value of approximately - 20 mV. However, in the presence of charybdotoxin, rods depolarized up to + 20 mV. In experiments with dark-adapted current-clamped rods, charybdotoxin perfusion lead to transient depolarizations up to 0 mV and steady-state depolarizations of approximately 5 mV above the dark resting potential. Finally, the recovery phase of the voltage response to a flash of light in the presence of charybdotoxin showed a transient overshoot of the membrane potential.

40|$|The {{research}} project focuses the attention on masonry domes – elements as much {{emerging in the}} historical urban landscape as constructively complex – considered as “macro-elements” historically vulnerable to static and dynamic stresses. In continuity with previous studies carried out over past years by many co-proponents, the project aims at experimenting an integrated knowledge approach to the domes' interpretation by combining established methodologies with innovative strategies for the comprehension of invisible structures. Such an approach is related in an unitary vision to verticals parts, as foundations, pillars, drums, attics and lanterns, and to curved ones, as arches, vaults and pendentives, together with the pre-reinforcements placed during the construction phases or for later strengthening (iron hoops, tie <b>rods,</b> <b>clamps,</b> etc). These arguments deal with issues crucial {{for the study of}} domes: firstly, the overlapping of inner and outer surfaces – as roof claddings and fresco paintings – which hide constructive elements and do not enable their comprehension. In addition, it has to be considered the difficult inspection and, therefore, the common inaccessibility, due to big dimensions and conspicuous heights from the ground level. All these factors, together with the presence of decorated surfaces that strongly limit the traditional diagnosis, require new investigation strategies – at distance and by non-destructive methods – able to document the invisible both for emerging and underground parts. Once limited the field of investigation on the 15 th and 16 th centuries' Campania construction context, the project aims at developing an integrated model of knowledge where “humanistic” interpretation techniques and bottom-up/bottom-down surveys and materials' investigations could be complementary and able to give information useful for the restoration of masonry domes. This could be possible thanks to an interdisciplinary data combination, by integrating bibliographical, iconographic and archival documents, comparisons with historical treatises, instrumental surveys and diagnosis investigations together with innovative spatial interpretations, as well as through the collaboration of research and specialist educational centres. This aim, supported by the careful selection, cataloguing and open-access digitalization of the acquired data, will be applied to a demonstrative research case-study and will have a broader and complete result in the Atlas of Masonry Domes in Campania. The Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries, considered as a testing outcome on which can be prepared, in the near future, national and international projects, related both to the following centuries’ architectures in the same area, as well as to wider contexts through well calibrated comparative processes. The understanding of what is invisible to direct inspection, in turn, is a stimulating frontier to deepen in a multi-disciplinary form for the proposition of innovative dissemination ways for the comprehension of cultural heritage and able to add to the recognition of decorative and spatial values new communicative horizons related to the construction of complex “machines”. The transposition of the outcomes of the survey phase – i. e, engineering inventions of the past, preventive expedients, hidden systems, transformations’ traces – into the transfer of digital “accessible” data by ICT and mobile systems, other than increase the specialized knowing, can have repercussions on the improvement of the sharing and consequent spread of a greater cultural awareness towards the historical-constructive features, often sacrificed, of the historical buildings...|$|R
