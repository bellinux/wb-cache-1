5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
25|$|After {{the north-south}} line opened in late 1999 with sixteen stations, {{ridership}} expectations were quickly met. The system was enthusiastically embraced by valley residents, {{to the surprise}} of many, and once-skeptical communities soon began <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> extensions.|$|E
25|$|By 1999, {{the public}} was <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> a {{unification}} bout versus the WBC World Champion, Lennox Lewis of the United Kingdom. That bout happened in March of that year. The bout was declared a controversial draw after twelve rounds, where it appeared to most that Lewis dominated the fight. Holyfield claimed his performance was hindered by stomach and leg cramps. Holyfield and Lewis were ordered by the three leading organizations of which they were champions to have an immediate rematch.|$|E

25|$|Larsson {{originally}} {{chose to}} retire from international football after that World Cup. His decision was met with dismay in Sweden and there was much <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> {{him to return to}} the team for their campaign at Euro 2004 in Portugal. Despite initially maintaining his decision to retire, he eventually agreed to return to the national side for Euro 2004. Playing up front alongside Zlatan Ibrahimović, Larsson scored three goals in four matches and lead Sweden to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated in a penalty shoot-out by the Netherlands. Larsson's diving header against Bulgaria was voted best goal of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Cohen toured for {{the first}} time, in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and {{appeared}} at the Isle of Wight Festival. In 1972 he toured again in Europe and Israel. When his performance in Israel didn't {{seem to be going}} well, however, he walked off the stage, went to his dressing room, and took some LSD. He then heard the audience <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> his reappearance by singing to him in Hebrew, and {{under the influence of the}} psychedelic, he returned to finish the show. Additionally, in 1973 he played a special performance for a group of IDF soldiers in the outposts of Sinai during the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
25|$|The even stricter {{emissions}} standards {{which were}} to be introduced in 1975 {{as part of a}} staggered program of cleaning the air proved problematic for kei car manufacturers. This was particularly hard for Daihatsu and Suzuki, which focused on two-stroke engines. Tiny Suzuki was worse off, with the company's entire production consisting of two-stroke kei cars. Daihatsu, though, had both the engineering backing and powerful connections of their large owner, Toyota, to aid them in meeting the new requirements. All manufacturers of kei cars were <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> relaxing the dimension conditions, claiming that the emissions standards could not be met with a functional 360-cc engine (though Subaru's SEEC-T-equipped Rex proved it possible). In the end, the Japanese legislature relented, increasing the overall length and width restrictions by 200mm and 100mm, respectively. Engine size was increased to 550cc, taking effect from January 1, 1976. The new standards were announced on 26 August 1975, leaving very little time for manufacturers to update their offerings.|$|E

Thought to produce wide cross-demographic appeal, however, the music video to the single features Lavigne and her band wreaking havoc in a mall, [...] "the sort of imagery that might have grown-ups thinking 'Clean that mess up!' more than <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> the record". The song was a worldwide No. 1 hit and was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E
500|$|Immediately after Santa Anna {{had taken}} office in April, he had handed over all {{decision-making}} authority to his vice president, Valentín Gómez Farías, and retired to the countryside. [...] Farías enacted many federalist reforms, which angered citizens and army leaders. [...] Much {{of the country}} was <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> a return to centralism, yet Texians wanted to take further steps toward self-rule. By the time Austin arrived in Mexico City on July 18, several Mexican states had engaged in minor revolts against Farías's reforms. [...] Although Texians had expelled troops within their province before Santa Anna and Farías took office, many officials identified the province with the other rebellious states and were suspicious of Austin's intentions.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to Harmy's Despecialized Edition {{has been}} positive. Writing for Inverse, Sean Hutchinson placed it at {{number one on}} his list of the best Star Wars fan edits, and {{described}} it as [...] "the perfect pre-1997 way to experience the saga". Whitson Gordon of Lifehacker called the edits [...] "the best version of Star Wars you can watch", and named them [...] "the version of Star Wars we've all been <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> the last 20 years". Similarly, Nathan Barry of Wired praised the films as [...] "an absolute joy to watch", while Gizmodo described them as [...] "very, very good".

500|$|At noon on November 6, {{an angry}} crowd began to {{gather at the}} Indiana Statehouse. Leaders issued a series of demands to the {{governor}} and began <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> him to appear and address their demands in person. They wanted him to order the guard to leave the city, and call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to have their grievances addressed by legislation. If the governor refused, they threatened more violence. Although advised by his friends to avoid contact with the crowd, Ralston, escorted by armed guardsmen, exited the statehouse {{and spoke to the}} crowd from the steps of the building. He delivered an impassioned speech and stated his reluctance at declaring martial law, but said he was forced to do so to prevent the further loss of [...] life. He promised to withdraw the troops, negotiate with the union leaders, and draft legislation to reform working conditions. In exchange the strikers had to return to work and prove their good faith. His speech calmed the situation and the crowd began to disperse. Ralston was credited by the press and civic leaders like Jacob Piatt Dunn for ending the strike.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott of IGN gave a 9.3 out of 10 to [...] "I Do", {{describing}} it as [...] "delivering some key {{moments in the}} series' history and leaving viewers with a spectacular cliffhanger ending." [...] Carabott complimented Locke's scenes as [...] "short but nonetheless powerful" [...] and praised Matthew Fox's acting, saying he [...] "steals the show {{with one of his}} best performances to date". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno considered that the flashbacks [...] "weren't as exciting as the action on the island, but they were full of fun details" [...] and liked Jack's scenes at the operating room. Jonathan Toomey of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "I Do" [...] "an episode worthy of being called a mid-season finale", thinking that the romantic scenes between Kate and Sawyer worked for [...] "the tension that existed". [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl considered [...] "I Do" [...] as [...] "a worthy end to Lost's truncated Fall season", having a good reaction to the cliffhanger and saying the episode [...] "set up incredible possibilities {{for the rest of the}} season". Not all reviews were positive, with Slant Magazines critic Andrew Dignan feeling it was [...] "lacking both the immediacy and urgency that keeps viewers <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> months on end", and being critical of the writing, particularly on most of the essential plot elements occurring in the final minutes.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} to the handheld praises its accomplishments, but defines it as a [...] "niche" [...] device that appeals to only certain gamers. Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi's design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market, but blames Bandai for its lack of success, stating, [...] "While WonderSwan ultimately {{will be remembered as}} a highly localized blip in the history of handheld games, as a platform it genuinely held its own... the system's obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai's strangely meek strategy, not from any inherent flaws {{in the design of the}} machine itself." [...] Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America, stating, [...] "given how hard it was to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail, it's hard to imagine they were <b>clamoring</b> <b>for</b> yet another niche portable from Japan." [...] Luke Plunkett from Kotaku praised the WonderSwan's challenge to Nintendo, stating, [...] "t tried some pretty unique and interesting things, and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed." [...] Retro Gamers Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld, including its lack of a headphone and AC port, as well as its poor control scheme for left-handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected. Wild offers some praise for the handheld, however, stating [...] "what [...] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition. The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was <b>clamoring</b> <b>for.</b> And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E
