25|$|With the {{exception}} of three arch bridges all steel bridges consisted of very simple, straight, single beam truss constructions. These had to be reinforced already before 1914 still during steam operation of the Gotthardbahn due to quickly increasing traffic and load. Fish-belly truss structures were attached to the bridges from below where possible and an arch truss structure was added from the top, where a short <b>clear</b> <b>height</b> made this necessary, besides other measures. Eventually all original iron bridges had to be replaced with modern bridges {{because they had been}} built and were repeatedly reinforced to specifications that again and again were surpassed by increasing traffic, velocity and load.|$|E
500|$|These ships [...] {{were given}} a [...] teak flight deck. Their hangar had a <b>clear</b> <b>height</b> of [...] and {{encompassed}} [...] It was the largest enclosed space afloat, civilian or military, when built. The hangar was [...] long and its width varied from , constrained by the bulky funnel uptakes and boat compartments. The height of the hangar was not exceeded on an American aircraft carrier until the [...] ships appeared in the mid-1950s. Aircraft repair shops, [...] long, were aft of the hangar and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft, [...] long. The hangar was divided by a single fire curtain just forward of the aft aircraft elevator.|$|E
500|$|The initial design had two islands {{with the}} flight deck running between them. Each island {{contained}} one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted {{on top of the}} bracing, which left a <b>clear</b> <b>height</b> of [...] for the aircraft on {{the flight deck}}. Fairly early in the design process, {{the decision was made to}} delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.|$|E

500|$|The Director of Naval Construction began {{preliminary}} design work {{even before the}} ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8February 1918. This design had a full-length flight deck and its most distinctive features were the two islands separated by the flight deck. Each island was to be [...] long, containing two funnels and a tripod mast. Although they were staggered {{to make it more}} difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship's course, they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing. The bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a <b>clear</b> <b>height</b> of [...] for the aircraft on the flight deck. There was to be a [...] wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off. Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators). A crane was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes. Bulk petrol storage consisted of [...] in [...] tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by [...] plating. Two ready-use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's planned armament consisted of nine 6-inch guns and four [...] anti-aircraft guns mounted on the platform between the islands. Eagle retained the battleship's mixture of coal and fuel oil, but the quantities were increased to [...] of coal and [...] of oil, as the forward and rear 14-inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{no part of}} our {{province}} here {{to decide}} between the conjectures of rival etymologists, nor to pronounce on their relative merits. But the world cannot {{be expected to be}} convinced by philological scholars before they have convinced each other. Mr. Max Müller had not convinced Benfey, who offered another etymology of Athene, as the feminine of the Zend Thrætana athwyana, an etymology of which Mr. Müller remarks that [...] "whoever will take the trouble to examine its phonetic foundation will be obliged in common honesty to confess that it is untenable".* Meanwhile Curtius** is neither for Ahana and Sanskrit and Mr. Max Müller, nor for Benfey and Zend. He derives Athene from the root aio, whence perhaps comes Athene, the blooming one" [...] = the maiden.

Cromwell's concluding Speech to these men is a remarkable one. So likewise to his third Parliament, in similar rebuke for their pedantries and obstinacies. Most rude, chaotic, all these Speeches are; but most earnest-looking. You would say, it was a sincere helpless man; not used to speak the great inorganic thought of him, but to act it rather! A helplessness of utterance, in such bursting fulness of meaning. He talks much about [...] "births of Providence:" [...] All these changes, so many victories and events, were not forethoughts, and theatrical contrivances of men, of me or of men; it is blind blasphemers that will persist in calling them so! He insists with a heavy sulphurous wrathful emphasis on this. As he well might. As if a Cromwell in that dark huge game he had been playing, the world wholly thrown into chaos round him, had foreseen it all, and played it all off like a precontrived puppet-show by wood and wire! These things were foreseen by no man, he says; no man could tell what a day would bring forth: they were [...] "births of Providence," [...] God's finger guided us on, and we came at last to <b>clear</b> <b>height</b> of victory, God's Cause triumphant in these Nations; and you as a Parliament could assemble together, and say in what manner all this could be organized, reduced into rational feasibility among the affairs of men. You were to help with your wise counsel in doing that. [...] "You have had such an opportunity as no Parliament in England ever had." [...] Christ's Law, the Right and True, was to be in some measure made the Law of this land. In place of that, you have got into your idle pedantries, constitutionalities, bottomless cavillings and questionings about written laws for my coming here;--and would send the whole matter into Chaos again, because I have no Notary's parchment, but only God's voice from the battle-whirlwind, for being President among you! That opportunity is gone; and we know not when it will return. You have had your constitutional Logic; and Mammon's Law, not Christ's Law, rules yet in this land.
