High-speed signal throughput is achieved with an innovative architecture utilizing Correlated Double Sampling (CDS), typically employed with CCD arrays, or Sample and Hold (S/H) inputs (for <b>Contact</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Sensors</b> and CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensors).</b> The sampling edges are programmable to a resolution of 1 / 64 th of a pixel period.

40|$|A {{position}} {{measurement system}} {{was designed to}} estimate the absolute and relative position of an x-y-[theta] nanopositioning stage {{for use in the}} metrology of microfluidic devices during and after manufacturing. The position sensing system consists of a visible-light high-speed area camera, a target pattern, and image processing software. The target pattern consists of a square grid with unique binary codes in each square that identify the square's global position in the grid. In macroscopic-scale testing of the position sensing system, the angular orientation of the target pattern was successfully measured with less than one degree uncertainty. However this uncertainty is several orders of magnitude larger than the target precision of the sensor, and it is still unclear whether sufficient precision is attainable with this system and software.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in analyzing single cells or even single molecules has inspired {{a great deal of}} research and engineering in developing low cost, high throughput, and high sensitivity biosensor systems. This work focuses on integrated CMOS optical sensors for fluorescence detection and contact imaging. Among many relevant techniques available for biological testing and molecular detection, fluorescence-based methods generally achieve the highest sensitivity and are the most widely used. We describe several contributions towards incorporating fluorescence sensing into low cost miniaturized platforms. We first investigated the spectral responsivities of photodetectors available in a commercially available CMOS process in order to assess the need for additional optical filtering. Further, we developed a low noise photodetector in a standard CMOS process. Both the reset noise and readout noise of the sensor were significantly improved compared to a conventional pixel structure widely used as a CMOS image sensor. The sensor successfully detected nanomolar concentrations of fluorescence indicator, 2 orders of magnitude less than the recommended assay concentration for commercial fluorescence detection devices. Miniaturized high-throughput biosensor systems for single cell characterization require the ability to steer microscale biological cells to distinct locations without macroscale imaging systems. One simple and promising approach to building a miniaturized imaging system with microscale resolution is to directly couple the sensor array with the sample of interest. To investigate this approach, we explored the theoretical limitations of contact imaging with the aid of an optics simulator. Experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions. Two possible applications of contact imaging were also demonstrated. We further describe a <b>contact</b> <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> with improved spatial resolution. A novel pixel structure is developed for suppressing increased dark current in a commercially available 0. 18 µm CMOS process.

This thesis presents {{the development of}} several novel wide FOV imaging technologies and demonstrates their capabilities in longitudinal imaging of living organisms, {{on the scale of}} viral plaques to live cells and tissues. The ePetri Dish is a wide FOV on-chip bright-field microscope. Here we applied an ePetri platform for plaque analysis of murine norovirus 1 (MNV- 1). The ePetri offers the ability to dynamically track plaques at the individual cell death event level over a wide FOV of 6 mm × 4 mm at 30 min intervals. A density-based clustering algorithm is used to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of cell death events to identify plaques at their earliest stages. We also demonstrate the capabilities of the ePetri in viral titer count and dynamically monitoring plaque formation, growth, and the influence of antiviral drugs. We developed another wide FOV imaging technique, the Talbot microscope, for the fluorescence imaging of live cells. The Talbot microscope takes advantage of the Talbot effect and can generate a focal spot array to scan the fluorescence samples directly on-chip. It has a resolution of 1. 2 μm and a FOV of 13 mm 2. We further upgraded the Talbot microscope for the long-term time-lapse fluorescence imaging of live cell cultures, and analyzed the cells’ dynamic response to an anticancer drug. We present two wide FOV endoscopes for tissue imaging, named the AnCam and the PanCam.

They {{are designed with}} certain characteristic performance {{and it is important}} to measure these characteristics accurately. CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> converts light information into digital information which can be reproduced {{in the form of an}} image. Conventional 4 T pixel with a pinned photodiode is a popular choice for designing image sensors; with certain modification in the pixel architecture better characteristic performance can be achieved with trade-offs. Quantum efficiency, linearity, full-well capacity, conversion gain, noise, non-uniformity, dark current, modulation transfer function and image lag are the main characterises of a CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> The quantum efficiency defines the photon-electron conversion and collection efficiency of the <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> which ideally should be 100 percent i. e. 1 electron-hole pair for every photon incident with linear photo response. Higher full-well capacity means more number of electrons that can be stored. Conversion gain tells the <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> ability to convert the electrons generated into a voltage, higher the better. Noise sets the dynamic range of the <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> by defining the lower limit of signal level, continuous advances have been made to reduce the noise and some <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> can achieve noise level of 1 e-. Modulation transfer function defines the spatial resolution and contrast relation of the <b>image</b> <b>sensor,</b> which is also the measure of crosstalk of the <b>image</b> <b>sensor.</b> Another characteristic which is more of an advantage over CCD <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> is the <b>image</b> lag which is also known as memory effect; defines the <b>image</b> <b>sensors</b> ability to completely transfer the charge from photodiode to floating diffusion.
