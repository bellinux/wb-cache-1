40|$|OBJECTIVE: According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the federation of Dutch patients' associations, patients {{would like to see}} a pharmacist, who acts more as a personal adviser. This raised the question, how often Dutch community pharmacists have personal <b>consultations</b> with their patients in daily practice, on which factors this depends, and what kind of topics are discussed during these meetings. SETTING: Community pharmacies in the Netherlands. METHOD: A questionnaire was distributed among 800 randomly selected pharmacies. Questions were restricted to <b>consultations</b> characterized by one-to-one contact, drug therapy related content, and adequate privacy. These <b>consultations</b> were labelled as pharmaceutical <b>consultations</b> in private to distinguish them from other contacts between pharmacists and patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number, content, and character of <b>consultations.</b> RESULTS: 198 (24. 8 %) community pharmacies responded. The pharmacists provide an average of roughly 1. 2 <b>consultations</b> in private per working day. The vast majority of respondents provided face-to-face and telephone <b>consultations</b> (94. 4 and 91. 9 %, respectively), only a minority gave <b>consultations</b> by e-mail (30. 8 %). These <b>consultations</b> primarily dealt with topics related to medication safety. The mean overall time spent was 290 min per month. A relatively high frequency of personal <b>consultations</b> was significantly associated with the absolute number of full-time equivalent pharmacists in the pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The frequency of pharmaceutical <b>consultations</b> in private is low, but may be improved by reorganisation of the pharmacist's activities. The possibility of personal <b>consultations</b> by e-mail is not yet well-developed. Further research is needed to assess the patient's view of pharmaceutical <b>consultations</b> in private...|$|R

5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after <b>consultation</b> with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the <b>consultation,</b> Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The <b>consultation</b> found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} family violence documented during general practice <b>consultations</b> and describe clinical presentations. Method A dataset of 447, 809 computerised <b>consultations</b> involving 143, 634 patients from 41 general practices throughout New Zealand was examined to identify <b>consultations</b> recording family violence issues.

40|$|AIM To {{develop and}} {{validate}} {{a method of}} measuring elements ofthe process of telephone <b>consultations</b> in primary care. BACKGROUND There is an unrecognised confusion about telephone <b>consultations</b> in healthcare. There is virtually no research that has considered the difference between consulting on the telephone and consulting face-to-face. Work on face-to-face <b>consultations</b> points the way forward, suggesting {{the need to develop}} a tool to measure process in telephone <b>consultations.</b> METHODS Qualitative approaches were used: a narrative analysis ofextant instruments for face-to-face <b>consultations</b> and Discourse Analysis for the telephone <b>consultations.</b> Using this combined knowledge, a new instrument was designed. Brief reliability testing was undertaken. RESULTS There were no instruments for face-to-face consulting that were sufficient for use with telephone <b>consultations.</b> Several important features were identified that informed design of a new instrument. Discourse Analysis of the 43 telephone <b>consultations</b> from primary care, revealed newly described elements of linguistic structure: 'Advise' and 'Request' exchanges and highlighting structure in narrative passages. From this the Instrument for Measurement of Telephone Process (IMoTeP) was developed. Argument was made for its construct and face validity. Reliability testing was limited to two people with eight <b>consultations.</b> This highlighted promising perfonnance, though there is need for further testing. CONCLUSION It has proved possible to develop an instrument to measure process in telephone <b>consultations</b> based on sound theory and real life observations. Further work should consolidate the reliability and validity while also looking for attributes oftelephone <b>consultations</b> that lead to positive outcomes.

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public <b>consultation</b> process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation <b>consultation</b> document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional <b>consultation</b> documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a <b>consultation</b> document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The <b>consultation</b> process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E
