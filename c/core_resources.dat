Finally, it is tried to propose a strategic course when the business domain is enhanced to eBusiness area. In a typical research on current eBusiness， The question of the method of the new entry to eBusiness is still open. Moreover, it has been said that the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> is important when entering about eBusiness by a current early research. However, the method of clarifying the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> at a start-up stage of the business is unsettled. In this text, the aspect of value creation was introduced as an index which clarified the <b>core</b> <b>resource.</b> The aim is in giving the concept of value to a past theory about Resourcebased View of the firm. This research provides the value creation process in eBusiness by an empirical study. The comparison case study of the theory verification type was chosen as a research method for the solution of the research topic. Two companies were picked up as a material of the case study. The first case is “AMAZON. COM". This case concerns the Internet distributor of the retail goods including the book. The second case is “DELL. COM". This case concerns a direct distributor of the personal computer and the network equipment. These cases were analyzed by using “Layer model of the business system" which was the research framework of this research. It is possible to pay attention to the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> of the enterprise by using this framework. As a result of this research, the mechanism of the value creation process by the use of the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> became clear.

In {{order to maintain}} the resources, protocols coordinate strategies to maintain the resource as a common property instead of dividing it up into parcels of private property. Common property systems typically protect the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> and allocate the fringe resources through complex community norms of consensus decision-making. Common resource management has to face the difficult task of devising rules that limit the amount, timing, and technology used to withdraw various resource units from the resource system. Setting the limits too high would lead to overuse and eventually to the destruction of the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> while setting the limits too low would unnecessarily reduce the benefits obtained by the users.|$|R
50|$|In economics, a common-pool {{resource}} (CPR), {{also called}} a common property resource, {{is a type}} of good consisting of a natural or human-made resource system (e.g. an irrigation system or fishing grounds), whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits from its use. Unlike pure public goods, common pool resources face problems of congestion or overuse, because they are subtractable. A common-pool resource typically consists of a <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> (e.g. water or fish), which defines the stock variable, while providing a limited quantity of extractable fringe units, which defines the flow variable. While the <b>core</b> <b>resource</b> is to be protected or nurtured in order to allow for its continuous exploitation, the fringe units can be harvested or consumed.|$|R

First, the telecommunications resources along a connection path are partitioned into {{two or more}} segments.

Whenever such a period of inactivity is detected, the pause sensor (550) selectively causes the release of <b>core</b> telecommunications <b>resources</b> for reallocation to active applications, typically by deactivating one or more segments. When wake-up sensors (520, 550) detect renewed activity over the connection, then the dormant connection is reactivated by reallocating <b>core</b> physical <b>resources.</b> The dynamic connection technique of the present invention can be used both with analog (inband) signaling systems (e. g., Plan Old Telephone Service) {{as well as with}} digital signaling systems (e. g., Integrated Services Digital Network).

5000|$|A common {{property}} {{system is}} a particular social arrangement regulating the preservation, maintenance, and consumption of a common-pool resource. The {{use of the term}} [...] "common property resource" [...] to designate a type of good has been criticized, because common-pool resources are not necessarily governed by common property protocols. Examples of common-pool resources include irrigation systems, fishing grounds, pastures, forests, water or the atmosphere. A pasture, for instance, allows for a certain amount of grazing to occur each year without the core resource being harmed. In the case of excessive grazing, however, the pasture may become more prone to erosion and eventually yield less benefit to its users. Because the <b>core</b> <b>resources</b> are vulnerable, common-pool resources are generally subject to problems of congestion, overuse, pollution, and potential destruction unless harvesting or use limits are devised and enforced.|$|E

At the heart of this are the data resources, tools and services that ELIXIR offers to the life-sciences community, providing stable and sustainable access to biological data. ELIXIR aims to ensure that these resources are available long-term and that the life-cycles of these resources are managed such that they support the scientific needs of the life-sciences, including biological research. ELIXIR <b>Core</b> Data <b>Resources</b> are defined as a set of European data resources that are of fundamental importance to the wider life-science community and the long-term preservation of biological data. They are complete collections of generic value to life-science, are considered an authority in their field with respect to one or more characteristics, and show high levels of scientific quality and service. Thus, ELIXIR <b>Core</b> Data <b>Resources</b> are of wide applicability and usage.
