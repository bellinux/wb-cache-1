40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} {{the process of}} homogenization of positional accuracy of land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map, where the so called membrane method {{as one of the}} possible approaches to achieve the goal of homogenization has been used. In Slovenia, the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> maps are characterized by considerable inhomogeneity as a result of different technologies used for land surveying and maintenance of cadastral maps during several decades. In this thesis, the software solutions of Slovenian providers are presented, which are most frequently used in the land cadastre, and the software solution from the German providers is introduced, which was used in this research for homogenization of positional accuracy of <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map. The whole process is presented starting with data acquisition, data processing, adjustment computation to the analysis of results, we obtained with Systra software. The main purpose was to determine the optimal number of observations of additional land cadastral points, which determine the land plot border, to achieve improvement of positional and geometrical accuracy of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map in the study area of cadastral community Bočna. The particularity of the study area is that there was a new cadastral surveying conducted, which included also the land plots’ rearrangements, and this has definitely bought some specialities when dealing with the geometrical and positional characteristics of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} diploma work is to {{reconstruct}} geometry from the old records of cadastral surveying data and to estimate the positional and geometric accuracy of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map in the cadastral municipality of Črešnjice in the city municipality of Novo mesto. The scope of the research work was, among the others, to study approaches, how the land surveying (cadastral) data can be integrated in the processes of the positional and geometrical quality improvement of <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> maps. It is explained, how we processed the land surveying data from the period 1974 – 1990; here, some particularities are outlined, which {{have to be considered}} by processing of land surveying data from the study period. Each of the 6 selected cadastral documentations is presented separately. In the conclusion, the discussion is added if such data are appropriate for improving the positional and geometrical accuracy of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims at {{improving}} the positional {{accuracy of the}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map. The thesis thus presents an approach to the reconstruction of cadastral maps along the border of cadastral community Ždinja vas in The city municipality of Novo mesto. It also attempts to improve the positional precision of the land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map in the cadastral community Ždinja vas using the membrane method. Moreover, the thesis describes the analysis of input data and data processing, the process of determining identical points, further processing and result analysis. It points to the possibilities of improving both spatial and geometric quality of cadastral maps using accurate position of {{a certain number of}} detail points (identical points). The points used in the thesis were cadastral boundary points; their coordinates were determined based on the measurement with a prescribed accuracy in the national coordinate system. The results illustrating the improved positional accuracy of cadastral maps were compared to the existing land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} one of {{the possible}} approaches to improve the positional accuracy of digitalized graphical cadastral maps based on membrane method. Graphical cadastral maps became practically useless or conditional applicable to professional use due to measurement techniques, mathematical foundations of cadastral surveying, poor maintenance through the history and consequently the heterogeneity of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> maps. Because of this, much attention {{has been focused on}} improving of the positional accuracy of these maps. This work describes the approach to the improvement of land-cadastral index map positional accuracy within the cadastral municipality of Žažar and is based on surveying principles such as measurements, adjustment (least square method, error propagation etc.). In the thesis, the entire process of determination, identification (in the field), surveying measurements of the "tie points" and their further processing together with other data from the land cadastre by the software tool Systra, based on the principles of membrane method, is described. The main purpose has been to evaluate the use of different identical (tie) points, to determine their optimal arrangement in the study area and to determine the optimal approach to measurements to determine their position for the purpose of improving the positional accuracy of land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> maps. The results of the improved positional accuracy of land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> maps in this study might be further used for comparative analysis with the results of other studies relating to the improvement of positional accuracy of land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> maps, where {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different approaches should be determined...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden the <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Index</b> Map {{has played}} an {{important}} role {{since the beginning of the}} century. Today the responsibility for building up and maintaining the National <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Index</b> Map (NCIM) is shared between the National Land Survey of Sweden (NLS) and 38 Municipal Cadastral Authorities (MCA). In Sweden there are 290 municipalities in total. Of course this undertaking was not easy to achieve and implied many problems. Problems that varied from technical ones to others, even more difficult to solve, related to the “cultural” differences among diverse organizations. A project called “User Interface 2000 ” (UI 2000) was implemented to help us solve the main technical problem which was the interchange of geographical information between the NLS and the MCA:s without regard to formats and different technical solutions. UI 2000 is neither a format nor a program but a series of technical principles that can be used with different programs and computer systems for interchanging geographical data. Apart from the technical aspect of the project there is, as mentioned above, another one that is related to cooperation among different organizations. This part was somehow more difficult to achieve. Reasons such as different “working environments ” with their own workin...|$|R

40|$|The {{positional}} {{accuracy of the}} land <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map (a graphical presentation termed `ZKP'), {{as one of the}} basic elements of spatial database quality, isotopic of on-going interest in the Republic of Slovenia. Mainly due to the pressures of institutional and other users of these data, the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia has decided to implement improvements. At the Department of Geodesy, Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering, University of Ljubljana, a working group was established in order to analyse and test in particular the so-called membrane method for this purpose. At the beginning, we started to develop our own program for the finite element method of geodetic adjustments, and then we continued to test the commercial solution of German provider. The membrane method, together with additional measurements, provides the possibility for an effective improvement of the heterogeneity of land cadastral graphical presentation (ZKP), where the basic principles of geodesy must be strongly respected (methods of the coordinate geometry topology, adjustments, error propagation law, etc.). This article is meant to introduce existing and possible solutions for the improvements of the {{positional accuracy}} of the ZKP and not to present the results of our first research...|$|R

40|$|Large scale land {{acquisitions}} {{happen again}} and again. Reasons are in food prices, production of palm oil and bio fuel and carbon offset. Substantial areas are affected, e. g. areas in size comparable with Western Europe. Beneficiaries are local elites, national governments and international companies, harmed are small holders {{who can not}} defend their rights, esp. women. Oxfam (2011) provides analyses {{and a set of}} recommendations on this subject. In the context of those recommendations from Oxfam it can be recognised that there is an urgent need for new approaches in Land Administration and Management. Conventional approaches, often of historical footings, proved to be inadequate in many jurisdictions. Flexibility is needed in relation to the way of recordation 1, the type of spatial units used, the inclusion of customary and informal rights, the data acquisition methodologies and in the accuracy of boundary delineation. It is less important to produce accurate maps. It is more important to have a complete <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> map and to know how accurate the map is. For instance, highly rigorous and accurate methodologies as practiced by registered or licensed surveyors are not pro-poor approaches and take very long to cover a whole region. A more flexible approach in Land Administration and Management may result in fast availability of a cadastral map with a related registry of all (formal, informal, customary) in an area. This can then be used as a (more) solid base for large scale land acquisitions. The paper investigates up to which level the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) can contribute to a fair approach in large scale land acquisition. In the paper the problem of large scale land acquisition will be briefly introduced with a focus on the transfers of rights (and restrictions). Fitness for purpose will be tested based on a series of cases. The broader land governance issues {{that need to be addressed}} to get to fair large scale land acquisitions are only briefly mentioned and mostly outside the scope of this paper...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preprint}} of a {{paper from}} the International Conference on Cadastral Reform, Korea, 16 - 17 July, 1996. Australian cadastral systems have been strongly influenced by the historical settlement of the Australian states and territories. An important consequence is that no cadastral office was ever established {{and as a result}} a coordinated cadastre never developed. Departments of Lands or Surveyors General departments administered the ever decreasing Crown lands as a result of rapid alienation, as well as the jurisdictions' surveying and mapping infrastructure. As a result Australia lacked a European style cadastral office providing a complete cadastral record which could be used for land administration purposes. Land Titles Offices historically had the responsibility for all freehold or private lands, which now comprise the vast majority of land parcels in the states. These Offices have been responsible for examining all cadastral surveys and ensuring appropriate regulations for such surveys, however they have only ever been concerned with individual transactions in support of an efficient land market. The maintenance of the cadastral map for each jurisdiction however has usually remained {{under the control of the}} Surveyor General or in recent years a geographic information coordination agency. Increasingly the title register in each jurisdiction is including all Crown and government lands and is assuming the role of a European cadastre, albeit the <b>cadastral</b> <b>index</b> has legal significance since it is based on actual land titles. Due to computerisation of the titles register and the establishment of digital cadastral data bases (DCDB), the trend in Australia is for the textual and spatial components of the cadastre to come together technically and administratively. This has allowed Australian jurisdictions for the first time to have a complete cadastral record to support land administration. The resulting model has permitted Australia to move from a land administration structure that was conceptually well behind that of most developed and many developing countries to a position at the forefront of developments due to innovation and computerisation. The development of coordinated cadastres formed by upgrading the now complete DCDBs in Australia is the key in the future improvement of Australia's cadastral systems. This paper reviews this development and shows how the Australian systems differ from their European counterparts. It concludes by attempting to describe a future conceptual model for an Australian state wide geographic information system based on a legal cadastre. Australian states and territories are well advanced to achieving this vision. 16 - 17 July, 1996 Open Acces...|$|R
