This mode of operation, constant cutting velocity combined with different profiles of materials to be cut, exposes the cut-ting saw to variable cutting forces. Therefore, the {{cutting off machine}} is usually set for the worst expected conditions, oth-erwise excessive wear of the saw and machine will occur. Fur-ther, traditional <b>cutting-off</b> <b>machines</b> require the adjustment {{of the position of}} a limit switch in order to automatically detect when the cut of a piece has been completed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the application of control algorithms to the process of cutting-off metallic pipes or bars, with variable pro-files, implemented in an industrial cutting-off machine, com-mercially available. The presented algorithms concern real-time cutting control and automatic detection of the cutting end. The algorithms are implemented in a low cost Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), allowing its use in industrial applica-tions without significant increase on machine cost. All algo-rithms were developed having in mind safety issues relative to the operation of the cutting machine in order to prevent catas-trophic failure.
