This argument, which is still popular, neglects {{the fact that the}} restriction of the German military to 115, 000 men relieved the German central budget considerably. In a counterfactual analysis we assess the savings in additional military costs and compare them to the reparation payments. Depending on the character of the foreign policy pursued by an unrestricted Germany, we find that the net effect of the Treaty’s stipulations on the German central budgets was either much lower than hitherto thought or even positive. This finding gives support to the argument that Germany suffered from home-made political failure even in the relatively stable period from 1924 to 1929. ...|$|E

This leads to what is referred to as Service Systems Engineering (SSE), which has its basis in the SE and, for specific types of services, represents the driving discipline to design successful systems capable of delivering effective services. In the defence market, the acquisition of defence and weapon systems is facing, in the last decades, a <b>continuous</b> <b>budget</b> contraction for both the acquisition and the support of the delivered systems.

At full employment, the substitution of borrowing for lump sum taxes crowds outprivate capital formation in a closed economy. Government financial policy {{can be used to}} implement optimal intertemporal risk distribution schemes. In the presence of distortionary taxes, the smoothing of tax rates over time may be optimal even where this involves systematic and predictable departures from <b>continuous</b> <b>budget</b> balance. The case for deficit finance and the operation of the automatic fiscal stabilizers in a Keynesian world with disequilibrium in labour and output markets is restated. The case for any kind of active financial policy rests on the presence of capital market imperfections (including incomplete contingent forward markets such as insurance markets), on the longevity of the institution of government and on the government's unique ability to tax. Finally, certain long-run aspects of the fiscal and monetary stance are analyzed. This includes their sustainability, i. e. the consistency of long-term spending and taxation plans with the monetary objectives and the crowding outtargets. The concepts of the comprehensive net worth of the public sector and its permanent income are central to this analysis. The current U.

40|$|Academic {{libraries}} {{have recently}} been subjected to <b>continuous</b> <b>budget</b> reductions, mainly due to the increasing costs of information and the global economic crisis. As {{the primary purpose of}} an academic library is to provide well-balanced collections and a wide range of services to support education and research, an efficient use and allocation of limited resources is vital. However, allocating resources such as money, staff, time, and infrastructure between the library collection and services represents a challenge due to the multitude of data sources required to consult during a decision-making process. Academic libraries are accustomed to keeping voluminous statistics on their collection and services; however these data are not fully used for decision-making processes {{due to the lack of}} an efficient structure for grouping this information. The authors in a previous study state that prior to decision making, data must be collected based on a holistic approach that incorporates all of the key elements that may influence a decision. It is in this sense that to holistically assess libraries, an approach combining a theoretical framework with several measurement tools is proposed in that study. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to document early experiences and lessons learned in implementing the holistic approach in an academic library in Belgium. To do so, the academic library is evaluated in two dimensions. The first dimension analyzes the library system and its collection, whereas the second dimension analyzes the perspective of both the user and the internal stakeholders. During the initial implementation stages, the proposed approach proved to be valuable to ensure a complete view of the library collection and services. There are, however, important considerations to be borne in mind such as the time required to implement the complete approach, as well as the need of a system to integrate the collected information...|$|E

40|$|Although project {{portfolio}} management (PPM) {{has been an}} active research area over the past 50 years, budget allocation models that consider competition are sparse. Firms faced with the {{project portfolio}} management problem must not only consider their current projections for the returns from their projects’ target markets, but must also anticipate that these returns can depend significantly on the investment decisions made by their competitors. In this thesis, we develop four Competitive PPM (CPPM) models wherein firms allocate resources between multiple projects and project returns {{are influenced by the}} actions taken by competitors. In the first two CPPM problems, we assume all-or-nothing project investment decisions where firms fully commit to either a project targeting a mature or an emerging market and the investment amount is fixed (first model) or a decision variable (second model). In the final two CPPM problems, firms have a fixed budget which they allocate in a continuous manner between two markets (third model) or multiple markets (fourth model). The returns each firm obtains from investments into these markets are assumed to follow an s-shaped curve (first model), the Inada (1963) conditions (third model), or are determined based on linear demand functions (second and fourth model). In the first model, two competing firms consider investing into two separate projects targeting a mature and an emerging market. We assume that firms have symmetric investment opportunities for each market and each firm simultaneously decides whether to invest in the mature or the emerging market. The returns from these markets are assumed to follow an s-shaped curve and depend on both firms’ investment decision. We characterize the variety of interactions that may emerge in symmetric environments (e. g., Prisoner’s Dilemma or Game of Chicken). For each game, we outline the CPPM strategy that can offer higher returns by exploiting first-mover advantages, cooperation opportunities and aggressive choices. We also discuss the market conditions that lead to these games. In the second model, a similar CPPM setting is considered where two symmetric firms face two target markets. However, we assume that demand for the emerging market is uncertain and may expand through firms’ market entry (positive diffusion effects), while demand for the mature market is known with certainty and cannot expand. Firms decide when to invest, in which market to invest, and how much to invest into this market. Our analysis reveals that the existence of multiple investment opportunities may induce firms to delay their investment {{even in the absence of}} demand uncertainty, and that high diffusion effects coupled with low demand uncertainty can drive firms to invest early even if both firms could increase returns by delaying their investment. We then study the asymmetric case where firms differ with respect to their costs and diffusion effects and show some counter-intuitive results. In the third CPPM problem, we consider <b>continuous</b> <b>budget</b> allocations and prove that while a monopoly firm bases its budget allocation decision solely on the marginal returns of the two markets, duopoly firms also account for their average returns from the two markets. This drives duopoly firms, in particular the firm with the smaller budget, to invest more heavily into the mature market. We show that as a firm’s budget increases, the share of its budget that is invested into the mature market decreases while its competitor’s investment into the mature market increases. This chapter also explores how changes to the market parameters and market uncertainty affect the resource allocation decision of firms under competition. Considering the special case of identical budgets, we prove that as the number of competing firms increases (with a fixed total budget), firms allocate an even greater share of their budget into the mature market. The fourth model considers a general case where a number of budget-constrained firms engage in production decisions for multiple markets under competition. Each firm decides how much to produce for each market, subject to its budget constraint. We prove that firms produce greater quantities for markets with higher than average base demand and that these quantities are increasing in the number of competitors (assuming identical production capacities). With asymmetric production capacities, we numerically illustrate how firms with large production capacities may, instead, increase production into lower than average base demand markets. Furthermore, we characterize the increase in return firms can expect from budget increases and conjecture that if some markets are not served by all firms, the remaining firms reduce their production into those markets where some firms are not producing...|$|E

In a Chinese auction, multiple players compete for several items by buying tickets, {{which can be used}} to win the items. In front of each item there is a basket, and the players can bid by placing tickets in the basket(s) corresponding to the item(s) they are trying to win. After all the players have placed their tickets, a ticket is drawn at random from each basket and the item is given to the owner of the winning ticket. While a player is never guaranteed to win an item, they can improve their chances of getting it by increasing the number of tickets for that item. In this paper we investigate the existence of pure Nash equilibria in both the continuous and discrete settings. When the players have <b>continuous</b> <b>budgets,</b> we show that a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist for asymmetric games when some valuations are zero. In that case we prove that the auctioneer can stabilize the game by placing his own ticket in each basket. On the other hand, when all the valuations are strictly positive, a pure Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist, and the equilibrium strategies are symmetric when both valuations and budgets are symmetric. We also study Chinese auctions with discrete budgets, for which we give both existence results and counterexamples. While the literature on rent-seeking contests traditionally focuses on continuous costly tickets, the discrete variant is very natural and more closely models the version of the auction held in practice...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{will present}} the total solar eclipse expeditions of the Lick Observatory that {{occurred}} during the late nineteenth century and continued through {{the first quarter of the}} twentieth century. At this period in time, astronomical research centers worldwide, were sending solar eclipse expeditions afar, often under arduous travel and living conditions. The primary goal, of the Lick Observatory’s eclipse expeditions, was to collect photographs and spectrograms of the features of the Sun that can only be seen and recorded in the brief moments of a total solar eclipse of the Sun. The scientific focus of this thesis is the Observatory’s study of the solar corona using large scale photographic images. A summary will be given of the science of the solar corona, as it developed through the midlate nineteenth century up to the period of the Lick Observatory’s eclipse expeditions, which began in 1889. It was then that the corona was on an ever-increasing scale being subjected to scientific analysis with the new tools of photography and the spectroscope. This review will define those contributions made by the study of drawings and photographs of the solar corona up to the time of the Observatory’s expeditions. This will set the stage for the pioneering photography and coronal research conducted by the Lick Observatory, made possible with the development of a new eclipse camera by Staff Astronomer J. M. Schaeberle. Schaeberle, would in turn use its images in his continued analysis of a new theory regarding the forces within the solar corona that define its structure and form. Schaeberle’s unique 40 foot focal length camera will be presented in detail. This instrument was designed for the sole purpose of making large-scale coronal images at a total eclipse of the Sun. These images would reveal fine structure within the corona never seen before. The individual components, making up this camera, will be described with attention given to the care and precision by which they were manufactured, set up, and operated. The Camera will be described at each eclipse site along with pertinent photographic processes. A brief summary of the plate results will be included. A general description of each of the Observatory’s eclipse expeditions will be detailed. The site geographic specifics, staff and volunteers in attendance, individual duties of the members of the eclipse party, layout of the eclipse camp, range of scientific apparatus and their purpose, interaction with local organizations, and any special circumstances that affected the outcome of the expedition’s success or failure are included. The Observatory’s contributions to the knowledge of coronal physics will be presented and subjected to critical analysis. Schaeberle’s new coronal theory based solely on Newtonian mechanics will be reviewed and compared to the concurrent mechanical, magnetic and electric coronal theories, then under study by other prominent astronomers at other institutions. Any connections of the new theory with regard to particle makeup, meteor streams, comets, or gas content of the solar corona, will be mentioned. The resulting scientific output generated from the Schaeberle Camera’s coronal images will then be fitted within the overall knowledge of the solar corona at that point in history. Major coronal research conducted by J. A. Miller of the Sproul Observatory at Swarthmore College using the Lick’s large scale plates will be mentioned as it was an extension in part of the original Schaeberle Mechanical Theory of the Solar Corona. A brief survey of the Lick Observatory involvement of a test of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity will be presented as it was the principal focus of three of the eclipse expeditions and the Lick Observatory was a chief participant in this paradigm shift of our knowledge of physics. The coronal imaging program of the Observatory will be compared with that of other institutions at individual eclipse dates. This comparison will include a summary of the cameras used for producing large scale images of the corona by all parties. The Lick Observatory’s solar eclipse program will be discussed in terms of its place in the overall scheme of the general research program of the Observatory. In the same manner, the direct photographic eclipse program will be assigned its level of importance on each of the expeditions when compared to the concurrent spectrographic experiments, Vulcan planet search, and Einstein verification studies, as time progressed. Issues of funding and staff allotment for the expeditions, research, and timely publication of images and scientific results will be discussed. The effectiveness of the Observatory relying on volunteers to conduct a good deal of the eclipse work will be examined. There will be a discussion of optical design for the production of large sized eclipse images. The study will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of fixed cameras versus clock-driven movable instruments and refractor versus reflector optical configurations. Optical specifications of aperture and focal length suitable for coronal image making with the photographic emulsions and reproduction methods of the time will be looked at. Within this study, the Schaeberle Camera will receive its classification amongst other eclipse cameras with its performance characteristics being evaluated and compared. A study will be made to show the level of cooperation present between the Observatory and other national and international institutions. Any major involvement with astronomical organizations and their eclipse committees will be summarized. The educational benefits to the general public and the public relations role of the eclipse expeditions will be noted. The founding of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific will be discussed because of its intertwinement with the preparations for the first Lick Observatory eclipse expedition in January 1889. The Observatory faced <b>continuous</b> <b>budget</b> deficiencies and the impact on the publication of eclipse results will be surveyed in this light. The thesis will conclude with a series of remarks to summarize the findings of the thesis. The advancement in camera design in regards to the Schaeberle Camera and photographic processes for solar eclipse image making will be summarized. A reflection on the modernization of the Lick eclipse expeditions will be given. Advancements in analytical techniques for data reduction will be noted. The key contributions of the Observatory to our knowledge of the solar corona will be summarized. Results of other institutions made latter in the nineteenth century by their use of the plates of the Schaeberle Camera will be briefly noted. The Lick Observatory solar eclipse expeditions and solar eclipse research program will be given its place in the grand scheme of the study of solar physics...|$|E

A review of modelling capabilities of mathematical programs for capital budgeting, and of financial expert systems leads to defining the respective role and potential of each method, and to the proposal of a two-tiered project selection approach: project evaluation and resource allocation. With emphasis placed on a tight coupling of the two tiers, logic programming is {{shown to be a}} language of choice to implement mathematical programming within an expert system shell. Prolog has the requisite properties to deal with both logical considerations and optimization problems. Although Prolog was not primarily designed to solve optimization problems, it is shown that the backtracking mechanism of the Prolog language is powerful enough for that purpose; it liberates the programmer from having to implement tree-search programs.

40|$|Empirical {{studies on}} minimum wages are {{primarily}} concerned with employment while their effects on income inequality receive less attention. Yet, a popular argument for a federal minimum wage in Germany {{is that it will}} prevent in-work poverty and reduce income inequality. We examine this assertion for different minimum wage levels {{on the basis of a}} microsimulation model that accounts for the interactions between wages, the tax-benefit system and net incomes at the household level. The methodological approach of an earlier study is extended by incorporating behavioral adjustments at different margins (labor supply and demand, consumption) for the first time into a microsimulation framework at the household level. We use data from the SOEP, the IABS, and the <b>Continuous</b> Household <b>Budget</b> Survey. We show that even a high federal minimum wage will only have a minor impact on inequality among households with at least one minimum-wage worker. Low wage earners are not not concentrated in the lower parts but rather scattered over the income distribution. Wage increases often substitute welfare transfers and are subject to high marginal tax rates. A decline in labor demand could diminish the gains in net incomes up to 50 % and higher product prices further reduce these gains even after consumption adjusts. Although it might decrease wage inequality substantially, the distributive impact of a minimum wage on disposable incomes is thus very limited...|$|R

There are also over 80 pages of classed profiles that describe the present and desired levels of collections. These are prepared by comparing parts of the curriculum with library ccllection call numbers. Four appendixes describe the university's degrees and programs, its mission statement and that of the library, and guidelines for faculty and library coordination. A fifth appendix contains some documents pertaining to intellectual freedom.

The published article is copyrighted by the University of Zagreb and can be found at: [URL] and implementation of road BMPs on a watershed scale can be a difficult task because of the need to prioritize locations while accounting for multiple constraints, such as the available <b>budget,</b> <b>continuous</b> maintenance, and equipment scheduling. Using simulated annealing (SA) as its heuristic optimizer, BMP-SA accounts for sediment being delivered to the stream network through incorporation of modeled road erosion predictions and alternative BMP options and scheduling for problematic road segments. BMP-SA was applied to the Glenbrook Creek watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin in Nevada, US. WEPP:Road predictions were used to identify road segments posing an erosion risk and appropriate BMPs were identified for problematic segments. Using BMP-SA, modeled road-related sediment leaving the forest buffer, thus entering streams, was minimized {{over the course of the}} planning horizon while considering budget constraints and equipment scheduling concerns. BMP-SA can be applied to any watershed but relies heavily on the perceived accuracy of road erosion predictions...|$|R
40|$|Heo, bo young In this study, {{the effect}} {{analysis}} of the Maintenance Project on Natural Disaster Prone Areas was analysed quantitatively as well as qualitatively {{in order to improve}} the quality of the project. The result obtained from this analysis is used as fundamental data to acquire the <b>continuous</b> and stable <b>budget</b> status. In order to analyze the effectiveness of rehabilitation projects of natural disaster risk districts, the cases of effectiveness analysis of similar projects at home and abroad were investigated, and based on this, the methods of effectiveness analysis on rehabilitation projects were presented. The effectiveness analysis was divided roughly into the quantitative analysis and the qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis utilized the cost-benefit analysis, and the quali-tative analysis conducted the analysis through the questionnaire survey on the degree of satisfaction and the damage reduc-tion effectiveness before and after the rehabilitation projects, and the validity analysis through, besides the results of descriptive statistical analysis generally obtained by questionnaire survey, the structural equation model used in the policy evaluation of agri-culture, forestry, and fishery industry projects, which are the public projects similar to the rehabilitation projects of natural disaster risk districts. The results of the analysis showed that, in the quantitative analysis, the cost-benefit analysis ratio was more than 1, and also in the qualitative analysis, the effectiveness of the projects was positively perceived. The results of such analysis are expected to contribute to securing the budget for the rehabilitation projects and to be utilized to establish the direction of effi...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the daily surgical scheduling problem in a teaching hospital. This problem relates {{to the use of}} multiple operating rooms and different types of surgeons in a typical surgical day with deterministic operation durations (preincision, incision, and postincision times). Teaching hospitals {{play a key role in}} the health-care system; however, existing models assume that the duration of surgery is independent of the surgeon's skills. This problem has not been properly addressed in other studies. We analyze the case of a Spanish public hospital, in which <b>continuous</b> pressures and <b>budgeting</b> reductions entail the more efficient use of resources. Methods: To obtain an optimal solution for this problem, we developed a mixed-integer programming model and user-friendly interface that facilitate the scheduling of planned operations for the following surgical day. We also implemented a simulation model to assist the evaluation of different dispatching policies for surgeries and surgeons. The typical aspects we took into account were the type of surgeon, potential overtime, idling time of surgeons, and the use of operating rooms. Results: It is necessary to consider the expertise of a given surgeon when formulating a schedule: such skill can decrease the probability of delays that could affect subsequent surgeries or cause cancellation of the final surgery. We obtained optimal solutions for a set of given instances, which we obtained through surgical information related to acceptable times collected from a Spanish public hospital. Conclusions: We developed a computer-aided framework with a user-friendly interface for use by a surgical manager that presents a 3 -D simulation of the problem. Additionally, we obtained an efficient formulation for this complex problem. However, the spread of this kind of operation research in Spanish public health hospitals will take a long time since there is a lack of knowledge of the beneficial techniques and possibilities that operational research can offer for the health-care system...|$|R
40|$|Beginning {{in early}} 2002 fiscal year (FY 2002), the University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{experienced}} four reductions in state funding. This required {{the administration to}} cut the University 2 ̆ 7 s budget on four consecutive occasions. Round one of the budget cuts comprised cuts for FY 2002 and FY 2003; {{the second and third}} rounds comprised cuts for FY 2003; and round four involved cuts for FY 2004. Each round of cuts varied in the required responses from the administration and faculty leadership. With the <b>continuous</b> reductions in <b>budget</b> the decisions became more contentious. ^ The methodology employed in this study was qualitative text analysis. Public documents constituting the data for this study included (1) official and unofficial documents released by the Chancellor; (2) Academic Senate meetings minutes; (3) Senate 2 ̆ 7 s executive committee meeting minutes; and (4) printed media articles. Based on the documents, a timeline of the events, beginning with the first announcement of reduction in state funding, was constructed and the events that occurred were placed within the timeline for {{a detailed description of the}} process. ^ Eleven key elements were identified as significant in the process. They are presented in ranked order based on their contribution to the process and its outcome: (1) prior development of policies for budget cuts; (2) importance of joint planning committee; (3) holding open hearings; (4) leadership by the Chancellor; (5) dissemination of information and maintaining communication; (6) importance of faculty executive committee; (7) support from senior administrators; (8) maintaining focus on mission; (9) using vertical cuts approach; (10) attention to media without being influenced; and (11) planning ahead, even during budget cuts. ^ These eleven elements, termed 2 ̆ 7 lessons learned 2 ̆ 7, are considered to be lessons that may be helpful in guiding subsequent budget cuts processes. It is hoped that future studies will be carried out expanding on this basis of knowledge. This could benefit future decision-makers in higher education when faced with decisions on budget cuts, as will undoubtedly happen. ...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJeff WilliamsThis study {{examines}} the net returns from grain and biomass production from seven annual crop rotations using six different management scenarios. This study also examines {{the profitability of}} producing biomass from three perennial crops using four management scenarios. Soybeans were rotated with grain sorghum, dual purpose sorghum, photoperiod sensitive sorghum, brown mid-rib (BMR) sorghum, and corn. Continuously cropped corn was also included. Perennial grasses including switchgrass and big bluestem were compared to a traditional crop, alfalfa. Yields and input data for the crops was from an experimental field study conducted at Kansas State University, Manhattan KS. Enterprise budgets were constructed for rotations of five sorghum varieties with soybeans, corn and soybeans, and <b>continuous</b> corn. Enterprise <b>budgets</b> were also constructed for three perennial crops; consisting of switchgrass, big bluestem grass, and alfalfa. Perennial crop costs and returns are estimated over an assumed 10 year production horizon. Costs and net returns {{for each of these}} budgets were compared to determine which crop rotation was the most economically feasible. Yield and input rates, excluding soybean yield and inputs, used were collected from an agronomic field experiment at Manhattan located in Riley County, Kansas (Propheter, 2009; Roozeboom et al., 2011). Costs of inputs were from USDA Agricultural Prices, Kansas State University farm management guides, and Sharpe Brothers Seed Company. Harvest costs are from Kansas State University farm management guides and a Northeastern Colorado and Northwestern Kansas producer survey. The corn- soybean rotation had the highest net returns per acre across all annual crop scenarios. The corn-soybean rotation did not have the highest net returns per acre when an alternative price was used for the photoperiod sensitive sorghum-soybean rotation. The dual purpose sorghum-soybean rotation had the second highest net returns per acre across all annual crop scenarios. The corn-soybean and dual purpose sorghum-soybean rotations had high grain net returns, and low to average biomass production costs. Alfalfa had the highest amortized net returns of the perennial crops, and had positive establishment year net returns. Alfalfa had higher amortized net returns and establishment year net returns than switchgrass and big bluestem...|$|R
