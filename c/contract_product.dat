5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{differences}} between the DMS model and other Contract Manufacturing such as Original Design Manufacturer (ODM), is the way intellectual property (IP) is treated. [...] In the DMS model, IP comes from three basic sources. These include (a) IP previously owned and contributed by the customer, (b) IP previously owned {{and contributed to the}} product by the DMS and (c) new or original IP created at the request of and paid by the customer. The latter (c) is commonly referred to as [...] "work for hire". With DMS, the customer ultimately has rights to all of the IP embodied in the product. This is especially important in industries like medical devices where customer owned IP is critical. [...] Some <b>contract</b> <b>product</b> development models, including Original Design Manufacturing (ODM), allow the developer, instead of the customer, to retain IP rights.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a simple model to {{demonstrate}} how a trade-off between incomplete contract distortions and excessive governance costs determine an agricultural firm's organizational choices. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, it is argued that the perishable nature of products exaggerates the incomplete contract distortion, such that products with a short biological production cycle (e. g. eggs) are likely to be operated under vertical integration, products with a medium cycle (e. g. poultry) are likely to be operated under <b>product</b> <b>contracts,</b> and <b>products</b> with a long cycle (e. g. pork) are likely to be operated under marketing contracts. Findings – This model helps explain why vertical integration dominates the US egg industry, why <b>product</b> <b>contracts</b> are prevalent in the turkey industry, and why marketing contracts have become common in the pork industry. The implications from this model are also applicable to other sectors and other countries, including China's agricultural sectors. Originality/value – This paper illustrates that perishable products are more vulnerable to opportunism, because the incomplete contract distortion is exaggerated by the perishable nature of the products. However, a local government can reshape firms' choices of vertical coordination by improving its legal infrastructure to reduce the incomplete contract distortions and then weaken the role of the perishable nature of <b>products,</b> so that <b>contracting</b> (<b>product</b> or marketing) may take place. Note that agricultural producers benefit more in selling their <b>products</b> through product/marketing <b>contracts</b> than spot markets.

40|$|Abstract. Designers and {{managers}} of new investments in engineering systems {{look for ways}} to add value to their programs. One fundamental {{way to do this is}} by taking advantage of uncertainty. Although uncertainty is usually seen as negative in most investment projects, it can also increase performance if flexibility is incorporated into the system to capture upside opportunities, and reduce losses in case of downside events. This paper introduces a design methodology that adds value to engineering systems by considering flexibility at an early conceptual stage. It provides screening tools to find areas where flexibility can be incorporated at the engineering, operational, and management decision levels. In engineering and operations, technical modifications need to be done within the system to acquire the flexibility exercisable by managers. One example is the ability to expand or <b>contract</b> <b>product</b> output as demand fluctuates.

40|$|In {{a common}} {{commercial}} pattern, the seller {{of a standard}} product contracts with one buyer and then sells to another at the contract price after the initial buyer breaches. Sellers argue, and courts largely agree, that the seller could have served the contract buyer {{as well as the}} later buyer; hence, the seller is entitled to retain a down payment to the extent of, or sue to recover, the profit – price less cost – that it would have realized on the initial sale had that sale been completed. Some courts and many scholars disagree, arguing that resale of the <b>contract</b> <b>product</b> at the contract price is fully compensatory; consequently, the seller is not entitled to damages. In this paper, we show that sellers in these “lost volume” contexts may use non-refundable down payments and later transaction prices in an attempt to practice second degree price discrimination. Sellers select among combinations of low down payment and high transaction price – which maximize the number of contracts as these serve low-value buyers, who are relatively unlikely to trade and pay the transaction price but who would be deterred by a significant down payment – and combinations of high down payment and low transaction price – which maximize the likelihood of transaction given a contract and serve high value buyers, who are relatively undeterred by a high down payment as they expect to benefit from increased trade at the low transaction price. These disparate preferences sometimes enable sellers to induce separation among the buyers by offering contracts that differ in their down payment/transaction price combinations. As a positive matter, we identify a form of price discrimination that does not require the seller to vary either the quantity or the quality of goods sold to an individual buyer. As a normative matter, we argue that a rule enforcing price discrimination contracts – i. e., restricting sellers to retention only of the down payment – is preferable to any mandatory rule on the treatment of liquidated damages {{as well as to the}} current majority default rule, which permits sellers to recover lost profits when they exceed the down payment, or the current minority default rule, which permits sellers to recover nothing...|$|E

Empirically, start-ups receive funding from both complementary and competitive CVC parents. However, start-up insiders commonly limit {{the influence of}} competitive CVCs, awarding them lower board power, while retaining higher board representation for themselves. Second, lead CVCs receive lower board representation, indicating heightened concerns about their greater influence in start-ups' early stages. Finally, start-ups extract higher valuations from competitive CVCs, reflecting greater moral hazard problems. Overall, CVC strategic objectives affect their early inclusion in VC syndicates, their control rights and share pricing.

We also address multilinear systems which do not fit the framework in the least-squares sense, that is, when the tensor has an odd number of modes or when the tensor has distinct dimensions in each modes. With the notion of tensor inversion, multilinear systems are solvable.
