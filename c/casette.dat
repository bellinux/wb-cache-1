Bu ürünün dekrepitasyon ve eleme işlemleri ile B 2 O 3 tenörü % 33, 08 ’den % 58, 40 ’a çıkarılmıştır. Elde edilen tozun karakteristik özellikleri belirlenerek, yapısal seramiklerden Al 2 O 3 ’ün bünyesine katılabilir hale getirilmiştir. Bunun için toz karakterizasyonu işlemlerinden partikül boyutu ölçümü ve dağılımı, piknometre yoğunluğu, Arnold görünür yoğunluğu, doldurma yoğunluğu ve dekrepitasyon öncesi ve sonrası için kimyasal analiz deneyleri yapılarak sonuçlar değerlendirilmiştir. Daha sonra elde ettiğimiz zenginleştirilmiş kolemanit tozu % 1 - 3 - 5 oranlarında ticari Alcoa™ alüminasına katılmıştır. PVA ile peletlenen karışımlardan kuru presleme ile 175 MPa’da ham numuneler elde edilmiştir. Bu ham numunelerin yoğunlukları ölçülmüştür.   Preslenen numuneler 1350 C, 1450 C ve 1550 C’de aynı sürede sinterlenmiştir. Sinterlenmiş numunelerin karakterizasyonunda SEM taramalı elektron mikroskobu ile mikroyapı incelenmiştir. Bunun yanında su emme değerlerine, arşimed yoğunluklarına, XRD faz analizlerine ve mikro sertlik değerlerine bakılmıştır.   Yapılan bu toz karakterizasyon ve sinterlenmiş numunelerin karakterizasyonu işlemleriyle elde edilen sonuçlar irdelenmiştir. Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap washers, pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering <b>casettes,</b>  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.

It {{is based on the}} conventional slow-freezing method with 10 % DMSO and modified mainly in a thawing protocol without specific equipment or reagents. Recovery rate of the cells cryopreserved by this method was equally high, which is comparable to that of the cells frozen by the vitrification method. In the case of vitrification method, it requires practiced hand because cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process and strict maintenance of low temperature is required throughout the cryopreservation. On the contrary, our method is available for novices and cryopreserved cells can maintain cell recovery rate for one week after transfer from - 150 °C to - 80 °C condition. This simple modified method would gain widespread acceptance. ### Introduction Human embryonic stem (hES) cells 1 and human induced pluripotent (hiPS) cells 2, 3 have great potential as a possible source of cells for the regenerative medical transplantation of various tissues and also for other research applications, such as developmental biology, toxicology, and drug discovery. Today, a number of hES and hiPS cell lines have been established around the world. To promote these great potential researches using hES and hiPS cell lines, the prerequisite is the foundation of cell banks of well-characterized and safety-tested cells for research which serve as seed stocks for therapeutic applications. Currently, several cell banks are distributing such cell lines all over the world. The International Stem Cell Banking Initiative has developed a consensus on the principles of best practice for the banking, testing, and distribution of hES cells 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. During cell banking, although most of the procedures share many of the principles of routine cell culture, a number of significant steps exist in the case of hES and hiPS cells. One of them is cryopreservation 9. Both hES and hiPS cells have been well-known {{to be sensitive to the}} cryopreservation 9, 10, 11. Two cryopreservation methods are commonly used for hES and hiPS cells which are vitrification 12, 13, 14, 15 and slow freezing 16, 17, 18, 19. At this moment, vitrification method is considered to be preferable for the local storage because of the high survival rate 12, 15, 16, 20. However, vitrified cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process without practiced hand compared to slow-frozen cells. Furthermore, if the low temperature is not strictly maintained, cell viability decreases rapidly. Therefore, when vitrified cells are transported, it needs liquid nitrogen dry-shippers with careful documentation for the regulatory requirements and transports companies with technical expertise to undertake such shipments, resulting in the high costs involved. As for slow-freezing method with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), although it has been long trusted as a stable cryopreservation for a wide variety of cells including mouse ES cells, it produces low levels of recovery or spontaneously differentiation for hES and hiPS cells. Until now, several approaches have been investigated for the improvement of cryopreservation for hES and hiPS cells such as the technique based on stabilizing hES colonies adherent to or embedded in a Matrigel matrix 17, and the protocol using of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor 21, 22. Considering clinical application of hES and hiPS cells, xeno-free defined freezing medium should be required. An effective serum- and xeno-free chemically defined freezing procedure was reported by Hovatta’s group 23. Another group has proposed in situ cryopreservation using gas permeable culture <b>casettes</b> 24. However, there is not any evidence that the cells can stably preserve their phenotypes for more than 10 years, excluding the conventional cryopreservation of the cells with DMSO. Thus, it is suggested that although these new methods would be worth to be challenged, the conventional cryopreservation should be backed up as a precaution. We here show that a simple modification of the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation with 10 % DMSO increased cell viability after thawing. This method requires neither specific equipment nor reagents and only the thawing way is changed, but resulting cells have comparable growth ability to those of vitrified cells. Even when using defined medium, such as our growth factor defined medium hESF 925, 26, 27, 28, or Thomson’s mTeSR medium 29, this method could work well. Because the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation is quite familiar, this simple method would gain widespread acceptance. ### Materials Critical: All reagents and materials used must be sterile. 1.

50|$|As {{the town}} grew {{in size and}} {{citizens}} prospered, the town that was locally known as <b>Casette</b> was renamed San Ferdinando {{in honor of the}} King, who sponsored the development of the area. While archival records document houses being built since 1823, the first record of rents paid for farm houses was in 1840 and a contract dating back to 1842 recording the lease of houses by Don Paolo DeLauretis (heir to Nunziante) for a period of two years to the Pantano, Loiacono, and others of the original families of San Ferdinando. The base fee was 4 ducats, with 6 ducats for those with individual rooms. In addition to the fees, the tenants were obliged to deforest and improve their property.|$|E

Kouichi unpacks and notices the <b>casette</b> player he left in his bag and Mizuno, who is in the same room as him, notices it as well. Night begins to fall and the students went to cafeteria for dinner. Kouichi and Mei were eating alone due to the other students avoiding them, especially Izumi and Sakurako, but only Teshigawara and Kazamyo decided to sit with them, since they are no longer non-existing students and even complemented Mei for her bravery in becoming the non-existing student. Izumi stares contemptly at her and walks up to Mei blaming her for everything that has happened, demanding an apology for the class. Kouichi defends her from the accusations, but Mei decides to apologize for what happened.|$|E

She then hangs up and removes her eyepatch and looks around, when Reiko suddenly appeared. As she looks at her, she seems a bit concerned after Reiko tells her that the lights are about to turn off. In Kouichi's room, they decide to tell the others about the <b>casette</b> tape, but it is missing and Teshigawara storms in and tells them that they listened to the tape leading Teshigawara to suspect Mochizuki as the dead one and tried to kill him. They start running to Mochizuki, but Kouichi slows down due to his heart condition and someone calls out his name.|$|E
50|$|Initially Via Aurelia, {{which was}} used from the Middle Ages until the Napoleonic era, avoided the sea, passing along Via Antica Romana di Quarto, over Ponte Vecchio di Sturla (a medieval bridge with two arches) and along the streets of <b>Casette,</b> Pontetti and Vernazza. With the road {{revolution}} in the nineteenth-century a main road opened up between Genoa, Albaro and Sturla. It was a continuation towards Genoa of the new coastal Via Aurelia, which in 1808 had reached Nervi from Levante. The new road, perpendicular to the ancient creuze (little streets that lead down toward the sea), {{put an end to}} the isolation of the city from Levante, reaching Piazza Sturla, heading towards San Martino and then on to Genoa. In the twentieth century more roads were built, starting from Piazza Sturla, that more directly linked Sturla to the centre of Genoa.|$|E

Kouichi slips back a bit causing his cellphone fall under a bookshelf, as kneels to retrieve it he discovers something taped to bottom of the shelf. The item appears to what the man was looking for which was a <b>casette</b> tape. The two play tape {{and listened to the}} message that was left and had tracked down the man who recorded the message. The man's name is Katsumi Matsunaga and he had murdered another student at the age of 13 during a fight, but after which had stopped the phenomenon at that time as no one remembers the student. He then tells the two that he remembers murdering someone and being terrified on the feeling of killing which caused him cut off three of his own fingers as desperate attempt to forget, but was unable to.|$|E
50|$|After dinner, Kouichi and Mei share a brief bonding {{conversation}} and he notices her cellphone. She {{was forced to}} take it and actually dislikes cellphones, but he tries assure her that having cellphone makes a person feel safe and even asks for number. As the two exchange numbers, Mizuno watches and decides to find what is Kouichi hiding {{from the rest of}} class. He and Teshigawara find the <b>casette</b> player in Kouichi's bag and listens to the message. He then passes on the message to Teshigawara and Kazamyo, greatly confusing them and Mochizuki ran to them until a few logs fell between them, causing Teshigawara to suspect Mochizuki. Kazamyo went to pass on the information to Izumi and Sakurako, causing them to question the very idea of killing someone. Sakurako is against the idea of killing, but Izumi plans to kill the students she deems as suspects. After they enter a room and locked the door, the lights suddenly broke out scaring them, however, Izumi begins to suspect Sakurako as the dead one.|$|E

This graduate project {{is concerned with}} physically disabled children and their need to experience childhood games. It is the proposal of this Master???s candidate to develop an adapted musical game tape and manual {{which could be used}} by special education teachers, public school teachers, and therapeutic recreators in a mainstreaming situation. The manual is a compilation of childrens musical activities specifically designed for the physically disabled. The activities have been divided into three domains of development: affective, cognitive and psycho-motor. There are ten activities on the thirty minute <b>casette</b> tape and in the manual which includes traditional childhood games, dancing, drama, verbal and arithmetic games and creative games. The activities are directed to and designed for wheelchair-bound children at the primary level, kindergarten through third grade. The <b>casette</b> tape and manual were field tested at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital and Lowman Elementary School with children that met the above requirements. The field testing showed that the activities were appropriate, useful and enjoyable for teachers and students...|$|E

The template used is a hybrid plasmid containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae CYC 1 promoter linked to a synthetic 377 -bp G-minus <b>casette</b> (1). In vitro transcriptions are {{carried out in the}} presence of RNase. T 1. Under these conditions only the transcripts that are resistant to RNase T 1 accumulate. Using this protocol, {{it has been shown that}} in the absence of cytosolic factors RNA polymerase II (pol II) from C. utilis initiated RNA synthesis randomly.

40|$|Human lipocortin-I {{was very}} {{efficiently}} produced as a secretory product by Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbouring an optimized expression <b>casette</b> containing the GAL 10 promoter, inulinase signal sequence and the lipocortin-I terminator. To overproduce lipocortin-I, a fed-batch fermentation was performed. The feed medium contained only glucose as sole carbon source and was first fed for cell growth. A mixture of glucose and galactose was then fed for gene induction {{in parallel with}} cell growth. During the gene induction period, {{a significant amount of}} lipocortin-I accumulated in the culture medium. However, about 45 % of the secreted lipocortin-I existed in a proteolytically-cleaved form, cleaved after the basic amino acid Lys 26. At the end of the culture, the concentration of total extracellular lipocortin-I (intact form + cleaved form) was about 2. 1 g/l, accounting for more than 80 % of the total extracellular protein. ope...|$|E
