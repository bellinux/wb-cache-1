5|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, 8 October 2008, the <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of Iceland {{abandoned}} its attempt to peg the Icelandic króna at 131 krónur to the euro after trying to set this peg on 6 October. By 9 October, the Icelandic króna was trading at 340 to the euro when trading in the currency collapsed due to the FME's takeover of the last major Icelandic bank, and thus the loss of all króna trade 'clearing houses'. The next day, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland. From 9 October to 5 November, the European <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> quoted a reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the monetary}} policy operations of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We distinguish the pattern of {{monetary policy operations}} of the liquidity providing <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> of the large industrialized countries (creditor <b>central</b> <b>banks)</b> and the liquidity absorb-ing <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> of emerging market economies (debtor <b>central</b> <b>banks).</b> Many debtor <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> provide liquidity through foreign exchange intervention in reaction to foreign exchange inflows. If the respective liquidity expansion {{is regarded as a}} threat to domestic price and financial stability, liquidity is partly absorbed through sterilization operations. The paper finds that most MENA coun-tries are debtor <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> due to a general pattern of excessive liquidity creation as well as due to country specific reasons. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Não informadoThis thesis {{inquires}} the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and {{the relations}} of them wi th government and private banks when the independence question comes into view. In this context, the thesis presents an intitutional analisys about <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> {{as well as it}} shows the logic of historical evolution of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and the importance of them for regulating the financial and monetary instabilities in the capitalist economy. The thesis is divided in five chapters: first of all, there is an introdution; in chapters two, tree and four it presents the historical origins of <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> the evolution of their functions and {{the relations of}} them with government and private banks; the last one presents the principal conclusions. The historical analisys of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> concludes that they are important institutions to the economic system. Why? Because they result from a process that shows the relation between the evolution of payments system and the public action. Due to this, the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> are singular institutions: at the same time, they are part of State structure and of the private credit system. How do the relations between the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and the private banks apear? The answer comes into view when an important function of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> is analysed, that is to say, the "lender of last resort" function. The performance of this function creates a basic trade-off to the central banks: the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> condition of "lender of last resort" conducts the private banks to a situation which they can have more risk positions. The classics denominated this trade-off as "moral azard". By the way the "moral azard" defines the characteristic private banks of the relations between <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and On the other hand, the ambivalence of the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and the relations of them with the private banks determine a specific connection between the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and government: the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> can not be totally independent as well as they can not be completly dependent from government. Finally, the idea of interdependence defines the characteristics of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> as well as it shows the relations of them with government and private banks. Why? Because the concept of interdependence brings the contradiction and the ambivalence that are part of these relations. On the other hand, the notion of interdependence explains the variability and the evolution of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> norms as well as it shows the permanent conflict between the lagal rule of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and their specific action...|$|R

40|$|Part Four of the Changing Politics of <b>Central</b> <b>Banking</b> SeriesCentral banks {{around the}} world emerged from the {{financial}} crisis in a curious situation.
