40|$|The {{introduction}} of composite materials {{is having a}} profound effect on the design process. Because these materials permit the designer to tailor material properties to improve structural, aerodynamic and acoustic performance, they require a more integrated multidisciplinary design process. Because of the complexity of the design process numerical optimization methods are required. The present paper is focused on a major difficulty associated with the multidisciplinary design optimization process - its enormous computational cost. We consider two approaches for reducing this computational burden: (1) development of efficient methods for cross-sensitivity calculation using perturbation methods; and (2) the use of approximate numerical optimization procedures. Our efforts are concentrated upon combined aerodynamic-structural optimization. Results are presented for the <b>integrated</b> design <b>of</b> a sailplane wing. The impact of our computational procedures on the computational <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> designs are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The analogy [...] "curb-cut" [...] {{has been}} used by advocates of {{universal}} usability to explain how ICT products designed for disabled users can be beneficial to all users. Sidewalk curb-cuts are added to accommodate wheelchair users, but the benefits extend to baby carriage pushers, delivery service workers, bicyclists, and travelers with roller bags. In the context of ICT design and development, universal usability is often tied to meeting the needs of people with disabilities. The adaptability needed for users with physical, visual, auditory, or cognitive disabilities is likely to benefit users with differing preferences, tasks, hardware, etc. Hence, electronic curb-cuts - system functions that are designed for people with disabilities - may be usable by everyone in various usage situations. It might be expensive to transform an existing system to meet universal usability standards, but the extra <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> electronic curb-cuts into a new system can be minimalized.|$|E

5000|$|While other prior Game Boy titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening use {{a battery}} save inside their cartridges, Monster Max employs a {{password}} system {{to prevent the}} loss of progress. This choice was made because the additional <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> a battery save was either prohibitive or expensive for the publisher. Ritman also revealed that he passed on the earlier option of having the game published by Nintendo, which would have required replacing the protagonist with an unspecified character from the Mario universe. Although Monster Max was ostensibly released in late 1994, Titus was very slow in destributing it and copies of the game could not be bought until December 1995. As a result, sales for the game were poor. Despite this, it received extremely positive reviews. UK's GB Action magazine gave Monster Max a rating of 94%, while Super Gamer magazine awarded it a rating of 96% under the tagline, [...] "simply the best Game Boy title ever".|$|E

The proposed mathematical model is used to analyze the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>integrated</b> model before the genetic algorithms (GA) approach is carried out in order to calculate the optimal values of four variables (n, h, L, k) that minimize the hourly cost. Subsequently, they are subjects to the nonparametric linear regression test in order to confirm the optimal values of four variables. A comparison between four policies <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> model KS and other models indicates that the integrated KS model has a better economic behavior when it is distribution-free. Finally, the performance or average run length (ARL) obtained from the KS model is greater than that of the general model...|$|R

In addition to a cost reduction, the associated radiation exposure is significantly less and, importantly, the use of a low dose unenhanced CT does not significantly alter the diagnostic accuracy <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> PET-CT for lesion detection/characterisation or staging compared with a contrast-enhanced CT component [35].|$|R

30|$|To {{estimate}} additional {{total cost}} and average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> the demand-based reproductive health commodity model into the existing Government and NGO facilities in Bangladesh. Activity based cost {{analysis was conducted}} during 2006 – 2008 in two low performing rural sub-districts (Nabigong and Raipur sub-district) and one urban slum area in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Activity-based cost data were collected using ingredient approach, which comprised of listing all types of inputs by activity, quantities and prices for each input. Total cost was presented according to capital and recurrent items. The supply side perspective was considered for entire analysis. The total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> demand-based reproductive health commodity (DBRHC) model into the Government and NGO service delivery system was estimated to BDT 18, 667, 634 (US$ 274, 524).

The average cost per beneficiaries was BDT 230 (US$ 3.38) only for introducing this model into the existing health system. The built-in interventions of DBRHC model were doable at low-cost at the selected Government and NGO settings at the grass-root level. The model has potential of further cost containment during scaling up—if the intervention costs are adjusted with the existing functionaries of the Government and NGOs.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the common}} {{characteristics}} of Silicon MEMS actuators is that they operate in open-loop, due to difficulties and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrating</b> sensors at small scales.

In this paper we propose to use input-shaping techniques, along with an identified reduced-order model to generate suitable input profiles for MEMS actuators. This systematic approach is a major improvement over the current Finite Element/Design of Experiments practices in the MEMS community...|$|E
