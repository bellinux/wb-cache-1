40|$|Essays in {{commemoration}} of the seventieth birthday of Professor Osanai SatoruModern constitutional law has developed various means of supervising and guaranteeing the effective implementation of the constitution. The principal means of judicial control of constitutionality is judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament, or <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review. This has become a dominant feature of modern constitutionalism, and recent decades have seen a global expansion of such judicial review mechanisms. This article considers the phenomenon and institution of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review from historical and comparative perspectives. The different models, structures and forms of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review are discussed {{with reference to the}} historical contexts in which they have evolved, their modes of operation and their underlying rationales. The possible tension between <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review and democracy is also considered. preprin...|$|R
40|$|American jurists {{traditionally}} {{have assumed that}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review (the power of courts to overturn legislation or require compensation for expropriation) of government regulatory law and practice is strictly necessary to protect private property rights. Recently, however, a few legal scholars and economists have challenged that point of view. Evidence from the US and the UK suggests that political institutions not only regulate or expropriate private property rights but also protect those rights, {{even in the absence}} of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review. In other words, <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review may not enhance social welfare. Indeed, since the process itself entails costs, it is not immediately clear that the benefits of the process exceed its costs. This article proposes that <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review should be subject to a social welfare analysis to determine when and if such review is efficient in enhancing social welfare. A model is proposed in which property rights protection is a component of social costs. Judicial review is then assumed on net either add to, or subtract from, those costs, affecting social welfare generally. It will be shown that under realistic conditions, reflected in real instances, that judicial review might not enhance economic efficiency or overall social welfare. We show that the efficiency of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review is likely to vary within the larger institutional context...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in support of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review {{points to the need}} to curtail the legal and political power of majority rule instantiated by democratic legislative institutions. This article aims to challenge the counter majoritarian argument for judicial review by showing that there is very little difference, at least morally speaking, between the current structure of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review in the US, and a system that would impose limits on majoritarian decisions procedures by an entirely randomized mechanism. The argument is based on a hypothetical model of a randomized system of judicial review, and proceeds to show that between the actual practices of judicial review in the US, and the hypothetical randomized model, there is not much to recommend the former. The current system of <b>constitutional</b> <b>judicial</b> review is fraught with many arbitrary elements, to an extent that makes the system only marginally better, if at all, compared with an overtly and blatantly randomized system...|$|R
