40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} the {{effectiveness}} of multipath transfer of <b>request</b> <b>copies</b> through the network and their redundant service {{without the use of}} laborious analytical modeling. The model and support tools for the design of highly reliable distributed systems based on simulation modeling have been created. Method. The effectiveness of many variants of service organization and delivery through the network to the query servers is formed and analyzed. Options for providing redundant service and delivery via the network to the servers of <b>request</b> <b>copies</b> are also considered. The choice of variants for the distribution and service of requests is carried out taking into account the criticality of queries to the time of their stay in the system. The request is considered successful if at least one of its copies is accurately delivered to the working server, ready to service the request received through a network, if it is fulfilled in the set time. Efficiency analysis of the redundant transmission and service of requests is based on the model built in AnyLogic 7 simulation environment. Main Results. Simulation experiments based on the proposed models have shown the effectiveness of redundant transmission of copies of queries (packets) to the servers in the cluster through multiple paths with redundant service of <b>request</b> <b>copies</b> by a group of servers in the cluster. It is shown that this solution allows increasing the probability of exact execution of at least one <b>copy</b> of the <b>request</b> within the required time. We have carried out efficiency evaluation of destruction of outdated <b>request</b> <b>copies</b> in the queues of network nodes and the cluster. We have analyzed options for network implementation of multipath transfer of <b>request</b> <b>copies</b> to the servers in the cluster over disjoint paths, possibly different according to the number of their constituent nodes. Practical Relevance. The proposed simulation models can be used when selecting the optimal design solutions for the redundant transmission and maintenance of requests time-critical for stay in information and communication system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As for {{the problem}} of how to carry out task {{scheduling}} and data replication effectively in the grid and to reduce task’s execution time, this thesis proposes the task scheduling algorithm and the optimum dynamic data replication algorithm and builds a scheme to effectively combine these two algorithms. First of all, the scheme adopts the ISS algorithm considering the number of tasks waiting queue, the location of task demand data and calculation capacity of site by adopting the method of network structure’s hierarchical scheduling to calculate the cost of comprehensive task with the proper weight efficiency and search out the best compute node area. And then the algorithm of ODHRA is adopted to analyze the data transmission time, memory access latency, waiting <b>copy</b> <b>requests</b> in the queue and the distance between nodes, choose out the best replications location in many copies combined with copy placement and copy management to reduce the file access time. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme compared with other algorithm has better performance in terms of average task execution time...|$|R
