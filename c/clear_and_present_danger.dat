5000|$|Within the {{discipline}} of Ethnoecology, {{there is a clear}} emphasis on those societies that are deemed “indigenous,” “traditional,” or “savage,” a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century.

[...] Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a “static, timeless, and hermetically sealed” notion. [...] Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a post-industrial society, such as that of the United States.|$|R

40|$|Despite their alleged uselessness, we {{frequently}} encounter {{instances of}} counterfactual thinking in everyday-life situations. During {{the last two}} decades, psychologists have examined this phenomenon and {{have been able to}} show that counterfactual thoughts about past (and, therefore, unchangeable) events can be useful for the thinker. This article retraces the effects of counterfactual thinking in everyday life and seeks to translate them into an academic context. Can counterfactuals produce similar analytical benefits in the sciences? And if so, what exactly are those benefits? After briefly examining the psychological aspects of counterfactual thinking, the article discusses its potential uses from a general scientific perspective before using counterfactual history as a concrete example. Eventually and for good measure, attention is drawn to the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> <b>dangers</b> associated with counterfactual thinking in an academic context...|$|R
40|$|The Web {{has been}} {{perhaps the most}} {{outstanding}} innovation {{in the field of}} communication in the history of mankind. There are different kinds of applications like Social Networking Sites, Communication, Entertainment, Job Searches, Online or e-Shopping provided by the Internet. With the usage of these applications Network Security must be there to access the information safely. Network security includes elements that prevent unwanted activities while supporting desirable activities. Efficient network security provides quick and easy access to resources for users. Hackers, viruses, vindictive employees and even human error all represent <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> <b>dangers</b> to network. Threats, both internal and external, can cause a catastrophic system failure or compromise. And all computers users from the most casual Internet surfers to large enterprises could be affected by network security breaches. Network security must support workers in doing their jobs white protecting against compromise, maintaining high performance and keeping costs to a minimum. This paper provides you an overview of the most common network security threats. The paper will help the readers to understand of network attacks and current scenario of network attacks. ...|$|R

This realization became more apparent to me at a recent Earth Day chapel in which the seminary community thanked God for giving us the earth, lamented our abuse of that gift and asked God to help us {{take better care of}} it now and into the future. As we worshipped, I was struck by the irony of praising God with the birds, squirrels and other animals only minutes before many of us would make animals part of our midday meal. Realizing the detachment between our words and deeds, my mind filled with questions. What does it mean to “care for creation ” when our eating habits devalue the lives of some of God’s creatures? How do we decide which parts of creation to preserve (humans, coral reefs, dogs, rainforests and spotted owls) and which to exterminate (cattle, wetlands, chicken...|$|R

40|$|Our {{society and}} its {{citizens}} depend on the undisturbed functioning of (critical) infrastructures and their services. Crucial processes in most critical infrastructures, and in many other organisations, rely on the correct and undisturbed functioning of Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

Therefore, the cyber security and resilience of ICS is of utmost importance to society as a whole, to utilities and other critical infrastructure operators, and to organisations which use ICS.

25|$|The Court {{proceeded}} {{to reject the}} <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> <b>danger</b> test for the following reasons. To begin with, the test {{is linked to the}} United States' unique culture and constitutional position on freedom of speech, which does not represent the position in most Commonwealth jurisdictions and Singapore. In particular, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution {{is quite different from the}} corresponding provisions in the respective constitutions of Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Court cautioned that the United States approach should not be followed as it could result in possible abuse and negation of the right itself. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the real risk test is already a weighty test which pays the correct attention to the balance between the right to freedom of speech and the possibility of its abuse.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{extremism}} and blindness of the Li Lisan line, the CCP suffered great losses. The Comintern sent Qu Qiubai and Zhou Enlai back to China to enforce its policies. The 28 Bolsheviks sent back by their mentors to take charge of the Chinese revolution took advantage of this opportunity to denounce Li. Xiang and Li still didn’t realize the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> <b>danger</b> and criticized these young, immature students heavily. Then the Comintern sent a telegram recalling Li to Moscow to account for his policies. Pavel Mif went to Shanghai as an envoy of the Comintern too. Under Mif’s direction, the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of the CCP was held, Li was replaced by Mif’s protégé Wang Ming, and his associates Bolsheviks took other important jobs. Although Xiang sought to tender his resignation, the Comintern and senior leaders of the CCP, such as Qu and Zhou, thought Xiang’s symbolic value as a worker among the CCP leadership might still be helpful to the revolution, so they blocked his resignation.|$|E
25|$|A foreign {{intelligence}} service, {{similar to the}} Central Intelligence Agency of the United States and MI6 of the United Kingdom, has never been established in Canada. However, {{through a number of}} agencies and through its Foreign Affairs postings, it has provided considerable political and economic intelligence to Ottawa decision makers. Whether most Canadians recognize it or not, this has very much blurred the boundaries as to what is required before a {{foreign intelligence}} service (FIS) is said to exist. For better or for worse, the debate on this topic has not received as much attention in Canada as it has around the world. Thinking has been that, {{due to the lack of}} <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> <b>danger</b> to Canada, the high cost and political risk involved, such an agency is not a necessity. However, supporters of a dedicated Canadian agency noted that Canada could not rely on its interests coinciding with those of the UK and USA which supplied its intelligence, in contrast to the Cold War period when they shared a common enemy. A dedicated agency might also boost Canada's international standing and increase its global influence.|$|E
