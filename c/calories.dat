40|$|This article {{examines}} the long-run relationship between per capita <b>calorie</b> intake, per capita income, and food prices using aggregate data for India, 1961 – 1992. Cointegration analysis yields an income elasticity of <b>calorie</b> intake of 0. 34, while the food-price elasticity is insignificant. Thus, economic growth in India, as measured by increasing per capita income, has significantly improved <b>calorie</b> intake; future income growth can alleviate further inadequate nutrition. However, significant improvements in <b>calorie</b> intake cannot be made directly by food subsidies. A further result is that <b>calorie</b> intake is Granger-caused by income and not vice versa: income generation is unconstrained by <b>calorie</b> intake.

5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into <b>calories</b> (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those <b>calories</b> came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|Background Obesity {{was known}} to be caused by {{imbalance}} in energy in food consumption and energy output in daily activities. It has become a public health epidemic all over the world. Obesity associated diseases has brought large burden on the healthcare systems. Morbidity and mortality related to obesity are increasing. Overconsumption of <b>calorie</b> from away-home-food has a large contribution to the epidemic. Dining out frequently is associated with overconsumption of <b>calorie</b> in food selected and intake, in which its popularity is on the rise. <b>Calorie</b> labeling on restaurant menus has got mixed evidence on reducing <b>calorie</b> in food selection and consumption. This paper aims to review and synthesize relevant evidence among randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of energy labeling in restaurant menu and total energy in food purchase and consumption so that possible causal relationship could be inferred and implications on future researches and policies could be provided. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane Library to locate relevant articles in English that examined the effectiveness of <b>calorie</b> labeling on energy reduction in food selection and consumption from 1966 to 30 June 2014. Results Twelve RCTs were included, with most of them (nine studies) conducted in the US. Overall, all the studies evaluated the effectiveness of <b>calorie</b> labeling on energy in food selection, 4 RCTs involved evaluated the effectiveness of <b>calorie</b> labeling on energy in food consumption. Studies were categorized into groups of real, laboratory and simulated settings for comparisons. In total, eight out of twelve RCTs revealed a significant <b>calorie</b> reduction in food selection with energy labeling, with proportional <b>calorie</b> reduction ranging from 8. 3 % to 36. 7 %. While in evaluating the effectiveness of <b>calorie</b> labeling on food consumption, three out of the four RCTs showed a significant <b>calorie</b> reduction in the intervention group, with proportional energy reduction ranging from 6. 2 % to 11. 4 %. One RCT showed a significant increase in <b>calorie</b> consumption after the study meal. Six of the 12 studies had recruited normal weight participants, and they found mixed results in <b>calorie</b> reduction of food selection with energy labeling, while 4 RCTs recruited averagely overweight participants and found significant <b>calorie</b> reduction in food selection. This difference in effectiveness of <b>calorie</b> labeling among various weight status of participants suggested that this policy would be more effective in secondary prevention of obesity rather than primary prevention. There was more evidence showing that <b>calorie</b> labeling is effective on reducing <b>calorie</b> in food selection in consumption in this systematic review among studies reviewing <b>calorie</b> reduction in food selection and consumption at a short period of time. Conclusions Mandating <b>calorie</b> labeling on restaurant menus could possibly reduce the energy in food selection and consumption. A minimal reduction in <b>calorie</b> in food selection and consumption might possibly bring a large population benefit. However, more scientifically rigorous researches were called for a longer exposure period of time to evaluate its sustainability in altering people's eating behaviour. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that estimations of the <b>calorie</b> content of an {{unhealthy}} main meal food tend to be lower when the food is shown alongside a healthy item (e. g. fruit or vegetables) than when shown alone. This effect has been called the negative <b>calorie</b> illusion and has been attributed to averaging the unhealthy (vice) and healthy (virtue) foods leading to increased perceived healthiness and reduced <b>calorie</b> estimates. The current study aimed to replicate and extend these findings to test the hypothesized mediating effect of ratings of healthiness of foods on <b>calorie</b> estimates. In three online studies, participants were invited to make <b>calorie</b> estimates of combinations of foods. Healthiness ratings of the food were also assessed. The first two studies failed to replicate the negative <b>calorie</b> illusion. In a final study, the use of a reference food, closely following a procedure from a previously published study, did elicit a negative <b>calorie</b> illusion. No evidence was found for a mediating role of healthiness estimates. The negative <b>calorie</b> illusion appears to be a function of the contrast between a food being judged and a reference, supporting the hypothesis that the negative <b>calorie</b> illusion arises from the use of a reference-dependent anchoring and adjustment heuristic and not from an 'averaging' effect, as initially proposed. This finding is consistent with existing data on sequential <b>calorie</b> estimates, and highlights a significant impact of the order in which foods are viewed on how foods are evaluated...|$|R
