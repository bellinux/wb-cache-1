40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is {{cultivated}} {{as a major}} food {{resource in}} some countries that have moderate climate. Manual sorting is labor intensive. Furthermore in mechanical sorting the <b>crop</b> <b>damages</b> is high, for this reason we must operate {{a system in which}} the <b>crop</b> <b>damages</b> would be diminished. For sorting of potatoes fast, accurate and less labor intensive modern techniques such as Machine vision is created. Machine vision system is one of the modern sorting techniques. The basis of this method is imaging of samples, analysis of the images, comparing them with a standard and finally decision making in acceptance or rejection of samples. In this research 110 numbers of potatoes from Agria variety were prepared. Samples were pre-graded based on quantitative, qualitative and total factors manually before sorting. Quantitative, qualitative and total sorting in Machine vision system was performed by improving images quality and extracting the best thresholds. The accuracy of total sorting was % 96. 823. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the case}} of the {{semi-arid}} zone of Southern Sri Lanka as an example, the paper shows that <b>crop</b> <b>damages</b> caused by grazing livestock can constitute an important obstacle to the adoption of available technologies for more sustainable land use. The paper considers <b>crop</b> <b>damages</b> as an externality problem and shows that the classical solutions to externalities - the neo-liberal, the interventionist solution and the communitarian solution - cannot be applied in the Sri Lankan case due to market failure, government failure and "community failure. " The paper discusses collective action and bargaining between organized interest groups as an alternative solution and analyses the conditions which make such a solution work. The paper concludes that - in the Sri Lankan case - a decentralized system of government, a preferential voting system creating incentives for politicians, an institutionalized negotiation platform, and the facilitating role of intermediaries favored this solution.

5|$|The outer rainbands of {{the storm}} first began {{affecting}} Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1. In Mexico, the peak 24-hour rainfall total was 4.96inches (126mm) in Huixtla, and across southeastern Mexico, the rainfall led to above normal levels in many rivers. An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero, Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h) with gusts of 53mph (85km/h) shortly after landfall. In most locations, damage from the storm was minor, limited to downed light posts, some damaged roofs, and a brief power outage. However, winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe <b>crop</b> <b>damage</b> in the mountain range of southern Chiapas. About 35sq.miles (90km²) of banana crops were destroyed, with about 4sq.miles (10km²) of coffee damaged. The passage {{of the storm}} also resulted in damage to cocoa beans, mango, coconut, and other vegetables, with <b>crop</b> <b>damage</b> totaling about 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD).

30|$|The {{inclusion}} of <b>crop</b> <b>damages</b> {{in this study}} is important because agricultural areas represent {{a large portion of the}} United States where the population density is low, and agricultural production represents an important share of the overall GDP in the United States. Thus, we believe that crop losses should be included in this analysis because they may deteriorate farming business needs and overall state income level.|$|R
