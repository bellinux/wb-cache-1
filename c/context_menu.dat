50|$|<b>Context</b> <b>menus</b> have {{received}} some criticism from usability analysts when improperly used, as some applications make certain features only available in <b>context</b> <b>menus,</b> which may confuse even experienced users (especially when the <b>context</b> <b>menus</b> {{can only be}} activated in a limited area of the application's client window).|$|R

25|$|Laptops today feature {{multitouch}} touchpads {{that can}} sense {{in some cases}} up to five fingers simultaneously, providing more options for input, {{such as the ability}} to bring up the <b>context</b> <b>menu</b> by tapping two fingers, dragging two fingers for scrolling, or gestures for zoom in/out or rotate.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} interfaces, {{two types}} of gestures are distinguished: We consider online gestures, which can also be regarded as direct manipulations like scaling and rotating. In contrast, offline gestures are usually processed after the interaction is finished; e. g. a circle is drawn to activate a <b>context</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E

Users need to be signed into Chrome to use the extension.|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer exposes {{a set of}} Component Object Model (COM) {{interfaces}} {{that allows}} add-ons to extend the functionality of the browser. Extensibility {{is divided into two}} types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding <b>context</b> <b>menu</b> entries, toolbars, menu items or Browser Helper Objects (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats. It allows Internet Explorer to handle new file formats and new protocols, e.g. WebM or SPDY. In addition, web pages can integrate widgets known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight are examples. Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.|$|E

KRDC, the remote desktop client improves support for Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory through LDAP. Kontact has gained a new planner summary and support for drag and drop in the free/busy view.

2500|$|The new Mini Toolbar {{is a small}} toolbar {{with basic}} {{formatting}} commands that appears within the document editing area, much like a <b>context</b> <b>menu.</b> When the mouse selects part of the text, Mini Toolbar appears close to selected text. It remains semi-transparent until the mouse pointer is hovered on it, to avoid obstructing what is underneath. Mini Toolbar can also be made to appear by right-clicking in the editing area or via [...] key on keyboard, in which case it appears near the cursor, above or below the traditional <b>context</b> <b>menu.</b> Mini Toolbar is not customizable in Office 2007, but can be turned off.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{they are}} called dual-pane managers, a term that is {{typically}} used for {{programs such as the}} Windows File Explorer (see below). But they have three panes including a command line pane below (or hidden behind) two symmetric panes. Furthermore, most of these programs allow using just one of the two larger panes with the second hidden. Some also add an item to the <b>Context</b> <b>Menu</b> in Windows to [...] "Open two Explorers, side by side".|$|E
2500|$|The Menu key or Application key {{is a key}} {{found on}} Windows-oriented {{computer}} keyboards. It is used to launch a <b>context</b> <b>menu</b> with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only. [...] This key was created {{at the same time}} as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).|$|E

50|$|A <b>context</b> <b>menu</b> (also called contextual, shortcut, and popup or pop-up menu) is a menu in a {{graphical}} {{user interface}} (GUI) that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click mouse operation. A <b>context</b> <b>menu</b> offers a limited set of choices that {{are available in the}} current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs. Usually the available choices are actions related to the selected object. From a technical point of view, such a <b>context</b> <b>menu</b> is a graphical control element.|$|E
