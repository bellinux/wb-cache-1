This mechanism to shed leaves is called abscission. When the leaf is shed, it leaves a leaf scar on the twig. In cold autumns, they sometimes change color, and turn yellow, bright-orange, or red, as various accessory pigments (<b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls)</b> are revealed when the tree responds to cold and reduced sunlight by curtailing chlorophyll production. Red anthocyanin pigments are now {{thought to be}} produced in the leaf as it dies, possibly to mask the yellow hue left when the chlorophyll is lost—yellow leaves appear to attract herbivores such as aphids. Optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.|$|E

A considerable increase (122 %) {{in the amount of}} total <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls</b> (antheraxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin) was also found in the seedlings subjected to ABA. The activity of the xanthophyll cycle measured by the epoxidation state of xanthophylls under high-light treatment was higher in ABA-treated plants compared with the control.

Results: Several carotenoids inhibited the multidrug resistance of cancer cells. Ascorbic acid improved the effect of certain xanthophylls, but the effect of capsanthin was not modified. Capsanthin had weak (12 %) but capsorubin (85 %) had a remarkable antiproliferative effect on A 549 lung cancer cells.

40|$|In {{highlight}} stress conditions, {{the mechanism}} of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence is triggered at the chloroplast level. This process allows thermal quenching of the excessive excitation energy and it is strictly related to {{the efficiency of the}} xanthophyll cycle. Nowadays, the utilization of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a powerful complementary way for the identification and quantitative analysis of plant metabolites either in vivo or in tissue extracts. Seeing that the oxidative damage caused by light stress in plants and the consequent involvement of pigments are widely studied, NMR spectroscopy can be utilized to compare crude leaf extract at different levels of light stress, allowing an analysis of these compounds. In this paper, the identification of possible relationships between light stress and 1 H NMR signal variations is discussed. The analysis of the 1 H NMR (1 D) spectra of two agronomic species (Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris) exposed to different light intensities is presented.

Pinot noir leaves collected from 12 locations across a 36. 69 - 49. 98 °N latitudinal gradient. Leaf morphological and biochemical parameters were analysed {{in the context}} of meteorological parameters and the latitudinal gradient. We found that leaf fresh weight and area were negatively correlated with both global and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, cumulated global radiation being a stronger correlator. Cumulative UV radiation (sumUVR) was the strongest correlator with most leaf metabolites and pigments. Leaf UV-absorbing pigments, total antioxidant capacities, and phenolic compounds increased with increasing sumUVR, whereas total <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls</b> decreased. Despite of this reallocation of metabolic resources from carotenoids to phenolics, an increase in xanthophyll-cycle pigments (the sum of the amounts of three xanthophylls: violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin) with increasing sumUVR indicates active, dynamic protection for the photosynthetic apparatus. In addition, increased amounts of flavonoids (quercetin glycosides) and constitutive β-carotene and α-tocopherol pools provide antioxidant protection against reactive oxygen species. However, rather than a continuum of plant acclimation responses, principal component analysis indicates clusters of metabolic states across the explored 1, 500 -km-long latitudinal gradient.

In this study, the contents of soluble sugars, amino acids, alkaloids, ethylene, phen-olics, tannins, flavonoids, pigments, malondialdehyde (MDA), glycerol, and fatty acids were analysed in cocoa (Theobroma cacao) shoots during the infection and development of WBD. Alterations were observed in the content of soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fruc-tose), asparagine and alkaloids (caffeine and theobrom-ine), ethylene, and tannins. Ethylene and tannins increased prior to symptom development and declined with the death of the infected tissues.

A transient UVR effect on photosynthesis under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) + UV-A and PAR + UV-A + UV-B was found, but dynamic recovery of photoinhibition was observed immediately after reduction of the photon fluence rate of PAR in the absence or presence of background UVR under laboratory and natural solar radiation, respectively.

The ultrastructure of the U. penicilliformis gametophytes showed that the cells are well adapted to UVR. No significant ultrastructural alterations were observed in filaments exposed to different spectral irradiance in the laboratory compared to in situ acclimated specimen. The antioxidant &# 945;-tocopherol was detected in minute quantity while the search for flavonoid-like compounds was negative.

Here, we investigated the consequences of altered carotenoid composition for the functional organization of photosynthetic complexes in wild-type and various mutant strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Although it is generally accepted that xanthophylls do not play a role in cyanobacterial photosynthesis in low-light conditions, we have found that the absence of xanthophylls leads to reduced oligomerization of photosystems I and II. This is remarkable because these complexes do not bind xanthophylls. Oligomerization is even more disturbed in crtH mutant cells, which show limited carotenoid synthesis; in these cells also the phycobilisomes are distorted despite the fact that these extramembranous light-harvesting complexes do not contain carotenoids. The number of phycocyanin rods connected to the phycobilisome core is strongly reduced leading to high amounts of unattached phycocyanin units. In the absence of carotenoids the overall organization of the thylakoid membranes is disturbed: Photosystem II is not formed, photosystem I hardly oligomerizes and the assembly of phycobilisomes remains incomplete. These data underline the importance of carotenoids in the structural and functional organization of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic machinery...|$|R

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out immediately prior to the spectroscopic experiments to obtain isomerically pure samples devoid of fluorescent contaminants. The polyenes showed vibrationally resolved S 0 → S 2 (11 Ag− → 11 Bu+) absorption and S 1 → S 0 (21 Ag− → 11 Ag−) fluorescence. The fluorescence from the C 30 carotenoids exhibits a systematic crossover from dominant S 1 → S 0 (21 Ag− → 11 Ag−) emission to dominant S 2 → S 0 (11 Bu+ → 11 Ag −) with increasing extent of conjugation. The xanthophylls all emit primarily from their S 2 states. The experiments at cryogenic temperatures provide enhanced resolution compared to room-temperature studies, reveal clearly the vibronic features of the fluorescence line shapes, and allow precise, direct assignments of the spectral origins and electronic-state energies of the molecules. The S 2 − S 1 energy gaps {{of all of the}} molecules increase with increasing length of π-electron conjugation. The lifetimes of the S 1 states of the C 30 <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls</b> were measured by transient absorption spectroscopy and were found to decrease as the conjugated chain length increases.

The degree of hepatoprotection was measured by estimation of biochemical parameters like serum transaminases serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) ], serum alkaline phosphatase, total albumin. and total protein. The results were compared with those for a control group, a CCl 4 -induced hepatic damage group, and a group treated with synthetic beta-carotene (all-trans) at the same dose. The protein content of the CCl 4 -treated group, which received normal diet and a dose of toxin, showed a significant decrease, i. e., 3. 92 mg/mL, whereas the protein levels were higher, i. e., 6. 96 and 6. 32 mg/mL, {{in the case of}} the Dunaliella and Spirulina, respectively, carotenoid-treated groups. The CCl 4 -treated group shown higher activity of transaminases (128. 68 units/mL SGPT and 171. 52 units/mL SGOT). However, the activity of SGPT was 62. 83 units/mL for Dunaliella and 76. 83 units/mL for Spirulina, i. e., carotenoids of Dunaliella showed a higher degree of protection. For serum alkaline phosphatase, the standard beta-carotene value was 81. 52 units/mL, compared with 84. 46 units/mL for the CCl 4 -treated group; however, natural algal carotenoids yielded 38. 45 units/mL (D. salina) and 44. 73 units/mL (Spirulina). The total albumin value diminished with CCl 4 treatment (2. 46 mg/mL); the effect was highest for Dunaliella, followed by the Spirulina carotenoid-treated group. The results clearly indicate that carotenoids from Dunaliella possess better hepatoprotection compared with those from Spirulina. High-performance liquid chromatography of the carotenoids indicated that Spirulina contains only beta-carotene and Dunaliella contains other <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> <b>xanthophyll.</b> The increase in protection with Dunaliella indicates that mixed carotenoids exhibit better biological activity than beta-carotene alone.

The samples of grains after drying with 12 % of final moisture were analyzed by concentration of total carotenoids, carotenes (&# 945;-carotene + &# 946;-carotene), monohydroxilated <b>carotenoids</b> (&# 946;-cryptoxanthin), <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls</b> (lutein + zeaxanthin). Initial moisture, type of drying and the interaction between moisture versus drying influence (p&# 8804; 0. 05) the levels of carotenoids in grains. This is the first report about the drying conditions and harvest&# 8217;s initial moisture as influence on the profile <b>and</b> content of <b>carotenoids</b> in maize grains. Based on the results, this work suggested that the harvest be carried out preferably when the grains present 22 % humidity, with drying in a dryer or in shade for further use or storage...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess, {{for the first time}}, the effect of ohmic heating on the {{carotenoid}} profile of two citrus fruit juices: grapefruit and blood orange. Two heat treatments were designed to obtain pasteurization values of 50 and 150 min (Tref = 70 °C and z-value = 10 °C) with ohmic heating as compared to conventional heating. The results showed that xanthophyll losses could reach 70 % for epoxyxanthophylls (cis-violaxanthin and cis-antheraxanthin) and 40 % for hydroxyxanthophylls (β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin) with conventional heating, but losses were under 30 % and 20 %, respectively, with ohmic heating. Carotene species (lycopene and β-carotene) were stable regardless of the treatment. No negative non-thermal effects of ohmic heating were shown on carotenoids. Loss simulations of the studied carotenoids showed that the high temperatures reached with ohmic heating during pasteurization could substantially increase the organoleptic and nutritional quality of acid carotenoid-rich juices. Industrial relevance Citrus are the top fruit crops in terms of world trade. This craze for them -particularly orange and grapefruit- is notably due to their high content in organoleptic and nutritional compounds of interest <b>and</b> among them <b>carotenoids.</b> About 50 % of the Citrus production is processed in juice. From the growing variety of products, minimal processed juices now have a significant market share. This work assessed {{for the first time the}} effect of ohmic heating, a thermal method for stabilizing juices while minimizing the impact on the juice quality, on the carotenoid profiles of blood orange and grapefruit juice. Pasteurization with ohmic heating was proven to be a very good alternative for protecting <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> especially <b>xanthophylls</b> compared to conventional heating. These results will help in designing ohmic heating process parameters for optimizing the overall quality of carotenoid-rich fruit juices. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

At {{the end of}} 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, <b>carotenoid,</b> <b>and</b> flavanone plasma concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59 % (p < 0. 001), 46 % (p = 0. 018), and 22 % (p < 0. 001), and 8 -fold (p = 0. 045), respectively. Flavanones were excreted in urine 9 -fold more {{at the end of}} the intervention (p = 0. 01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 8 -Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16 % (p = 0. 38; n = 11), and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29 % (p = 0. 36; n = 7), respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol ratios decreased but cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance plasma concentrations did not change significantly.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the use of}} narrow-band indices formulated in the visible spectral region at leaf and canopy levels to estimate carotenoid content. The research area was a pine forest affected by decline processes. Spectral reflectance and pigment content including chlorophylls a <b>and</b> b (Ca+b), <b>carotenoid</b> (Cx+c) <b>and</b> <b>xanthophyll</b> cycle pigments (VAZ) were measured in needles for two consecutive years. The study was conducted using radiative transfer modeling methods and high-resolution airborne imagery acquired at 10 nm FWHM bandwidth. Airborne data consisted of high spatial resolution imagery acquired with a narrow-band multispectral camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The imagery had 50 cm resolution and six spectral bands in the 500 - 800 nm range, enabling the identification of pure crowns to obtain the reflectance of individual trees. The indices evaluated were traditional formulations and new simple ratios developed by combining bands sensitive to Cx+c absorption in the 500 - 600 nm region. The PROSPECT- 5 model was coupled with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to explore the performance of Cx+c-sensitive vegetation indices at leaf and canopy levels. The sensitivity of these indices to structural effects was assessed to study the potential scaling-up of Cx+c-related vegetation indices on heterogeneous canopies. Coefficients of determination between Cx+c content and narrow-band vegetation indices revealed that traditional indices were highly related with Cx+c content at leaf level (r 2 > 0. 90; P 0. 44; P 0. 72; P 0. 71; P< 0. 001). Remote sensing cameras on board UAV platforms can provide very high multispectral and hyperspectral imagery for mapping biochemical constituents in heterogeneous forest canopies.

40|$|Natural photosystems, {{that are}} present in {{photosynthetic}} bacterial membranes and in thylakoids of algae and green plants, contain pigment molecules which are necessary for the three primary processes of Photosynthesis: - Light harvesting; - Energy transport to the Reaction Centre; - Primary charge separation. In the so-called Photosystem II (PSII) of plants, this complex pigment system is made up essentially by chlorophylls, pheophytins <b>and</b> <b>carotenoids.</b> There are about 300 chlorophyll molecules (a and b), more than 100 <b>carotenoids</b> (<b>xanthophylls</b> <b>and</b> beta-carotene) and a few molecules of pheophytin-a. The system can be studied by optical spectroscopy in the visible region, a main difficulty being the overlap of the pigment transitions in the red and blue regions where the most informative transitions of chlorophylls <b>and</b> <b>carotenoids</b> are present, In this report it will be shown how the association of optical spectroscopy and magnetic resonance in a double resonance spectroscopic technique known as Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) allows the above-mentioned difficulties to be partially overcome. On the one side, {{it is possible to}} assign optical transitions within unresolved bands to specific pigments selected by their magnetic resonances which have an intrinsically larger resolution. On the other hand, it is possible to study paths of excitonic energy within the pigment-protein complexes through the fluorescence response and to obtain interesting information about the function of the system. Some examples will be illustrated taken from recent experiments performed in our laboratory both on the antenna and on the reaction centre of PSII...|$|R
40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the third}} most widely {{consumed}} plant food by humans. Its tubers are rich in starch and vitamin C, but have low or null levels of essential nutrients such as provitamin A and vitamin E. Transformation of potato with a bacterial mini-pathway for β-carotene in a tuber-specific manner results in a "golden" potato (GP) tuber phenotype resulting from accumulation of provitamin A <b>carotenoids</b> (α- <b>and</b> β-carotene) <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls.</b> Here, we investigated the bioaccessibility of <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> vitamin E as α-tocopherol (αTC) in boiled wild type and golden tubers using in vitro digestion. Golden tubers contained up to 91 μg provitamin A carotenes (PAC) /g D, increased levels of <b>xanthophylls,</b> phytoene <b>and</b> phytofluene, as well as up to 78 μg vitamin E/g DW. Cubes from wild type and GP tubers were boiled and subjected to simulated digestion to estimate bioaccessibility of <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> αTC. Retention in boiled GPs exceeded 80 % for β-carotene (βC), α-carotene (αC), lutein, phytoene ± and αTC, but less than 50 % for phytofluene. The efficiency of partitioning of total βC, αC, E-lutein, phytoene, phytofluene and αTC in the mixed micelle fraction during small intestinal digestion was influenced by genotype, tuber content and hydrophobicity. Apical uptake of the compounds that partitioned in mixed micelles by monolayers of human intestinal Caco- 2 cells during incubation for 4 h was 14 - 20 % for provitamin A <b>and</b> <b>xanthophylls,</b> 43 - 45 % for phytoene, 23 - 27 % for phytofluene, and 53 % for αTC. These results suggest that a 150 g serving of boiled golden potatoes {{has the potential to}} contribute 42 % and 23 % of the daily requirement of retinol activity equivalents (RAE), as well as 34 and 17 % of the daily vitamin E requirement for children and women of reproductive age, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Seaweeds contain polyphenols, <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> polysaccharides with {{potential}} {{for use in}} functional foods. This study investigated these compounds using conventional and novel recovery techniques from seaweeds (Fucus serratus, Laminaria digitata, Gracilaria gracilis, Codium fragile, Fucus vesiculosus, Himanthalia elongata and Cystoseira nodicaulis) harvested from the Irish coast. The effect of seasonality on compound concentration, structure and bioactivity was assessed. Solid liquid extraction (SLE) and pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) were investigated for the optimal recovery of antioxidant compounds. Methods were evaluated based on extraction yield and antioxidant properties. SLE extracts possessed higher antioxidant activity compared to PLE extracts. Enriched fractions from SLE extracts were generated using membrane dialysis. An increase in activity compared to the crude extracts was achieved. Initial weak activity in the < 3. 5 kDa fraction of F. serratus was further enhanced using reversed-phase flash chromatography separation. Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-ToF-MS) confirmed {{the presence of a}} high abundance of low molecular phlorotannins. Phlorotannins characterisation with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry from brown macroalgae demonstrated isomeric complexity. The level of isomerisation differed substantially within the species studied. The seasonal variation on macro-composition of four seaweed over four seasons was investigated. Protein content was highest (28. 70 %) in G. gracilis winter samples. Lipid content was low and ash content high in all species. Carbohydrate levels were highest in the brown seaweed (75 - 80 %). Insoluble dietary fibre ranged between 30 - 60 % and was highest in spring. Soluble dietary fibre was highest in the spring/summer periods. Levels of phenolics in F. serratus were highest during the summer period and lowest in the autumn. This study demonstrated that seaweed composition is affected by seasonality and environmental factors. Brown seaweeds contain <b>carotenoids</b> (fucoxanthin <b>and</b> <b>xanthophyll)</b> known to possess antioxidant activity. The efficiency of three extraction techniques (conventional SLE, supercritical CO 2 (SFE) extraction and supercritical CO 2 with co-solvent) and seasonal variation was examined for these carotenoids. SLE gave a higher yield while SFE gave a higher purity of extract. The winter/spring period gave the highest purity of carotenoids from L. digitata, however, the summer was the peak period for F. serratus. The seasonal variation on structure and bioactivity of phlorotannins was also investigated in the brown algae F. serratus. Low molecular weight phlorotannins predominantly had a degree of polymerisation (DP) of phloroglucinol between 6 - 14 across all seasons/harvest sites. Winter samples exhibited the highest level of isomerisation (427 isomers) while summer samples had the lowest level of isomerisation (121 isomers). High levels of isomerisation were associated with higher bioactivity in the in-vitro tests. The seasonal variation laminarin from Laminaria digitata was investigated in relation to molecular weight, content and chain length. ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis showed that summer was the optimum for harvest time for extraction of higher content of laminarin, no laminarin was detected in the winter. Variation in the molecular weight based in the number if glucose monomers was observed. This research highlighted the optimum extraction technologies for extraction of bioactive compounds (polyphenols, <b>carotenoids</b> <b>and</b> polysaccharides) from Irish macroalgae {{with potential}} for inclusion in functional foods. It has also demonstrated the seasonal variation of these compounds and its effect on structure and bioactivity...|$|R
