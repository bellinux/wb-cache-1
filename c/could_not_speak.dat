5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|To elevate {{his son to}} Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip {{the crown}} of Naples {{as well as his}} claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Therefore, Mary became Queen of Naples and titular Queen of Jerusalem upon marriage. Their wedding at Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> English, and so they spoke in a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.|$|E
5|$|General Alexandre de Beauharnais {{decided to}} put Tarrare's {{abilities}} to military use, and he was employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Unfortunately for Tarrare, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> German, and on his first mission was captured by Prussian forces, severely beaten and underwent a mock execution before being returned to French lines.|$|E

Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children.

5|$|The {{division}} began formation {{as part of}} the Transcaucasian Front on 19 August 1941, {{under the}} command of Colonel Ivan Vinogradov at Makharadze. Out of 10,252 soldiers in the division at its inception, 8,979 had never handled weapons. Most of its troops <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> or understand Russian. The enlisted personnel of the 390th were mostly Armenian and Azerbaijani peasants, while junior and political officers were Russian and Georgian. On 23 November, it joined the 51st Army, and by early December the division command post was located at Taman on the coast of the Kerch Strait.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1933, MGM staff {{realized}} that additional footage was needed to complete the film. This involved casting an actress for the role. The production staff visited San Francisco, California, to identify an actress for a minor female part. Ray Mala offered the role of Iva to Sadie Brower, a 17-year-old half-Inupiat girl. But after her father refused to let her appear in movies, a Japanese American (who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> any Eskimo) was cast in the role instead. According to Brower, this woman's Eskimo {{was so bad that}} it was unintelligible. Dortuk, Elik, Kemasuk, Nunooruk, and four other Inupiat actors were brought to California to act in the reshoots and new scenes.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the years, he {{received}} the Victory Medal, the Occupational Medal from the Mississippi Army National Guard, an honourable discharge (which he had not received upon leaving the army) and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, when he was 105 years old, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time, {{he was known as}} the oldest living World War I veteran, as Emiliano Mercado del Toro had not yet been discovered. He was interviewed by Treehouse Productions in 2006 as part of their Living History Project, a radio tribute to the last surviving World War I veterans that was hosted by Walter Cronkite. Though he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> coherently, his son Haywood Hardy, himself 80 years old at the time, recalled some of the stories that his father had told him.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak.</b> You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|Åkerman {{was raised}} a Buddhist, which {{inspired}} the lotus flower tattoo on her upper back. She {{also has a}} tattooed 'Z' on her right wrist, honouring her husband, Italian musician Roberto Zincone. The two met in 2003 when Åkerman was the lead singer for The Petalstones, for which Zincone served as the drummer. After band practices, they usually socialized, using a dictionary as he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> English. They eventually started dating and married at Grand Hotel Moon Valley in Sorrento, Italy on June 20, 2007. Every year, they used to spend their holidays in Naples, Zincone's native city. The couple had one son, Sebastian Zincone, born on April 16, 2013. On November 25, 2013, the couple announced that they were separating. Zincone filed for divorce on December 2, 2013.|$|E

5|$|Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. The first {{towns to}} be {{concentrated}} into colonial reducciones were Ixtutz, {{which became the}} new town of San José, and neighbouring San Andrés, both {{on the north shore}} of Lake Petén Itzá. They were first subjugated by one of Ursúa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpetén, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén. The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> the Itza language.|$|E
5|$|In February, the 390th Rifle Division {{became an}} Armenian {{national}} division {{as part of}} an attempt to overcome the language barrier, as the majority of its troops still <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> Russian fluently. As a result of mass desertions of the Caucasian troops during the previous fighting, the Armenian officer Colonel Simon Zakian replaced Vinogradov as commander of the division on 24 February. The 51st Army launched an attack on 16 March, with the 390th and 398th Rifle Divisions in reserve. On the night of 17–18 March, the 390th and 398th were moved up to their jumping-off positions in the area of Korpech village. The attacks of the two divisions began at 10:00 on 18 March, and the 390th, advancing in conjunction with the 55th Tank Brigade, overcame German resistance and captured two trench lines of the German main defensive line. By the end of the day, they had dug in on the new positions. On the morning of 19 March, Zakian committed his reserve, the 784th Rifle Regiment, into the battle. However, the rest of the attacks were unsuccessful. After army commander Vladimir Lvov received reports of a German buildup, the offensive was halted.|$|E
5|$|In early 1994, Levesque {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In his first televised match, Levesque debuted as a villain named Terror Risin', defeating Keith Cole. His ring name was soon modified to Terra Ryzing, which he used until mid-1994, when he was renamed Jean-Paul Lévesque. This gimmick referred to his surname's French origins and {{he was asked to}} speak with a French accent, as he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> French. During this time, he began using his finishing maneuver, the Pedigree. Lévesque had a brief feud with Alex Wright that ended at Starrcade with Wright pinning him. Between late 1994 and early 1995, Lévesque briefly teamed with Lord Steven Regal, whose upper class British persona was similar to Lévesque's character. However, the team was short-lived, as Levesque left for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in January 1995 after WCW turned down his request to be promoted as a singles competitor.|$|E
