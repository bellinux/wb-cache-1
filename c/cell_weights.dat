40|$|In {{this thesis}} the 16 -fold {{parallel}} fermentation device fedbatch-pro®, commercially {{available from the}} company DASGIP in Jülich, was used to develop processes {{for the production of}} recombinant proteins in Hansenula polymorpha. Due to the improvement of the aeration system {{and the development of a}} robust fermentation strategy for parallel cultivation, the Hansenula-clone FMD-HSA 56 - 1 reached dry <b>cell</b> <b>weights</b> of up to 60 g/L and rHSA concentrations of 250 mg/L in the fedbatch-pro® device. After scale-up to a 5 -L stirred tank reactor, dry <b>cell</b> <b>weights</b> of 66 g/L and rHSA concentrations of 289 mg/L were measured (values related to total fermentation volume). During co-expression of the chaperones calnexin and proteindisulfideisomerase, a 3. 2 -fold increase in specific product yield was observed in the parallel fermentation device. In the 5 -L stirred tank reactor, the specific product yield was increased 1. 8 -fold compared to the Hansenula-clone without co-expressed chaperones. By means of several chromatographic methods, rHSA could be purified from Hansenula culture supernatant. While the recovery rate of rHSA was relatively low (values of 27 % to 45 %), the purity of rHSA was comparable to a commercially available therapeutic HSA product. The formation of a 52 kDa degradation product could neither be prevented by tuning the fermentation conditions nor be separated from the mature 66. 5 kDa HSA molecule by chromatographic methods. This degradation product is likely formed by cell wall-associated proteases and might be avoided by targeted knock-out of these proteases. Initially, product concentrations obtained in the parallel fermentation system showed only a low reproducibility. In two 16 -fold experiments, statistical spreads in product concentration of 63 % and 90 % respectively, were noticed. In contrast to this, the cell dry weight data showed only statistical spreads of 7 % and 3 % respectively. It became apparent that the biomass formation was subject to a more robust mechanism than the product formation. However, with the use of duplicate experiments, adequate reaction conditions could be identified for the production of rHSA. In consideration of data variance, tendencies of different reaction conditions regarding product formation could be recognized and a selection of appropriate fermentation conditions could be carried out. Inaccuracies in the aeration system were identified as one reason for the high deviation in product concentration. Condensate in the off-gas filters led to different aeration rates in the respective vessels. These differences in aeration conditions made an impact on growth and glucose consumption leading to different derepression conditions of the FMD-Promoter and finally resulted in different product concentrations. After removal of the off-gas filters, the statistical spread of product concentration could be reduced to 3 % in a four-fold parallel fermentation. For future fermentation experiments the use of off-gas filters with a higher volumetric flow capacity or off-gas condensers should be considered. In addition to the improvement of the albumin process, the process development of a commercially relevant protein was described in this thesis. Using both the fedbatch-pro® device and a 5 -L stirred tank reactor, the product concentration could be increased from initially not detectable concentrations to 0. 25 g/L in the fedbatch-pro® device and up to 1. 87 g/L in the stirred tank reactor within 6 weeks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Lipids {{produced}} from filamentous fungi show great promise for biofuel production, but a major limiting {{factor is the}} high production cost attributed to feedstock. Lignocellulosic biomass is a suitable feedstock for biofuel production due to its abundance and low value. However, very limited study has been performed on lipid production by culturing oleaginous fungi with lignocellulosic materials. Thus, identification of filamentous fungal strains capable of utilizing lignocellulosic hydrolysates for lipid accumulation is critical to improve the process and reduce the production cost. Results The growth performances of eleven filamentous fungi were investigated when cultured on glucose and xylose. Their dry <b>cell</b> <b>weights,</b> lipid contents and fatty acid profiles were determined. Six fungal strains with high lipid contents were selected to culture with the hydrolysate from dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of wheat straw. The results showed that all the selected fungal strains were able to grow on both detoxified liquid hydrolysate (DLH) and non-detoxified liquid hydrolysate (NDLH). The highest lipid content of 39. 4 % was obtained by Mortierella isabellina on NDLH. In addition, NDLH with some precipitate could help M. isabellina form pellets with an average diameter of 0. 11 [*]mm. Conclusion This study demonstrated the possibility of fungal lipid production from lignocellulosic biomass. M. isabellina was the best lipid producer grown on lignocellulosic hydrolysates among the tested filamentous fungi, because it could not only accumulate oils with a high content by directly utilizing NDLH to simplify the fermentation process, but also form proper pellets to benefit the downstream harvesting. Considering the yield and cost, fungal lipids from lignocellulosic biomass are promising alternative sources for biodiesel production. </p...|$|E

In this study, the maximum polymer content per volume of the medium of 342  ±  34  mg L− 1 PHB was observed after 10  days of limitation which corresponds to 14.6  ±  1 % (dcw) PHB.

40|$|The direct {{simulation}} Monte Carlo (DSMC) {{method is}} today {{by far the}} most popular simulation technique to solve the Boltzmann equation for rarefied flows. The first part of the thesis aims to characterize both the convergence and the accuracy of the DSMC method. The particular test case used for this investigation consists of an axisymmetric argon jet. Sampled flow quantities are found to be highly time-correlated, but the rate of convergence of their sampled averages is found to be well-predicted by a Central Limit Theorem taking that correlation into account. The influence of the number of particles and the time step on the accuracy of the simulation is then assessed. Their influence on the convergence and time correlation of sampled flow quantities is also studied. The second part of the thesis addresses one of the major shortcomings inherent to the DSMC method, the fact that the number of computational particles in any one cell is directly proportional to its density. For flows with large density disparities or multiple species, this often results in some cells containing excessive numbers of particles and others too few. A possible solution is thus to use both <b>cell</b> <b>weights</b> and species weights that vary in space. As each particular flow is different, optimum weight fields also differ between simulations. In this thesis, a novel adaptive procedure for the weights and time step is proposed. Both are automatically varied as the simulation progresses to steady state. The performance of the adaptive procedure is then assessed for a test case consisting of two counterflowing jets. Significant performance improvements are observed. These are mostly due to an improved distribution of computational particles throughout the domain for each individual species. In the last part of this thesis, a hybrid DSMC/Fluid method is applied to the simulation of a weakly ionized rarefied flow. Electrons are modeled via the use of an electron fluid model while DSMC is used to model the dynamics of all non-electron particles. Satisfactory results are obtained for both plasma parameters and gas properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} level of {{xanthophylls}} of several representative species of green algae were investigated as a possible source of pigmentation for the egg yolk and broiler markets. Chlorella pyrenoidosa 7 - 11 - 05 was selected for fermentation studies because of its high level of xanthophylls and wide temperature range for growth. The heterotrophic metabolism was preferred because of the ease of adaptability to present fermentation equipment. When used as the sole carbon source, glucose was the only sugar, among many tested, that gave appreciable growth in illuminated shaken flasks. A dry cell weight of 90 g per liter and total xanthophylls of 450 mg per liter were obtained from 190 g per liter of glucose monohydrate in 168 -hr illuminated shaken flasks. Higher levels of glucose decreased yields. In combination with glucose, monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, were readily assimilated. The 7 - 11 - 05 strain was adapted to galactose as the sole carbon source after six vegetative passages. Light of the proper intensity and duration stimulated total xanthophylls approximately 35 %. The effect on dry cell weight and total xanthophylls of seven antibiotics added at various levels in shaken flasks was studied. Erythromycin was essentially stable throughout the fermentation and nontoxic up to 25 μg/ml, with only slight toxicity at higher levels. Both erythromycin and ristocetin were effective in controlling {{a high incidence of}} bacterial contamination in 30 -liter fermentors. With the higher agitation and aeration rates possible in 30 -liter fermentors, dry <b>cell</b> <b>weights</b> in excess of 100 g per liter and total xanthophylls of 467 to 512 mg per liter were readily obtained from 230 to 260 g per liter of glucose in 162 -hr illuminated batch-type fermentations. Continuous-feed runs yielded a dry cell weight of 302 g per liter and total xanthophylls of 650 mg per liter from 520 g per liter of glucose. The type of Chlorella cell produced was an important consideration with respect to the availability of the xanthophylls in pigmenting egg yolks and broilers...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A dissimilarity {{coefficient}} for estimating the dissimilarity between two bird atlas distributions is developed. This coefficient {{is based on}} the Euclidean distance concept. The atlas distributions are compared over all quarter degree grid cells. Existing coefficients are not suitable for the comparison of distributions with different total areas and species with different mean reporting rates. In each grid cell the reliability of the reporting rates depends on the number of checklists collected for the grid <b>cell.</b> <b>Weights</b> are used to solve this problem. To solve the problem of different levels of abundance and conspicuousness of species, the reporting rates are sorted into percentiles, using five or 10 categories for the strictly positive reporting rates. Each grid cell is weighted by a function of the number of checklists collected for the grid cell. The coefficient is scaled by the maximum possible sum of the differences which would occur if there is no overlap between the two distributions, so that the dissimilarity coefficient lies between zero (a perfect match) and one (no overlap). A variety of these coefficients are investigated and compared. The continuity of observed reporting rates in a spatial cellular map is an indication of spatial autocorrelation present, especially between observations which are in close vicinity. We are particularly interested in measuring and comparing the continuity of the reporting rates in the bird distributions from The Atlas of Southern African Birds. The variogram, developed in geostatistics, estimates this spatial autocorrelation. The classical variogram estimator, however, is dependent on the scale of measurement and assumes that the data are intrinsically stationary. The bird atlas distribution maps contain trend and the variance of each observation (reporting rate) {{is a function of the}} number of checklists collected for the grid cell and the underlying probability of encountering the species in the grid cell. The approach of removing this binomial measurement error from the variogram developed by McNeill (1991) is investigated but not found satisfactory. A weighted variogram, where each squared difference is weighted by a function of the smaller number of checklists, is developed. To make the variogram values comparable between species a function of the mean reporting rates is used to scale the variogram. We were particularly interested in the first variogram value of each species distribution, 2 y(1). The bird distribution maps in The Atlas of Southern African Birds show the raw observed reporting rates. Each of these reporting rates is a random variable dependent on sampling error due to binomial variation based on the number of checklists collected for the grid cell and on the underlying probability of encountering the species. The distribution maps show this measurement error. It is believed that a smoothed version of the bird distribution maps will to some extent improve the statement these observed distributions are aiming to make. Single-step regression methods are investigated for a fast approach to this problem. These cause problems because of frequent 'zero' observed reporting rates and because they smooth the maps too heavily. Generalized Linear Models are investigated and this iterative procedure is applied to model the reporting rates with a binomial distribution on square blocks of nine grid cells where a value for the central cell is 'predicted' in each regression. This approach is especially suited to accommodate the binomial distribution characteristics and is found to smooth the bird atlas distributions well. Because only a local window is taken for each regression, the spatial autocorrelation is adequately included in the spatial explanatory variables...|$|E
40|$|Carrot hairy roots {{have shown}} {{vigorous}} growth and extensive lateral root branching {{in the absence}} of phytohormone. The production of peroxidase which was not detected in suspension cells was observed in high amounts in carrot hairy root. High peroxidase activity (19. 2 Ug(- 1) fresh <b>cell</b> <b>weight)</b> was obtained by increasing the total phenolics concentration in the media. Peroxidase synthesis could be increased using elicitors such as yeast extract, V 2 O 5, and Hg 2 Cl 2, which are known to induce the synthesis of PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase). As the initial sucrose concentration in the medium increased, peroxidase activity and total phenolics increased while final cell mass decreased. A high level of sucrose also affected the elevation of the phenolics concentration in the cell. By adopting a two-stage culture method, the activity of peroxidase (55 U g(- 1) fresh <b>cell</b> <b>weight)</b> was ten times higher than that of a single-stage culture (5 U g(- 1) fresh <b>cell</b> <b>weight)</b> and about three times higher than that of field-grown horseradish on an activity per weight basisclose 445...|$|R

However, the low productivity remains a bottleneck for large-scale application and cost-effective production. In the present work, we cloned the key biosynthetic gene, phlD (a type III polyketide synthase), into a bacterial expression vector to produce phloroglucinol in E. coli and developed different strategies to re-engineer the recombinant strain for robust synthesis of phloroglucinol.
