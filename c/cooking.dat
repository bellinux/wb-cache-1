5|$|<b>Cooking</b> in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian <b>cooking.</b> Wealthy households tended to vary <b>cooking</b> methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of <b>cooking</b> that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|David wrote eight {{booklets}} {{on individual}} topics. The first two The Use of Wine in Fine <b>Cooking</b> (1950) and The Use of Wine in Italian <b>Cooking</b> (1952) were commissioned {{and published by}} the wine merchants Saccone and Speed. David reused the first as a chapter in French Country <b>Cooking.</b>|$|E
5|$|David's last booklet was <b>Cooking</b> with Le Creuset (1989) {{written for}} the French {{manufacturers}} of Le Creuset <b>cooking</b> ware.|$|E

Mama Kills Animals consists of minigames related to the preparation of animal carcasses.|$|E

5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was an {{influential}} cookery book written by Elizabeth David in 1950, her first, {{and published by}} John Lehmann. After years of rationing and wartime austerity, the book brought light and colour back to English <b>cooking,</b> with simple fresh ingredients, from David's experience of Mediterranean <b>cooking</b> while living in France, Italy and Greece. The book was illustrated by John Minton, and the chapters were introduced with quotations from famous writers.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign <b>cooking</b> styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and <b>cooking</b> in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home <b>cooking</b> of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant {{vitamins}} {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, and E can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged <b>cooking.</b> The effects of <b>cooking</b> and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cooking</b> {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, <b>cooking</b> onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. <b>Cooking</b> onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic {{heritage}} <b>cooking,</b> both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, {{has made}} a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society. Apart from home <b>cooking,</b> many ethnic foods are now available in street markets, supermarkets and restaurants, or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and people increasingly eat foods from ethnic backgrounds other than their own. Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops.|$|E

5|$|Stir frying: Stir frying is a Chinese <b>cooking</b> {{technique}} used for preparing {{food in a}} wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, but did not fully develop until the Song Dynasty. Although there are no surviving records of Han Dynasty stir frying, archaeological evidence of woks and the tendency to slice food thinly indicate that the technique was likely used for <b>cooking.</b> It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir frying was popularized as primary <b>cooking</b> method of Chinese cuisine. Stir frying was brought to America by early Chinese immigrants, and has been used for non-Asian cuisines.|$|E

5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage <b>cooking</b> process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of <b>cooking,</b> the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another <b>cooking</b> device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this <b>cooking</b> process. In the second <b>cooking</b> stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
