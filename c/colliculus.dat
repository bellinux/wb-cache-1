5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior <b>colliculus,</b> and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior <b>colliculus</b> is part of the midbrain.|$|E
5|$|A {{vampire bat}} has front teeth that are {{specialized}} for cutting {{and the back}} teeth are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior <b>colliculus,</b> {{the part of the}} bat's brain that processes sound, is well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping animals that serve as its main food source.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the cerebral cortex {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The superior <b>colliculus,</b> which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|The nucleus geniculatus {{medialis}} receives axons from auditory axons. From the cochlea, peripheral auditory information goes to {{the cochlear}} nucleus. From there, through the cochlear nerve, axons reach the superior olivary complex of both sides. Axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which ends in the inferior <b>colliculus.</b> Axons from the inferior <b>colliculus</b> constitute the brachium of the inferior <b>colliculus</b> and end in the medial geniculate. The thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the primary auditory cortex located {{in the center of}} the superior temporal plane. See auditory system.|$|E
25|$|Inferior <b>colliculus</b> (IC) aids {{in sound}} {{orienting}} to pain stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Superior <b>colliculus</b> {{receives}} IC’s input, integrates visual orienting info, {{and uses}} the balance topographical map to orient the body to the pain stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Suppression of {{recently}} inspected stimuli for both attention and oculomotor saccade is usually measured using attentional and oculomotor inhibition of return tests. The superior <b>colliculus</b> and the midbrain, oculomotor pathway {{are involved in}} suppression of stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells of}} the DNLL respond best to {{bilateral}} inputs, and have onset and complexity tuned sustained responses. The nucleus is primarily GABAergic, and projects bilaterally to the inferior <b>colliculus,</b> and contralaterally to the DNLL, with different populations of cells projecting to each IC.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} <b>colliculus</b> (SC) or optic tectum (OT) {{is part of}} the tectum, {{located in}} the midbrain, superior to the brainstem and inferior to the thalamus. It contains seven layers of alternating white and grey matter, of which the superficial contain topographic maps of the visual field; and deeper layers contain overlapping spatial maps of the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities. The structure receives afferents directly from the retina, as well as from various regions of the cortex (primarily the occipital lobe), the spinal cord and the inferior <b>colliculus.</b> It sends efferents to the spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus and occipital lobe via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The structure contains a high proportion of multisensory neurons and plays a role in the motor control of orientation behaviours of the eyes, ears and head.|$|E
25|$|Binaural-beat {{perception}} {{originates in}} the inferior <b>colliculus</b> of the midbrain and the superior olivary complex of the brainstem, where auditory signals from each ear are integrated and precipitate electrical impulses along neural pathways through the reticular formation up the midbrain to the thalamus, auditory cortex, and other cortical regions.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus is a {{tract of}} axons in the {{brainstem}} that carries information about {{sound from the}} cochlear nucleus to various brainstem nuclei and ultimately the contralateral inferior <b>colliculus</b> of the midbrain. Three distinct, primarily inhibitory, cellular groups are located interspersed within these fibers, and are thus named the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus.|$|E
25|$|Fibers leaving these {{brainstem}} nuclei ascending to {{the inferior}} <b>colliculus</b> rejoin the lateral lemniscus. In that sense, {{this is not}} a 'lemniscus' in the true sense of the word (second order, decussated sensory axons), as there is third (and out of the lateral superior olive, fourth) order information coming out of some of these brainstem nuclei.|$|E
25|$|The reticulospinal tracts {{are mostly}} {{inhibited}} by the corticospinal tract; if damage {{occurs at the}} level of or below the red nucleus (e.g. to the superior <b>colliculus),</b> it is called decerebration, and causes decerebrate rigidity: an unopposed extension of the head and limbs. The reticulospinal tracts also provide a pathway by which the hypothalamus can control sympathetic thoracolumbar outflow and parasympathetic sacral outflow.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus {{is located}} where the {{cochlear}} nuclei and the pontine reticular formation (PRF) crossover. The PRF descends the reticulospinal tract where it innervates motor neurons and spinal interneurons. It {{is the main}} auditory tract in the brainstem that connects the superior olivary complex (SOC) with the inferior <b>colliculus</b> (IC). The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) has input from the LL and output to the contralateral LL via the ipsilateral and contralateral Dorsal Acoustic Stria.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{up until}} now much of the above {{paragraph}} could apply to octopuses, mollusks, worms, insects and things more primitive; anything with a more concentrated nervous system and better eyes than say a jellyfish. However, the following applies to mammals generally and birds (in modified form): The retina in these more complex animals sends fibers (the optic nerve) to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the superior <b>colliculus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging these variations, many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} established to reflect why these observations are task-dependent. Given that different senses develop at different rates, it has been proposed that cross-modal integration does not appear until both modalities have reached maturity. The human body undergoes significant physical transformation throughout childhood. Not only is there growth in size and stature (affecting viewing height), {{but there is also}} change in inter-ocular distance and eyeball length. Therefore, sensory signals need to be constantly re-evaluated to appreciate these various physiological changes. Some support comes from animal studies that explore the neurobiology behind integration. Adult monkeys have deep inter-neuronal connections within the superior <b>colliculus</b> providing strong, accelerated visuo-auditory integration. Young animals conversely, do not have this enhancement until unimodal properties are fully developed.|$|E
25|$|The nigral afferences {{come from}} the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. The axons do not {{constitute}} a conspicuous bundle. They are placed medially to the pallidal and ascend almost vertically. A part of the territory is posterior and inferior {{going up to the}} anterior pole of the central complex. This part sometimes designated as VM is simply the posterior continuation of the nigral territory. There is indeed no more VM in the upper primates where the pallidal and nigral territories are everywhere separated. In the whole territory axons expand widely (François et al., 2002) allowing no precise map, which is confirmed by physiology (Wichemann and Kliem, 2004). VA is crossed by the mammillothalamic bundle. The mediator of the nigro-thalamic connection is, as for the pallido-thalamic the inhibitor GABA. In addition to nigral, VA receives amygdalar and tectal (superior <b>colliculus)</b> axons. The thalamo-cortical axons go to the frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the premotor cortex and the oculomotor fields FEF and SEF. It is important to stress the necessity from now to clearly distinguish the pallidal VO and the nigral VA territories. The fact that they do not lead to the same cortical areas and systems is alone one reason for this. The physiology of the two territories is also different (van Donkelaar et al., 1999).|$|E
25|$|However, {{considerations}} of how unified conscious representations are formed {{are not the}} full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact {{in order to maximize}} how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of Gestalt psychology schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain, the physiological processes underlying the formation of percepts and conscious experience have been vastly understudied. Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the superior <b>colliculus</b> (SC) and various cortical structures such as the superior temporal gyrus (GT) and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the ventriloquism effect, rapid localization of stimuli and the McGurk effect; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contributions}} of Barry Stein, Alex Meredith, {{and their colleagues}} (e.g."The merging of the senses" [...] 1993,) are widely {{considered to be the}} groundbreaking work in the modern field of multisensory integration. Through detailed long-term study of the neurophysiology of the superior <b>colliculus,</b> they distilled three general principles by which multisensory integration may best be described.|$|E
2500|$|Auditory evoked {{potential}} {{can be used}} to trace the signal generated by a sound through the ascending auditory pathway. [...] The {{evoked potential}} is generated in the cochlea, goes through the cochlear nerve, through the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, to the inferior <b>colliculus</b> in the midbrain, on to the medial geniculate body, and finally to the cortex.|$|E
2500|$|A neural {{structure}} located {{behind the}} {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} that is understood to control eye movements. In particular, the deeper layers of the superior <b>colliculus,</b> known as lamina VI and VII, {{have been found to}} be involved in initiating and executing saccadic eye movements, which includes the desired speed and direction of the saccade. The cells in these layers are organized in a way that forms a map of the visual field. They are organized according to what direction each cell moves the eye. It has been found that activation of specific cells is directed by where objects in the environment are located in the visual field. [...] Once a new object is detected, the cells that fire the strongest to stimuli within this specific area of the visual field will fire, causing the eyes to move and focus on this object. Although the superior <b>colliculus</b> may not be directly related to memory for objects across saccades, it is directly related to the control of saccades and selection of fixation targets.|$|E
2500|$|One intensively studied {{function}} of the basal ganglia is its role in controlling eye movements. [...] Eye movement is influenced by an extensive network of brain regions that converges on a midbrain area called the superior <b>colliculus</b> (SC). [...] The SC is a layered structure whose layers form two-dimensional retinotopic maps of visual space. [...] A [...] "bump" [...] of neural activity in the deep layers of the SC drives an eye movement directed toward the corresponding point in space.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior <b>colliculus,</b> cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E
2500|$|A clear {{emergent}} {{issue in}} comparative {{anatomy of the}} basal ganglia {{is the development of}} this system through phylogeny as a convergent cortically re-entrant loop in conjunction with the development and expansion of the cortical mantle. There is controversy, however, regarding the extent to which convergent selective processing occurs versus segregated parallel processing within re-entrant closed loops of the basal ganglia. Regardless, the transformation of the basal ganglia into a cortically re-entrant system in mammalian evolution occurs through a re-direction of pallidal (or [...] "paleostriatum primitivum") output from midbrain targets such as the superior <b>colliculus,</b> as occurs in sauropsid brain, to specific regions of the ventral thalamus and from there back to specified regions of the cerebral cortex that form a subset of those cortical regions projecting into the striatum. The abrupt rostral re-direction of the pathway from the internal segment of the globus pallidus into the ventral thalamus—via the path of the ansa lenticularis—could be viewed as a footprint of this evolutionary transformation of basal ganglia outflow and targeted influence.|$|E
50|$|This small artery {{supplies}} the superior <b>colliculus,</b> inferior <b>colliculus,</b> and tectum of midbrain.|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} <b>colliculus</b> receives {{input from}} both the ipsilateral and contralateral cochlear nucleus and respectively the corresponding ears. There is some lateralization, the dorsal projections (containing vertical data) only project to the contralateral inferior <b>colliculus.</b> This inferior <b>colliculus</b> contralateral to the ear it is receiving the most information from, then projects to its ipsilateral medial geniculate nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} <b>colliculus</b> also receives auditory {{information from}} the inferior <b>colliculus.</b> This auditory information is integrated with the visual information already present to produce the ventriloquist effect.|$|E
50|$|The collicular artery or quadrigeminal artery {{arises from}} the {{posterior}} cerebral artery. This small artery supplies portions of the midbrain, especially the superior <b>colliculus,</b> inferior <b>colliculus,</b> and tectum.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} inputs {{terminate}} in the inferior <b>colliculus,</b> {{although there are}} a few small projections that bypass the inferior <b>colliculus</b> and project to the medial geniculate, or other forebrain structures.|$|E
50|$|The {{thalamus}} {{and superior}} <b>colliculus</b> are connected via lateral geniculate nucleus. Superior <b>colliculus</b> (SC) is the topographical map for balance and quick orienting movements with primarily visual inputs. SC integrates multiple senses.|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} <b>colliculus</b> {{is involved}} with saccadic eye movements; while the inferior is a synapsing point for sound information. The trochlear nerve {{comes out of the}} posterior surface of the midbrain, below the inferior <b>colliculus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inferior <b>colliculus</b> - Contralateral stimulation.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{accepted}} that the primate superior <b>colliculus</b> is unique among mammals, {{in that it}} does not contain a complete map of the visual field seen by the contralateral eye. Instead, like the visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus, each <b>colliculus</b> represents only the contralateral half of the visual field, up to the midline, and excludes a representation of the ipsilateral half. This functional characteristic is explained by the absence, in primates, of anatomical connections between the retinal ganglion cells in the temporal half of the retina and the contralateral superior <b>colliculus.</b> In other mammals, the retinal ganglion cells throughout the contralateral retina project to the contralateral <b>colliculus.</b> This distinction between primates and non-primates {{has been one of the}} key lines of evidence in support of the flying primates theory proposed by Australian neuroscientist Jack Pettigrew in 1986, after he discovered that flying foxes (megabats) resemble primates in terms of the pattern of anatomical connections between the retina and superior <b>colliculus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{posterior}} <b>colliculus</b> is {{the posterior}} {{portion of the}} medial malleolus of the distal tibia which is smaller in size comparing to the anterior <b>colliculus.</b> It has an attachment of the posterior tibiotalar ligament which {{is a part of}} deltoid ligament on the medial side of the ankle.|$|E
50|$|The nucleus geniculatus {{medialis}} receives axons from auditory axons. From the cochlea, peripheral auditory information goes to {{the cochlear}} nucleus. From there, through the cochlear nerve, axons reach the superior olivary complex of both sides. Axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which ends in the inferior <b>colliculus.</b> Axons from the inferior <b>colliculus</b> constitute the brachium of the inferior <b>colliculus</b> and end in the medial geniculate. The thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the primary auditory cortex located {{in the center of}} the superior temporal plane. See auditory system.|$|E
50|$|The two {{superior}} colliculi sit {{below the}} thalamus and surround the pineal gland in the vertebrate midbrain. It comprises the dorsal {{aspect of the}} midbrain, posterior to the periaqueductal gray and immediately superior to the inferior <b>colliculus.</b> The inferior and superior colliculi are known collectively as the corpora quadrigemina (Latin, quadruplet bodies). The brachium of superior <b>colliculus</b> (or superior brachium) extends laterally from the superior <b>colliculus,</b> and, passing between the pulvinar and medial geniculate body, is partly continued into an eminence called the lateral geniculate body, and partly into the optic tract.|$|E
