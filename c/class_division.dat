The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E
5|$|The German {{forces in}} the area of the {{landings}} were under the command of Army Group G, and also divided between the 1st Army in the west and the 19th Army in the east. In June 1944, these three headquarters commanded three panzer divisions, around thirteen infantry divisions and some smaller formations. By this stage of the war, many of these divisions were lacking modern equipment, inexperienced and under-trained. The troops were mainly elderly, or not fit for service in a first <b>class</b> <b>division.</b> Some divisions had several complete battalions formed by the Ostlegionen (conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia). Four of the divisions were static or garrison divisions and five were reserve formations that had only been used in an internal security role against the French Resistance.|$|E

Lolohea was born in Kolofo'ou, a district of the capital city Nuku'alofa, and competed in Beijing as a 40-year-old in the men's super-heavyweight <b>class</b> <b>division,</b> which encompasses athletes who weigh more than 105kilograms. Lolohea had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The Tongan athlete competed in his event on August 19, where he faced 14 other athletes. During the snatch phase of the event, Lolohea was given three attempts. He successfully lifted 127kilograms on his first attempt, 135kilograms on his second attempt, and 140kilograms on his third and final attempt. During the clean and jerk phase of the event, he successfully lifted 173kilograms on his first try, but unsuccessfully attempted to lift 185kilograms on his second and third attempts. Because his highest scores were 140 in snatch and 173 in clean and jerk, Lolohea's final and total score was 313kilograms. Of the 13 competitors who finished the event, Maamaloa Lolohea finished last behind Sam Pera, Jr. of the Cook Islands (350kilograms), who in turn finished behind Finland's Antti Everi (366kilograms). Gold medalist Matthias Steiner of Germany, in contrast, lifted a total of 461kilograms.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dental arch width {{measurement}} {{is needed}} to determine diagnoses and orthodontic treatment planning of Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2  malocclusions that have narrow maxillary dental arch generally. Dental arch width in this study was measured by maxillary and mandibular intercanine width.  This study aimed to compare the differences of intercanine width between Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 malocclusions. Methods: Descriptive comparative research with total samples of 67 study models, consisted of 34 <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 cases and 33 <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 cases. The minimum age of the samples chosen was 13 years old with no history of orthodontic treatment. A non probability consecutive sampling technique was used. Results: Study results showed the avarage maxillary and mandibular intercanine width of <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 were 33, 99 mm and 26, 33 mm. Average maxillary and mandibular intercanine width of <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2 were 34, 77 mm and 25, 37 mm. Conclusions: T-test analysis showed no statistical significant differences in the intercanine width between Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2   malocclusions...|$|R

Under an imposed order to democratize, Habyarimana rallied the majority Hutus against what he depicted as their racial enemy—the Tutsis—in a measure to prevent both regional and <b>class</b> <b>division</b> from becoming politically relevant issues. Thus, this political climate ensured that national identity would be defined singularly across ethnic lines—a dangerous prelude to the ensuing genocide. The tense situation became inflamed with Habyarimana’s mysterious death in 1994.

The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, the middling yeomen (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels.

It remained in the Somme and Aisne area until January 1917, when it went into 1st Army reserve to rest and refit. After returning to the line, it saw action in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne (and by the Germans, the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne).

The division also was engaged in 1917 in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne and referred to in German sources as the Dual Battle of Aisne-Champagne (Doppelschlacht Aisne-Champagne). After a short spell in the trenches near Verdun, {{in the latter part}} of 1917, the division was sent to Flanders in response to the Allied offensive there. In October 1917, the division went to the Romanian Front and then to Ukraine after the armistice in Romania. It returned to the Western Front in April 1918, occupying the line near Verdun and then Reims, and then engaged in mobile defense. It ended the war facing Allied forces in the Hundred Days Offensive.

Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank you for that good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give me good food that sticks to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the mean values of various intra-arch distances in Class I, <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search engines PubMed, Embrace and Cochrane were employed to select articles for further study, and the sample thereby selected comprised adult subjects with full permanent dentition, without missing teeth, malformations or previous orthodontic treatment. Only subjects from articles published during the last 10 years {{were included in the}} study. RESULTS: The search located a total of 628 articles regarding arch form. However, only eight articles were chosen for the study. We observed that: the distance between mandibular canines is smaller in Class I than in <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1; mandibular inter-molar distance is similar in Class I and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1; maxillary inter-canine distance is similar in Class I, <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1; maxillary inter-premolar width is greater in Class I than in <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1; and that maxillary inter-molar width is similar in Class I and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in arch width were found between the different classes analysed (there are only slightly differences between classes), except in the case of mandibular inter-canine width (L 3), which was smaller in Class I than in Class II, 1, and maxillary inter-premolar width (U 4), which was smaller in Class II-I than in Class I...|$|R
