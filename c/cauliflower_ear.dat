5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear,</b> a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cauliflower</b> <b>ear</b> is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large bump in the ear; the bump tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear</b> one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear</b> it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect your ears from taking hard hits.|$|E

60|$|But it was Tom King's {{face that}} advertised him unmistakably {{for what he}} was. It was {{the face of a}} typical prize-fighter; of one who had put in long years of service in the squared ring and, by that means, {{developed}} and emphasized all the marks of the fighting beast. It was distinctly a lowering countenance, and, that no feature of it might escape notice, it was clean-shaven. The lips were shapeless and constituted a mouth harsh to excess, that was like a gash in his face. The jaw was aggressive, brutal, heavy. The eyes, slow of movement and heavy-lidded, were almost expressionless under the shaggy, indrawn brows. Sheer animal that he was, the eyes were the most animal-like feature about him. They were sleepy, lion-like--the eyes of a fighting animal. The forehead slanted quickly back to the hair, which, clipped close, showed every bump of a villainous-looking head. A nose twice broken and moulded variously by countless blows, and a <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear,</b> permanently swollen and distorted to twice its size, completed his adornment, while the beard, fresh-shaven as it was, sprouted in the skin and gave the face a blue-black stain.|$|E
60|$|Jerry Mitchell turned an {{appealing}} face to Ann. Ogden's revelations and especially his eulogy of Biggs' personal appearance had tormented him. He knew that, in his wooing of Mrs. Pett's maid, Celestine, he was handicapped by his looks, concerning {{which he had}} no illusions. No Adonis to begin with, {{he had been so}} edited and re-edited during a long and prosperous ring career by the gloved fists of a hundred foes that in affairs of the heart he was obliged to rely exclusively on moral worth and charm of manner. He belonged to the old school of fighters who looked the part, and in these days of pugilists who resemble matinee idols he had the appearance of an anachronism. He was a stocky man with a round, solid head, small eyes, an undershot jaw, and a nose which ill-treatment had reduced to a mere scenario. A narrow strip of forehead acted as a kind of buffer-state, separating his front hair from his eyebrows, and he bore beyond hope of concealment the badge of his late employment, the <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear.</b> Yet was he a man of worth and a good citizen, and Ann had liked him from their first meeting. As for Jerry, he worshipped Ann and would have done anything she asked him. Ever since he had discovered that Ann was willing to listen to and sympathise with his outpourings on the subject of his troubled wooing, he had been her slave.|$|E

50|$|Wrestling {{headgear}} is made {{to protect}} the wearer from long term injury. The constant bashing and beating on a wrestler's ears that comes from not wearing headgear can cause {{blood vessels in the}} ears to burst. These types of injuries do not cause any external bleeding; however incredibly painful sacs of blood will start to develop in the ears often resulting in permanent disfiguration of the ears. This condition is known as <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear.</b> Treatment of <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear</b> requires the wrestler see a doctor who will then drain the blood out of the ear via a needle. A wrestler may need to see a plastic surgeon to repair and/or treat a <b>Cauliflower</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{inflammation}} of the ear usually lasts {{a few days or}} more, rarely a few weeks, and then resolves spontaneously and recurs at various intervals. Because of the loss of cartilage, after several flares <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear</b> deformity may result. The outer part of the ear may be either floppy or hardened by calcifications of the scar tissue that replaces the cartilage. These <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ear</b> deformities occurs in about 10% of persons with RP.|$|E

60|$|It {{was less}} than a quarter of an hour later--such was the speed with which Nemesis, usually slow, had {{overtaken}} him--that Jerry Mitchell, carrying a grip and walking dejectedly, emerged from the back premises of the Pett home and started down Riverside Drive in the direction of his boarding-house, a cheap, clean, and respectable establishment situated on Ninety-seventh Street between the Drive and Broadway. His usually placid nervous system was ruffled and a-quiver from the events of the afternoon, and his <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ears</b> still burned reminiscently at the recollection of the uncomplimentary words shot at them by Mrs. Pett before she expelled him from the house. Moreover, he was in a mild panic at the thought of having to see Ann later on and try to explain the disaster to her. He knew how the news would affect her. She had set her heart on removing Ogden to more disciplinary surroundings, and she could not possibly do it now that her ally was no longer an inmate of the house. He was an essential factor in the scheme, and now, to gratify the desire of the moment, he had eliminated himself. Long before he reached the brown-stone house, which looked exactly like all the other brown-stone houses in all the other side-streets of uptown New York, the first fine careless rapture of his mad outbreak had passed from Jerry Mitchell, leaving nervous apprehension in its place. Ann was a girl whom he worshipped respectfully, but he feared her in her wrath.|$|R

5000|$|Torres {{was born}} in Santa Ana, California and after a long amateur career entered {{professional}} wrestling in 1946 debuting at the Olympic Auditorium and was very successful in the nascent and booming televised wrestling market in the California. He had no gimmicks, however his signature move was a deftly executed Flying Scissors. He used no self given stage name but a Mexican-market newspaper billed him as “La Pantera Negro de Sonora”, or [...] "The Black Panther from Sonora, Mexico," [...] due to his [...] "smooth and lightning-fast moves." [...] He would later be named [...] "The Mexican Adonis." [...] In his first year, he won the California version of the world heavyweight championship before losing it Gorgeous George, only to win it back the following year. In 1952 Torres and then-rival Baron Leone {{were involved in a}} case that {{went all the way to}} the Santa Monica Superior Court due to two fans claiming they were injured when Leone threw Torres into the crowd. Leone claimed if he was capable of the feat he'd leave wrestling to play for the Southern Cal football team, and the two were exonerated. http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/04/02/3897543.html One of Torres' greatest matches was in February 1953 while he was the reigning Pacific Coast Heavy Weight champion, he wrestled the legendary world heavyweight champion Lou Thesz to a one-hour draw. The gate was a then-record $5000 in Sacramento. He also claimed the Central States championship in 1952 and 1963. Due to his success Torres' brothers Alberto and Ramon wanted to join him in wrestling. Enrique worked with Alberto and Ramon; Rachel, Enrique’s second wife, worked to help train Ramon in the various wrestling holds and tactics. In time, with hard work and training in Oakland, CA they received Enrique's blessing and later went on the road. The three went on to be involved in a 'Vachon-Torres Brother War' in Georgia against the Vachon wrestling family. In 1971 Alberto would be the first to die, as a result of a ruptured pancreas from a match in the ring. Ramon would later die August 2000 of heart failure. In addition to his singles titles, Torres also held numerous tag team championships teamed with Bobo Brazil, Leo Nomellini, Ronnie Etchison, Johnny Barend, Jess Ortega, and his brothers in the 1950s and 1960s, ranging from Texas to the Central States territory. Enrique and Alberto wrestled a headliner match in Havana, Cuba the night that the Batista regime fell to Castro’s rebel army in 1959 and returned to the US with the help of his Promoter, Benny Ginsberg and his Meyer Lansky connections in Cuba. Enrique retired in 1968 after one last run as a headline star, living in California Hawaii and Nevada. In 1969 Enrique was asked to make a cameo appearance by Jimmy Lennon, a much loved sports announcer at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles for a celebration of twenty-five years of televised wrestling. Enrique later moved with his third wife Kata Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In 2006, a Japanese reporter visited Calgary, Canada to meet and interview Enrique one last time. Enrique remains highly respected and revered as part of the Japan Wrestling Association where he wrestled the Japanese Sumobasho circuit in the 1960s. His success came for his skills, talent, good looks and a convergence of technology and the need for television content in what would later become a $Multi-Billion market. Those were the days of real wrestling. He used to say, [...] "that these <b>cauliflower</b> <b>ears</b> didn't come from sleeping on hard hotel pillows, as well as his knee, back and other injuries sustained in the arena ring.
