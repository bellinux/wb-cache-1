40|$|According to the {{planetary}} origin conceptual model proposed in this paper, the protosun {{centre of the}} pre-solar nebula exploded, resulting in a shock wave that passed through it {{and then returned to}} the centre, generating a new explosion and shock wave. Recurrent explosions in the nebula resulted in a spherical standing sound wave, whose antinodes <b>concentrated</b> <b>dust</b> into rotating rings that transformed into planets. The extremely small angular momentum of the Sun and the tilt of its equatorial plane were caused by the asymmetry of the first, most powerful explosion. Differences between inner and outer planets are explained by the migration of solid matter, while the Oort cloud is explained by the division of the pre-solar nebula into a spherical internal nebula and an expanding spherical shell of gas. The proposed conceptual model can also explain the origin and evolution of exoplanetary systems and may be of use in searching for new planets. ...|$|E
30|$|During recent years, many Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) {{have shown}} {{expanding}} rings around {{the sources of}} the images. These rings were confirmed to be photons scattered by the <b>concentrated</b> <b>dust</b> grains. Some observations even showed that more than one ring existed near the sources, which indicated that there was more than one dust concentration along the line of sight (LOS) of a GRB (Vaughan et al., 2004; Tiengo et al., 2010). There are mainly two different ways to study the X-ray halos. The first is the delay property of the scattered photons. Because scattered photons travel through longer paths than unscattered photons, they must lag those unscattered photons. The length of the lag is related to both the location where the scattering takes place and the distance of the source. The exact scattering cross-section and the dust-grain properties are not important in this method. Trömper and Schönfelder (1973) and Hu et al. (2004) have also proposed to use the smeared property of the light curves to study the scattered halo. Because of the bad statistics in the data of the actual observations, these methods have not been tested so far. The other method is the halo-brightness distribution. Nearly all X-ray scattered halos are found by comparing the observed radial surface brightness with the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope used. The total fraction of the scattered X-ray photons can be derived by this method precisely. In summary, because the scattering process is related to the properties of the dust grains, i.e. the space distribution, the chemical composition, and the radii of the dust grains, we can study those properties with the X-ray scattered halos.|$|E

These images are also compared to optical {{images of the}} galaxies obtained with the HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC 2). In M 31 the nucleus remains distinctly asymmetric {{in all of the}} infrared bands, with no evidence of <b>concentrated</b> <b>dust,</b> although the distinction between the two nuclei, P 1 and P 2, is not as strong as in the WFPC and WFPC 2 images. This result is nonetheless consistent with the model of the nucleus as an eccentric stellar disk produced by the dynamical influence of a central supermassive black hole. Several individual M-giant stars are detected within ~ 3 " of the nuclei, and may represent stars that have escaped from the disk and phase-mixed around the nuclear center of mass. In M 32 we also do not find strong evidence of dust, and the brightness profiles within the central ~ 1 " of the infrared images can be fitted by a power law of the same form as that fitted to the optical images. The infrared color profiles of the central few arcseconds of M 32 show no strong gradients, and indicate a population dominated by K-giant stars. This is consistent with recent groud-based spectroscopy and photometry of the core region, which similarly show no strong gradients in age or metallicity within its stellar population.

Stellar and gas masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and metallicities are obtained from the analysis of a set of ancillary data. Dust is detected in 49 out of 140 optically identified dwarfs covered by the HeViCS field; considering only dwarfs brighter than mB = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43 %. After evaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the FIR-submm SEDs are best-fit by &# 0946;= 1. 5, with a median dust temperature Td = 22. 4 K. Assuming &# 0946;= 1. 5, 67 % of the 23 galaxies detected in all five Herschel bands show emission at 500 &# 0956;m in excess of the MBB model.

40|$|Streaming {{instability}} is {{a powerful}} mechanism which <b>concentrates</b> <b>dust</b> grains in pro- toplanetary discs, eventually up to the stage where they collapse gravitationally and form planetesimals. Previous studies inferred {{that it should be}} ineffective in viscous discs, too efficient in inviscid discs, and may not operate in local pressure maxima where solids accumulate. From a linear analysis of stability, we show that streaming instability behaves differently inside local pressure maxima. Under the action of the strong differential advection imposed by the bump, a novel unstable mode develops and grows even when gas viscosity is large. Hence, pressure bumps are found to be the only places where streaming instability occurs in viscous discs. This offers a promising way to conciliate models of planet formation with recent observations of young discs. Comment: 11 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|The Pasvik {{monitoring}} programme {{was created in}} 2006 {{as a result of}} the trilateral cooperation, and with the intention of following changes in the environment under variable pollution levels. Water quality is one of the basic elements of the Programme when assessing the effects of the emissions from the Pechenganikel mining and metallurgical industry (Kola GMK). The Metallurgic Production Renovation Programme was implemented by OJSC Kola GMK to reduce emissions of sulphur and heavy metal <b>concentrated</b> <b>dust.</b> However, the expectations for the reduction in emissions from the smelter in the settlement Nikel were not realized. Nevertheless, Kola GMK has found that the modernization programme’s measures do not provide the planned reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions. In this report, temporal trends in water chemistry during 2000 – 2009 are examined on the basis of the data gathered from Lake Inari, River Pasvik and directly connected lakes, as well as from 26 small lakes in three areas: Pechenganikel (Russia), Jarfjord (Norway) and Vätsäri (Finland). The lower parts of the Pasvik watercourse are impacted by both atmospheric pollution and direct wastewater discharge from the Pechenganikel smelter and the settlement of Nikel. The upper section of the watercourse, and the small lakes and streams which are not directly linked to the Pasvik watercourse, only receive atmospheric pollution. The data obtained confirms the ongoing pollution of the river and water system. Copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and sulphates are the main pollution components. The highest levels were observed close to the smelters. The most polluted water source of the basin is the River Kolosjoki, as it directly receives the sewage discharge from the smelters and the stream connecting the Lakes Salmijarvi and Kuetsjarvi. The concentrations of metals and sulphates in the River Pasvik are higher downstream from the Kuetsjarvi Lake. There has been no fall in the concentrations of pollutants in Pasvik watercourse over the last 10 years. Ongoing recovery from acidification has been evident in the small lakes of the Jarfjord and Vätsäri areas during the 2000 s. The buffering capacity of these lakes has improved and the pH has increased. The reason for this recovery is that sulphate deposition has decreased, which is also evident in the water quality. However, concentrations of some metals, especially Ni and Cu, have risen during the 2000 s. Ni concentrations have increased in all three areas, and Cu concentrations in the Pechenganickel and Jarfjord areas, which are located closer to the smelters. Emission levels of Ni and Cu did not fall during 2000 s. In fact, the emission levels of Ni compounds even increased compared to the 1990 s...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of planetesimals via gravitational instability {{of the dust}} layer in a protoplanetary disks demands that there be local patches where <b>dust</b> is <b>concentrated</b> {{by a factor of}} ∼ a few × 10 ^ 3 over the background value. Vortices in protoplanetary disks may <b>concentrate</b> <b>dust</b> to these values allowing them to be the nurseries of planetesimals. The concentration of dust in the cores of vortices increases the dust-gas ratio of the core compared to the background disk, creating a "heavy vortex. " In this work, we show that these vortices are subject to an instability which we have called the heavy-core instability. Using Floquet theory, we show that this instability occurs in elliptical protoplanetary vortices when the gas-dust density of the core of the vortex is heavier than the ambient gas-dust density by a few tens of percent. The heavy-core instability grows very rapidly, with a growth timescale of a few vortex rotation periods. While the nonlinear evolution of this instability remains unknown, it will likely increase the velocity dispersion of the dust layer in the vortex because instability sets in well before sufficient dust can gather to form a protoplanetary seed. This instability may thus preclude vortices from being sites of planetesimal formation. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R

The central surface brightness mu 0 and linear disk scale length h vary smoothly along the Hubble sequence of galaxies within a rather narrow interval. The disks of relatively early type galaxies display higher central surface brightnesses in K, higher central surface densities, smaller sizes (relative to {{the diameter of the}} galaxy), redder integrated and central colors. The color gradient normalized to the radius of the galaxy and the blue central surface brightness mu 0 _{ 0,i}(B) of the disk, are both independent of the galaxy type. The radial disk scales in different photometric bands differ less in early-type than in late-type galaxies. The ratio of linear disk scales measured in different photometric bands increases with the isophote ellipticity e of the disk (the inclination of the galaxy); however, the range of the ratio values for each e value exceeds the range of variations of scale lengths ratio over e. The disks in S 0 galaxies have more homogeneous parameters than those in spiral galaxies. However, no sharp boundary in the properties of disks in lenticular, spiral, and irregular galaxies has been found; all parameters vary smoothly along the Hubble sequence.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{detection}} of a time-dependent dust-scattered X-ray halo around a gamma-ray burst (GRB). GRB 031203 was observed by XMM-Newton starting 6 hr after the burst. The halo appeared as concentric ringlike structures {{centered on the}} GRB location. The radii of these structures increased with time as t 1 / 2, consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering caused by a large column of dust {{along the line of}} sight to a cosmologically distant GRB. The rings are due to <b>dust</b> <b>concentrated</b> in two distinct slabs in the Galaxy located at distances of 880 and 1390 pc, consistent with known Galactic features. The halo brightness implies an initial soft X-ray pulse consistent with the observed GRB...|$|R
50|$|Urban dust domes are a {{meteorological}} phenomenon in which soot, dust, and chemical emissions become {{trapped in the}} air above urban spaces. This trapping is a product of local air circulations. Calm surface winds are drawn to urban centers, they then rise above the city and descend slowly {{on the periphery of the}} developed core. This cycle is often a cause of smog through photochemical reactions that occur when strong concentrations of the pollutants in this cycle are exposed to solar radiation. These are one result of urban heat islands: pollutants <b>concentrate</b> in a <b>dust</b> dome because convection lifts pollutants into the air, where they remain because of somewhat stable air masses produced by the urban heat island.|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} from our sublimation {{experiments in the}} laboratory offer a potential solution. Since {{it seems likely that}} the heavier isotope is being <b>concentrated</b> on the <b>dust,</b> different values for the D/H ratio will be obtained depending on the provenance of the water vapor used for analysis. If that water vapor has been desorbed from dust grains, it is likely to have a higher D/H ratio than solid buried cometary ice. This will be especially true near the start of any degassing cycle before the comet has reached perihelion. Thus the D/H values obtained for comets in flybys of comae may not be at all representative of the reservoirs from which those comets formed depending on the stage of outgassing at which those comets are observed.|$|R
40|$|The DEMOCRITUS code is a particle-based {{code for}} plasma-material {{interaction}} simulation. The code {{makes use of}} particle in cell (PIC) methods to simulate each plasma species, the material, and their interaction. In this study, we <b>concentrate</b> on a <b>dust</b> particle immersed in a plasma. We start with the simplest case, in which the dust particle {{is not allowed to}} emit. From here, we expand the DEMOCRITUS code to include thermionic and photo emission algorithms and obtain our data. Next we expand the physics processes present to include the presence of magnetic fields and collisional processes with a neutral gas. Finally we describe new improvements of the code including a new mover that allows for particle subcycling and a new grid adaptation approach. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using {{infrared}} photometric data {{extracted from}} the 2 MASS, IRAS and MSX databases, 142 suspected young stellar objects (YSOs) are selected from about 2 million stars in the Camelopardalis segment of the Milky Way limited by Galactic coordinates ℓ, b = 132 – 158 ◦, ± 12 ◦. According to radial velocities of the associated CO clouds, the objects are attributed to three molecular and dust cloud layers at 150 – 300 pc, ∼ 900 pc and 2. 2 kpc distances from the Sun. These objects <b>concentrate</b> into <b>dust</b> and molecular clouds and exhibit extremely large reddenings (AV up to 25 mag) which {{can be caused by}} the dust in foreground clouds and circumstellar envelopes or disks. In the J–H vs. H–K diagram these objects lie above the intrinsic line of T Tauri variables, roughly along the black-body line. Among the identified objects, some already known YSOs are present, including the well investigated massive object GL 490. The spectral energy distributions between 700 nm and 100 µm suggest that the objects may be YSOs of classes I, II and III. However, we do not exclude the possibility that {{a small fraction of the}} objects, especially those without IRAS and MSX photometry, may be unrecognized heavily reddened OB-stars, latetype AGB stars or even galaxies...|$|R
40|$|We present H and K band imaging {{spectroscopy}} {{of the core}} regions of the cD/AGN galaxy NGC 1275. The spectra, including lines from H 2, H, 12 CO bandheads, [FeII], and [FeIII], are exploited to constrain the star formation and excitation mechanisms in the galaxy's nucleus. The near-infrared properties can largely {{be accounted for by}} ionized gas in the NLR, dense molecular gas, and hot <b>dust</b> <b>concentrated</b> near the active nucleus of NGC 1275. The strong and compact H 2 emission is mostly from circumnuclear gas excited by the AGN and not from the cooling flow. The extended emission of latetype stars is diluted in the center by the thermal emission of hot dust.

40|$|Abstract. Reddening of {{the major}} axis {{compared}} to the minor axis on a given isophote, and asymmetry of the run of surface brightness and colour along the minor axis, are possible signatures of <b>dust</b> <b>concentrated</b> in the disk of an inclined two components galaxy, the first being somewhat ambiguous. From CFHT observations, these phenomena are shown to occur in nearly all disky ellipticals of sufficient flattening. They may also occur in the inner “decoupled ” disks, appearing in some ellipticals both boxy and disky. HST frames in Lauer et al. (1995) for a few objects confirm the present findings. Future modelling of diffuse dust in E classified galaxies should take into account this property of its distribution.
