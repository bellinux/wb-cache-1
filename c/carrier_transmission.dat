5000|$|A related {{concept is}} the {{combination}} of a single <b>carrier</b> <b>transmission</b> with the single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization (SC-FDE) scheme. [...] The single <b>carrier</b> <b>transmission,</b> unlike SC-FDMA and OFDM, employs no IDFT or DFT at the transmitter, but introduces the cyclic prefix to transform the linear channel convolution into a circular one. After removing the cyclic prefix at the receiver, a DFT is applied to arrive in the frequency domain, where a simple single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization (SC-FDE) scheme can be employed, followed by the IDFT operation.|$|E

A different structure for STBC single <b>carrier</b> CDMA <b>transmission</b> system based on chip-interleaved block-spread (CIBS) CDMA [17] was proposed in [18]. The structure in [18], though promising excellent performance, incurs in a relatively high computational complexity to update the equalizer coefficients [19].

50|$|The Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1998 {{comprises}} a set {{of regulations}} which govern the transmissions of television stations in the United States, specifically imposing the restriction of satellite <b>carrier</b> <b>transmissions</b> of a network station's transmissions only to subscribers who cannot receive these broadcasts via antenna and have not subscribed to a cable system providing these broadcasts, and which also concern regularizing satellite carriers' submission of lists of subscribers to networks, the coordination of broadcasting fees with territorial coverage of transmissions, {{and the distribution of}} fees to copyright owners of works included in transmissions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carrier</b> current <b>transmission</b> (originally called wired wireless) employs guided {{low-power}} radio signals, {{which are}} transmitted along electrical conductors. The transmissions are {{picked up by}} receivers that are either connected to, or a short distance from, the conductors. <b>Carrier</b> current <b>transmission</b> is used to send audio and telemetry to selected locations, and also for low-power broadcasting that covers a small geographical area, such as a college campus. The {{most common form of}} carrier current uses longwave or mediumwave AM radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring, although other conductors can be used, such as telephone lines.|$|R

50|$|Siemens Brothers and Company Limited {{was bought}} by Associated Electrical Industries in 1955. At that time its {{business}} was described as follows: manufacture sale and installation of submarine and land cables, overhead telegraph, telephone and power transmission lines, public and private telephone exchanges and <b>carrier</b> <b>transmission</b> equipment for telephone lines and marine radio and signalling equipment.

The Commission found that e-mail, voice mail, the World Wide Web, newsgroups, fax store-and-forward, interactive voice response, gateway, audiotext information services, and protocol processing are enhanced services.|$|E
30|$|In this work, {{we design}} low {{complexity}} mitigation techniques for multicarrier nonlinear satellite channels {{working at the}} symbol rate (data level). The reason for using data level instead of signal level in the mitigation techniques is twofold: first, data level operation does not introduce a spectral regrowth in the predistorted signal as required for the satellite regulatory authority [3]. Secondly, the inclusion of DPD in an early stage in the communication system (as data level) reduces the computational resources required for the mitigation technique while simultaneously enable the DPD deployment in scenarios where the signal level is not accessible or available, for instance, in <b>carrier</b> <b>transmissions</b> from different gateways.|$|R
30|$|Interface {{engineering}} {{is essential for}} the PEDOT:PSS/n-Si solar cells because it optimizes the <b>carriers</b> <b>transmission</b> and separation and reduces the interface recombination velocity [11]. Several common methods are used to improve the PCE of PEDOT:PSS/n-Si heterojunction solar cells: reducing the thickness of crystalline silicon by depositing film crystalline silicon, applying colloidal quantum dot, texturing silicon surface into nanostructures, introducing the back surface field(BSF), and applying silicon nitride or silicon oxide as a passivation layer [5, 6, 12 – 21]. However, the contact properties of PEDOT:PSS with textured substrate has seldom been considered, which raises the Jsc and efficiency of PEDOT:PSS/n-Si hybrid solar cells from the perspective of interface engineering.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability for}} {{electrical}} conductors {{to act as}} waveguides for radio signals was noted in {{the earliest days of}} radio experimentation, and Heinrich Hertz published the first review of the phenonmenon in 1889. By 1911, Major General George Owen Squier was conducting some of the earliest studies designed to put <b>carrier</b> current <b>transmissions</b> — which he called [...] "wired wireless" [...] — to practical use. To be effective, the radio transmitter must be capable of generating pure continuous-wave AM transmissions. Thus, the technology needed to set up <b>carrier</b> current <b>transmissions</b> would not be readily available until the late 1910s, with the development of vacuum tube transmitters and amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|Optical <b>Carrier</b> <b>transmission</b> {{rates are}} a {{standardized}} set of specifications of transmission bandwidth for digital signals {{that can be}} carried on Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) fiber optic networks. Transmission rates are defined by rate of the bitstream of the digital signal and are designated by hyphenation of the acronym OC and an integer value of the multiple of the basic unit of rate, e.g., OC-48. The base unit is 51.84 Mbit/s. Thus, the speed of optical-carrier-classified lines labeled as OC-n is n × 51.84 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The {{line trap}} {{acts as a}} barrier or filter to prevent signal losses. The {{inductive}} reactance of the line trap presents a high reactance to high-frequency signals but a low reactance to mains frequency. This prevents carrier signals from being dissipated in the substation or in a tap line or branch of the main transmission path and grounds {{in the case of}} anything happening outside of the <b>carrier</b> <b>transmission</b> path. The line trap is also used to attenuate the shunting effects of high-voltage lines.|$|E

[...] His 1928 paper is considered as [...] "the single most important prerequisite" [...] for Shannon's theory of information. After about 10 years of illness {{he returned}} to Bell Labs in 1939 as a consultant.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY This paper proposes per-tone {{equalization}} {{methods for}} single <b>carrier</b> block <b>transmission</b> with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) systems. Minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) based optimum weights of the per-tone equalizers are derived for SISO (single-input single-output), SIMO (single-input multipleoutput), and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) SC-CP systems. Unlike conventional frequency domain equalization methods, where discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is employed, the per-tone equalizers utilize sliding DFT, {{which makes it}} possible to achieve good performance even when the length of the guard interval is shorter than the channel order. Computer simulation results show that the proposed equalizers can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the SISO, SIMO, and MIMO SC-CP systems with the insufficient guard interval. key words: per-tone equalization, single <b>carrier</b> block <b>transmission,</b> cyclic prefix 1...|$|R

5000|$|Member {{stations}} {{invested in}} earth station receiving equipment to {{be a part}} of the new PRSS in the form of a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cover all costs with the stipulation that the radio station must be on the air for a minimum of 18 hours per day and have at least 3 full-time employees. After a period of years the stipulations would cease and the earth station would become the property of the radio station. The equipment included a receiving dish and an analog audio receiver manufactured by network hardware manufacturer Coastcom http://www.coastcom.com under the master contract held by Rockwell. The dish was aimed to Westar 1, the satellite used by PRSS at its debut, and later to Westar IV after the former satellite was retired in 1983. The receiver was able to tune into the several audio channels uplinked by NPR on two transponders on the satellite. The audio channels, transmitted in analog using FM modulation, were multiplexed on each transponder using SCPC (Single Channel Per <b>Carrier)</b> <b>transmission.</b> The receivers were pre-programmed for 12 channels. There were additional channels that were available and accessible by special Coastcom receivers that were frequency agile or by the upgrade of a microchip to the existing 12 channel demodulators already installed at the radio station. The additional channels were rented out to various programming including commercial content. Later, channels 13 and 14 were for a period leased to the CMSS (the Classical Music Satellite Service), a third party produced service outside of NPR, that was available to public radio stations who paid to air the service. Each transponder was labeled on the receiver as [...] "NPR A" [...] and [...] "NPR B", with a red illuminated numeric LED display of the channel number on each receiver with each channel tunable to any desired IF-based SCPC frequency.|$|E

Network resources in LTE are mainly {{similar to those}} in UTRAN, as both rely on baseband, radio <b>carrier,</b> and <b>transmission</b> interface capacity as critical resources. Nevertheless, these LTE studies lack of real field validation. Instead, our study has been written from on field experience and it is especially a practical for actual field network operation.|$|R
5000|$|Murphy {{began his}} radio career in 1982 {{at the campus}} radio station of George Mason University, WGMU. That summer he worked the midday shift at WVBK-AM in Herndon, Virginia, without being paid. At the start of 1983, he was named station manager of WGMU, {{just as it was}} {{transitioning}} from a closed circuit broadcast available only in the Rathskeller to a <b>carrier</b> current <b>transmission</b> which could be heard in the dorms and student apartments on any AM radio.|$|R
25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed <b>carrier</b> <b>transmissions</b> are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|R
