5|$|Massachusetts {{has a long}} {{political}} history; earlier {{political structures}} included the Mayflower Compact of 1620, the separate Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies, and the combined colonial Province of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified in 1780 while the Revolutionary War was in progress, {{four years after the}} Articles of Confederation was drafted, and eight years before the present United States <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on June 21, 1788.

It has been amended 120 times, most recently in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} {{and signed by}} a majority of delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the new constitution but also for state officials that would be elected if the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{governors}} of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 the state <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended {{to change this}} to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, rather than have their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term. Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.|$|E

5|$|A centenary {{celebration of}} Brooke rule in Sarawak {{was held in}} 1941. During the celebration, a new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} that would limit {{the power of the}} Rajah and granting the Sarawak people a greater role in the functioning of government. However, this <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> never fully implemented due to the Japanese occupation. That same year saw the British withdrawing its air and marine forces defending Sarawak to Singapore. With Sarawak now unguarded, the Brooke regime adopted a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri were to be destroyed and the Kuching airfield held as long as possible before being destroyed. Nevertheless, a Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 and conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941, with British ground forces retreating to Singkawang in neighbouring Dutch Borneo. After ten weeks of fighting there, the Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942. Charles Vyner Brooke, the last Rajah of Sarawak, had already left for Sydney, Australia; his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp.|$|E
5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision.

25|$|The second legal {{criterion}} <b>is</b> {{that the}} <b>constitution</b> must <b>be</b> rigid.

5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
