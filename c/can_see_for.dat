Each complex must {{have at least one}} soldier garrisoned for the territory to expand. To recruit soldiers, the player must build a barracks, with each individual soldier requiring their requisite weapon to transition from settler to soldier.

However, it {{has been established in}} other cases that imperfect mimicry can confer significant advantage to the mimic, especially if the model is really noxious. Also, not only is polymorphism absent from these mimics, it is absent in the wasps also: these facts are presumably connected.|$|E

Soldiers are automatically created from the pool of existing settlers in the headquarters, with each individual soldier requiring a sword, shield, and one unit of beer. Once soldiers are garrisoned, gold coins can be transported to the building to increase their rank.

500|$|After the Hermits tour, the Who {{recorded}} {{their next}} single, [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles", which Townshend {{had written in}} 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well. [...] Townshend called it [...] "the ultimate Who record", and was disappointed it reached only No.10 in the UK. It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.9. The group toured the US again with Eric Burdon and the Animals, including an appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, miming to [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>For</b> Miles" [...] and [...] "My Generation". Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by flying cymbal shrapnel. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.|$|E

500|$|The next {{album was}} The Who Sell Out—a concept album paying tribute to pirate radio, {{which had been}} outlawed in August 1967 by the Marine, , Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967. It {{included}} humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, a mini rock opera called [...] "Rael", and [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>For</b> Miles". The Who declared themselves a pop art group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded {{a wide variety of}} radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the American Cancer Society, in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture. Townshend stated, [...] "We don't change offstage. We live pop art." ...|$|E
500|$|A few {{songs on}} the album show classic rock influences. The intro to the opening track [...] "Breakerfall" [...] uses a guitar riff similar to The Who song [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles" [...] (from the 1967 album, The Who Sell Out). Additionally, [...] "Soon Forget", which {{features}} Vedder playing a ukulele, is heavily influenced by The Who song [...] "Blue, Red and Grey" [...] (from the 1975 album, The Who by Numbers), with Vedder describing it as [...] "30 seconds of plagiarising" [...] and thanking Pete Townshend on the lyric sheet. The song [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] {{has been compared to}} the style of Pink Floyd.|$|E
500|$|Psychedelic rock's {{popularity}} accelerated {{following the}} success of the Monterey Pop Festival and the release of the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in the same week of June. The album was the first commercially successful work that critics heralded as a landmark aspect of psychedelia, and the Beatles' mass appeal meant that the album would be played virtually everywhere. The Summer of Love of 1967 saw a huge number of young people from across America and the world travel to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, boosting the population from 15,000 to around 100,000. It was prefaced by the Human Be-In event in March and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival in June, the latter helping to make major American stars of Janis Joplin, lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jimi Hendrix, and the Who. Existing [...] "British Invasion" [...] acts now joined the psychedelic revolution, including Eric Burdon (previously of The Animals) and The Who, whose The Who Sell Out (December 1967) included psychedelic influenced tracks [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles" [...] and [...] "Armenia City in the Sky". The Incredible String Band's The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion (July 1967) developed their folk music into full blown psychedelia, which would be a major influence on psychedelic rock.|$|E

500|$|The Who {{developed}} {{from an earlier}} group, the Detours, and established themselves {{as part of the}} pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, [...] "I Can't Explain", reached the UK topten, followed by a string of singles including [...] "My Generation", [...] "Substitute" [...] and [...] "Happy Jack". In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US topten single [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera Tommy, included the single [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's Who's Next, which included the hit [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again". The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.|$|E
2500|$|The Who {{commenced}} {{their first}} US tour on 22 March 1967. It {{did not start}} well, as Townshend and Daltrey were briefly jailed for assaulting a police officer they mistook for a heckler. Townshend took to trashing his hotel suites, though not {{to the extent of}} his bandmate Moon. He also began experimenting with LSD, though stopped taking the drug after receiving a potent hit after the Monterey Pop Festival on 18 June. Released in December, their next album was The Who Sell Out—a concept album based on pirate radio, which had been instrumental in raising the Who's popularity. It included several humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, and the Who's biggest US single, [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles". Despite the success of [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles", which reached number 9 on the American charts, Townshend was surprised it was not a smash hit, as he considered it the best song he'd written up to that point.|$|E

2500|$|McCartney was {{inspired}} to write the song after reading a 1967 Guitar Player magazine interview with the Who's Pete Townshend where he described their latest single, [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles", as the loudest, rawest, dirtiest song the Who had ever recorded. McCartney then [...] "wrote 'Helter Skelter' {{to be the most}} raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera" [...] and said he was [...] "using the symbol of a helter skelter as a ride from the top to the bottom; {{the rise and fall of}} the Roman Empire – and this was the fall, the demise." [...] In British English, a helter skelter is an amusement park attraction which features a tall spiral slide winding round a tower. McCartney has used since this song as a response to critics who accuse him of writing only ballads.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Machover, the {{solicitor}} {{acting on}} behalf of Rigg's brother Wayne, reacted: [...] "Now that the IPPC has published its February 2010 report, the public <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> itself that the IPCC failed to properly examine the most basic evidence in its possession in Sean Rigg's case, including police incident records, photographs of the restraint and CCTV footage, which meant that officers were never asked key questions until the inquest. This helps to account for the gulf between the IPCC's ludicrous findings and the jury's damning narrative verdict: so, while the IPCC gave the police {{a clean bill of health}} in 2010, two weeks ago the inquest jury was highly critical of every aspect of the police conduct, including the eight minutes restraint in the prone position, a fact totally missed by the IPCC." [...] Deborah Coles of the charity group Inquest, which campaigns {{on behalf of}} bereaved families with a particular focus on deaths in custody, said: [...] "The IPCC investigation was fundamentally flawed from the outset and it is shameful that without the relentless and dogged determination of the family and their legal team, so many of these failures would never have been uncovered." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009 Pete Townshend of The Who, an English {{rock band}} that {{established}} {{itself in the}} 1960s, identified Purcell's harmonies, particularly the use of suspension and resolution that Townshend had learned from producer Kit Lambert, as an influence on the band's music (in songs such as [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] (1971), [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>for</b> Miles" [...] (1967) and the very Purcellian intro to [...] "Pinball Wizard"). The processional section from Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary was adapted for the synthesiser by Wendy Carlos {{to serve as the}} theme music for the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange; the music is also featured in the final scene of the 1995 film The Young Poisoner's Handbook.
