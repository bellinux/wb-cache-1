A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E

Lack of funds meant that the mill was left as an unfinished base for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Thomas Webb, who owned the Little Mill, bought the unfinished mill and financed its completion in 1816. A steam engine was added in 1889 as auxiliary power. The mill was worked by wind until 1905, when the sails and stage were removed. It worked by steam engine until 1918, and was demolished in 1924. The mill's brick base was left, serving as a corn store in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Patient R.B. was a {{normally}} functioning man {{until the}} age of 52. At age 50, he had been diagnosed with angina and had surgery for heart problems on two occasions.

It wasn't until after his death that researchers had the chance to examine his brain, when they found his lesions were restricted to the CA1 portion of the hippocampus. This case study led to important research involving the role of the hippocampus and the function of memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} tenant {{of the oval}} was the North Melbourne Cricket Club. The cricket club first started playing at the ground in 1868. The cricket club began to share the oval with the football club in 1882, with the football club using the oval in winter, and the cricket club using the oval in the summer. Historically this arrangement has been difficult and the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs have not got along. In 2007, the cricket club moved its First and Second XIs playing base to J. J. Holland Park in neighbouring Kensington, but its Third and Fourth XIs remained at Arden Street; the club left Arden Street altogether in 2010, playing and training nomadically at Holland Park, Albert Park and Royal Park for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> moving permanently to the outer north-western suburb of Greenvale in 2013.|$|E

500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was {{getting in the way of}} his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{determining}} {{the impact of the}} variability of marine environment conditions on the capture of a vessel that exploit the red seabream fishery of the Strait of Gibraltar. This paper estimates first and second order elasticities of a Translog approximation of a Stochastic Distance Functions of multiple outputs assuming time unvarying technical efficiency in order to get this aim. The evidences that sea surface temperatures have influence on growth and maturation and on the development of hermaphroditic gonads of different kinds of seabream support the consideration of sea surface temperatures as an approximation of the variability of marine environment conditions. Additionally, the growth pattern of red seabream provides meaningful information of this fish species that justifies looking in the relation between landings or red seabream abundance, and sea surface temperatures during spring with a lag of no less than two seasons. This paper concludes that technical efficiency of red seabream fleet is of 88 % in period 2002 - 2004 and that an increase of 1 % of mean sea surface spring temperature lagged 2 seasons results on a 27. 50 % decrease of captures. This paper also concludes that the relationships between the marine environment factors and the evolution of red seabream exploited fish stock take place a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> the season and therefore the expected recruitment is known before it. This allows the policy-maker to design an adaptive management strategy accounting these relationships for a certain season once the historical evolution of the marine environment factors is known...|$|R

50|$|Around 1183 envoys {{came from}} the County of Flanders to ask for Theresa's hand in {{marriage}} to Count Philip.

Her marriage was celebrated (in the Tournai Cathedral, Bruges) after the death of Elisabeth of Vermandois, first wife of Philip, who hadn't given him any children, and was because Philip needed an heir so that his county wouldn't fall into French hands. For its part, Portugal, a new-born country, managed to secure an important alliance with Flanders, and European recognition. Theresa brought a considerable dowry, something that helped Philip manage his war with France for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> more <b>years,</b> <b>before</b> making peace in 1186.
