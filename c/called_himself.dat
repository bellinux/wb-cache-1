5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria {{proved more}} {{dangerous}} to Yamhad than Mari.

Shamshi-Adad surrounded Yamhad by alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu {{to the north and}} by conquering Mari to the east forcing Zimri-Lim the heir of Mari to flee. Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Lim and aimed to use him against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Though Stowell's {{hypothesis}} was incorrect, his article rekindled {{interest in the}} Jack the Ripper case, and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series, Jack the Ripper, which investigated the Whitechapel murders. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by fictional detectives Barlow and Watt, played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor, respectively. The series {{was made into a}} book, The Ripper File, by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in 1975. The sixth and final programme included a testimony by Joseph Gorman, who <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter Walter Sickert. Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders.
