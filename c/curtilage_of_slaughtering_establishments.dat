50|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>curtilage</b> is {{relevant}} to {{town and country planning}} in the United Kingdom, particularly as it relates to listed building legislation.

Current legislation uses a cut-off date of 1947, so that later additions, while they may be within the curtilage, are not included in the listing designation.|$|R

Based on an officer's naked eye observation, a search warrant was granted. After the trial court rejected Ciraolo's motion to suppress the evidence (under the exclusionary rule), he pleaded guilty.
