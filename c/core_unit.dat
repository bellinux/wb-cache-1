They also offer Siege Catapults and ballistae with mantlets, led by Gothmog; these siege engines are often {{operated}} by Mordor Trolls, which can also be used as shock troops. Mordor armies can field a variety of troops to diversify their armies, including Morgul Knights and Black Numénórean Warriors, Orc Trackers,which provide a rare form of accurate archery, Morgul Stalkers, Warg Riders and even Shelob. However, the most dreaded element of Mordor armies is the Ringwraith on Fell-Beast, which, as a flying creature, can move around the board unimpeded and strike with dark magic. Mordor can be allied with any Evil army except Angmar or Isengard. Sauron is only ever fielded in person in campaigns set around the Last Alliance (or in Dol Guldur armies).|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Armed Forces {{recently}} {{underwent a}} transformation from conscription-based recruitment {{to a professional}} defense organisation. This {{is part of a}} larger goal to abandon the mass army from the Cold War and develop an army better suited to modern maneuver warfare and at the same time retain a higher readiness. Since 2014, the Swedish army has had around 50,000 soldiers in either full-time or part-time duty, with eight mechanized infantry battalions instantly available at any time and the full force of 71 battalions ready to be deployed within one week. The regular army consists of 8 mechanized maneuver battalions, 19 support battalions of different kinds including artillery battalions, anti-aircraft battalions, combat engineer battalions, rangers, logistics battalions and 4 reserve heavy armored battalions and 40 territorial defense battalions. The battalion is the <b>core</b> <b>unit</b> but all units are completely modular and can be arranged in combat teams from company to brigade level with different units depending on the task. There are a total of 6 permanent staffs under the central command capable of handling large battlegroups, 4 regional staffs and 2 brigade staffs.|$|E
25|$|The Green Garter Band (GGB) is {{a select}} group of twelve players that plays at {{numerous}} additional events for the University of Oregon.

The group has a faculty advisor, the Director of Athletic Bands, {{but for the most part}} is entirely run by its student members. The Green Garter Band performs for all UO Women's Volleyball home games, UO Women's Basketball home games, many UO Softball home games and serves as the <b>core</b> <b>unit</b> of the OBB and OMB. Each year, the GGB also gives approximately 20-25 performances at special Athletic Department events, for the UO School of Music and Dance, for the University at large, and at various special events within the community. In return for their large commitment, Green Garter Band members are awarded scholarships equal to about 12 in-state credits. The demand for the GGB is so high that in 2002 the Yellow Garter Band (YGB) was created to help fulfill the number of requests coming in. The Yellow Garter Band is identical to its Green counterpart in most regards, but has a slightly smaller commitment. In return for their commitment, members of the YGB receive a large book scholarship every term. Together, the Green and Yellow Garter Bands have gained recognition and acclaim on campus, in the community and even nationally.|$|E

40|$|To obtain {{background}} information for code prescriptions for the shear and torsion interaction in hollow core floors, finite element analyses of some basic cases were made. A simplified global model for complete floors developed in Lundgren et al. (2004) was used, where {{the height of}} the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> is included. Analyses where the longitudinal joints between the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> were assumed to act as hinges were also carried out. Several set-ups were modelled, in total 30 floors. 12 floors with an even number of hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> (2, 4, and 6) were loaded with a point load on the joint in the centre of the floor. Furthermore, one example of each load case described in the Annex C in prEN 1168, was analysed. These examples include both line and point loads, and with and without a third line support. In all the analyses, the chosen span was 12 m, and the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> were 400 mm high and 1200 mm wide. The analyses show that the maximum torsional moment was reduced when {{the height of the}} hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> was included in the analyses, compared to when hinges were assumed between the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units.</b> Also the bending moment was reduced, in most of the studied set-ups. This reduction was rather small. On the other hand, the shear force increased when the height of the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> was included, especially the shear force at the supports. In four of the studied set-ups, a direct comparison to the present code, CEN/TC 229 (2004), regarding the load distribution could be done. In CEN/TC 229 (2004), it is not clear if the given distributions are valid for the bending moments at mid span or the shear forces at the supports. It {{is important to note that}} the distribution of these differ. No clear answer to which of these results that were considered in the code could be found...|$|R

2500|$|The Blab-off was a wired {{remote control}} created in 1952 that turned a TV's sound {{on or off}} so that viewers could avoid hearing commercials. In the 1980s Steve Wozniak of Apple started a company named CL 9. The purpose of this company {{was to create a}} remote control that could operate {{multiple}} electronic devices. The <b>CORE</b> <b>unit</b> (Controller Of Remote Equipment) was introduced in the fall of 1987. The advantage to this remote controller was that it could [...] "learn" [...] remote signals from different devices. It had the ability to perform specific or multiple functions at various times with its built-in clock. It was the first remote control that could be linked to a computer and loaded with updated software code as needed. The <b>CORE</b> <b>unit</b> never made a huge impact on the market. It was much too cumbersome for the average user to program, but it received rave reviews from those who could. These obstacles eventually led to the demise of CL 9, but two of its employees continued the business under the name Celadon.

40|$|To obtain {{background}} information for code prescriptions for the shear and torsion interaction in hollow core floors, finite element analyses of some basic cases were made. A simplified global model for complete floors developed in Lundgren et al. (2003) was used. A set-up with two simply supported hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> connected along a longitudinal joint {{and support of}} tie beams was modelled. The hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> were loaded with a point load situated at the longitudinal joint. Several parameters were varied; i. e. the section height, the slab length, an assumed gap in the longitudinal joint, stiffness of the tie beams, and the loading position. When the two hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> are loaded, they will deflect and rotate equally much, as there is symmetry. Therefore, no shear force will be transferred in the longitudinal joint. Compressive contact forces will appear at the upper edge of the longitudinal joint, while the lower edge of the longitudinal joint will open without any force transfer. The main studied result from the analyses is {{the distribution of the}} contact forces along the upper edge of the longitudinal joint. The results show that the contact forces in the longitudinal joint had typically a peak where the point load was applied. When no gap was assumed in the longitudinal joint and the tie beams were assumed to be infinitely stiff, compressive contact forces appeared towards the supports, almost in triangular shaped blocks. These blocks decreased and vanished when the stiffness of the tie beams decreased, and also when there was a gap in the longitudinal joint. In the analyses where a gap was assumed in the longitudinal joint between the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units,</b> no contact is obtained for low loads. After a certain load, contact is obtained, and the contact forces between the hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> start to act. This load can be predicted by hand calculations. As the analyses are non-linear, the results from various load cases can not be super positioned. This was demonstrated in one example. In the studied set-up with only two hollow <b>core</b> <b>units,</b> the deflections in horizontal bending were of the same magnitude as the deformations due to torsional rotations. Therefore, very small reductions in torsional moments were observed. The torsional moments would most likely be more reduced if floors with more hollow <b>core</b> <b>units</b> were studied...|$|R
