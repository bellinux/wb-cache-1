5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> is, in part, attributable to service by low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an emerging international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.|$|E

5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz.

5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full operational capability in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E

5|$|Many Katangese gendarmes {{and their}} {{mercenary}} leaders {{took refuge in}} Angola to reorganise, acting under orders from Tshombe. In 1964, Tshombe was welcomed back to the Congo and made prime minister. He immediately called on his forces to suppress communist revolts {{in the east and}} centre of the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> they accomplished but Tshombe was dismissed from his post in 1965, ultimately losing all contact with them following his imprisonment in Algeria in 1967. Relations between the new central government and the gendarmes soured and after a mutiny was repressed, they returned to Angola. An insurgency for Katangese secession continued until late 2016.|$|E
5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan {{was ruled}} by {{successive}} military shoguns.

The Shoguns were the hereditary military governors, with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo. Although the Emperor was the sovereign who appointed the Shogun, his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> is often compared to the present role of the Emperor, whose official role is to appoint the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for {{loss of citizenship}} based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> statute also mandated loss of citizenship for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E

5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|The high {{concentration}} and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the UK allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby {{giving rise to}} an exceptional variety of breeds {{in relation to the}} land mass of the <b>country.</b> <b>This</b> greater variety of breeds also produced a valuable variety of products to compete with the superfine wool of Spanish sheep. By the time of Elizabeth I's rule, sheep and wool trade was the primary source of tax revenue to the Crown of England and the country was a major influence in the development and spread of sheep husbandry.|$|E
