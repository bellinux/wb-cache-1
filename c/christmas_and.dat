5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E

5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season as the team were left with much to do; a poor run of form during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> New Year period effectively ruled the team out of retaining the championship. Arsenal finished the season strongly however – unbeaten in 16 matches, to end the campaign in fourth place. Wright was Arsenal's top goalscorer with 26 goals.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a victory}} over the Buffalo Sabres after <b>Christmas,</b> <b>and</b> with the team still mired in 14th place in the Western Conference, General Manager and Executive Vice President Darryl Sutter {{announced}} his resignation from both positions on December 28, exactly eight years after {{he was hired by}} the team to become its coach in 2002. The move was not entirely Sutter's decision, as he was asked by the organization to step aside. The decision came as a shock to many fans, even as it was believed to be inevitable following the team's decline in recent seasons. Jay Feaster assumed control of the team, serving as acting general manager.|$|E

During this time, Linkin Park reunited with their original bassist, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell. The band kept an online journal on their official website throughout their 2001 and 2002 touring regime, in which each band member made a respective notation. Although the notes are no longer on their website, they are available on fansites. Linkin Park played 324 shows in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated {{with other}} local {{charities}} with similar purposes, {{to form the}} Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at <b>Christmas,</b> <b>and</b> distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|In the {{transfer}} window, Arsenal purchased several players, including midfielders Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit and goalkeeper Alex Manninger; English midfielder Paul Merson departed to join Middlesbrough. Arsenal began the league season relatively well, but {{a run of}} three defeats in four matches between November and December 1997 left the team in sixth position before <b>Christmas,</b> <b>and</b> seemingly out of championship contention. Although they were 12 points behind reigning champions Manchester United {{at the end of}} February, a winning streak of nine matches ensured Arsenal won the championship with a 4–0 win over Everton on 3 May 1998.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country.

Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of <b>Christmas,</b> <b>and</b> condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
