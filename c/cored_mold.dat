50|$|AutoCAST is a {{software}} program for casting methods design, simulation and optimization developed by IIT Bombay. It uses geometric reasoning for automating the design of casting methods elements - <b>cores,</b> <b>mold</b> cavity layout, feeders, feedaids and gating channels. Fast and intelligent simulation technology is employed to visualize mold filling and casting solidification in near-real time. Foundry engineers can quickly import a 3D model of cast part, create methods elements, simulate the casting, predict internal defects (like shrinkage porosity and sand inclusion), and modify the methods design to improve quality and yield. Product designers can improve the casting design for manufacturability by minor modifications, such as fillets at junctions. This enables better compatibility between part requirements and process capability, leading to zero defects.|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) manufacturing often is an expensive, time-consuming small-scale production {{where most of the}} products and components are characterized by complex geometric properties. Especially for hollow components it is necessary to use removable <b>mold</b> <b>cores,</b> which are typically made of low-melting metal alloys, and used to shape the inner contour of the component. To improve the time-consuming and costly process of mold-making, this paper describes the application of additive manufacturing (i. e. 3 D-printing) for the production of <b>mold</b> <b>cores.</b> The outstanding advantage of additive manufacturing is the very flexible production out of a CAD model without further tools. In the provided case study materials for additive manufacturing were selected and tested for their suitability to manufacture <b>mold</b> <b>cores.</b> For this purpose an exemplary <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> was produced with different additive manufacturing methods and used in common carbon fiber production processes. Since curing in the autoclave places the highest demands on the core, this process has been selected to test the <b>mold</b> <b>cores.</b> A special focus was on the analysis of the dimensional stability and accuracy by measuring the deviations of the inner cores after the autoclave cycle. The analysis was performed by using optical metrology utilising stripe light projection. Finally this case study shows that additive manufacturing can lead to an increase in efficiency in the CFRP production but also that further scientific research and technological development are needed to realize the indicated potentials...|$|R

40|$|The {{injection}} molding is the technique most used for processing polymers.

The assessment of the coefficient of friction was carried out with the help of one apparatus that possibility this type of measurement.

40|$|Abrasive flow machining(AFM) is an {{effective}} method that can remove the recasting layer produced by wire electrical discharge machining(WEDM). However, the surface roughness will not be easily uniform when a complex hole is polished by this method. CFD numerical method is aided to design good passageways to find the smooth roughness on the complex hole in AFM. Through the present method, it reveals that the shear forces in the polishing process and the flow properties of the medium in AFM play the roles in controlling the roughness on the entire surface. A power law model was firstly set up by utilizing the effect of shear rates on the medium viscosities, and the coefficients of the power law would be found by solving the algebraic equation from {{the relations between the}} shear rates and viscosities. Then the velocities, strain rates and shear forces of the medium acting on the surface would be obtained in the constant pressure by CFD software. Finally, the optimal <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> put into the complex hole could be designed after these simulations. The results show that the shear forces and strain rates change sharply on the entire surface if no <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> is inserted into the complex hole, whereas they hardly make any difference when the core shape is similar to the complex hole. Three experimental types of <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> were used. The results demonstrate that the similar shape of the <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> inserted into the hole could find the uniform roughness on the surface.

He and his coworkers would pack mud very precisely into the exact shape of {{the interior of the}} bell, apply tallow and wax to the exterior, then cover it in a layer of mud. Aaron Hobart taught Revere how to make the mud for the bell: [...] "one part horse dung, one sand, and one part clay. For nowel and cope, six parts horse dung, one-sand, one-clay and some cow horn." [...] The model would then be heated from below, allowing the wax to drip out and the mud would harden into the bell mold. Molten bronze would be poured and cooled. After the cast bell was removed from the mold, Revere and his employees would painstakingly clean, polish, and tune the bell by hand. After casting and polishing the bells, Paul Revere generally mounted his bells using a cast and then tuned the bells by removing metal from the interior of the bell. This practice of tuning with a tuning hammer continued into the early 20th century. Throughout the tuning process, the notes made by striking the bell were frequently compared with the tones made by a tuning fork.|$|R
