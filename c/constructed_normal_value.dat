Thereafter {{the case of}} Norwegian salmon is presented and industry context added, before the anti-dumping proceedings are presented comprehensively. The main {{focus is on the}} alternative methods to establish normal value when there is no viable home market, as this exercise raises a number of intriguing cost allocation problems. Finally, status quo on the salmon case and anti-dumping rules expected evolution is briefly addressed. Key words: Anti-Dumping, <b>Constructed</b> <b>normal</b> <b>value,</b> Salmon...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyDumping is to unfairly sell goods {{at a lower price}} (at foreign market) as compared to their normal value at domestic market of the manufacturing country, thus causing material injury to the local industry of the importing country. Other researchers have explored the global (WTO Agreement) and the European Union’s (EU) Anti-Dumping law mostly with a commercial perspective. At doctoral level EU-China, EU-Japan and EU-Korea trade relations with reference to the application of protective measures have been studied. This dissertation is, however, the very first aimed to examine the application of EU Anti-Dumping law relating to Pakistan. This is a complete health check of EU-Pakistan trade relations with reference to the application of Anti-dumping duties on Pakistan. This study is a combination of doctrinal research and empirical research, whereby it critically evaluates the Commission’s investigation and the judgements of the EU Courts related to Pakistan and thus establish their consistency or inconsistency; it also studies the voting patterns within the Council and the impact of AD duties on Pakistani imports. It is a qualitative exploratory study based upon an inductive approach. Contradictions are found in the calculations of normal value and export price, <b>constructed</b> <b>normal</b> <b>value,</b> the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the calculation of injury. Suggestions are made as {{to the extent to which}} Unions’ anti-dumping rules need to be reviewed to moderate their tilt that unequivocally favours Union manufacturers. Moreover, this dissertation identifies many provisions of the basic regulation, which being too vague offers multiple interpretations, which are thus recommended to be amended. In the empirical part of this research the voting style of EU member states for or against the adoption of AD measures against Pakistan has been studied. Thereafter, the content analysis of stated reasons for specific voting styles reveals that the member states vote on the basis of the findings and conclusions of investigation as done by the Commission, thus trade partner loyalty is not the reason for their voting. Furthermore, application of the ADDs is found to be reason of import decline from Pakistan to the EU...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Commission of the European Community has made Korea one of three main target {{countries}} of anti-dumping measures, because Korea is pressing to export more of the electronics products which the Community is struggling to protect, study of the Community Antidumping Law in Korea has barely begun. Therefore, in this thesis, the measures that may be imposed by Community authorities with respect to trade with countries not members of the European Community, especially with Korea, under the Community Anti-dumping Regulation, {{in the context of the}} GATT Anti-dumping system are explained and analysed. With regard to the Community's anti-dumping rules, protectionist bias in their application is examined, in particular the determination of normal value and export price, <b>constructed</b> <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> and constructed export price, the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the determination of injury, and proposals are made as to the extent to which the Community anti-dumping rules need to be revised to diminish the bias in their range that explicitly favours Community producers and a finding of dumping, in the context of the GATT rules. With regard to the Korean Anti-dumping rules, on the other hand, they are introduced, generally. Anti-dumping measures in Korea have not been applied properly in favour of Korean producers, mainly because of the lack of transparency and institutional inertia. Therefore, enactment of a special Act governing anti-dumping complaints, modelled on a unitary system rather than a bifurcated system, should be considered for the transparent and speedy investigations. Institutional inertia must be rectified, i. e., more precise definition is required in some terminologies, and provisions on cumulation and anti-circumvention should have been prescribed before their application. Through a comparative study of the anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea, it becomes clear that various aspects of the technical methodology applied by the authorities in anti-dumping determinations have a tendency to make findings of dumping largely automatic and inevitable. Therefore, it must always be borne in mind that anti-dumping measures can be imposed only where dumping and resulting injury is actually established, not artificially. This study has looked at anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea comparatively, in the context of the GATT Anti-dumping rules. The Community refers to GATT and the Code in the preamble of its anti-dumping regulation, which has no binding effect in Court, and adopts the regulation in accordance with existing international obligations, in particular those arising from Article VI of the GATT and from the GATT Anti-dumping Code. However, this does not ensure an interpretation in conformity with GATT rules and its spirit, because the wording of the GATT anti-dumping rules taken literally is very ambiguous and can be interpreted very differently. Therefore, a comparative study with the Community's antidumping rules and its practice as a legislative model should be very helpful, in order to improve the current Korean anti-dumping system, because the GATT anti-dumping rules can play a very limited role only as a guideline...|$|E
40|$|The Korean {{government}} has officially recognized China {{as a full}} market economy. This paper investigates the impact of grantingThe Korean {{government has}} officially recognized China as a full market economy. This paper investigates the impact of granting market economy status to China on antidumping (AD) duties and imports. With regard to non-market economies (like China), it is presumed that prices and costs are influenced by state interference and, therefore, authorities use prices and costs from a third party economy to <b>construct</b> <b>normal</b> <b>values.</b> This, however, leads to higher dumping margins. This paper examines the use of Non-Market Economy (NME) on dumping margins and statistical analysis finds that NME, in fact, raises margins by 18. 7 ∼ 27. 3 %. Furthermore, the imposition of AD duties significantly restrains trade; for example, a 10 % AD duty causes imports to fall by about 1. 5 ~ 3. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{issue of}} {{establishing}} reference values, especially of those pertaining to somatic features, is {{of importance for}} an assessment of normal growth. It was assumed that norms ought to reflect not the actually existing status but the recommended one. Thus, weight-height relations, including body mass index (BMI), ought to be established for that fraction of the general population, in which body fat content is within physiologically acceptable limits. The aim of the study: To construct weight-to-height percentile norms {{for boys and girls}} aged 7 - 20 years. Material and methods: A cohort of healthy boys (n= 1282) and girls (n= 1150) attending schools in the Eastern regions of Poland participated in the study. Their body height, body mass and body fat content were determined, the latter by skinfold (Slaughter&# 8217;s method) or bioimpedance measurements. The data for <b>constructing</b> <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> of body fat content were compiled from diverse sources so as to associate them smoothly with the <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> for adults. Results: By applying the proposed lower and upper limits of body fat, 1007 boys (78. 5 %) and 581 girls (50. 5 %) with acceptable fat content were selected for constructing percentile norms of body mass expected for height, as well as for BMI. Conclusions: The existing norms for BMI of children and youths, also the Polish ones, differ from each other, as these were not based on data from subjects with acceptable body fat and assessing body fat content from BMI is known to be markedly biased. Unlike BMI, the presented percentile weightfor-height norms are age-independent in the range 7 - 20 years and are thus much easier to use. Those norms may be recommended as a tool in assessing the course of normal growth, as well as in developmental disorders and possible clinical intervention...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to summarize current information about the <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> on infant sleep polysomnography for clinical use. MethodsMEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and CINAHL (Ovid) from January 1976 to May 2007 were searched. Two reviewers independently reviewed all relevant articles, using preset inclusion criteria. The population of interest included children aged less than 1 year. Studies in infants with known major anomalies were excluded. The results on apneas were extracted and analyzed. ResultsFor obstructive apnea, the upper limit of <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> was less than 1. 0 per hour, and for mixed apnea, the current data suggested the upper limit of <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> was less than 1. 0 per hour. For central apnea defined as cessation of respiratory efforts for more than 3 seconds, the current data suggested that the upper limit of the normal central apnea index was 45 per hour for 1 -month-old infants, 30 per hour for 2 -month-old infants, 22 per hour for 3 -month-old infants, and between 10 and 20 for the older age groups. For the desaturation episode defined as SpO 2 less than 80 % for any length of time, the current data suggested the upper limit of <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> to be 14. 7 episodes per hour for day 1, 41 episodes for day 4, and 15. 1 episodes for day 39. ConclusionThe <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> of obstructive apnea, mixed apnea, and central apnea are well established for neonates and infants. With these <b>normal</b> <b>values,</b> sleep polysomnography study should be routinely used to quantify the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in those neonates at risk for these disorders...|$|R
40|$|History and Objectives: Arterial blood gases (ABG) have various {{clinical}} diagnostic <b>values,</b> however their <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> are {{not known}} in our country. Therefore, this investigation was conducted {{in order to determine}} <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> for PaO 2, PaCO 2, HCO 3 - and pH among healthy 18 - 74 years old in autumn and winter of 1995 in Kashan. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study on 121 randomly selected healthy individuals from medical records. Arterial blood was taken from the radial blood arteries {{in order to determine the}} <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> and the confidence intervals. Results: <b>Normal</b> <b>values</b> of PaO 2 were 91. 9 Â± 9. 8 mmHg and 94. 4 Â± 11. 5 mmHg in men and women respectively. The linear formula was PaO 2 = 103. 59 - 0. 29 X age (year) and PaCO 2 values were 38 Â± 3. 5 mmHg and 36 Â± 4. 36 mmHg for men and women respectively. The <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> for HCO 3 - were 22. 6 Â± 2. 12 meq/L and 21. 4 Â± 1. 96 meq/L for men and women respectively and pH values were 7. 4 Â± 0. 02 and 7. 4 Â± 0. 04 for men and women respectively.

40|$|AIM: To measure puerperal {{symphysis}} fundus distance (SFD) by two manual {{methods and}} to calculate individual <b>normal</b> <b>values.</b> Study design: Prospective cohort study including women after single pregnancy without special problems in uterine involution. METHODS: SFD was daily measured on the 1 (st) - 5 (th) postpartum days by counting {{the number of}} midwife's fingers put horizontally on the mother's abdomen and by a paper tape, respectively. Linear mixed model analysis was performed to determine SFD <b>normal</b> <b>values.</b> RESULTS: Independent variables determining the SFD on different days after delivery were the gestational age and the delivery mode (finger method) and the maternal age, body mass index (BMI), delivery mode and birth weight (tape method). Individual <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> were calculated by regression equation including the coefficients for the independent variables. CONCLUSION: Puerperal SFD values measured by tape have more independent variables than those measured by fingers and reflect better the actual situation of the patient. It should be verified whether <b>values</b> deviating from <b>normal</b> <b>values</b> of tape measurements may prevent postpartum complications...|$|R
30|$|As an example, for the VR_DB attribute, a <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> {{should be}} near to 30  % for adult {{patients}} (18  < Age <  60). However, for the elderly, a <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> is around 25  %; and {{for children and}} young patients, a <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> is close to 60  %. Also, the same principle applies to VR_HG, PSR α, CSR α, CSR β and VR_Ort attributes except that the critical values differ from one attribute to another. Nevertheless, we notice that the average value for VR_DB is 46.23  % which shows {{that a lot of}} patients suffer from difficulties in case of breathing efforts. In general, a <b>normal</b> HR <b>value</b> should be between 60 beats/min and 80 beats/min, and a <b>normal</b> <b>value</b> of BP should be between 100 and 140 for systolic values. These values were calculated using devices that measures HR and BP directly from patients through a set of sensors. These devices are adopted by the specialists of the ANS unit for several years. According to Table  2, the min and max values detected have far exceeded the normal ones for both HR and BP which shows that there are some patients that are suffering from serious problems that need to be treated urgently.|$|R
