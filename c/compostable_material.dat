40|$|Optimum {{moisture}} content (MC) for three different <b>compostable</b> <b>materials</b> was estimated through the relationship `MC vs. FAS', where FAS is the free air space, which is {{calculated from the}} values of both particle and bulk density (method 1). As the determination of particle and bulk density was complicated and tedious, two simplifications of the method 1 were tested to obtain an easier approach to establish the optimum MC. The first one (method 2) assumed that bulk density was a constant value (calculated for dry samples), independent of the {{moisture content}} of the sample. The second approach (method 3) {{was based on the}} measurement of the porosity of the materials. Independently of the method used for the estimation of FAS, values of MC and FAS were linearly correlated with high determination coefficients. Regression lines of methods 1 and 2 were comparable only for a fibrous material (cotton gin trash) because bulk density increased slightly when MC increased. For the other materials (grape marc and olive press cake) the simplification assumed by method 2 was not valid due to great increases of bulk density when MC increased. However, the comparison of the regression lines showed that methods 1 and 3 were not statistically different for the three materials tested. Thus, the optimum MC (FAS= 30 - 36 %) of <b>compostable</b> <b>materials</b> can be estimated by a simple method that requires only easy measurements of porosity at several moisture contents.

Israel is grappling {{with the task of}} designing an efficient (and politically acceptable!) solid-waste policy, taking into consideration externalities associated with alternative disposal options and the pervasive NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome. This paper analyzes alternative waste management options for the country, including collection, transportation, and processing costs, landfill tipping fees as well as environmental externalities, for a representative Israeli town. Externality costs may increase disposal costs by about 10 per cent. A source separation option, namely, sorting of the waste into wet, clean <b>compostable</b> <b>material</b> and dry fractions was found to be the least costly option when landfill tipping fees are higher than 15 US$.

40|$|Abstract On-site {{composting}} {{is examined}} {{as an alternative}} method of organic waste disposal in San Francisco Bay Area restaurants. Since 74 % of an average restaurant’s waste stream is <b>compostable</b> <b>material,</b> composting and reuse of organic material would redirect {{a significant portion of}} the waste stream from landfills. Economic, ecological, and social costs and benefits of three methods of organic waste disposal are compared: landfilling, off-site composting, and onsite composting. A waste characterization of one large Emeryville restaurant is performed to determine the mass of the organic waste generated. An economic analysis of the three methods of organic waste disposal is made for the specifications of this particular restaurant and ecological and social considerations are proposed for each method. Two commercially available composting technologies are compared. For the more appropriate technology, present discounted value and payback period of the hypothetical investment are calculated based on the current expenditures for landfilling service. An ecosystem modeling method is performed as a means to visually represent ecological sustainability. A life-cycle approach is taken to determine the ecological impacts of the use of agricultural soil conditioners and fertilizers, impacts that would be curbed to the extent that restaurant compost is used in their place.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} has as primary aim to improve environmental, {{economic and social}} conditions, both at local territorial and global level. The sustainability represents a complex concept often confused with the environmental impact reduction. A complete sustainability investigation depends on the environmental impacts and also on its economic and social consequences, both in absolute and relative terms. The research shows as the method of life cycle assessment (LCA) {{can be used to}} do a complete sustainability analysis of a case study. Specifically the study has the objective to evaluate, through the LCA approach, the environmental impacts of an integrated waste management plant projected in Lebanon and also to estimate economic and social effects related to this plant. The plant was dimensioned to serve the population of Union of Commons of Baalbek. It consists of a sorting and composting plants, an anaerobic digester plant and a sanitary landfill located in the Caza of Baalbek. The environmental analysis was conducted using the SimaPro 8. 2 software and the IMPACT 2002 + evaluation method. The inventory analysis has been conducted using primary and secondary data whenever available. The remaining data have been obtained from the EcoInvent database v. 2 - v. 3. In the analysis have been included (i) the municipal solid waste collection, (ii) the waste separation (with different sorting process technologies to divide recyclable items, <b>compostable</b> <b>material</b> and not-differentiated inert waste) (iii) the pretreatment of recyclable material, (iv) anaerobic digestion of organic material, (v) composting of the remainder organic material and of the anaerobic digestion product, (vi) disposal in a landfill of not recyclable material, (vii) the use of anaerobic digestion biogas to produce electricity by cogeneration. An economic quantification, differentiating incoming, investments and operation costs of the plant has been done. Finally, the social effects with an estimation of benefits deriving from the introduction of a new waste management system in a developing country have been considered. Three specific indicators to demonstrate (i) the occupation (jobs related to the waste management system), (ii) the function of the system (the management of municipal solid waste) and (iii) the management mode choice (that is representative of the combination introduced by the system of alternative waste treatment) have been used...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the presence of recyclable and <b>compostable</b> <b>materials</b> in the residual wastes (or residue) produced with the separate collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) in two municipalities of the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy, namely Maiori and Tramonti. In the light of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system, the money recovery for the Municipalities from the recoverable materials was evaluated, on the one hand, and the sociological reasons for the wrong behaviours in separating MSW components were analysed, on the other hand. 58. 5 % and 41. 5 % were the average percentages of recyclable and <b>compostable</b> <b>materials</b> wrongly found in the residue of Maiori and Tramonti, respectively. On the base of the economic value of the recyclables and the avoided cost of landfill disposal, it was possible to calculate the amount of possible money recovery: 11, 900 Euro/month for Maiori and 2100 Euro/month for Tramonti. A sociological survey was conducted with a structured questionnaire in the same areas where the composition analysis was performed. The areas with the lowest percentages of recyclables in the residue corresponded to the areas in which the highest number of correct answers to questions in the knowledge section of the questionnaire were given, as well as to the areas in which the highest presence of school and university graduates are living. The fraction of recyclables in the residue increases with wrong answers to questions in the knowledge section of the questionnaire as well as with the number of people defining “discards” the fractions that they separate from MSW.
