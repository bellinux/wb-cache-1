5|$|Indictment against Blythe {{was brought}} by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík. Mužík had tried {{a number of}} murderers, such as Luboš Mika (life in prison), Roman Fidler (life {{imprisonment}} at 1st instance, 25 years on appeal), Maria Zolotukinová (13 years imprisonment) and Petr Procházka (11 years imprisonment). He also tried a case against Andranik Soghojan, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting 25 {{years in prison for}} ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court. Another of Mužík's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž, a vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association.|$|E
25|$|For those {{accused of}} a felony, their case is sent to a court part where felony cases await {{the action of the}} grand jury. If the grand jury finds that there is enough {{evidence}} that the accused has committed a crime, it may file an indictment. If the accused waives their right to a grand jury, the prosecutor will file a Superior Court Information (SCI). If the grand jury votes an indictment, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> transferred from Criminal Court to the Supreme Court for another arraignment. This arraignment is similar to the arraignment in Criminal Court, and if the accused does not submit a guilty plea, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> adjourned to a calendar part.|$|E

25|$|Season three {{begins with}} Beverly Hills being shaken {{up by an}} {{earthquake}} as the main characters start out their senior year. Naomi spent the summer isolating herself, assuring her friends' visits by promising money from her trust fund. She decides to report her rape by Mr. Cannon, but backs out after discovering that her <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> made more difficult by her previous false accusations. Later, her sister Jen overhears Naomi and Silver's conversation and decides {{to take matters into}} her own hands with the help of Ryan, who had seen Cannon and Naomi in the school while he was there drunk. When Naomi finds enough proof to press charges, Cannon disappears. Cannon was from the UK, and had actually been accused many times of rape prior to attacking Naomi. Later, Jen feels that she is a bad mother, and leaves her son in the hands of Ryan.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} the {{oscillator}} representation in infinite dimensions is due to Irving Segal and David Shale. Graeme Segal used it to give a mathematically rigorous construction of projective representations of loop groups and the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. At an infinitesimal level {{the construction of the}} representations of the Lie algebras, in this case the affine Kac–Moody algebra and the Virasoro algebra, was already known to physicists, through dual resonance theory and later string theory. Only the simplest <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> considered here, involving the loop group LU(1) of smooth maps of the circle into U(1) = T. The oscillator semigroup, developed independently by Neretin and Segal, allows contraction operators to be defined for the semigroup of univalent holomorphic maps of the unit disc into itself, extending the unitary operators corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the circle. When applied to the subgroup SU(1,1) of the diffeomorphism group, this gives a generalization of the oscillator representation on L2(R) and its extension to the Olshanskii semigroup.|$|E
25|$|In Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S., {{after losing}} before {{a three-judge panel}} of the Federal Circuit, the {{government}} petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that the FDIC is Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. The FDIC receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the en banc court agrees and finds that appropriated funds {{may not be used}} to pay judgments against NAFI's, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> produced by the banks regulated by the FDIC and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, the FDIC could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find the FDIC a NAFI, the government is arguing that Congress has no obligation to honor its promises to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.|$|E

The Christian Science Monitor took a more detached view in an editorial: [...] "The outcome of the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> watched by government and political parties {{around the world as}} to how the United States, as an outstanding exponent of democratic government, intends to share the benefits of its civil liberties and yet protect them if and when they appear to be abused by enemies from within".|$|E

500|$|The typical <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> of a non-fatal offence {{against the}} person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} need to show intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by gross negligence manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E
500|$|Chicago-based singer-songwriter Rickey Allen pushed {{allegations}} that [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{was inspired by}} a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, which was copyrighted in the mid-1990s and 2000 and performed locally during that time. He claimed he handed over a version to producer Maurice Joshua, who allegedly went on to cover the song with Destiny's Child. Joshua denied his claims, noting that he never held a copy of Allen's song. Allen filed a lawsuit against the group for compensation in a Chicago, Illinois court in 2006 where the trio was due to appear in December 10 for an eight-day trial. However, they managed to avoid any given court dates after their public split in 2005 and agreed to settle behind closed doors. In early December 2009 it was confirmed by Chicago Sun-Times that the group had reached a settlement with Allen. His attorney, Matthew Wildermuth, said in a statement, [...] "I can confirm that yes, [...] did settle. All of the issues have been amicably resolved and the case is going to be dismissed. [...] excited about being able to devote time to pursuing his musical career. All legal terms and agreement will not be released and the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> dismissed by a judge".|$|E
500|$|... "In these days, the {{construction}} and guidance of airships have been improved greatly", wrote The Providence Journal, [...] "and it is supposed, both by the Parisian experts and by the Swedish scientists who have been assisting M. Andree, {{that the question of}} a sustained flight in this <b>case</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> very satisfactorily answered by the character of the balloon, by its careful guidance and, providing it gets into a Polar current of air, by the elements themselves."Faith in the experts and in science was common in the popular press, but with international attention came also for the first time informed criticism. Andrée being Sweden's first balloonist, no national had the requisite knowledge to second-guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but both Germany and France had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about Andrée's methods and inventions. However, just as with the Svea mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andrée's optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known aeronaut and balloon builder Henri Lachambre in Paris, world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer silk balloon, 20.5meters (67ft) in diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called Le Pôle Nord (French for [...] "The North Pole"), was to be renamed Örnen (Swedish for [...] "The Eagle").|$|E
