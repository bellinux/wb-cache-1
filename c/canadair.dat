25|$|<b>Canadair's</b> top {{management}} {{was of the}} opinion that Lear’s concept was sketchy at best. Lear did not have an expert grasp of aeronautical engineering. He was also at a financial low point, with a skeleton staff. Thus, he had only been able to pay a California aeronautical consultant to do some very preliminary design explorations.|$|R
5|$|The largest {{recreational}} park in Sarnia is Germain Park, which incorporates five baseball diamonds, four soccer fields, {{an outdoor}} pool, and the Community Gardens.

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, new {{versions}} of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the Avro Tudor, military transport aircraft such as the Avro York, and the <b>Canadair</b> North Star which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer, and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while <b>Canadair</b> was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of deaths {{took place in}} Pedrógão Grande when a fire swept across a road filled with evacuees escaping in their cars. Portuguese officials dispatched more than 1,700 firefighters nationwide to combat the blazes and Prime Minister António Costa declared three days of national mourning. Spain, France, Morocco and Italy deployed firefighters and Water Bombers <b>Canadairs</b> to help extinguish the fires. Although most official reports point to a dry thunderstorm {{as the cause of}} the tragedy, the president of the Portuguese Firefighters League expressed his conviction the fire was provoked by arsonists.|$|R
50|$|The antiquity of the Pont Ambroix {{had never}} been disputed {{and it had been}} visited by Mérimée, who {{included}} it in the first edition of his Historical Monuments of France in 1840. The hill behind, the Colline de Devès was not investigated until the 1960s. In 1964 Marc Fenouillet did a surface inspection of the vineyard {{at the base of the}} hill and found Roman era remains. In November 1967, the first archaeological test digging was made on the hill itself by Jean-luc Fiches and traces of the oppidum were found, a larger volunteer dig was made the following July. In 1974, a path had been cleared around the ramparts and the oppidum was recognised and classified as an historic monument. A regular pattern of annual digs had been established. The paved road was discovered in 1975. Between 1980 and 1985 work established that the lower site adjacent to the bridge was a staging post on the Via Domitia. In 1984 the hill was donated to authorities in Lunel but the lower site remains in private ownership. There was a pause in the excavations between 1986 and 1992 and now the focus was on the lower site and the contours of the river. In 2009 Lunel started constructing a visitor welcoming centre and museum, work was interrupted in May 2011 by an accidental fire that set the vegetation alight. Four <b>Canadairs</b> were called in to help the sapeur-pompiers extinguish the fire, they made two passes. The fire revealed more features in the oppidum. The museum designed by Michel Goroneskoul opened on 25 June 2011.|$|R
5|$|No.410 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 December 1946 as an Air Defence squadron flying de Havilland Vampire F.3 aircraft, and was re-formed from a defence role {{into that}} of a fighter role at St Hubert (Montreal), Quebec on 1 December 1948. From May 1949 to August 1951, the Blue Devils aerobatics team formed, to demonstrate the abilities of the new Vampire aircraft at formation flying. The squadron later converted to <b>Canadair</b> Sabres and was deployed to Europe, flying from RCAF Station North Luffenham in the UK, and then at RCAF Station Marville (No.1 (Fighter) Wing) in France. The squadron {{had been the first}} regular force fighter unit to fly the Vampire aircraft and was the first to fly the Sabre and the first to join No.1 (Fighter) Wing of No.1 Air Division Europe.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Balado's record flight, the Argentine Air Force {{reviewed}} {{its decision}} to acquire 100 Pulqui IIs for its fighter force. The Fábrica Militar de Aviones considered that, based on the spares and wing and fuselage components at hand, ten aircraft could be constructed relatively quickly, however {{the remainder of the}} order would take five years to complete. Up to this time, the attrition of the original 100 Meteor F 4s obtained in the late 1940s continued, with plans for an alternative replacement, initially centered on the acquisition of 36 <b>Canadair</b> F-86 Mk 6 Sabres, being rejected in 1956 when the Central Bank of Argentina was unable to provide the necessary foreign exchange.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the <b>Canadair</b> Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their <b>Canadair</b> CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E

It served with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and later the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) until it was replaced by the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet.|$|E
25|$|With the {{suspension}} of Frontier Airlines Airbus A319 service to Denver in January 2015, all commercial airlines operating out of Santa Barbara had regional airline affiliates flying smaller regional jet aircraft. American Eagle flights to Phoenix are operated with Mesa Airlines <b>Canadair</b> CRJ-900s. In June 2016, American Eagle relaunched service to Dallas-Fort Worth with <b>Canadair</b> CRJ-900 aircraft and American Airlines took over the route on an Airbus A319 jet. Additional mainline service returned to the airport in the Summer of 2017 when United Airlines began service to Denver and San Francisco utilizing Airbus A319/A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft on select flights June 8, 2017. United Express flights to San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Denver operated by SkyWest use <b>Canadair</b> CRJ-200s, <b>Canadair</b> CRJ-700s and Embraer E175s. SkyWest Airlines operated Embraer E175s flying as Alaska Airlines nonstop to Seattle and Portland, but Horizon Air took over the Seattle route with their E175. Alaska Airlines took over the Seattle route on a Boeing 737 on August 27, 2017 and Horizon Air will take over the Portland route with a Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 in 2018.|$|E
