5000|$|The {{deviation}} errors {{caused by}} magnetism in the ship's structure are minimised by precisely positioning small magnets and iron compensators {{close to the}} compass. To compensate for the induced magnetization, two magnetically soft iron spheres are placed on side arms. However, because the magnetic [...] "signature" [...] of every ship changes slowly with location, and with time, {{it is necessary to}} adjust the compensating magnets, periodically, to keep the deviation errors to a practical minimum. Magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>adjustment</b> and correction is one of the subjects in the examination curriculum for a shipmaster's certificate of competency.|$|E

Magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>adjustment</b> is an {{indispensable}} work during ship operation, and its procedure {{can not be}} simulated in a real ship by traditional teaching methods, {{which has become a}} bottleneck to magnetic compass learners. The procedure of magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>adjustment</b> is simulated by virtual reality modeling language(VRML). Three-dimensional interactive demonstrations of magnetic compass â€™ structure and adjustment procedure are implemented. So learners will have a direct cognition to the adjustment procedure of heeling deviation, semicircular deviation and quadrantal deviation. The realization process of simulation in the virtual reality environment is described in detail and the relevant source codes are given...|$|E

By 1917 it was in widespread use in the RNAS, and was selected for the Handley Page O/400 bomber in RFC service as well. However, Wimperis was well aware of the shortcomings of the Drift Sight in terms of flying along the wind line, and was already testing his solution, the Course Setting Bomb Sight. The CSBS was only slightly more complex than the Drift Sight to build, adding a <b>compass</b> and another <b>adjustment</b> to the sights to account for cross-drift. Hundreds were in use by 1918, and had supplanted the Drift Sight by the war's end.|$|R
