5000|$|During the SSPD {{the schools}} {{prepare for a}} {{earthquake}} scenario and when the shaking starts the children along with staff perform a Drop <b>Cover</b> <b>Hold</b> on under sturdy tables and desks preparing to save themselves from falling objects. When the shaking stops everybody evacuates to a pre-designated assembly area followed by a debriefing. [...] With every passing year the drill started expanding to new areas covering more children both at Tibetan and non-Tibetan schools. In the 5th SSPD in 2013 more than 50,000 children participated in 162 schools in North and North East Indian states. Moreover, one school from Bhutan and another from Mandalay in Myanmar also participated in that drill. Last year in 2014 the turnout was phenomenal with participation of more than 725,000 children in 1100 schools.|$|E

Self-contained units now have the data capacity and accuracy/resolution sufficient for unattended operation over periods of months to years.

The enlarged data storage of the newest ice profilers enables collection of ocean wave data during periods of open water in summer.

40|$|Covering is a {{well-known}} relationship in semantic and object-oriented data models. <b>Covering</b> <b>holds</b> when a class is the union {{of a collection of}} subclasses. However, covering has been studied only for entity classes. In this paper, we investigate covering for properties, as well. We introduce a new relationship among properties, called property covering. Property covering holds when a property restricted to a given class is the union of a collection of sub-properties. Property covering allows us to (i) partition a property into sub-properties, (ii) express property value refinement, and (iii) express a particular form of negative information. We demonstrate that property covering, together with inheritance, disjointness, and participation constraints, constitutes a useful conceptual modeling mechanism. In particular, we provide a set of inference rules that lead to schema derivations based on property covering, specialization, and disjointness relations.

This name continued, the year changing for each different annual, until the release of the 2003 book in 2002 when it was renamed to its final name, though the following year still appeared at the end.
