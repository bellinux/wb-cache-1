50|$|A {{considerable}} number of early notable dams were built in that era and they are now {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'Pennines embankment' type. These dams are characterized by a slender vertical puddle clay core supported on both sides by earthfill shoulders of more heterogeneous material. To control under-seepage through the natural foundation below the dam, the Pennines embankments generally constructed a puddle clay-filled <b>cutoff</b> <b>trench</b> in rock directly below the central core. Later construction often used concrete to fill the <b>cutoff</b> <b>trench.</b>|$|E
50|$|The dam {{consists}} of a rolled earthfill embankment and a gravity concrete control section. The dam, at crest elevation of 797 ft above mean sea level, is about 5200 ft long and 95 ft high above the flood plain. A compacted impervious <b>cutoff</b> <b>trench</b> to bedrock and a grout curtain in the rock are provided for underseepage control.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the lessons learnt in the assessment, stabilization and subsequent monitoring of a landslide, which mobilized over 90, 000 m 3 {{of material and}} threatened to completely close England’s busiest highway, the M 25 around London. The wedge shaped slide occurred on the 19 th December 2000 and extended some 80 m up the slope with a slip surface up to 10 m below the ground surface. Due to the strategic importance of the M 25, the design and construction was fast tracked to be completed before the fall rains when further movements would be inevitable. The adopted solution used a combination of 1050 mm diameter augered piles, a deep <b>cutoff</b> <b>trench</b> and counterforts at the toe and was extensively instrumented. The collected data for the winter 2001 / 02 demonstrates that {{not only were the}} remedial works successful in stabilizing the slope but that the proposed design method can accurately predict the bending moments and forces produced in the pile...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of embankment dams of a new type: a rockfill dam with a clay-cement concrete diaphragm built by bored-pile method. The authors give the results of numerical modeling of a stress-strain state of 69 m high dam, where a diaphragm {{in the form of}} a slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cutoff</b> wall cuts the whole dam body and a 23 m deep gravel-pebble foundation. The co-authors describe a dam design where the diaphragm is constructed in three lifts. The diaphragm lifts are connected by slabs made of clay-cement concrete or clay. Numerical modeling was carried out with the use of the author’s computer program with consideration of non-linearity of soils deformation. Analyses showed that clay-cement concrete of a slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cutoff</b> wall is in a favorable stress state, as clay-cement concrete by its deformation characteristics (E = 100 МPа) is close to gravel-pebble soil. The diaphragm deflections turned to be small; therefore, tensile stresses will not occur in it. In the diaphragm the clay-cement concrete is in a state of triaxial compression, therefore, its strength will be higher than unconfined compression strength (1 - 2 МPа). It may be expected that its strength will be provided. The nodes of connection of the slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cutoff</b> wall lifts also demonstrate safe operation...|$|R
40|$|Soil-bentonite (SB) slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cutoff</b> walls {{have been}} used for over 30 years as {{subsurface}} vertical barriers to control ground water flow and contaminant transport. Despite the millions of square feet of cutoff wall that have been constructed, {{little is known about the}} time-dependent behavior of the backfill and, in particular, the change in shear strength with aging. From experience, practitioners know that the backfill, which is initially placed as a semi-fluid material, gains strength with time. What has not been known is whether this time-related strength gain is due entirely to consolidation of the backfill or some other mechanism. This paper presents the results of laboratory and field testing of a SB slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cutoff</b> wall. Laboratory studies included consolidation and slump testing. Field studies included testing a constructed wall using vane shear, earth pressure cells, and settlement plates. The results of these tests demonstrate an increase in shear strength within a few days of backfill placement. This initial increase in shear strength is attributed to consolidation of the low-permeability backfill. The shear strength continues to increase with time, behavior that the authors attribute to two factors. The first is secondary consolidation or creep. The second is broadly termed “aging ” and is attributed in part to the thixotropic nature of the bentonite used in the backfill mixture. Recommendations for the design shear strength for SB backfill are also included...|$|R
40|$|Slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cutoff</b> {{walls with}} low-permeability {{backfill}} material, such as soil-bentonite and slag-cement-bentonite, are used widely for containment of subsurface pollution. In {{the design of}} slurry walls the potential service life for a given thickness or the wall thickness for a target service life are typically determined via analyses of one-dimensional contaminant transport. The difficulty of selecting appropriate inlet and outlet boundary conditions and the mathematical complexity of analytical solutions hinder engineers in undertaking a contaminant transport analysis–based design. Design charts for nondimensionalized effluent flux are presented by developing and using an analytical solution. The methodologies of using these charts in design are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The Al-Fulaij {{recharge}} dam {{is located}} on the Al Batinah coast in Oman and was constructed in 1992. The dam is about 3. 3 km long and 7. 7 m high with a storage capacity of 3. 7 million cubic meters of water. It is an earthfill dam with silty, sandy gravel fill in the embankment. Excessive seepage of between 5, 000 – 12, 500 m 3 /day was observed during floods in 1993, and several sinkholes were noticed close to the upstream toe. Remedial work consisting of an upstream blanket and a <b>cutoff</b> <b>trench</b> wall was performed in 2000. However, these remedial measures failed and almost the same seepage was noticed again during the impoundment. This paper investigates possible causes of the seepage using a finite element model. The input data for the model were collected from site investigations and field records during the construction and monitoring of the dam. The study reveals that the most probable cause of the excessive seepage is the presence of a permeable soil layer underneath the dam due to the dissolution of the gypsum material...|$|E
40|$|Earthen dams are {{constructed}} to store {{water for the}} purposes of human consumption, food production, electricity production, industrial use and flood protection. Failure of Earthen dams may be due to hydraulic failure, structural failure or seepage failure. Hydraulic failure may be due to overtopping, erosion of the upstream/downstream surface/toe and piping. Structural failures can occur in either the embankment or the appurtenances. Failure of a spillway, lake drain, or other appurtenance may lead to failure of the embankment. Cracking, settlement, and slides are the more common signs of structural failure of embankments. Seepage Failure occurs due to the uncontrolled seepage in both velocity and quantity. Water permeating slowly through the dam and progressively erode the soil in the embankment or the foundation toward the reservoir. Eventually with increased seepage flow rate the direct connection is made to the reservoir causing the piping. Piping may occur through the dam or the foundation causing dam failure. Seepage problems in large dams should be addressed in proper way on time to prevent before it becomes a massive disaster. Field investigation and data evaluation reveal the type of seepage and its extent. Then the most appropriate remedial measures can be adopted. Construction of toe filter, toe drain, downstream seepage berm, conducting cement/clay grouting and Cutoff walls construction are more frequently practiced to prevent seepage through and beneath the dam. Cutoff walls make the seepage paths longer, decrease the exit gradient at the toe and reduce the seepage quantities. Compacted impervious <b>trench</b> <b>cutoffs,</b> concrete cutoff walls, sheet piles, slurry trenches/cutoff walls are some different types of cutoff walls currently being utilized...|$|R
