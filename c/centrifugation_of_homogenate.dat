40|$|Amino acid {{decarboxylation}} {{activity in}} dispersed rat pancreas acinar cells and fractions derived by differential <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenate</b> of these cells was studied. The rate of decarboxylation {{was measured by}} determining the rate of production of the [3 H]-amine from [3 H]-amino acid or the rate of production of 14 CO 2 from the [14 C]-carboxy-labelled amino acid. Only the hydroxylated amino acids L-dopa and 5 -hydroxytryptophan are decarboxylated by intact dispersed pancreas acinar cells or cell homogenates at all pH values and amino acid concentrations tested. The decarboxylase activity is located exclusively in the cell cytosol. Each substrate competitively inhibits the decarboxylation of the other and the decarboxylation of each is inhibited by NSD- 1055. The estimated Km and Vmax are, for L-dopa, 4. 8 X 10 (- 5) M and 2. 5 nmol/mg protein/min and for 5 -hydroxytryptophan, 2. 9 X 10 (- 5) M and 0. 3 nmol/mg protein/min. The pH optimum for 5 -hydroxytryptophan decarboxylation is from 7. 0 - 8. 5 while that for L-dopa is 7. 0. It is concluded that pancreas acinar cells possess a single aromatic amino acid decarboxylase specific for the hydroxylated amino acids L-dopa and 5 -hydroxytryptophan, and which is similar in all properties studied to the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase found in several other mammalian tissues...|$|E
40|$|Maggot Debridement Therapy (MDT) {{is a type}} of biosurgery {{involving}} the intentional application of live, disinfected fly larvae into the chronic non-healing wounds of human or animal to debride the necrotic tissue and disinfect the infected wounds. Many studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of Lucilia sericata larval excretions/secretions against bacteria, however, the antibacterial activity of the local strain of blowfly, L. cuprina (Wiedeman) larval extract against bacteria has never been determined, although MDT using L. cuprina larvae was successfully conducted. In view of this, the objectives of this study are to develop a procedure for the production of sterile L. cuprina larval extract as well as to study the in vitro antibacterial activity of L. cuprina larval extract against seven selected potentially pathogenic wound bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Larvae were sterilized using established procedures and sterile larval extract was produced successfully via subsequent methanol-homogenization of larvae, <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenate</b> and vacuumconcentration of the resultant supernatant. The vacuum-concentrated product (larval extract) was kept at - 70 °C and re-suspended in sterile distilled water prior to use. Turbidometric (TB), Colony-Forming Units (CFU), Agar Well-Diffusion and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays were adopted to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity and properties (bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic) of larval extract against the seven selected bacteria. TB Assay has demonstrated significant growth inhibition of all bacteria tested (p< 0. 001). However, both CFU and well-diffusion assays have demonstrated the significant potent inhibitory effect of L. cuprina larval extract towards P. aeruginosa and these results were substantiated by the MIC assay that as little as 0. 78 mg/ml of larval extract was able to inhibit at least 50...|$|E

40|$|Lysosome {{formation}} was induced {{in cells}} of the renal medulla by feeding rats on a K+-deficient diet. The role of the endoplasmic reticulum {{in the production of}} acid phosphatase, a typical lysosomal enzyme, was examined. Lysosomal and microsomal fractions were prepared for study by differential <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> <b>of</b> renal papilla and inner stripe of red medulla. Acid phosphatase activity in the microsomal fraction was distinguished from the activity in the lysosomal fraction in normal tissue by differences in pH optima, tartrate inhibition, distribution of multiple forms after polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and detergent-sensitivity. During progressive K+ depletion, acid phosphatase activity in both microsomal and lysosomal fractions of the tissue increased 3 -fold. In the lysosomes, K+ depletion was associated with the appearance of a new band of acid phosphatase. The neuraminidase-sensitivity of this band on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme protein had been modified by the addition of sialic acid residues. K+ depletion also altered the lysosomal enzyme so that thiol compounds were able to stimulate its activity...|$|R

In guinea-pig preparations phosphodiesterase II occurred with highest specific activity in those fractions rich in succinate dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase. A lysosomal location for the guinea-pig enzyme was indicated by its structure-linked latency and by its association with particles that under-went a characteristic decrease in equilibrium density when Triton WR- 1339 was injected into the animals. With rat preparations a much greater proportion of the phosphodiesterase II activity {{was found in the}} soluble fraction after ultracentrifugation. The rat enzyme exhibited a lower degree of latency and administration of Triton WR- 1339 had no effect. The rat enzyme further differed from that of the guinea pig in other respects; it was more labile at 60 °C, it exhibited a lower pH optimum and it had a higher molecular weight as determined by gel-filtration chromatography...|$|R
40|$|Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} {{exists in}} two different forms in various human tissue preparations. One of them is exhibited, after starch-gel electrophoresis, by a rapidly migrating or `fast' band and the other by a `slow' band.

40|$|The {{total number}} of high-affinity ryanodine {{receptor}} (RyR) binding sites present in skeletal and cardiac muscle and in brain tissue of the rabbit was determined by [3 H]ryanodine binding to subfractions obtained by differential <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> prepared in a low-ionic strength medium, containing 0. 5 % Chaps. In all three tissues at least 80 % of [3 H]ryanodine binding was recovered in the total membrane (TM) fraction obtained by centrifuging between 650 g for 10 min and 120, 000 x g for 90 min. Skeletal muscle displayed higher contents of high-affinity RyR sites (about 49 pmol/g wet wt) than heart and brain (about 12 pmol and 3. 5 pmol/g wet wt, respectively). The affinity for ryanodine, {{as well as the}} affinity for Ca 2 +, in the absence or presence of Ca 2 (+) -releasing drugs (caffeine and doxorubicin) of TM from skeletal muscle, were found to be identical to those of purified terminal cisternae.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of dictyosomes and their vesicles in secretion of slime by maize root cap cells {{is demonstrated by}} kinetic and organelle fractionation experiments using l-fucose as a specific marker for the secreted slime. Pulse-chase experiments show that l-[1 - 3 H]fucose is incorporated into two distinct fractions of root cap cells. Incorporation into a water-soluble, ethyl alcohol-insoluble fraction <b>of</b> the <b>homogenate</b> has a peak at 20 minutes of chasing followed by rapid loss of label. Seventy per cent of the radioactivity in this fraction is secreted from the tissue during a 2 -hour chase period. Incorporation of label from [3 H]fucose into a water-insoluble fraction is kinetically different suggesting that in situ incorporation of label is occurring into the cell wall. Labeling of the water-soluble, ethyl alcohol-insoluble fraction with an 14 C-amino acid mixture {{differs from that of}} [3 H]fucose. Thus, while release of the [3 H]fucose-containing polymer begins after 10 to 15 minutes of chasing, the release of the 14 C-amino acid polymer is delayed an additional 5 to 10 minutes and occurs at a lower rate. Cesium chloride density gradient <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> secreted material labeled with radioactivity from [3 H]fucose indicates the presence of only one major component having a buoyant density similar to that of purified root cap slime (1. 63 g cm− 3). Sucrose density gradient <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]fucose-labeled root cap tissue shows that radioactivity in nondialyzable material occurs as a broad band between densities 1. 12 and 1. 18 g cm− 3 with a peak at density 1. 15 g cm− 3, the same density at which dictyosomes were localized by electron microscopy.

40|$|When {{incubated}} with 3 H-astemizole, {{a potent}} antagonist of H 1 receptor, cultured rat hepatocytes, {{which do not}} express specific receptors for this ligand, avidly take up 3 H-label proportionally to the drug concentration. HPLC analysis indicates that at 10 ng 3 H-astemizole/ml, cells almost entirely deplete the culture medium of the drug within 4 hr of incubation. At 37 degrees, astemizole is metabolized and released into the culture medium mainly under the form of glucuronoconjugated metabolites. Differential <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> from hepatocytes incubated with 3 H-astemizole indicates that astemizole and unconjugated metabolites {{are found in the}} particulate fraction, whereas astemizole and conjugated metabolites are present in the cytosol. Isopycnic centrifugation on sucrose gradient shows that the major part of the 3 H-label in the particulate fraction distributes like phospholipids and NADPH cytochrome c reductase, suggesting an association with membranes and, in particular, with the endoplasmic reticulum. Chloroquine, a drug accumulating within lysosomes and acidic endosomes, decreases the uptake of 3 H-astemizole by hepatocytes and induces, during isopycnic <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> a particulate fraction, a shift of the 3 H-label towards lower densities where it closely accompanies cathepsin B. This suggests that a minor part of astemizole accumulated in the hepatocytes could be trapped within lysosomes.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of a dTMP kinase a 8 {{well as a}} dTDP kinase in Acetabularia mediterranea has been demonstrated. A test system was developed by which {{it was possible to}} estimate the enzyme activity in an individual Acetabularia cell or even in a cell fragment. The enzyme catalyses the phosphorylation of dTMP in the presence of ATP. In the test system described, dTTP is formed as well as dTDP. This indicates that there is also a dTDP kinase present in the enzyme preparation. Characteristics of the enzyme such as pH optima at pH 7 - 0 and 8 - 75, a temperature optimum at 45 °C, a Km value of 3 - 3 X 10 ~ 6 M and a high specificity for ATP were established. In homogenates that were preserved at — 70 °C the enzyme activity was retained even after many weeks. Freezing at — 70 °C and then thawing resulted in an increase in enzyme activity.

40|$|Cytosolic α-mannosidases are {{glycosyl}} hydrolases {{that participate}} in the catabolism of cytosolic free N-oligosaccharides. Two soluble α-mannosidases (E-I and E-II) belonging to glycosyl hydrolases family 47 have been described in Candida albicans. We demonstrate that addition of pepstatin A during the preparation <b>of</b> cell <b>homogenates</b> enriched α-mannosidase E-I {{at the expense of}} E-II, indicating that the latter is generated by proteolysis during cell disruption. E-I corresponded to a polypeptide of 52  kDa that was associated with mannosidase activity and was recognized by an anti-α 1, 2 -mannosidase antibody. The N-mannan core trimming properties of the purified enzyme E-I were consistent with its classification as a family 47 α 1, 2 -mannosidase. Differential density-gradient <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> revealed that α 1, 2 -mannosidase E-I was localized to the cytosolic fraction and Golgi-derived vesicles, and that a 65  kDa membrane-bound α 1, 2 -mannosidase was present in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi-derived vesicles. Distribution of α-mannosidase activity in a kex 2 Δ null mutant or in wild-type protoplasts treated with monensin demonstrated that the membrane-bound α 1, 2 -mannosidase is processed by Kex 2 protease into E-I, recognizing an atypical cleavage site of the precursor.

40|$|Esterases in {{organophosphate}} susceptible and resistant houseflies {{were studied}} {{by means of}} sensitive Gomori method. In susceptible flies the esterase activity to α-naphthylacetate {{was found to be}} mainly due to the cholinesterase and an ali-esterase identical with that responsible for most of the activity to methylbutyrate. The latter enzyme is much less active to β-naphthylacetate than to α-naphthylacetate. The Km values of the cholinesterase for α- and β-naphthylacetate were 1 · 0 × 10 − 4 and 2 · 3 × 10 − 4 (M) respectively. The ali-esterase had a Km of approximately 10 − 4 (M) for α-naphthylacetate. The activity to α-naphthylacetate of the cholinesterase was strongly, that of the ali-esterase only weakly pH-dependent in the range from pH 6 to 8. Both enzymes were more active at higher pH. Eserine and diazoxon were used in inhibition experiments, acetylcholine and methylbutyrate in experiments on substrate competition. The Km value of the cholinesterase for acetylcholine was calculated as approximately 10 − 5 (M). The addition <b>of</b> heat-inactivated <b>homogenate</b> strongly enhanced the ali-esterase activity to α-naphthylacetate. It did so much more at low than at high concentrations <b>of</b> the active <b>homogenate</b> and thus caused the disappearance of the disproportionality initially observed between enzyme concentration and activity.

40|$|In {{preparing}} for metamorphosis insects store in their hemolymph and fat bodies a major nutrient reserve of 500 -kDa hexamerins. At least three hexamerins serve this function in Lepidoptera, including arylphorin (ArH) and two high methionine proteins (M-MtH and V-MtH). Six day-old adults of Manduca sexta are shown here to have consumed over 99 % of their pupal reserves of ArH {{and in the}} case of males, 99. 8 % of M- and V-MtH. In support of egg formation, however, females at this stage retain over 25 % of their pupal reserves of the high methionine proteins. Demonstrated here are three factors contributing to the methionine protein reserves in day- 6 adult females. (1) Pupal stores of the methionine proteins average 1. 67 times larger in females than in males. (2) A fraction of this pupal store remains undiminished during pharate adult development: <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> partitions the hexamerins into a fraction that is soluble in PBS and a smaller, particle-associated fraction that is not. Pharate adults consume most of the soluble fraction and relatively little of the particulate fraction, which then constitutes over half of the methionine protein reserves of post-eclosion females.

The distribution of enzyme markers in density gradients indicated that phosphatidylinositol kinase was located in both the plasma membrane and the secretory-granule membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate kinase activity was low in all fractions. Phosphatidylinositol kinase activity of secretory granules and plasma membranes was decreased to 10 - 20 % of its initial value by raising the free [Ca 2 +] from 1 microM to 5 microM. The enzyme had a Km (apparent) for ATP of 110 microM (secretory granule) or 120 microM (plasma membrane) and a Ka for Mg 2 + of 7 mM (secretory granule) or 6 mM (plasma membrane). Ca 2 +-sensitivity of phosphatidylinositol kinase in calmodulin-depleted secretory granules and plasma membranes was not affected by addition of exogenous calmodulin, although activity was stimulated by trifluoperazine in the presence of 0. 1 microM or 40 microM-Ca 2 +. Trifluoperazine oxide had no effect on the enzyme activity of secretory granules. Plasma membranes had a phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate phosphatase activity which was stimulated by raising the free [Ca 2 +] from 0. 1 to 40 microM.

The data confirm, with biochemical techniques, the presence of 1, 4 -dihydropyridine and (±) D- 600 inhibitable calcium channels in skeletal muscle, previously found with electrophysiological techniques...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{investigated}} whether sauvagine (SVG) and urotensin I (UT), two peptides displaying sequence homology with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), could affect synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity of mouse striatum {{in a manner similar}} to CRF. The enzyme activity was assayed in supernatants obtained following sonication and <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> preincubated with the peptides. SVG and UT produced a concentration-dependent increase of TH activity with a half-maximal effect obtained at 5 and 10 nM, respectively. SVG and UT were as effective as CRF with maximal stimulations corresponding to 52 - 58 % increase of basal enzyme activity, whereas the rank order of potency was SVG greater than UT = CRF. Kinetic analysis of TH activity versus low concentrations of the pterin co-factor (0. 05 - 0. 4 mM) indicated that the stimulations elicited by CRF, SVG and UT were associated with an increase in the Vmax of the enzyme form with high affinity for the co-factor. The CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF 9 - 41 inhibited the effects of all 3 peptides. Moreover, the combined addition of CRF with either SVG or UT did not produce additive effects on TH activity. The stimulatory effects of CRF, SVG and UT were dependent on the concentration of extracellular free Ca 2 +, being minimal in a Ca 2 (+) -free medium and maximal at about 0. 5 mM extracellular free Ca 2 +. These results indicate that SVG and UT can mimic the effect of CRF on synaptosomal TH by acting on a common receptor site associated with a Ca 2 (+) -dependent mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the distribution of methionyl-, leucyl-, and arginyl- tRNA synthetases in primary liver fractions obtained by differential <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homogenates</b> in isotonic sucrose: 78 - 93 % of synthetase activities are recovered in the cytosolic fraction. Microsomes contain only 4. 8 %, 19. 4 %, and 6. 4 % of the methionyl-, leucyl-, and arginyl-tRNA synthetases activities, respectively. This proportion increases up to 11. 3 %, 26. 1 %, and 20. 7 %, respectively, when the homogenization medium is supplemented with 5 mM Mg 2 + and 25 mM K+. The presence of protease inhibitors in the homogenization medium does not increase the proportion of synthetases recovered in microsomes. After subfractionation of microsomes by isopycnic <b>centrifugation,</b> the distributions <b>of</b> the 3 synthetases display a second peak overlapping that of at a density of 1. 12. In addition, methionyl- and leucyl- tRNA synthetases display a second peak overlapping that of RNA. This suggests that {{a small proportion of}} these synthetases (0. 7 % and 5. 71 % of total activities, respectively) bind to the d domain of the ER. The Golgi complex, the plasma membranes, and the peroxisomes lack aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity. The 3 synthetases are readily detached from membranes when intact microsomes are washed with 250 mM sucrose alone or containing 5 mM PPi, or 320 mM KCl. The binding of methionyl-tRNA synthetases to microsomes was measured in vitro, at 4 degrees C, with a sample of the cytosolic fraction as a source of synthetase. Microsomes stripped of their bound polysomes display a binding capacity that is not significantly different from that of unstripped microsomes. Even in the presence of cations, the amount of synthetase bound to the membranes remained low by comparison with the cytosolic content...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for isolating synaptic junctional complexes (SJC) of high structural integrity. The major step in the isolation involves homogenization of a synaptosomal membrane (SM) fraction in a biphasic system consisting of Freon 113 and an aqueous phase containing 0. 2 % Triton X- 100. Wellpreserved SJCs, along with membrane vesicles, were recovered in the aqueous phase after low-speed <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>homogenate.</b> The membranes were subsequently separated from the SJCs by centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The purity and identity of subcellular fractions were monitored by thin sectioning electron microscopy, using specific and nonspecific staining methods. From the electron microscope studies we conclude that SJCs and their components occupy about 65 % of the area covered by structures in this fraction. The assay of enzyme activities indicates that homogenization in Triton-Freon and subsequent steps of the isolation procedure affect the activities of Na, K...|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to isolate and {{characterize}} {{the total population of}} free and membrane-bound polysomes from the elongating region of dark-grown pea stems (Pisum sativum L.). Partial separation of free from membrane-bound polysomes was achieved by relatively low speed <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>homogenate.</b> Complete separation was not achieved. Based on analysis of the rRNA content of various subcellular fractions, fractionated tissue yielded greater than 95 % of the rRNA found in whole tissue. Approximately 45 % of the ribosomal material was membrane-bound (released by detergent) and was found in the “wall” (13 %), the “nuclear” pellet (2 %), and the “mitochondrial” pellet (29 %). The remaining 55 %, consisting primarily of free polysomes, could be recovered free from membranous material by sedimentation through a dense (700 mg/ml) sucrose pad for 90 hours. The advantages and disadvantages of using sucrose pads for the separation of free and membrane-bound polysomes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} <b>of</b> differential <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>homogenates</b> {{into various}} particulate fractions (1) {{has resulted in}} an accumulation of evidence pertaming {{to the importance of}} mitochondria in cell metabolism. The work of numerous investigators (2) has shown that certain enzymes are for the most part localized with the mitochondrial fraction of the cell. Other evidence indicates that the mltochondria are surrounded by a membrane (3, 4) which is selectively permeable (5 - 8). Thus it appears that the mitochondria are capable of carrying on certain specific reactions within the cell because of their selective permeability and their high concentration of certain enzymes. In the present investigation further evidence is offered to show that the mitochondria possess differences in permeability toward certain compounds. The swelling properties of mitochondria were studied when these particulates were incubated in various media. In addition, measurements were made of the rate of penetration into mitochondria of various solutes from the media. Method...|$|R
40|$|Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) {{neutrophils}} {{were shown}} to contain the azurophilic granule maker enzymes myeloperoxidase and beta-glucuronidase but were deficient in the specific granule markers alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and lysozyme. Isopycnic <b>centrifugation</b> <b>of</b> leukocyte <b>homogenates</b> on linear sucrose gradients resulted in cosedimentation of myeloperoxidase and beta-glucuronidase with an equilibrium density of 1. 18. After an intravenous inoculation of monkeys with Salmonella typhimurium AKP activity became marked, whereas that of beta-glucuronidase decreased and myeloperoxidase remained unchanged. Lysozyme was undetected {{throughout the course of}} the experiment, but was present in oil-induced peritoneal macrophages and peripheral mononuclear cells. The induced AKP exhibited partial latency and had an equilibrium density of 1. 15. It is unclear, however, whether the induced AKP is associated with specific granules or cytoplasmic membranes. Hence, while these data are consistent with the presence of azurophilic granules in polymorphonuclear neutrophils from infected monkeys, the presence of specific granules in polymorphonuclear neutrophils of both uninfected and infected monkeys remains moot...|$|R
