40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and John Mitchell; 173 pp. Flat-plate solar collectors have potential applications in HVAC system, industrial thermal process, and solar engineering. Flat-plate collectors are the most economical and popular in solar domestic heating water system since they are permanently fixed in positions, have simple construction, and require little maintenance. The design of a solar energy system is generally concerned with obtaining maximum efficiency at minimum cost. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} design tool for predicting the performance of a flat-plate solar collector. A very detailed thermal analysis of a flat-plate solar collector was carried out to predict the thermal performance. The analysis is based on the established theory about flat-plate solar collector: the radiation absorption, heat loss from the collector, and temperature distribution on the plate. The calculation of useful energy and top heat loss from the collector is based on the aperture area to make a more accurate prediction of collector performance. The net-radiation method was employed to obtain the radiation component of top heat loss from the general <b>collector</b> <b>cover</b> system. The correlation for natural convection heat transfer between the covers and between the plate and cover was selected with the consideration of the low conductivity of plastics. The semi-gray radiation model was adopted to determine the optical properties of the <b>collector</b> <b>cover</b> and absorber plate. Results comparing the design tool calculations with experiments showed good agreement. The collector tests were performed by Florida Solar Energy Center. The calculations based on the information from test reports yielded an accurate prediction of the thermal performance of flat-plate solar collectors. Based on the analysis, a flat-plate solar collector design program (CoDePro) has been developed. The program is arranged so that detailed information about the collector can be specified with an easy-to-use graphic interface. Compiled versions of CoDePro have been distributed to solar engineers from its development level, and it has been modified according to their suggestions.

This study aimed to examine the nutritional constituents of dried Tilapia zillii products, produced from different types of solar tent dryers. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the best type of solar tent dryer for producing solar dried fish in a tropical humid environment. The type of dryer used for the study was designed by Doe (1977) and cited in Olokor et al., (2009 a). The dryers had wooden frames with dimensions 4 x 3 x 3 m and trays made with chicken wire over wooden frames. Three types of dryers were set up: a solar tent dryer with <b>collector</b> <b>covered</b> with transparent white polythene (CTP); a solar tent dryer without <b>collector</b> but <b>covered</b> with transparent white polythene (NCTP) and a solar tent dryer without <b>collector</b> <b>covered</b> with black polythene (NCBP).

Against this background, this paper presents a numerically examined energy feasibility study of a solar driven heat pump system for a low energy residence, where a {{flat plate solar collector}} served as the sole low temperature heat source. A parametric study on the ambient-to-solarfluid heat transfer coefficient was conducted to determine the required solar collector heat transfer characteristics in this system setup. Moreover, solar collector area and storage tank volume were varied to investigate their impact on the system performance. A new performance indicator availability was defined to assess the contribution of the solar collector as low temperature energy source of the heat pump. Results showed that the use of a solar collector as low temperature heat source was feasible if its heat transfer rate (UA-value) was 200 W/K or higher. Achieving this value with a realistic solar collector area (A-value) required an increase of the overall ambient-to-solarfluid heat transfer coefficient (U-value) with a factor 6 to 8 compared to the base case with only natural convection heat exchange between solar <b>collector</b> <b>cover</b> and ambient. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An angle-resolved {{scatterometer}} and an {{integrating sphere}} for reflectance measurements at oblique angles of incidence {{have been designed}} and evaluated. The integrating sphere has a centre-mounted sample holder and the detector sits {{at the end of}} the sample holder and therefore always faces the same sphere wall area. The sphere geometry plays an important role for the modelling of detected signals and the reflected intensity has to be divided into a specular and a diffuse component. These components must be treated separately in the modelling. These two instruments, as well as traditional spectrophotometers, have been used for the evaluation of solar energy materials. Scattering as well as non-scattering surfaces have been studied, requiring different measurement techniques. By using angle-resolved scatterometry it has been demonstrated that a solar reflector does not need to be perfectly specular provided the concentration factor is low. Thus it is possible to use inexpensive aluminium foil as the reflector material. The possibility of increasing the reflectance of aluminium with thin dielectric films of silicon and titanium oxides for pv-cell and solar thermal collector application has been investigated. Particular attention has been paid to the angular optical properties since thin films strongly affect them owing to interference effects. In an under-glazing application for pv-cells, the use of aluminium coated with titania and silica is recommended. The long-term stability of several reflector materials has been studied and anodised aluminium protected by a UV-stabilised polymer coating is recommended for solar collector reflectors. Antireflective films consisting of porous silicon oxide for solar <b>collector</b> <b>cover</b> glazings have been studied. The films were prepared by a dip-coating process using a suspension of nano-sized silicon oxide particles. This treatment increased the solar transmittance by 5. 5 percentage points. It has also been shown that it is possible to temper antireflection treated glazings without seriously affecting the optical performance. The tempering also strongly improves the mechanical stability of the film. Some of the measurements presented in this thesis were used as input data to simulation programs, which calculate the collected annual energy as a function of the optical properties of the different components. It was found that spectrophotometric laboratory measurements agree well with outdoor collector testings...|$|E
