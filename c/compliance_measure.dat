40|$|Summary {{measures}} of VAT compliance rates are valuable for identifying problem areas in VAT implementation. They are also essential for meaningful cross-country and cross-time comparisons of VAT compliance. We present a comprehensive and general framework for calculating VAT compliance rates {{at both the}} economy-wide and detailed sectoral levels. Unlike existing {{measures of}} VAT compliance, our framework isolates a <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> from the effects on VAT receipts of detailed features of VAT systems as actually implemented by tax authorities. These features include multiple VAT rates, exemptions, registration rates, refund limitations, informal activity, taxation of domestic non-residents, and undeclared imports. We implement our comprehensive VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> for Vietnam, {{a country with a}} complex VAT system. Our estimate of Vietnam's VAT compliance rate is about eleven percentage points higher than that calculated by the most popular measure of compliance, collection efficiency (CE). Our method facilitates decomposition of the difference between CE and our VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> into the individual contributions of statutory and structural features of Vietnam's VAT regime.

40|$|Audit {{objective}} and criteria The {{objective of the}} audit {{was to assess the}} Department of Human Services’ and the Department of Social Services’ management of selected fraud prevention and <b>compliance</b> Budget <b>measures.</b> To form a conclusion against the audit objective, the ANAO adopted the following high level audit criteria: 	Have sound processes and practices been established to support the design and implementation of specific Budget-funded <b>compliance</b> <b>measures?</b> 	Is there effective monitoring of the implementation and achievement of the measures? 	Have expected savings and other benefits from the measures been achieved? The audit focussed on seven Centrelink-related <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> announced in the relevant Budgets and implemented from 2012 – 13 to 2015 – 16 (see Appendix 2). In examining the Strengthening the Integrity of Welfare Payments measure, the audit focussed on two specific initiatives that had identified savings for 2015 – 16 —that is, the Employment Income Matching initiative and the AUSTRAC initiative. The audit’s scope did not consider any <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> announced following the 2015 – 16 Budget. Further, the audit scope did not examine the Department of Human Services’ management of its broader Centrelink compliance program. Conclusion The Department of Human Services’ management of the seven selected <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> resulted in: 	three measures not being effectively implemented; 	two measures’ implementation being partially effective—with one measure achieving the expected savings but not the expected level of compliance activity and the other measure achieving the expected level of compliance activity but not the expected savings; and 	two measures being effectively implemented. As a consequence, most of the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> examined did not fully achieve their expected outcomes, including savings and addressing the risks to payment integrity, as agreed. Shortcomings were also identified in the Department of Human Services’ approach to monitoring and reporting for all measures examined. As the entity responsible for the Administered appropriations against which savings were to be delivered, the Department of Social Services’ oversight of the achievements of the measures was not effective. Improvements are warranted to both the bilateral and the internal monitoring arrangements presently in place, to support both entities’ capacity to track progress against the Government’s expected outcomes, including savings targets. The Department of Social Services used an agreed methodology to calculate the savings expected from the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> and the Department of Human Services developed useful implementation plans to support the delivery of the measures. There are opportunities to improve both the methodology and plans. The monitoring and oversight arrangements for the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures,</b> set out under the Bilateral Management Arrangement between the Department of Social Services and the Department of Human Services, have not been effective as they were not followed. The Department of Social Services as the relevant policy entity did not take responsibility for monitoring outcomes, including impacts and actual savings, achieved from the measures. The Department of Human Services’ internal and external monitoring and reporting for <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> could be improved. While the Department of Human Services has well established monitoring and reporting arrangements, these mechanisms did not consistently provide clear and accurate advice on whether the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> were achieving the desired outcomes, including savings and planned levels of activity...|$|R

In order to maintain a proactive approach to safety management, safety climate, safety compliance and safety participation were used as study variables as they have been established as antecedents to accidents and injuries in the workplace. From questionnaire data from employees with regular safety issues it was found that a positive relationship exists between safety climate and safety behaviours.

Providing support for the buffer hypothesis of the Job Demand-Control model, safety control moderated the relationship between safety climate and safety participation.

40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{proposed}} state-specific {{limits on}} carbon pollution from existing sources in its recent “Clean Power Plan” proposal. These goals reflect {{the potential of}} states to reduce carbon emissions by, among other things, reducing demand for electricity generated from fossil fuels via end-use energy efficiency. The interconnected nature of the electricity grid, however, frequently causes the fossil generation reductions associated with these policies to transpire outside the state responsible for their implementation. This report shall refer to these phenomena as “interstate effects. ” States implementing the Clean Power Plan (CPP) may only be interested in pursuing energy efficiency programs for compliance purposes if the associated carbon savings can be counted regardless of where they physically occur. However, the proposed rule would require states implementing such policies {{to ensure that the}} associated reductions are not double-counted by the state whose generation and emissions levels are affected.

This Master’s Project seeks to develop {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms and range of magnitude of interstate effects between power pools, under various levels of energy efficiency.

It was assumed that if encroachments of barrier line and the standard deviation of lateral positions were reduced, safety would improve. The standard deviation of the lateral position of passenger cars travelling in free-flow traffic decreased from 35 cm with the worn barrier line to 28 cm after repainting the barrier line and to 24 cm after milling the rumble strip barrier line. Oncoming traffic moved the driving paths of vehicles 15 – 20 cm closer to the edge line. The mean speeds of cars in free-flow traffic did not change.

40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to crack down on}} {{offshore}} tax evasion, the United States is implementing a new set of information reporting and withholding requirements on foreign banks and other foreign entities. These provisions, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, require thirty percent withholding of the entity’s U. S. -source income, unless they disclose specific information regarding their customers’ identities and account balances. While this may be an effective way to force foreign institutions into compliance, it also raises questions about how it will function within existing tax reporting systems, where the function of withholding serves a materially different purpose. The FATCA reporting and withholding provisions depart from the norm of using withholding as a tax enforcement mechanism, and instead use it as a coercive <b>compliance</b> <b>measure.</b> This Comment looks to current domestic and international withholding systems as a point of comparison for this new regime. By examining the objectives and operation of these existing systems as compared to those of FATCA, it becomes clear that withholding income serves a drastically different purpose. Existing systems utilize withholding as a means of ensuring that taxes will be paid, while FATCA implements {{it as a way to}} force foreign banks to comply with a set of reporting requirements. Considering this is the first time withholding appears to be used in this way, it is prudent to ask whether this is a desirable use of withholding in our current international taxation system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Data {{sources for}} MS {{research}} are numerous but rarely provide an objective measure of drug therapy compliance coupled with patient-reported health outcomes. The {{objective of this}} paper is to describe the methods and baseline characteristics of the Therapy Optimization in MS (TOP MS) study designed to investigate the relationship between disease-modifying therapy compliance and health outcomes. METHODS: TOP MS was designed as a prospective, observational, nationwide patient-focused study using an internet portal for data entry. The protocol was reviewed and approved by Sterling IRB. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials. gov. It captured structured survey data monthly from MS patients recruited by specialty pharmacies. Data collection included the clinical characteristics of MS such as MS relapses. Disability, quality of life and work productivity and activity impairment were assessed quarterly with well-validated scales. When events like severe fatigue or new or worsening depression were reported, feedback was provided to treating physicians. The therapy <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> was derived from pharmacy drug shipment records uploaded to the study database. The data presented in this paper use descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The TOP MS Study enrolled 2966 participants receiving their disease-modifying therapy (DMT) from specialty pharmacies. The mean age of the sample was 49 years, 80. 4 % were female, 89. 9 % were Caucasian and 55. 7 % were employed full or part time. Mean time since first symptoms was 11. 5 years; mean duration since diagnosis was 9. 5 years. Patient-reported EDSS was 3. 5; 72. 2 % had a relapsing-remitting disease course. The most commonly reported symptoms at the time of enrollment were fatigue (74. 7 %), impaired coordination or balance (61. 8 %) and numbness and tingling (61. 2 %). Half of the sample was using glatiramer acetate and half was using beta-interferons. CONCLUSION: Demographic and clinical characteristics of the TOP MS sample at enrollment are consistent with other community-based MS samples, and the sample appears to be representative of DMT users in the US. TOP MS data can be used to explore the associations between disease-modifying therapy compliance and health outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 00819000) ...|$|E

Methods Fifty-five patients with a diagnosis of AIS were recruited. All were female and aged 10 years or above when a brace was prescribed, none had undergone prior treatment, and all had a Risser sign of 0 – 2 and a Cobb angle of 25 - 40 °. The patients were examined in three consecutive visits with 4 to 6 months between each visit. The Chinese translated Trunk Appearance Perception Scale (TAPS), the Chinese translated Brace Questionnaires (BrQ) and the Chinese translated SRS- 22 Questionnaires were used in the study. The in-brace Cobb angle, vertebral rotation and trunk listing were also measured. Patients’ compliance, in-brace correction and patients’ QoL were assessed. To identify the relationship among these three areas, logistic regression model and generalized linear model were used. Result For the <b>compliance</b> <b>measure,</b> a significant difference (p[*]=[*] 0. 008) was detected on TAPS mean score difference between Visit 1 and Visit 2 in the least compliant group (0 – 8 hours) and the most compliant group (17 – 23 hours).

Analysis of compliance data collected at East Pacific Rise between 9 ° and 10 °N through 3 -D numerical modeling reveals strong along-axis variations in the lower crustal shear velocities, as well as temporal variation of crustal shear velocity near 9 ° 48 ′N between measurements spanning 8 years. <b>Compliance</b> <b>measured</b> across the rise axis at 9 ° 48 ′N and 9 ° 33 ′N suggest a deep crustal low-velocity zone beneath the ridge axis, with a low Vs/Vp ratio consistent with melt in low aspect ratio cracks or sills. Changes in <b>compliance</b> <b>measured</b> at 9 ° 48 ′N between years 1999 and 2007 suggest that the melt fraction in the axial crust decreased during this interval, perhaps following the 2005 – 2006 seafloor eruption. This temporal variability provides direct evidence for short-term variations of the magmatic system at a fast spreading ridge...|$|R
40|$|Diversity Management (or {{its many}} {{alternative}} terms) is now widespread in larger organisations in Australia. However, {{the exact nature}} of what this means in each organisation varies, as there is no legislative underpinning of these policies and processes. This paper explores the bases on which organisations are undertaking Diversity Management and examines the legislation to which organisations must respond, that is anti-discrimination legislation and equal opportunity legislation. The former has strict <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> while the latter relies on individual organisational decisions of how to proceed and is backed up by few benchmarks or <b>compliance</b> <b>measures.</b> The paper discusses how this mixture of employee rights (employer obligations) and employer responsibilities produces varied outcomes in organisations resulting in different conditions for employees. The paper draws on analysis of organisational reports to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace and case studies. It concludes that the business case is predominantly driving many organisations’ diversity practices and this is particularly the case {{at a time when many}} organisations are dealing with a skills shortage. It questions whether the business case is a sufficient incentive for organisations to deliver employee rights...|$|R
