500|$|... "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{is written}} as a self-manifesto song. Lyrically, though the song {{appears to be}} about dancing and sex, in reality Madonna uses sarcasm to {{emphasize}} the longevity of her career. The lyrics explain {{that she does not}} want to retire from her career at that moment and possesses the ability to continue, as noted in the lines [...] "Don't stop me now, no need to catch my breath, I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on and on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{starts with}} an offbeat rhythm and is {{accompanied}} {{by the sound of}} West African percussion. The song builds into a crescendo as Madonna sings the line, [...] "If it's against the law, arrest me, if you can handle it, undress me". This is followed by synthesized musical arrangement, as Madonna starts singing the line, [...] "When the lights go down and there's no one left, I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on and on." [...] An interlude, where Madonna continuously chants the words [...] "Get Stupid", is also present. According to Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice, the song contains elements of the work of Nile Rodgers.|$|E
500|$|... "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Elysa Gardner from USA Today called the song [...] "thumping" [...] and [...] "breathless", naming {{it one of}} the standout tracks of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone described [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] as a [...] "thumpy self-empowerment anthem". Mark Beech from Bloomberg Television complimented the track's [...] "insidious beats". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a little careerism on the dance floor", for the line [...] "Give me a record and I'll break it". However, she criticised the [...] "Get stupid" [...] interlude, calling it [...] "plain stupid". Jon Pareles from The New York Times, and Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, compared the song with Rick James' [...] "Super Freak" [...] (1981). Mark Savage from BBC described the song as [...] "one of the [...] record's few out-and-out pop moments, featuring a cute, bouncy beat, and a sense of humour that has been missing from Madonna's music since her Dick Tracy days." [...] Tom Ewing of Pitchfork named the song as one of Hard Candys better tracks, possessing the album's [...] "most urgent tune", stating that Madonna sings the lyrics [...] "Show me a record and I'll break it/ I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on" [...] over [...] "hard-pushing electro-ska whose keyboards break up trying to keep pace." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 7 September 2007, Simpson fought Andy Morris for a {{third time}} and {{defeated}} him via a seventh-round knockout to defend his British title. After the fight, Simpson said [...] "I hope I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to bigger <b>and</b> better things now. Hopefully now I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to European <b>and</b> World titles, I started boxing to win a World title and that is my ambition".|$|R

I've found that {{rewriting}} an old book took much more effort than writing one from scratch, but I {{had to go back}} to do right by these things. Now I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> start completely new stuff.|$|E
2500|$|During a 1953 {{rally in}} Chattanooga, Tennessee, Graham tore down the ropes that {{organizers}} had erected {{to separate the}} audience into racial sections. He recounted in his memoirs that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down [...] "or you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> have the revival without me." [...] He warned a white audience, [...] "we have been proud and thought we were {{better than any other}} race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride." ...|$|E

[...] "This is a certain witchcraft cure. Still, {{you have to make}} your mind up. We <b>can</b> not <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> take all the trade goods, without provisions." ...|$|R

6000|$|Therefore, {{knowing that}} {{electricity}} does three things, they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> [...] "imagine" [...] electricity doing three hundred things, {{and the very}} great ones among them can imagine it doing three thousand things; but for them, or anybody else, to imagine a new force, totally unconnected with and different from anything yet known in nature, would be utterly impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Grandison," [...] said Mr. Morris, [...] "I'll {{give you}} a trial. If, {{at the end of}} six months, you can pay me the first instalment, I'll have the {{necessary}} papers made out, and you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> buy the place, but if you are not up to time on the first payment, I want to hear no more about the purchase." ...|$|E

"Doctor," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "if {{there is}} {{anything}} about all this in your medicine books, perhaps you know more than I do, and you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> talk; but you know there is not, and you know, too, that I was a very sensible middle-aged woman when you were toddling around in frocks and running against people.

6000|$|Hence {{comes the}} great {{difference}} between the American [...] "lead" [...] or opening sentence of the article, and the English method of commencement. In the American paper {{the idea is that}} the reader is so busy that he must first be offered the news in one gulp. After that if he likes it he <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> eat some more of it. So the opening sentence must give the whole thing. Thus, suppose that a leading member of the United States Congress has committed suicide. This {{is the way in which}} the American reporter deals with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{young and}} strong, and am refreshed, now. Take Mr. Brown to our house, {{and give him}} help--you see how plainly he needs it. I will go back {{and take care of}} the Old People; I can be there in twenty minutes. You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> do what you first started to do--wait on the main road at our house until {{somebody}} comes along with a wagon; then send and bring away the three of us. You won't have to wait long; the farmers will soon be coming back from town, now. I will keep old Polly patient and cheered up--the crazy one doesn't need it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, sir. He <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> doing it, <b>and</b> {{come up to}} {{his work}} {{just as well as}} not. I can see to him then, and he won't be a care to any one," [...] said Mrs. Moss, heartily.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, father," [...] said she, [...] "look at that! {{just listen}} to him! You wouldn't believe me before. What's a young woman to look for with a man as <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like that?--cursing <b>and</b> {{swearing}} before one's face,--quite awful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{it takes}} a long {{lifetime}} to do what I plan, I think I shall ask some good woman 'to lend a hand' when I've got anything worth offering her. Not a saint, for I never shall be one myself, but a gentle creature who will help me, as I shall try to help her, so that we <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> together <b>and</b> finish our work hereafter, if we haven't time to do it here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> {{see what}} she says as to her reason for coming." [...] So Harry went on reading. [...] "I have {{suffered}} much, and of course I know that I must suffer more; but I am determined that I will face {{the worst of it}} at once. It has been hinted to me that an attempt will be made to interfere with the settlement--" [...] "Who can have hinted that?" [...] said Harry. Lady Clavering suspected who might have done so, but she made no answer. [...] "I can hardly think it possible; but, if it is done, I will not be out of the way. I have done my duty as best I could, and have done it under circumstances that I may truly say were terrible; and I will go on doing it. No one shall say that I am ashamed to show my face and claim my own. You will be surprised when you see me. I have aged so much--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Captain laughed. [...] "Pirates!" [...] said he. [...] "What stuff! There are no pirates {{in these}} days!" [...] {{and then he}} laughed again. [...] "Well, I can't talk any more now," [...] said he, [...] "but I'll keep your {{business}} in my mind, and settle it pretty soon. Then {{you can go back}} and tell your people what I'll do. You had better go on deck and make yourself comfortable. If you'll take my advice, you won't do any talking. The people on this vessel don't know what she carries, and I don't want them to know! So if I see you talking to anybody, I'll consider that you want to make trouble--and I can tell you, if some of these people on board knew what was in them boxes in the hold, there would be the worst kind of trouble. You can bet your head on that! So you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> show yourself. Your friends won't be worried about you--I've explained it all to them in my note!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{might have}} asked Araminta herself," [...] she adds; and, so saying, {{she holds the}} doll before her, and enters into a long {{imaginary}} conversation with her, more or less spirited and original, according to the talent and ingenuity of the young lady, but, in any conceivable case, enough so to completely absorb {{the attention of the}} children and fully to occupy their minds. She asks each of them her name, and inquires of each which of the girls is her mother, and makes first one of them, and then the other, point to her mother in giving her answer. By this time the illusion is completely established in the children's minds of regarding their dolls as living beings, responsible to mothers for their conduct and behavior; and the young lady <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> give her admonitions and instructions in respect to the sin and folly of quarrelling to them--the children listening. And it will be found that by this management the impression upon the minds of the children will be far greater and more effective than if the counsels were addressed directly to them; while, at the same time, though they may even take the form of very severe reproof, they will produce no sullenness or vexation in the minds of those for whom they are really intended. Indeed, the very reason why the admonition thus given will be so much more effective {{is the fact that it}} does not tend in any degree to awaken resentment and vexation, but associates the lesson which the teacher wishes to convey with amusement and pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she said. [...] "It isn't {{anything}} serious, of course, but it's wonderful, Philip, what memories {{a really}} lonely woman will live on, what {{she will do}} to keep that little natural vein of sentiment alive in her, and how fiercely she will fight to conceal it. You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> down <b>and</b> wait {{for me in the}} hall. I am going in to say good-by to Miss Martha Grimes. I think that this time I shall get on better with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tomorrow morning," [...] the Major <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> [...] "we will {{continue}} the work of filling sandbags. There are still {{a large number of}} empty bags on hand. We shall want them for all the lower windows and doors, and the more there are of them the better; and we must also keep a supply in readiness to make a retrenchment if they should breach the wall. Now, Mr. Hunter, as soon as you have made out your list my watch <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> duty, <b>and</b> I should advise the others to turn in without delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And with my father, at first, I'm {{sure she}} had the real thing. She knows; she has been there.
