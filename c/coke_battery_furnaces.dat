The HEM properties are determined thanks to brick-mortar interface behaviour, experimentally characterised at high temperature. In order to control joint opening, a criterion changing the HEM is used. The use of the HEM gives the global stresses instead of local stresses, that's why, a submodelling step has been developed to obtain local stresses used in the criterion and thus to have accurate information about joint opening...|$|R
