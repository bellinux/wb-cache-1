5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro {{said that he and}} Yamazaki would like to make a third Investigations game, and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future, but that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any promises.|$|E

When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> {{a living as a}} lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{short cut}} of the German ships is via the English Channel. It is 240 miles from Brest to Cherbourg and another 120 miles from Cherbourg to the Dover straits. While ships could make the passage from Brest to Cherbourg or from Cherbourg to the Dover straits in the same dark period, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the {{complete}} passage from Brest to Dover in one dark period.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Following Against All Odds, Team 3D {{were forced}} to weigh in before each contest, which created a feud with the team of Curry Man and Shark Boy, leading to a Fish Market Street Fight between the two teams, with the {{stipulation}} that if Team 3D <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> weight they would be fired from TNA. At the event, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight that night {{they would not have}} to abide by a weight restriction henceforth. Team 3D marked in below the mark prior to the contest; however eventually lost the encounter.|$|E
5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Carmen Velazquez lost welfare {{benefits}} from the government under {{the provisions of the}} Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act (TANF). An attorney from an LSC grantee, Bronx Legal Services, litigated her claim. Bronx Legal Services, on behalf of Velazquez, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking a declaration that the provision of the act prohibiting challenges to existing welfare law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. It argued {{that there was no way}} to help Velazquez without challenging the welfare system itself, and sought to challenge the provisions of TANF under which Velazquez lost her benefits; a challenge they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> due to the 1996 restrictions. The district court denied an injunction.|$|E

5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain {{the support of the}} Holy See against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the Holy See <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Porto Ferrajo was a French {{attempt to}} force the {{surrender}} of the Tuscan fortress town of Porto Ferrajo (now Portoferraio) {{on the island of}} Elba following the French occupation of mainland Tuscany in 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered, but received significant support from British Royal Navy forces who controlled the Mediterranean Sea and ensured that supplies reached the garrison and that French supply convoys were intercepted. The French began the siege with 1,500 men in May 1801, later reinforced to more than 5,000, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> an impression on the fortress's defences, instead seeking to starve the defenders into submission with the support of a squadron of French Navy frigates operating off the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{recapture}} of Primosole Bridge did {{not result}} in the rapid advance over the Catania plain envisioned by Montgomery. The by now exhausted 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was holding a position based on the bridge. The 5th Infantry Division took over the lead, but after a number of attacks <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any further progress. Its 13th Infantry Brigade had to establish another bridgehead across the Simeto, but the Germans had brought in more troops and prepared defensive positions, and after hard fighting it was not until 5 August 1943 that the Eighth Army entered the city of Catania itself. Further hard fighting followed, and they entered Messina just after the United States Seventh Army on 17 August 1943.|$|E

5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the {{beginning}} of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

5|$|By October 9, {{all of the}} French and American {{guns were}} in place. Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three {{eighteen}} pounders, two eight-inch (203mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate, HMS Guadeloupe across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00pm the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; {{legend has it that}} this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The Franco-American guns began to tear apart the British defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the British <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> repairs. All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced. The British soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers. Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Citi Bike's massive, {{unexpected}} popularity caused {{problems within}} a year. In January 2014, the designer of Citi Bike's bicycles and docking stations {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection. Officials with Montreal, Quebec-based Public Bike System Company (also known as Bixi) said they were $46 million in debt, partly because the operators of Citi Bike and Chicago's Divvy bikeshare had withheld a combined $5 million in payments because of software glitches in the docking stations. Alta officials, who operate Citi Bike, Divvy, and Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., said they anticipated no interruptions of service, though they did want $20 million to expand the system to 10,000 bikes and 600 stations. However, due to Citi Bike's various problems, expansions to the Upper East and Upper West Sides were delayed {{for at least a}} year. Its general manager resigned in March. The new mayor, Bill de Blasio, stated that he wanted to expand Citi Bike's reach, but that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> city funds available for such an expansion at that time.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> enough new textures {{because of the}} amount of diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E
