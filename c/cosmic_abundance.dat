500|$|This {{rarity of}} {{tellurium}} in the Earth's crust {{is not a}} reflection of its <b>cosmic</b> <b>abundance.</b> [...] Tellurium is more abundant than rubidium in the cosmos, though rubidium is ten thousand times more abundant in the Earth's crust.

Under this scenario, certain elements that form volatile hydrides, such as tellurium, were severely depleted through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process.|$|E
500|$|During cosmic {{nucleogenesis}} of the elements, {{large amounts}} of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars. Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth in <b>cosmic</b> <b>abundance</b> after hydrogen, helium, oxygen and carbon), it is very rare on Earth. It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume (this {{is about the same}} as the molecular or mole fraction), and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. The reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner (terrestrial) planets is that neon [...] is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids. As a result, it escaped from the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System. Even the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon, although for a different reason. It is also lighter than air, causing it to escape even from Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

The nature of cometary dust and the atomic abundances of H, C, N, O, and S in the volatile fraction are examined, and data on the dust and volatile fractions are combined to derive elemental abundances.

5000|$|Oxygen and silicon are {{notably the}} most common {{elements}} in the crust.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{determination}} of elemental abundances from high resolution X-ray data. We emphasize {{the need for an}} accurate determination of the underlying temperature structure and advocate the use of a line ratio method which allows us to utilize, first, the strongest lines observed in the X-ray spectra, and second, lines that span a rather wide temperature range. We point out the need to use continuous emission measure distributions and show via example that modeling in terms of individual temperature components yields errors of more than 50 %. We stress the need to derive differential emission measure distributions based on physical assumptions and considerations. We apply our methods to the Chandra LETGS spectrum of Algol and show that nitrogen is considerably enhanced compared to <b>cosmic</b> <b>abundances</b> by a factor of 2 while carbon is depleted by at least a factor of 25.

The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers (the Oddo-Harkins rule), and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide {{that can be made}} by fusion of helium in supernovae. Elements 43 (Tc) Technetium and 61 (Pm) Promethium are omitted from the graph due to their extremely low <b>cosmic</b> <b>abundance,</b> which is far below the adjacent even-numbered nucleides.|$|E

50|$|Of the {{varieties}} of molecules identified in the interstellar medium , 84 are based on carbon while only 8 are based on silicon. Moreover, of those 8 compounds, four also include carbon within them. The <b>cosmic</b> <b>abundance</b> of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest {{a greater variety of}} complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation on which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Also, even though Earth and other terrestrial planets are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon, may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.|$|E
