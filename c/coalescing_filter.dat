50|$|To {{clean the}} process air further, there are {{different}} stages of filtration. First of all, more condensate is removed, then a <b>Coalescing</b> <b>filter</b> acts as a gravity filter and finally an adsorber filled with activated carbon removes some hydrocarbons.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{compressed}} air is first filtered with a high-quality <b>coalescing</b> <b>filter.</b> This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from {{the compressed}} air. The water vapor-laden air then {{passes through the}} center bore of hollow fibers in the membrane bundle. At the same time, {{a small portion of}} the dry air product is redirected along the outside surface of the fibers to sweep out the water vapor which has permeated the membrane. The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and clean, dry air is supplied to the application. The membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate.|$|E

50|$|In {{the area}} of {{compressed}} air purification, <b>coalescing</b> <b>filters</b> are used to separate liquid water and oil from compressed air using a <b>coalescing</b> effect.

50|$|High oil {{compressed}} air <b>coalescing</b> <b>filters</b> remove water and oil aerosols by coalescing the aerosols into droplets. This happens partially because of tortuous path and pressure drop. Coalescers remove both water and oil aerosols {{from the air}} stream, and are rated at particulate contamination through direct interception. Filtration of oil, water aerosols, dust and dirt particles to 0.01 µm the best achievable in industry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Cisco’s NetFlow Collector (NFC) is a {{powerful}} example of a real-world product that supports multiple aggregate queries over a continuous stream of IP flow records. NFC enables a plethora of network management tasks like traffic demands estimation, application traffic profiling, etc. In this paper, we investigate two computation sharing techniques for enabling streaming applications such as NFC to scale to hundreds of queries. Our first technique instantiates certain intermediate aggregates which are then used to generate the final answers for input queries. Our second technique <b>coalesces</b> the <b>filter</b> conditions of similar queries and uses the <b>coalesced</b> <b>filter</b> to pre-filter stream data input to these queries. Using these techniques, we propose a heuristic to compute a good query plan and perform extensive simulations to show that our heuristic delivers a factor of over 3 performance improvement compared to a naive approach.

An industry standard chemical test {{for the detection of}} free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm (parts per million) free water.

40|$|This work {{details the}} results of a study into the {{relationship}} between pressure drop and liquid saturation in mist (or <b>coalescing)</b> <b>filters.</b> Liquid saturation (clogging) in mist filters is of critical importance as it is directly related to filter efficiency and flow resistance. Experiments were conducted to determine steady-state saturation and pressure drop values in commonly used oleophillic fibrous filter media, using a range of different combinations of face velocity and number of layers of media within the filter element. Several empirical relationships for saturation and pressure drop were derived based on the relationships found. In addition, a capillary-based saturation model has been described and fitted to the experimental data. A good agreement between the model and data was obtained when an empirically fitted term was added. Equations were developed which allow such variables to be determined from known parameters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined volume-of-fluid and discrete Lagrangian particle tracking method {{which can be}} used to simulate oil-mist or <b>coalescing</b> <b>filters,</b> and gauge their effectiveness. The solver is built on the open-source OpenFOAM CFD libraries, which are extended to include a physically accurate model for motion of small particles, coupled with a volume-offluid treatment as particles coalesce, or are collected on the fibres. A key part of the method is accounting for particles as they change between a discrete Lagrangian treatment to a volume-offluid treatment. Results from an investigation into an idealised filter geometry are used to demonstrate that the method is feasible, robust and that realistic behaviour of an oil-mist filter can be captured. Successful implementation of the method should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the behaviour of oil mist filters, and will allow design options to be explored through simulation, in addition to experimentation.

40|$|Coalescence {{filtration}} using fibrous filters is {{a well-known}} approach for the separation of water-in-oil emulsions. Many factors {{have an effect on}} the performance of <b>coalescing</b> <b>filters</b> including fluid velocity, fiber geometry, surface properties, bed length etc. In liquid-liquid filtration, wettability of the filter media plays an important role in coalescence phenomena. It is known that, intermediate wettability gives best filter performance [1]. Wetting and non-wetting behavior of a solid material surface is generally characterized using contact angle. The direct approach of contact angle can not be used for characterizing the wettability of a filter medium. Instead, the liquid penetration approach is used to measure the contact angles of filter media treating the pores as a bundle of uniform capillaries. This method of the liquid penetration is based on the equilibrium capillary pressure and Washburn’s equation. Washburn’s equation is based on the capillary driving force of a liquid that penetrates a compact vertical bed of particles with small pores and the viscous drag: r cosθ γ 2 eff a lvt h =...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of flow interruptions on the filtration performance of two different multi-layered fibrous filters during liquid aerosol filtration. It was found that both types of filters experienced a significant secondary loading stage, though they had reached a steady state for continuous flow. The filters showed distinctive increases in pressure drop and filter saturation until a second equilibrium state was reached. This second equilibrium state was attributed to a rearrangement of liquid in the filter during the breaks, clogging previously free passages. The ratio of shear and capillary forces was found to determine whether these passages were able to be “cleaned” once airflow was recommenced. Based on these findings, the airflow required to clean fully saturated filters was investigated and a phenomenological model developed to describe this behaviour. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} filters could be cleaned and reused, whereby they would return to one of the previous steady states (continuous or discontinuous flow). The experiments conducted in this work represent a more realistic test for oil-mist (or <b>coalescing)</b> <b>filters</b> than typical laboratory testing. Furthermore, it is hoped that they will help {{to bridge the gap between}} laboratory and field test results...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the investigation of the}} feasibility of rapid drilling in ice sheets and glaciers to depths of up to 600 m, with cuttings and cores continually transported by air reverse circulation. The method employs dual wall drill rods. The inner tubes provide a continuous pathway for the chips and cores from the drill bit face to the surface. To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original cutter drill bits and air processing devices (air-cooled aftercoolers, air receivers, <b>coalescing</b> <b>filters,</b> desiccant dryers) should be used. The airflow velocity for conveying a 60 -mm diameter and 200 -mm long ice core should not be lower than 22. 5 m/s, and the minimal airflow rate for continual chip and cores transport is 6. 8 m 3 /min at 2. 3 – 2. 6 MPa. Drilling of a 600 -m deep hole can be accomplished within 1. 5 days in the case of 24 h drilling operations. However, to avoid sticking while drilling through ice, the drilling depth should to be limited to 540 m at a temperature of − 20 °C and to 418 m at a temperature of − 10 °C. この論文では、氷床や氷河の深度 600 mまでの氷コア掘削について、空気を循環して送ることで氷の切削と氷コアの輸送を連続的に行う高速掘削の実行可能性について述べている。この方法は、二重のチューブにしたドリルロッドを使うことで可能である。二重ドリルロッドの内側チューブは、ドリルの切削面から地上までの切削チップおよび氷コアの輸送経路となる。様々な氷河の状況によって空気循環掘削技術を適応するために、それに対応するドリルロッドのカッターと空気処理装置（乾燥した冷たい空気を送るための、空冷クーラー、空気貯留タンク、空気乾燥機など）を使用する必要がある。直径 60 mm、長さ 200 mmの氷コアを運ぶための空気速度は 22. 5 m/s以上でなければならず、連続的な切削チップおよび氷コア輸送のための最小空気流量は 2. 3 〜 2. 6 MPaの時に 6. 8 m 3 /分になる。 24 時間の掘削作業の場合には、 600 mの深さの孔を 1. 5 日以内に掘削することが可能である。しかし、氷河や氷床の掘削中にスタックするのを避けるためには、掘削深度を− 20 ℃の氷温では 540 mに、− 10 ℃の氷温では 418 mに制限する必要がある...|$|R

40|$|When the raw {{output of}} a {{gravitational}} wave detector is {{correlated with the}} matched <b>filter</b> of a <b>coalescing</b> binary wave form the filtered output shows a periodic behavior—it rings at a certain frequency. This phenomenon could be worrisome since the signal peak in the filtered output might be reduced if it falls in the ``trough'' of the sinusoid. In this paper we address this question and present a detailed examination of the ringing which {{is caused by the}} effective narrow banding by the matched filter of detector noise. We first solve the problem for an idealized ``box'' filter and show that the ringing frequency is roughly the central frequency of the box if the box is not too wide. For an idealized <b>coalescing</b> binary <b>filter</b> we show that the expected value of this frequency is 1. 27 fs where fs is the seismic noise cutoff of the detector. The ringing implies that there is some redundancy in the filtered ouput. Also the autocorrelation function of the filtered output resembles the sinc function, and hence adjacent sample points are correlated, i. e., the filtered output is colored. These two phenomena are related and have a bearing on the setting up of thresholds and also suggest that we resample the filtered output at a coarser rate. We investigate the problem of thresholds when the filtered output is colored and obtain relations between the false alarm probabilities and threshold levels. Finally we suggest optimal sampling rates so that the resampled filtered output is uncorrelated...|$|R
50|$|Agitation, heat, special baffling, <b>coalescing</b> packs, and <b>filtering</b> {{materials}} {{can assist in}} the removal of nonsolution gas that otherwise may be retained in the oil because of the viscosity and surface tension of the oil. Gas can {{be removed from the}} top of the drum by virtue of being gas. Oil and water are separated by a baffle at the end of the separator, which is set at a height close to the oil-water contact, allowing oil to spill over onto the other side, while trapping water on the near side. The two fluids can then be piped out of the separator from their respective sides of the baffle. The produced water is then either injected back into the oil reservoir, disposed of, or treated. The bulk level (gas-liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel. Valves on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation. The smaller droplets of water will not settle by gravity and will remain in the oil stream. Normally the oil from the separator is routed to a coalescer to further reduce the water content.|$|R
40|$|Fibrous {{filters are}} used for {{environmental}} and occupational mist sampling and industrial mist collection. If compounds in the filtered droplets are volatile or semi-volatile, they may evaporate into the gas passing through the filter. In sampling applications, failure to properly account for evaporation of collected mist will lead to mist concentration estimates that are low. In control applications, volatilization of filtered droplets may release vapors that are harmful to workers or the public. Also, vapor emitted from mist filters may recondense as a hazardous aerosol or on surfaces to pose a safety or housekeeping problem. Droplets collected by fibrous <b>filters</b> <b>coalesce</b> into larger drops that reside on the fibers. Results from a numerical model developed to predict evaporation from these drops agree favorably with experimental data. Measurements and numerical predictions show that a gas stream leaving a wetted fibrous filter can be saturated with the vapor of semi-volatile compounds retained on the filter. In some situations, the model indicates that the gas stream will be saturated before it passes 0. 1 mm into a wetted filter. If the liquid retained on a filter is a pure compound, the vapor concentration leaving the filter is constant when initially clean air passes through. If the liquid is multicomponent, the downstream vapor concentration in previously uncontaminated air will decrease with time as the more volatile components evaporate preferentially. Fluctuations in incoming mist and vapor concentrations can enhance evaporation because more retained liquid will volatilize when incoming vapor concentrations are low. # 1999 British Occupational Hygiene Society...|$|R
