2500|$|A {{commodity}} {{index fund}} is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or {{linked to a}} commodity index. In just about every case the index {{is in fact a}} Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the Commodity Research Bureau (<b>CRB)</b> <b>Index,</b> which began in 1958. Its construction made it unuseful as an investment index. The first practically investable commodity futures index was the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, created in 1991, and known as the [...] "GSCI". The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After AIG's financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to UBS and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / <b>CRB</b> <b>index</b> (which is the old <b>CRB</b> <b>Index</b> as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Parallel factor (PARAFAC) {{analysis}} {{is an extension}} of low-rank matrix decomposition to higher way arrays, also referred to as tensors. It decomposes a given array in a sum of multilinear terms, analogous to the familiar bilinear vector outer products that appear in matrix decomposition. PARAFAC analysis generalizes and unifies common array processing models, like joint diagonalization and ESPRIT; it has found numerous applications from blind multiuser detection and multidimensional harmonic retrieval, to clustering and nuclear magnetic resonance. The prevailing fitting algorithm in all these applications is based on (alternating) least squares, which is optimal for Gaussian noise. In many cases, however, measurement errors are far from being Gaussian. In this paper, we develop two iterative algorithms for the least absolute error fitting of general multilinear models. The first is based on efficient interior point methods for linear programming, employed in an alternating fashion. The second is based on a weighted median filtering iteration, which is particularly appealing from a simplicity viewpoint. Both are guaranteed to converge in terms of absolute error. Performance is illustrated by means of simulations, and compared to the pertinent Cramér–Rao bounds (<b>CRBs).</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Array signal processing, non-Gaussian noise, parallel factor analysis, robust model fitting.

40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{approaches}} for estimation of the equity market attractiveness. Fed's model has received a wide prevalence. However this model has a number of essential restrictions. In particular the Fed's model uses current earnings yield, which is based on analysts’ estimates of earnings over the coming twelve months. However as it is shown in the article these estimations can play certain role only in the short-term prospect. In the long-term prospect they will reflect real changes in economy that makes their use as parameters for the long-term estimation doubtful enough.

On the other hand, year-to-year change of {{earnings}} multiple P/E tends to anticorrelate with profits cycle. It shows sluggishness of market response in relation to profits cycle. It is shown that there is one important condition for development of new long-term bull trend. It is presence of phase of earnings accumulation. Such accumulation is possible only during periods of significant outstripping of earnings growth over the market growth. Now there is no phase of earnings accumulation, because market returned to 8 % long-term growth rate, which outstrips the 5. 5 % long-term earnings growth rate.

40|$|Abstract—The use of {{multiple}} transmit and receive antennas can offer substantial performance improvement to a wireless communication system by providing spatial diversity and supporting high data rate services. Many of the current space-time coding schemes proposed for multiple-antenna systems assume perfect timing information to achieve the expected performance gain. The lack of timing synchronization between the transmit and receive signals could degrade the system performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem of timing estimation in multiple-antenna systems {{with the aid of}} training signals. A slow, independent and identically distributed Rayleigh flat-fading channel model is considered. We derive two maximum likehood timing estimators based on two different approaches, namely, treating the channel deterministic and random and present the corresponding Cramér–Rao bounds (CRBs). Then, the optimal designs of training signals based on some figures of merit associated with the <b>CRBs</b> are discussed. <b>Index</b> Terms—Cramér–Rao bound, MIMO system, optimal training sequence, Rayleigh fading, timing estimation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In an {{underwater}} medium the sound speed is not con-stant, but varies with depth. This phenomenon upsets the linear dependency {{of the distance}} traveled by an acoustic wave to {{the time it takes}} for the wave to travel that distance, and therefore makes existing distance-based localization algorithms less effec-tive in {{an underwater}} environment. This paper addresses the prob-lems of localizing a fixed node and tracking a mobile target from acoustic time-of-flight (ToF) measurements in a three-dimensional underwater environment with an isogradient sound speed profile. To solve these problems we first analytically relate the acoustic wave ToF between two nodes to their positions. After obtaining sufficient ToF measurements, we then adopt the Gauss-Newton al-gorithm to localize the fixed node in an iterative manner, and we utilize the extended Kalman filter for tracking the mobile target in a recursive manner. Through several simulations, we will illustrate that the proposed algorithms perform superb since they meet the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for localization and posterior <b>CRB</b> for tracking. <b>Index</b> Terms—Extended Kalman filter, Gauss-Newton algo-rithm, localization, ray tracing, sound speed profile, tracking...|$|R

However, by proper research, we can analyze the reason for the decoupling and predict the same. Taking for example, in 1993, both the <b>CRB</b> <b>Index</b> and the 30-year bond rallied that summer; these two markets were negatively correlated. The problem was as the interest rates were falling, prices of bonds were rising so rapidly which caused the effect - An Intermarket inversion.

The logic is that interest rates falling stimulated the economy; which caused the fear of inflation and commodity prices to rally.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a common}} habit among {{practitioners}} to maintain under strong control {{the behavior of a}} bunch of indexes that are known to capture the movements of Eurozone stocks. Baltic Dry Index (BDI), RJ/CRB Commodity Price <b>Index</b> (<b>CRB),</b> Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) and Deutsche Bank G 10 Currency Future Harvest Index (DBHI), in fact, are supposed to exhibit a kind of anticipatory behavior with respect to that of Eurozone economy: understanding their dynamics should therefore imply to know in advance how the economic system will behave. The rationale of this chapter is to verify to what extent the use of tools relying on chaos theory and complexity studies (in our case: multiscaling analysis) can be of any help to capture such anticipatory movements. To do this, we performed two separate tasks: we evaluated the Hurst exponent of the aforementioned indexes using a set of techniques, to give robustness to the results; we then moved to compute for each of them the Hölderian function values.

PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are considered expressions of the same disease, termed as venous thromboembolism (VTE). In the present review, we describe and meta-analyze the efficacy and safety data available with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) in clinical trials testing these new compounds in the acute/long-term and extended therapy of VTE, providing subgroup analyses in patients with index PE. We analyzed ten studies in 35, 019 randomized patients. A total of 14, 364 patients (41 %) had index PE. In the acute/long-term treatment of VTE, the DOAC showed comparable efficacy in preventing recurrent VTE to standard treatment in patients with index PE (risk ratio [RR]: 0. 88; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 70 – 1. 11) and index DVT (RR: 0. 93; 95 % CI: 0. 75 – 1. 16) (P for subgroup differences = 0. 76). VTE recurrence depending on PE anatomical extension and presence/absence of right ventricular dysfunction was only reported in two trials, with results being consistent with those obtained in the overall study populations. In the single trial comparing extended therapy of VTE with DOAC versus warfarin, the point estimate for recurrent VTE tended to disfavor the DOAC in patients with index PE (RR: 2. 05; 95 % CI: 0. 83 – 5. 03) and in patients with index DVT (RR: 1. 11; 95 % CI: 0. 49 – 2. 50) (P for subgroup differences = 0. 32). In trials that compared DOAC versus placebo for extended therapy, the reduction in recurrent VTE was consistent in patients with PE (RR: 0. 15; 95 % CI: 0. 01 – 1. 82) and in patients with DVT (RR: 0. 25; 95 % CI: 0. 10 – 0. 61) (P for subgroup differences = 0. 71). The DOAC were associated with a consistently lower risk of clinically relevant bleeding (CRB) than standard treatment of acute VTE and higher risk of CRB than placebo for extended therapy of VTE regardless of index event. In summary, the DOAC were as effective as, and safer than, standard treatment of (hemodynamically stable) PE. Their efficacy in preventing recurrent VTE seemed consistent regardless of anatomical extension of PE (extensive, intermediate, or limit) or presence/absence of right ventricular dysfunction although the data are limited. For extended therapy, the DOAC were more effective than placebo in preventing recurrent VTE but were associated {{with an increase in}} <b>CRB</b> regardless of <b>index</b> event.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} direction-of-arrival (DOA) of multiple uncorrelated sources from single an-tenna power measurements is addressed. Utilizing {{the fact that the}} antenna pattern is bandlimited and can be modeled as a finite sum of complex exponentials, we first show that the problem can be transformed into a frequency estimation problem. Then, we ex-plain how the annihilating filter method can be used to solve for the DOA in the noiseless case. In the presence of noise, we propose to use Cadzow denoising that is formulated as an iterative algorithm derived from exploiting the matrix rank and linear structure prop-erties. Furthermore, we have also derived the Cramér–Rao Bound (CRB) and reviewed several alternative approaches that {{can be used as a}} comparison to the proposed approach. From the simu-lation and experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches. It is also ev-ident from the Monte Carlo analysis that the proposed approach converges to the <b>CRB.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Annihilating filter, denoising, direction-of-arrival, single antenna direction finding.

40|$|Abstract—LOFAR is a low-frequency radio astronomical array {{currently}} under development in The Netherlands. It {{is designed to}} produce synthesis images of the most distant celestial objects yet observed. Due to high redshift levels, observations must be at unusually low frequencies (30 – 240 MHz), over large apertures (100 km), using thousands of antennas. At these frequencies, Earth’s ionosphere acts as a random refractive sheet which over the large aperture induces source direction dependent gain and phase errors that must be estimated and calibrated out. Current radio astronomy “self-calibration ” algorithms do not address direction dependence and will not work in the LOFAR environment. This paper presents a formal study of the parameter estimation problem for LOFAR calibration. A data model is proposed, and a Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRB) analysis is developed with a new general formulation to easily incorporate a variety of constraining signal models. It is shown that although the unconstrained direction dependent calibration problem is ambiguous, physically justifiable constraints can be applied in LOFAR to yield viable solutions. Use of a “compact core ” of closely spaced array elements {{as part of the}} larger array is shown to significantly improve full array direction dependent calibration performance. Candidate algorithms are proposed and compared to the <b>CRB.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Array calibration, Cramér–Rao bound (CRB), radio astronomy...|$|E
