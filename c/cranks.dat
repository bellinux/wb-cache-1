5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with <b>cranks</b> having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and <b>cranks</b> used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} type to incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle. The outside <b>cranks</b> were set at 120°, with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley conjugated valve gear derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E

5|$|The trio {{eventually}} {{reach an}} underground temple where the Thugs worship Kali with human sacrifice. They {{watch as the}} Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial fire pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession {{of three of the}} five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. After defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and <b>cranks</b> it out of the pit just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire. They go back to the mines to free the children, but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer. The Maharajah, who was also entranced, attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll. Shorty spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. With his strength returned, Indy kills the overseer. The Maharajah then tells Shorty {{how to get out of}} the mines. While Mola Ram escapes, Indy and Shorty rescue Willie and retrieve the three Sankara stones, the village children escape.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of newly proposed bicycle’s <b>crank</b> to <b>crank</b> angle setting on the Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Bicep Femoris (BF) muscle activity during cycling. Procedures of Conconi Test were used throughout the experiment for the data collection purpose. The muscles activities were recorded using surface electromyography and software LabChart 7.

It was found that 0 ° <b>crank</b> to <b>crank</b> setting (similar to conventional <b>crank</b> to <b>crank</b> angle setting) caused the prime mover VL (Normalized RMS = 0. 119) to fatigue more than BF (Normalized RMS = 0. 102).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>crank</b> configuration on muscle activity and torque production during submaximal arm <b>crank</b> ergometry. Thirteen non-specifically trained male participants volunteered. During the research trials they completed a warm-up at 15 W before two 3 -min exercise stages were completed at 50 and 100 W; subjects used either a synchronous or asynchronous pattern of <b>cranking.</b> During the final 30 -s of each submaximal exercise stage electromyographic and torque production data were collected. After the data had been processed each parameter was analysed using separate 2 -way ANOVA tests with repeated measures. The activity of all muscles increased in line with external workload, although {{a shift in the}} temporal pattern of muscle activity was noted between <b>crank</b> configurations. Patterns of torque production during asynchronous and synchronous <b>cranking</b> were distinct. Furthermore, peak, minimum and delta (peak-minimum) torque values were different (P < 0. 05) between <b>crank</b> configurations at both workloads. For example, at 100 W, peak torque using synchronous [19. 6 (4. 3) Nm] <b>cranking</b> was higher (P < 0. 05) compared to asynchronous [16. 8 (1. 6) Nm] <b>cranking.</b> In contrast minimum torque was lower (P < 0. 05) at 100 W using synchronous [4. 8 (1. 7) Nm] compared to asynchronous [7. 3 (1. 2) Nm] <b>cranking.</b> There was a distinct bilateral asymmetry in torque production during asynchronous <b>cranking</b> with the dominant transmitting significantly more force to the <b>crank</b> arm. Taken together, these preliminary data demonstrate the complex nature of muscle activity during arm <b>crank</b> ergometry performed with an asynchronous or synchronous <b>crank</b> set-up. Further work is required to determine how muscle activity (EMG activity) and associated patterns of torque production influence physiological responses and functional capacity during arm <b>crank</b> ergometry...|$|R
