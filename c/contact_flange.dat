40|$|The {{study of}} lateral {{dynamics}} of running trains on bridges is of importance mainly {{for the safety}} of the traffic, and may be relevant for laterally compliant bridges. These studies require threedimensional coupled vehicle-bridge models, wheree consideration of wheel to rail contact is a key aspect. Furthermore, an adequate evaluation of safety of rail traffic requires nonlinear models. A nonlinear coupled model is proposed here for vehicle-structure vertical and lateral dynamics. Vehicles are considered as fully three-dimensional multibody systems including gyroscopic terms and large rotation effects. The bridge structure is modeled by means of finite elements which may be of beam, shell or continuum type and may include geometric or material nonlinearities. The track geometry includes distributed track alignment irregularities. Both subsystems (bridge and vehicles) are described with coordinates in absolute reference frames, as opposed to alternative approaches which describe the multibody system with coordinates relative to the base bridge motion. The wheelrail contact employed is a semi-Hertzian model based on realistic wheel-rail profiles. It allows a detailed geometrical description of the contact patch under each wheel including multiple-point <b>contact,</b> <b>flange</b> contact and uplift. Normal and tangential stresses in each contact are integrated at each time-step to obtain the resultant contact forces. The models have been implemented within an existing finite element analysis software with multibody capabilities, Abaqus (Simulia Ltd., 2010). Further details of the model are presented in Antolín et al. (2012). Representative applications are presented for railway vehicles under lateral wind action on laterally compliant viaducts, showing the relevance of the nonlinear wheel-rail contact model as well as the interaction between bridge and vehicle...|$|E

50|$|The allowed {{unbalanced}} superelevation {{will cause}} trains {{to run with}} normal <b>flange</b> <b>contact.</b> The points of wheel-rail contact {{are influenced by the}} tire profile of the wheels. Allowance has to be made for the different speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment if speeds and superelevation are not within the permitted limits. Many high-speed lines do not permit the use of slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the wear or friction of <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> on curves is reduced by the use of flange lubrication.|$|R
50|$|During this <b>flange</b> <b>contact,</b> {{the wheel}} {{on the high}} rail is {{experiencing}} the lateral force L, towards {{the outside of the}} curve. As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the flange angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a flange climbing derailment usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.|$|R

Using a finite element analysis approach, the important stress values in the flange and bolts and flange rotation/displacement have been obtained for variations in flange thickness, bolt pre-stress and taper angle (different surface profiles) whilst maintaining other leading flange dimensions (hub length and hub thickness) constant, when the vessel/flange component is subjected to internal pressure. In addition, results are compared for the flange geometry with no taper angle on the flange surface with the predictions obtained from the appropriate sections of the ASME, PD 5500 and new European unfired pressure vessel standard EN 13445 Part 3.

40|$|If {{the contact}} between the wheel and rail occurs at the flange, {{a high degree of}} slip is inherent. This can result in {{excessive}} wear and the potential for rolling contact fatigue cracking. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the bogie and track characteristics that may lead to <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> occuring. However, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available to validate such models or to assist in vehicle and track condition monitoring. In this study, the feasibility of a new approach is investigated. The method is based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel. The concept is that the sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> occurs. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the <b>flange</b> <b>contact.</b> The specimens were pressed to together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of head and <b>flange</b> <b>contact.</b> The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied.

In the present paper, the effects of <b>contact</b> between <b>flange</b> plates are modelled via a refined beam model which has been previously applied with success to represent the elastic behaviour of non-preloaded L-stubs and T-stubs. Taking into account the behaviour of the <b>flange</b> in the <b>contact</b> area and bolt bending, a model is developed to predict the plastic resistance of L-stub joints. Simplifications are proposed to facilitate the determination of the contact zone and the ultimate resistances corresponding to failure modes involving flange and bolt. The comparison between analytical results with 3 D finite element elasto-plastic analyses and experimental tests indicates that the proposed model provides good capacity predictions. Effects of contact, and therefore of the prying force, are particularly important in the case of relatively thin flanges. © 201...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{leakages}} are {{a considerable}} problem when measuring waveguide structures at high frequencies. In {{order to maintain}} good electrical <b>contact,</b> <b>flanges</b> need to be tightly and evenly screwed to the device under test. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially with repeated measurements. We present a metamaterial-based adapter, which prohibits leakage even {{in the presence of}} gaps at the interconnects. This so-called gap adapter has been fabricated from a metallized polymer (SU 8). The reflection coefficient is below - 20 dB throughout the band for a 50 -mu m gap {{on both sides of the}} gap adapter. In comparison, a conventional waveguide with a 50 -mu m gap on both sides has a reflection coefficient of - 10 dB. The gap adapter can be used to perform fast measurements, since the normal flange screws are redundant. We compare the SU 8 gap adapter with a Si version and to a smooth metal waveguide reference disc. The SU 8 gap adapter performed better than the Si version and much better than the waveguide disc in all test cases. SU 8 gap adapters were used to measure on a waveguide component. The SU 8 gap adapters with 50 -mu m gaps performed comparable with the waveguide component with the flange screws carefully tightened. The polymer also makes the gap adapter mechanically robust and easy to mass fabricate. [2015 - 0113...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} study {{of the influence of}} operating conditions on the tribological aspects of the wheel flange and rail gauge <b>contact.</b> The wheel <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> occurs when the vehicle moves on a curve track and it leads to severe up to catastrophic wear regime.

40|$|Wheel/rail {{contact is}} {{critical}} to the successful operation of a railway network. Contact occurs at the wheel tread/rail head and wheel flange/rail gauge corner. Contact conditions are more severe in the latter, which occurs mainly at curves. The contact is small and supports large loads; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These, combined with the slip in the contact, are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether by deformation, wear or a fatigue process. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the wheel/rail contact characteristics; however, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available. In this study, the feasibility of an approach based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel is investigated. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If <b>flange</b> <b>contact</b> takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced.

40|$|Abstract: Maintaining the {{alignment}} of railway track {{is vitally important}} for the smooth and safe passage of railway vehicles. Poor track alignment can result in poor ride quality, <b>flange</b> <b>contact,</b> or even <b>flange</b> climb. Accurate horizontal track geometry can be measured using a dedicated track recording vehicle or from a full track geometry recording system mounted on an in-service vehicle. This paper describes the use of sensors mounted on the bogie of an in-service vehicle to estimate the mean track alignment {{without the use of}} optical or contact sensors. In principle, either bogie lateral acceleration or yaw rate can be processed to give an estimate of mean lateral track irregularity, but a yaw rate gyro provides consistent estimates down to lower vehicle speeds than does an accelerometer and does not require compensation for the effects of bogie roll. An improved estimate can be obtained by inverting the dynamic relationship between themean track alignment and the bogie yawmotion. This is demonstrated with results from a Class 175 vehicle. Continually monitoring the lateral response of a bogie on an in-service vehicle, using only a yaw rate gyro, can provide data enabling the prioritization of maintenance operations...|$|R

50|$|If, {{however, the}} {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side, the diameters of {{the regions of}} contact, and hence the tangential velocities of the wheels at the running surfaces are different and the wheelset tends to steer back towards the centre. Also, when the train encounters an unbanked turn, the wheelset displaces laterally slightly, so that the outer wheel tread speeds up linearly, and the inner wheel tread slows down, causing the train to turn the corner. Some railway systems employ a flat wheel and track profile, relying on cant alone to reduce or eliminate <b>flange</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|R
