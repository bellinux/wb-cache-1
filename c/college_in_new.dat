5|$|When Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick (1802–1871) died on March 6, 1871 {{at the age}} of 68, {{she named}} Rutgers College as her estate's residuary legatee. At that time, Rutgers was a small, private liberal arts <b>college</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Brunswick, New Jersey, {{affiliated}} with the Dutch Reformed faith. Founded in 1766 as Queen’s College, Rutgers is the eighth-oldest institution of higher education established in the United States.

5|$|George {{donated the}} royal library to the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation. He had no {{interest}} in reading, or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City, which later became Columbia University.

5|$|In 1763, Dr. Johnson was {{succeeded in}} the {{presidency}} by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate {{of the class of}} 1777, Alexander Hamilton. The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 {{with the arrival of the}} Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces. Loyalists were forced to abandon their King's <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, which was seized by the rebels and renamed Columbia College. The Loyalists, led by Bishop Charles Inglis fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they founded King's Collegiate School.|$|E

He graduated from Columbia <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York and earned a gold medal for a dissertation on the compounds of cyanogen. The couple moved to Columbia, South Carolina, when he was made professor of chemistry, mineralogy and geology at South Carolina College in 1836.

5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E

5|$|Robert Cade {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas on September 26, 1927. He was a {{fourth-generation}} Texan. Cade took an early interest in athletics, and ran the mile in four minutes, twenty seconds at Brackenridge High School, a very respectable time for a high school athlete in the early 1940s. He graduated from Brackenridge High School in May 1945, and served in the U.S. Navy as a pharmacist's mate during {{the last months of}} World War II through 1948. After being discharged from the navy, he enrolled in the University of Texas. He completed four years of undergraduate coursework in two calendar years, and graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1950. In 1953, he married Mary Strasburger, a nurse from Dallas, Texas, whom he had met while he was in medical school. After graduating with his doctor of medicine degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas in 1954, Cade completed his internship at the Saint Louis City Hospital in Saint Louis, Missouri and did his residency at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. He also served fellowships at his alma mater, Southwestern Medical School, and Cornell University Medical <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City.

5|$|The first {{bishop of}} Manchester, Denis Mary Bradley, invited the Benedictine monks of St. Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, {{to form a}} college and preparatory school in his diocese. The monks that came to Manchester from Saint Mary's were {{primarily}} of German descent. This {{is due to the}} fact that Manchester was heavily populated with French Canadian and Irish immigrant mill workers, and Bradley was unable to find a suitable religious community that would not stir up ethnic tensions. The German monks accepted, and founded the third Catholic <b>college</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> England. On August 1, 1889, the New Hampshire legislature approved the incorporation of the Order of Saint Benedict of New Hampshire “for religious and charitable purposes, for the education of youth, for establishing churches and conducting services therein.” This historic date marked the founding of Saint Anselm College. A six-year curriculum in philosophy and theology was developed. In 1892, as Alumni Hall neared completion, a fire destroyed the college on a cold winter night in February. The fire was most likely caused from an ember from the heating stove's gate as it was not closed properly. Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had received only $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. To save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. The monks rebuilt the college, and on October 11, 1893 the college was officially rededicated. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house, which today serves as the college print shop, was constructed separately from the building. Two years later, in 1895, the New Hampshire legislature granted Saint Anselm College the right to bestow standard academic degrees upon its graduates. In 1912, the bell tower and ivy were added to the building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. The second chapel serves today as the Alva deMars Megan Chapel Arts Center.|$|E
