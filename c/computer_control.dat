5|$|The first {{computer-controlled}} {{search for}} supernovae was {{begun in the}} 1960s at Northwestern University. They built a 24-inch telescope at Corralitos Observatory in New Mexico that could be repositioned under <b>computer</b> <b>control.</b> The telescope displayed a new galaxy each minute, with observers checking the view on a television screen. By this means, they discovered 14 supernovae {{over a period of}} two years.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members {{activated}} critical {{life support systems}} and <b>computer</b> <b>control,</b> as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station {{did not have enough}} electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so Unity was left unused and unheated. Unity had been used {{for the past two years}} to allow U.S. flight controllers to command ISS systems and read station system data.|$|E
5|$|Still unfinished, {{the vehicle}} was entered in an SPL {{competition}} in 1997 {{at which a}} complaint was lodged against the <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together {{in the hope that}} the motor speed was set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E

25|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>control</b> {{eliminates}} errors {{from human}} drivers, so PRT designs {{in a controlled}} environment should be much safer than private motoring on roads. Most designs enclose the running gear in the guideway to prevent derailments. Grade-separated guideways would prevent conflict with pedestrians or manually controlled vehicles. Other public transit safety engineering approaches, such as redundancy and self-diagnosis of critical systems, are also included in designs.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, some {{manufacturers}} began using computer-controlled servo stepping motors. These motors {{are capable of}} slower rotating speeds approaching 0Hz. The <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> also allows operations that are not possible with an analog motor, {{such as the ability}} to synchronize the rotation of the two resonator sets and stop the rotation at a desired state (all open, all closed, all half open, etc.).|$|E

The Sudarshan kit incorporates laser guidance developed by ADE for 450kg (1000 pound) bombs to improve the accuracy of a conventional bomb. The guidance consists of a <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> group (CCG), canards attached {{to the front of}} the warhead for steering and a wing assembly attached to the rear end to provide lift.|$|E

25|$|Animatronics is a multi-disciplinary field which {{integrates}} anatomy, robots, mechatronics, and puppetry {{resulting in}} lifelike animation. Animatronic figures are often powered by pneumatics, hydraulics, and/or by electrical means, {{and can be}} implemented using both <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> and human control, including teleoperation. Motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions in limbs. Figures are covered with body shells and flexible skins made of hard and soft plastic materials and finished with details like colors, hair and feathers and other components to make the figure more life like.|$|E
25|$|From 1974 to 1981, NASA's Glenn Research Center (then the Lewis Research Center) in Brook Park, Ohio led the U.S. Wind Energy Program {{for large}} horizontal-axis wind turbines, {{designing}} {{a series of}} 13 experimental large horizontal-axis wind turbines. In conjunction with the United States Department of Energy, NASA developed and tested megawatt-class wind turbines. The program's goal was to develop the technology, and then {{turn it over to}} private industry. While none of the program's wind turbine designs saw mass commercialization, the tests generated valuable data and pioneered modern design concepts such as tubular towers and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> of blade pitch and rotor yaw.|$|E
25|$|The Liberator is recaptured by {{the people}} that built it. Orac's prophecy is {{fulfilled}} when it destroys an identical space vehicle. Blake wants to attack {{the heart of the}} Federation and he targets the main <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> facility on Earth. Avon agrees to help on condition that Blake gives him Liberator when the Federation has been destroyed. Blake, Avon, Vila and Gan reach the control facility and find an empty room. Travis reveals that the computer facility was secretly relocated years before and the old location was left as a decoy. Blake and his crew escape but Travis throws a grenade in the confined area and Gan is killed by falling rubble.|$|E

50|$|Data General Corp. v. Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls,</b> Inc. was a 1971 case {{in which}} the Delaware Court of Chancery {{determined}} that widespread, confidential disclosure of trade secrets does not necessarily compromise their secrecy. Data General Corporation distributed design documentation with its Nova 1200 minicomputer, notifying owners of the confidentiality of these design drawings through contractual agreements and explicit text on the drawings (essentially a shrinkwrap license). After acquiring drawings with a Nova 1200 purchase, Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> designed its own nearly identical minicomputer. Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> maintained that its use of the documentation was proper because Data General Corporation inadequately maintained the secrecy of the design drawings by distributing them to many customers. The court found that Data General Corporation had sufficiently protected the secrecy of the drawings and that Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> was thus in violation of trade secret law for improperly using confidential information.|$|R
25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by <b>computer</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1974, the Rivers Department and the Rivers Committee {{ceased to}} exist, when {{responsibility}} for the works passed from Manchester City Council to the newly formed North West Water Authority. The Authority built a new control room in 1981, which housed a <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> system for the site. Three years later, eight new sludge digesters were built, to enable all sludge dumped at sea to be digested first. Construction of the Mersey Valley Regional Sludge Pipeline began, linking Oldham to Davyhulme, and continuing to Sandon Dock in Liverpool. Davyhulme was able to treat sludge {{from a number of}} other sewage works to the east, and pump the digested product to Liverpool. Sludge boats ceased to use the ship canal, taking 15 minutes to transport sludge from Liverpool to a point {{to the north of the}} Bar Light in the Mersey, instead of over six hours required when using the canal.|$|E
25|$|The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or toss bombing, tactic {{was first}} made public {{in front of}} a crowd of 3,000 {{including}} 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B–47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target. The development of this system at Eglin dated to at least mid-1955 under Project Back Breaker. The unintended consequence of this tactic would be a series of crashes by B-47s in early 1958 caused by stress-induced cracks which caused the bombers to shed their wings. A fleet-wide inspection and repair program known as Milk Bottle was begun in May 1958 which led to no fewer than nine Technical Orders, with most aircraft cycled through the program by October 1958.|$|E
