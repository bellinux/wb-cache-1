40|$|Antitrust {{enforcement}} concerning monopolies, mergers, and cartels is converging {{across all}} market-oriented {{economies in the}} world. This convergence is based upon neoclassical economic analysis of industrial organization. The role of empirical economic analysis, however, has not converged as rapidly as the conceptual model because different countries have different enforcement institutions and strategies. This article explains how antitrust enforcement has evolved over time from public agencies to a market for enforcement that admits private parties. Private party law suits, and especially class action law suits on behalf of groups such as farmers and consumers, is a mechanism for redressing the often superior legal and economic resources that defendant corporations have and public agencies do not have. Enforcement {{and the role of}} empirical analysis are compared in the United States and other <b>countries.</b> Examples <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> from different <b>countries</b> illustrate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} different approaches.

40|$|Islands play a {{significant}} role in international irregular maritime migration. Frequently they are part of maritime interstitial spaces between states, and their location, combined with institutional membership, makes them part of international migration routes and subject to border management strategies. In this paper borders are analysed as social institutions used for regulating relative permeability through rules of entry and exit for persons, goods and capital. Borders institutionalize territoriality and are politically implemented by states. They are selective, also in migration, and irregular border transit is not always indicative of an inability to control. The Canary Islands are used as an illustrative example of how border management at the southern edge of the European Union has evolved towards more coercive deterrence and tighter surveillance. The Canary Islands experienced irregular maritime immigration from the west African coasts during the first decade of the 21 st century and most of these migrants intended to use the islands as transit space towards the European continent. Increasing surveillance in <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin, <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> border controls and stricter return policies were used to stop flows. The so-called “cayuco crisis” in 2006 induced institutional change in border management and forced the active involvement of the EU through FRONTEX...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} concerns how national institutions impact the implementation of occupational healthy and safety management systems (OHSMS) in different types of market economies. The main objective is to show how variation in national institutional frameworks influences the implementation of OHSMS, and thus, relative performance. There are two main conclusions. First, dominating organisational templates and co-operative industrial relations structures allow firms from coordinated market economies (CME) to more effectively implement OHSMS than those from liberal market economies (LME) which are embedded in adversarial industrial relations. Secondly, {{due to differences in}} the institutional framework among <b>countries,</b> the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> for OHSMS need to be designed in different ways. The article contributes to the literature by showing that the implementation and functioning of OHSMS are mediated by the different institutional logics in which firms are embedded...|$|R

This is probably because in many <b>countries</b> where <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> regulations is limited small firms do not comply, remaining invisible to regulators and inspectors. By contrast, larger firms are visible to the authorities and thus unable to avoid regulations. Moreover, firms that have upgraded their production process or their products {{are more likely to}} face severe constraints from strict employment protection legislation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} a <b>country's</b> first-time <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> insider trading laws and stock price informativeness using data from 48 countries over 1980 [...] 2003. <b>Enforcement</b> <b>of</b> insider trading laws improves price informativeness, as measured by firm-specific stock return variation, but this increase is concentrated in developed markets. In emerging market countries, price informativeness changes insignificantly after the enforcement, as the important contribution of insiders in impounding information into stock prices largely disappears. The enforcement does not achieve the goal of improving price informativeness in countries with poor legal institutions. It does turn some private information into public information, thereby reducing the cost of equity in emerging markets. The Author 2008.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{discussion}} has flourished among practitioners and academics regarding workers’ rights in developing <b>countries.</b> The lack <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> national labour {{laws and the}} limited protection of workers’ rights in developing countries have led workers’ rights representatives to attempt to establish transnational industrial relations systems to complement existing national systems. In practice, these attempts have mainly been operationalised in unilateral codes of conduct; recently, however, negotiated international framework agreements (IFAs) have been proposed as an alternative. Despite their growing importance, few studies have empirically studied IFAs. This paper starts to fill this gap by studying why corporations adopt IFAs, based on a qualitative study of the process leading to the signing of a recent IFA. The study’s findings complement existing research into why corporations adopt IFAs, codes of conduct, and CSR policies by demonstrating that corporate motives {{can be linked to}} a desire to retain a trusting relationship with the labour union movement. In addition, the findings indicate that the discrete campaign model of stakeholder pressure dominant in previous research should be complemented by a continuous bargaining model of stakeholder pressure. The paper concludes by discussing differences between these conceptual models of stakeholder pressure and avenues for future research...|$|R

With respect to these non-contracting countries, the former state of the law is still in force. A general presentation of the subject will require, therefore, a discussion of foreign awards apart from the Geneva Convention, and under the provisions of the Convention. No attempt will be made to deal with the bilateral treaties that have been entered into, and the discussion will be limited to a few European and Latin-American countries whose law is of special interest. Before proceeding to the consideration of foreign awards a few words will be necessary with respect to the validity and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> local awards...|$|R

Countries continue to vary in their approaches - some permit and regulate, and others prohibit online gambling, and even countries that permit and regulate online gambling approach the issue differently. Countries cannot enforce their own online gambling regulations without assistance from other countries - specifically, the countries where online gambling operators have their operations and/or their assets. Under the proposed Convention, national online gambling regulators would cooperate in the exchange of necessary information, in the licensing and standardization of technological requirements for online gambling operators, and, most importantly, in assisting with the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>country</b> regulations by imposing geolocation and filtering requirements on online gambling operators. The chapter discusses the challenges that the proposal faces and suggests that the challenges can be overcome. Recent events in the online gambling world, such as 2 ̆ 7 Black Friday, 2 ̆ 7 demonstrate a pressing need for effective international cooperation among Internet gambling regulators, and the proposed Convention, by providing {{a solution to the}} vexing problem <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> online gambling regulation on the Internet, can provide the impetus for national discussions on online gambling...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the chapters on public <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> law and on criminal law from a general, forthcoming book, Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law (Harvard University Press, 2003). By public {{law enforcement is}} meant the use <b>of</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> agents [...] such as police, tax inspectors, regulatory personnel [...] to enforce legal rules. A number of important dimensions <b>of</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> may be distinguished. One is {{the choice of the}} basic rule of liability: whether liability is strict or fault-based, and whether liability is imposed only if harm is done or may be imposed on the basis of acts alone (independently of the occurrence of harm). A second dimension <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the type of sanction, whether monetary or nonmonetary, notably, imprisonment. A third aspect <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the magnitude of sanctions. And a fourth dimension <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the degree <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> effort, which determines the probability of imposition of sanctions. These dimensions <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> are discussed in the chapters that follow. In chapter 20, the basic theory <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> employing monetary sanctions is discussed; in chapter 21, the basic theory <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> using nonmonetary sanctions is examined; and in chapter 22, extensions to the basic theory are considered. Then, in chapter 23, functions of sanctions apart from deterrence, namely, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and retribution, are discussed. Finally, in chapter 24, the subject of criminal law is addressed against the background of the theory <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> law. ...|$|R
