Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E

Jewell fell under suspicion of participating in the bombing {{a few days after}} the incident, after having been initially hailed as a hero for being the first one to spot Rudolph's explosive device and helping to clear the area. When he came under FBI suspicion for involvement in the crime, Jewell became the prime suspect and an international news story.|$|E

50|$|The {{opening of}} the 1976 games was held at Woodbine Race Track in north Etobicoke. There was no athletes' village, so {{competitors}} were housed at York University (Keele campus), University of Toronto (St. George Campus), and the CNIB (national headquarters in Toronto). Israeli athletes were housed at an undisclosed hotel due to security concerns. Closing ceremonies and outdoor events (mainly track and field) took place at Centennial Park Stadium. Centennial Gymnasium and <b>Centennial</b> Park's <b>Olympic</b> Pool (Etobicoke Olympium) were the other venues (for indoor and swimming events respectively).|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Halley's Bluff (and {{the site of}} the fort) became the {{possession}} of a Mormon group that eventually separated from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot). This group, known as the Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff, controlled the property as a compound from 1945 until 1979. Since a dispute over control of the church in the 1970s, the compound has been the property of the Church of Israel, a Christian Identity group. In the 1980s, the church compound was home to Eric Robert Rudolph, who committed the <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Park bombing in 1996.|$|E

50|$|The {{area is the}} world's largest {{toll-free}} calling zone spanning 7162 sq mi, {{has four}} active telephone area codes, and local calling extending into portions of two others. 404, which originally covered all of northern Georgia until 1992, now covers mostly the area inside the Perimeter (Interstate 285). In 1995 the suburbs were put into 770, requiring mandatory ten‑digit dialing even for local calls under FCC rules. This made Atlanta one of the US's first cities to employ ten-digit dialing, which was begun by BellSouth {{the year before the}} <b>Centennial</b> 1996 <b>Olympic</b> Games. In 1998, 678 was overlaid onto both of the existing 404 and 770 area codes. Mobile phones, originally only assigned to 404, may now have any local area code regardless of where in the region they were issued. Area code 470, the newest area code, was overlaid with 404 and 770 in the same fashion as 678. The local calling area also includes portions of 706/762 and a small area of 256 in Alabama on the Georgia border.|$|R

25|$|In November 1987, Dr. Crecine, {{acting on}} behalf of Georgia Tech, volunteered to help Atlanta become the host city for the 1996 <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Games and was {{an active member of the}} Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games before and after Atlanta was chosen as host for the Centennial Games (from 1988 to 1996). Dr. Crecine {{conceived}} of and arranged funding for the development of a computerized, virtual reality model of the competition, living, and support facilities to be constructed in support of the Centennial Games as part of Atlanta’s bid package. Georgia Tech was the Olympic Village during the Centennial Games. As a result, both on-campus housing and student athletic and recreational facilities more than doubled. Georgia Tech hosted the boxing, swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, and water polo competitions.|$|E

In Atlanta, at the <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Games, although Egerszegi advanced into the final with the best time on 400 individual medley, she finished in third. This was her first and only bronze medal during her Olympic career. She competed in the 4×100 m medley relay as member of the Hungarian team, who finished in 11th. Interestingly, her time in this event at the qualification round, would have won the 100 m backstroke event. Her final career appearance {{was one of the}} finest farewell of all-time in swimming sport: she won her beloved 200 m backstroke event with the greatest margin in any short distance events of the swimming sport, collecting her fifth individual gold medals and defending her titles for three consecutive Olympic Games.|$|E

50|$|Spirits {{then rose}} from the {{northwest}} corner of the stadium in response to the President's invitation. Each of them representing the Olympic colors of Red (Americas), Green (Oceania), Black (Africa) Yellow (Asia), and Blue (Europe) rose to the beat of their own percussion. They summoned tribes out to the stadium floor with their own color and the percussion began to mix. Meanwhile, US Army Paratroopers rappelled down from the stadium roof trailing long colorful papers representing the colors while the tribes formed the Rings of the Olympic Flag and the Children of Atlanta, dressed in white, formed the number 100 representing the <b>Centennial</b> of the <b>Olympic</b> Games.|$|R
50|$|The {{province}} of Ilocos Norte saw Fariñas as a committed and energetic governor who closely monitored {{the functions of}} the provincial government and actively participated in rescue operations when calamities battered the province. With his program “Rang-ay ti Barangay”, he brought the government closer to the people by personally delivering the government’s programs and services to remotest areas of the province. Governor Fariñas made a headway in the areas of education, health, agriculture, sports, tourism and peace and order by directing to create the Department of Public Safety which responded to medical emergencies, erect a new hospital building at the Gov. Roque Ablan Hospital, construct the <b>Centennial</b> Arena and <b>Olympic</b> size swimming pool, establish the Capitol Day care Center, restore the Rizal Amusement Park and implement infrastructure projects {{in various parts of the}} province. Through his leadership, the insurgency problem of the province was reduced dramatically thus restoring peace and security in the province.|$|R
25|$|By {{then the}} process of {{choosing}} a location for the Games had itself become a commercial concern; allegations of corruption rocked the International Olympic Committee. In the Atlanta games in 1996, the highlight was 200 meters runner Michael Johnson annihilating the world record {{in front of a}} home crowd. Canadians savored Donovan Bailey's recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when Muhammad Ali, clearly affected by Parkinson's disease, lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place not at the boxing ring but in the basketball arena, at the demand of US television. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a bomb exploded during the celebration in <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, Eric Robert Rudolph, was arrested.|$|E
25|$|After the 1996 Olympics were {{complete}} the stadium was leased by the Atlanta Braves. Private entities, including NBC and other Olympic sponsors, {{agreed to pay}} a large sum of the cost to build <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Stadium (approximately $170 million of the $209 million bill). The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) sought to build the stadium {{in a way that}} it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion. This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic Committee and the Braves. The 71,228 seat Georgia Dome had been completed four years earlier by the state of Georgia, so there was no need for another large stadium in downtown Atlanta. Furthermore, the Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new stadium. The Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority owns Turner Field and leased it to the Braves, who operated the stadium. The end of the Braves' most recent lease in 2016 coincided with the team's departure for SunTrust Park.|$|E
25|$|Between 1993 and 1996, the FBI {{increased}} its counter-terrorism {{role in the}} wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, New York; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996. Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. But Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Park bombing. It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing.|$|E
50|$|His columns {{varied between}} introspective, sentimental pieces to quirky and controversial, where he covered {{everything}} from international events, like {{the funeral of}} Princess Diana to the local Ottawa scene. Writing a daily interest column allowed McRae to branch outside the sports world, an opportunity he loved, and cover anything that sparked an interest in him. He continued to do telling sports profile pieces, such as ones on NHL goaltenders Tom Barrasso and Ray Emery but also focused on local issues; investigative pieces, heart-warming stories, revealing columns on political scandals and articles petitioning for a change, McRae's columns had as much sway with the public as any politician's agenda; in 1996 he was accused by then CFL commissioner Larry Smith of being partially responsible for the folding of the Ottawa Rough Riders due to several critical columns he wrote on the franchise's shaky ownership. It was McRae's columns on Canadian businessman and Ottawa philanthropist Howard Darwin, urging the City of Ottawa to honour the late Darwin with a permanent memorial, that spearheaded the process of renaming Merivale Arena to Howard Darwin <b>Centennial</b> Arena. Canadian <b>Olympic</b> figure skater Barbara Ann Scott was indebted to a column by McRae for having her memorabilia displayed at Ottawa's city hall as well. Notably, he predicted in a 2008 column that Barack Obama would be assassinated by right wing groups while campaigning for the presidency.|$|R
500|$|Terrorism {{affected}} {{the last two}} Olympic Games held in the United States. During the Summer Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta, Georgia, a bomb was detonated at the <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Park, which killed two and injured 111 others. The bomb was set by Eric Rudolph, an American domestic terrorist, who is currently {{serving a life sentence}} for the bombing. The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, took place just five months after the September 11 attacks, which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols of the day's events. They included the flag that flew at Ground Zero, NYPD officer Daniel Rodríguez singing [...] "God Bless America", and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY members. The events of that day have made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern for Olympic planners.|$|E

On 9 December 1980, the day after Lennon's murder, Queen performed [...] "Imagine" [...] as a tribute to him during their Wembley Arena show in London. On 9 October 1990, more than one billion people listened to a broadcast of the song on what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday. Ratau Mike Makhalemele covered the song on an EP of Lennon covers in 1990. In 1991–92, Liza Minnelli {{performed the}} song in her show at Radio City Music Hall. Stevie Wonder gave his rendition of the song, with the Morehouse College Glee Club, during the closing ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics as a tribute to the victims of the <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Park bombing. In 2001, Neil Young performed it during the benefit concert [...] Madonna performed [...] "Imagine" [...] during the benefit Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope. Peter Gabriel performed the song during the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Crecine was {{instrumental}} in securing the 1996 Summer Olympics for Atlanta. In September 1989 he imagined a grand multimedia presentation for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The resulting 3-D presentation, developed by the institute's Multimedia Laboratory, provided a [...] "1996" [...] view of Atlanta, complete with digitized graphic models of non-existent facilities overlaid on their proposed sites. More than 40 Georgia Tech computer scientists were recruited to assemble the virtual reality, three-dimensional tour through Olympic venues {{that had not yet}} even been designed. The term [...] "virtual reality" [...] was almost unknown in 1989 when Tech's seven-foot tall, three-screen, 3-D interactive video and laser disc projection system debuted during a meeting of the IOC at San Juan, Puerto Rico. Members of the committee used a trackball and a touch screen to view a dazzling montage of animation, computer graphics, aerial photography, video, and satellite topographical photographs created to depict Atlanta during the <b>Centennial</b> <b>Olympic</b> Games. Many believe the presentation showed the IOC that Atlanta was a major player in its Olympics bid and served to create the foundation for the city's high-tech theme for the Centennial Games.|$|E
