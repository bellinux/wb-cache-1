25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers <b>cloxotestosterone,</b> quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cloxotestosterone</b> (INN), {{also known}} as 17β-chloral {{hemiacetal}} testosterone, is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ether - specifically, the 17β-chloro hemiacetal ether of testosterone - which was never marketed. The O-acetate ester of <b>cloxotestosterone,</b> <b>cloxotestosterone</b> acetate (brand name Caprosem), in contrast to <b>cloxotestosterone,</b> has been marketed.|$|E

50|$|Testosterone esters are {{substituted}} at the C17β {{position with}} a lipophilic fatty acid ester moiety of varying chain length. Major testosterone esters include testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone propionate, and testosterone undecanoate. A C17β ether prodrug of testosterone, <b>cloxotestosterone</b> acetate, {{has also been}} marketed, although it is little known and is used very rarely or no longer. Another C17β ether prodrug of testosterone, silandrone, also exists but was never marketed, and is notable {{in that it is}} orally active. In addition to ester and ether prodrugs, androgen prohormones or precursors of testosterone, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, and androstenedione, exist as well, and convert into testosterone to variable extents upon oral ingestion. Unlike testosterone ester and ether prodrugs however, these prohormones are only weakly androgenic/anabolic.|$|E
