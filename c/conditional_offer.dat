Also applying to Durham, Warwick and London School of Economics, Yousafzai was interviewed at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in December 2016 {{and received a}} <b>conditional</b> <b>offer</b> of three As in her A Levels; in August 2017, she was accepted to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} began {{negotiations with the}} Allies about the terms of surrender on 10August. During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315thBombardment Wing against an oil target {{on the night of}} 9/10August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10August. The next day, President Truman ordered a halt to the bombing due to the possibility that it would be interpreted as a sign that the peace negotiations had failed. On 11August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure. On 13August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's <b>conditional</b> <b>offer</b> to surrender over Japanese cities. Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of Kumagaya and Isesaki were firebombed. While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as {{he did not want to}} risk the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over. These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15August Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender.|$|E

Saruman himself is not {{directly}} involved, and only appears again in chapter 10, [...] "The Voice of Saruman", by which time he is trapped in Orthanc. He fails {{in his attempt to}} negotiate with the Rohirrim and with Gandalf, and rejects Gandalf's <b>conditional</b> <b>offer</b> to let him go free. Gandalf casts him out of the White Council and the order of the wizards, and breaks Saruman's staff.|$|E
40|$|The {{constitutionality}} of <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> {{from the government}} is a transsubstantive issue with broad and growing practical implications, but {{it has always been}} a particular problem for free speech. Recent developments suggest at least three new approaches to the problem, but no easy solutions to it. The first approach would permit conditions that define the limits of the government spending program, while forbidding conditions that leverage funding so as to regulate speech outside the contours of the program. This is an appealing distinction, but runs into some of the same challenges as public forum analysis. The second approach would treat <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> to purchase speech like other proposed economic transactions, invalidating them when they are coercive. This principle helps explain many recent cases, including the healthcare decision. And yet the Court’s willingness to find coercion in cases involving <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> from the government is hard to square with its approach to campaign finance law and its apparent faith in markets more generally. The third and final approach would treat limits on <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> not as individual rights, but as structural limitations on the scope of government. This approach, too, points in the direction of possible solutions—and also further problems—for analyzing the {{constitutionality of}} subsidized speech...|$|R

40|$|In a {{well known}} British case, the {{relatives}} of a dead man consented {{to the use of}} his organs for transplant on the condition that they were transplanted only into white people. The British government condemned the acceptance of racist offers and the panel they set up to report on the case condemned all <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> of donation. The panel appealed to a principle of altruism and meeting the greatest need. This paper criticises their reasoning. The panel's argument does not show that conditional donation is always wrong and anyway overlooks a crucial distinction between making an offer and accepting it. But even the most charitable reinterpretation of the panel's argument does not reject selective acceptance of <b>conditional</b> <b>offers.</b> The panel's reasoning has no merit...|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} {{of the system is}} that candidates will apply to University in S6 on the basis of determined Higher results.

50|$|For {{each course}} applied for, the {{applicant}} receives {{a response from}} the institution: rejection, <b>conditional</b> <b>offer</b> or unconditional offer.

If no offers are received following the initial application, or the applicant {{does not wish to}} take up any of their offers, UCAS+ can be used. Applicants can then apply to one course at a time {{in order to try to}} find a suitable offer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> made by {{universities}} to candidates resident in England and Wales and taking A levels are analysed. The {{analysis was conducted}} at Lancaster University {{as part of a}} larger research project funded by the Training Agency during 1988 - 89, whose main aims were to map the pattern of admissions policies and practices and to examine the rationales, constraints and incentives affecting them. Our aim was to discover for each subject whether or to what extent the level of <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> made was related to the gender, age, social class, or school/college of the applicant, to the choice position (1 - 5) in which the university was placed, or to differences between universities. Four subjects were examined (electrical engineering, English, mathematics and sociology), and substantial differences in conditions were found which could be associated with some or all of the above factors. For all four subjects, variations between universities in the magnitude and direction of these effects were also found. We discuss the possible reasons for these variations, and also the limitations of this study...|$|R

50|$|As of 2015 entry, <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> {{for entry}} include grades A*AA at A-level, to {{include at least}} Chemistry and Biology, and an {{additional}} pass at AS-level, {{this has been a}} significant change as previously the university was willing to accept A-Level grades of AAA. The International Baccalaureate (Full Diploma), although less common, is also an acceptable entry qualification. The course is also open to graduates with a minimum of a 2:1 required. Additionally, applicants must sit an entrance exam, the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT) which is used alongside the rest of the UCAS application to determine selection for interview.|$|R

The announcement was followed in May by two <b>conditional</b> <b>offers</b> from WPP to buy TNS for a combination of cash and shares, both of which were rejected by TNS’s board.
