The pattern of the trade was to spend the winter purchasing and packaging trade goods. April through August was spent picking up furs on the Siberian coast.

50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>foxes</b> are {{relatively}} {{common in the}} northern areas of North America, and comprise up to 30% of Canada's red <b>fox</b> population. <b>Cross</b> <b>foxes</b> were once abundant in Idaho and Utah before being largely killed off.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>foxes</b> are {{occasionally}} {{reported in}} Scandinavia, having {{been described by}} Conrad Gessner and Olaus Magnus.

50|$|Originally {{starting}} at the <b>Cross</b> <b>Foxes</b> near Dolgellau the A458 now runs only from Mallwyd to Shrewsbury. It now starts at Mallwyd with the Mallwyd to <b>Cross</b> <b>Foxes</b> section being the A470. <b>Cross</b> <b>Foxes</b> to near Gellilydan (in the Meirionydd part of Gwynedd south of Ffestiniog) brings us to a complicated series of route renumbering. This stretch was originally the A487 which ran through Dolgellau town centre. The modern A470 bypasses the town using {{the line of the}} old Ruabon - Morfa Mawddach railway. The A487 number applies to two sections of the Fishguard - Bangor trunk road with the A470 between Dolgellau and Gellilydan.|$|R

He will be all black, with perhaps {{just the tip of}} his tail white. Or his fur will be all black just tipped with white. Then he is called a Black Fox or Silver Fox. He is still a Red Fox, yet there is nothing red about him. Sometimes the fur is only partly marked with black and then he is called a <b>Cross</b> <b>Fox.</b> A great many people have {{supposed}} that the Black or Silver Fox and the <b>Cross</b> <b>Fox</b> were distinct kinds. They are not. They are simply Red Foxes with different coats. The fur of the Silver Fox is considered by man {{to be one of the}} choicest of all furs and tremendous prices are paid for it. This means, of course, that a young Fox whose coat is black will need to be very smart indeed if he would live to old age, for once he has been seen by man he will be hunted unceasingly." ...|$|E
60|$|The most {{valuable}} of the furs {{mentioned in the}} above list {{is that of the}} black fox. This beautiful animal resembles in shape the common fox of England, but it is much larger, and jet-black, {{with the exception of one}} or two white hairs along the back-bone and a pure white tuft on the end of the tail. A single skin sometimes brings from twenty-five to thirty guineas in the British market; but, unfortunately, they are very scarce. The silver fox differs from the black fox only in the number of white hairs with which its fur is sprinkled; and the more numerous the white hairs, the less valuable does it become. The <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> is a cross between the black or silver and the red fox. The red fox bears a much inferior fur to the other kinds; yet it is a good article of trade, as this species is very numerous. These four kinds of foxes are sometimes produced in the same litter, the mother being a red fox. The white fox is of less value than the red, and is also very numerous, particularly on the shores of Hudson Bay. The variety termed the blue fox is neither numerous nor valuable. It is of a dirty bluish-grey colour, and seldom makes its appearance at the Company's posts.|$|E
50|$|Although cross foxes were {{historically}} hunted {{and bred}} for their fur, {{they were not}} considered as valuable as silver foxes. They were however considered prestigious enough {{to be used to}} adorn the leaders of certain religious communities. In the late 19th century, 4,500 <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> pelts were exported by the Hudson's Bay Company annually, while 3,500 <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> skins were annually disposed of at auction by the London fur companies.|$|E

50|$|The {{value of}} a <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> pelt {{depended}} largely on {{the darkness of the}} coat, with pale coats commanding cheaper prices than darker ones.

5000|$|The <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> is a {{partially}} melanistic colour {{variant of the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) which has a long dark stripe running down its back, intersecting another stripe to form a cross over the shoulders.

5000|$|At {{one time}} the <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> was {{considered}} to be a separate species from the red fox, and was given the binomial name Canis decassatus (the fox genus Vulpes was then commonly included in the dog genus Canis).

50|$|When bred {{with another}} member of the same color morph, silver foxes will produce silver coated offspring, with little {{variation}} in this trend after the third generation. When mated to pure red foxes, the resulting cubs will be fiery red in overall coat color, and will have blacker markings on the belly, neck and points than average red foxes. When one such fiery red fox is mated with a silver one, the litter is almost always 50% silver and 50% red. Fiery red parents may occasionally produce a silver cub, the usual proportion being one in four. Occasionally, the colors of mixed foxes blend rather than segregate. The blended offspring of a silver and red fox is known as a <b>cross</b> <b>fox.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{physical}} conformation, cross foxes {{are identical}} to red foxes, though according to Teancum's Mammals of Utah (1922), {{they may be}} slightly larger with a bushier tail and with more wool under the feet. The <b>cross</b> <b>fox</b> derives {{its name from the}} vertical dark band running down the back, which is intersected with another horizontal band across the shoulders. The back and sides are yellowish rufous, which is more vivid on the flanks and the sides of the neck. Excepting the muzzle, {{the upper part of the}} head, the hind quarters and the outsides of the shoulders and thighs have dusky brown underfur and black outerfur. The flanks and sides of the neck are reddish yellow, while the muzzle, ears and underparts of the leg are black. The long hairs of the tail are greyish or yellowish red with black tips, though the tip of the tail is always white. They are distinguished from [...] "bastard" [...] foxes (which are usually the result of a red/silver fox mating) by the dorsal stripe which is black rather than dark red.|$|E
