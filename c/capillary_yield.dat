40|$|AbstractIn vivo {{confocal}} Raman spectroscopy is a noninvasive optical {{method to}} obtain {{detailed information about}} the molecular composition of the skin with high spatial resolution. In vivo confocal scanning laser microscopy is an imaging modality that provides optical sections of the skin without physically dissecting the tissue. A combination of both techniques in a single instrument is described. This combination allows the skin morphology to be visualized and (subsurface) structures in the skin to be targeted for Raman measurements. Novel results are presented that show detailed in vivo concentration profiles of water and of natural moisturizing factor for the stratum corneum that {{are directly related to}} the skin architecture by in vivo cross-sectional images of the skin. Targeting of skin structures is demonstrated by recording in vivo Raman spectra of sweat ducts and sebaceous glands in situ.

Previous observations have highlighted the importance of sub-core-scale capillary heterogeneity in developing local saturations during drainage; we show {{in this study that}} {{the same is true for}} the imbibition process. Spatially distributed drainage and imbibition scanning curves were obtained for mm-scale subsets of the rock sample non-invasively using X-ray CT imagery. Core- and sub-core scale measurements are well described using the Brooks-Corey formalism, which uses a linear trapping model to compute mobile saturations during imbibition. <b>Capillary</b> scaling <b>yields</b> two separate universal drainage and imbibition curves that are representative of the full sub-core scale data set. This enables accurate parameterisation of rock properties at the sub-core scale in terms of capillary scaling factors and permeability, which in turn serve as effective indicators of heterogeneity at the same scale even when hysteresis is a factor.

There are currently two major processes by which circuit boards are imaged; dry film and screen printing. This study investigated the screen printed circuit board. The resolution and registration limits are primary concerns of the screen circuit printer. These two factors are greatly influenced by two screen components; fabric and stencil system. The effects that two fabrics and two stencil systems had on the resolution and registration capabilities of a screen circuit printing system were determined. A test target was printed on a circuit substrate by a screen printing press under production conditions. Data on registration variation and line resolution was collected and analyzed statistically to determine if fabric, stencil or an interaction of both had a significant effect. A strong interaction effect of fabric and stencil upon resolution was found to occur when stainless steel mesh was used with the two stencil systems. Stainless steel combined with indirect stencil yielded the best resolution, while steel with <b>capillary</b> direct stencil <b>yielded</b> the worst resolution. A combination of polyester monofilament fabric and either indirect or <b>capillary</b> direct stencil <b>yielded</b> resolution between the two values found with the steel fabric. Registration variability was found to be significantly affected by the factor FABRIC. Steel mesh produced less registration variability than polyester mesh. However, this registration variability of fabrics seems to be significantly related to the condition of the fabric – new or used. Conclusions of the study were that for best resolution and least registration variability, stainless steel fabric combined with indirect stencils should be used. The second choice would be dyed monofilament polyester combined with either indirect or capillary direct stencil systems. The combination of stainless steel and capillary direct stencil should be avoided. It should be noted that run length is a major consideration when choosing fabric/stencil combinations for circuit imaging. Further investigations of registration variability in stainless steel and polyester monofilament fabrics over numerous runs would also yield valuable information for the screen circuit printer...|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineered}} barriers {{are expected to}} function {{for hundreds of years}} or longer. Over the course of time, it is likely that some barriers will experience infiltration to the point of breakthrough. This study compares the recovery from breakthrough of two storage- evapotranspiration type {{engineered barriers}}. Replicates of test plots comprising thick soil and capillary/biobarrier covers were wetted to breakthrough in 1997. Test plots were kept cleared of vegetation to maximize hydrologic stress during recovery. Following cessation of drainage resulting from the wetting irrigations, water storage levels in all plots were at elevated levels compared to pre-irrigation levels. As a result, infiltration of melting snow during the subsequent spring overloaded the storage capacity and produced drainage in all plots. Relatively rapid melting of accumulated snowfall produced the most significant infiltration events each year during the study. <b>Capillary</b> barriers <b>yielded</b> less total drainage than thick soil barriers. By limiting drainage, capillary barriers increased water storage in the upper portions of the test plots, which led to increased evaporation from the capillary barrier plots compared to thick soil plots. Increased evaporation in the capillary barrier plots allowed more water to infiltrate in the second season following the wetting tests without triggering drainage. All thick soil plots again yielded drainage in the second season. Within two years of intentionally induced breakthrough, evaporation alone (without transpiration) restored the capability of the capillary barrier covers to function as intended, although water storage in these covers remained at elevated levels...|$|R

Initial studies of S 100 B in pediatric head injury have shown promising results. Venous sampling can be challenging in children and capillary samples are often a preferred option. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the relation between capillary, venous and arterial measurements of protein S 100 B, primarily by determining whether capillary S 100 B differ from venous and if capillary S 100 B can predict venous S 100 B levels, and secondarily, if arterial S 100 B samples can substitute venous samples in severely brain-injured patients. Methods: Venous, arterial and capillary blood samples for S 100 B were collected simultaneously once a day for a maximum of 6 days. Patients were >= 18 years old and admitted to neurointensive care due to severe brain pathology. Results: Capillary S 100 B samples were on average 0. 08 mu g/L higher than venous S 100 B samples.

Hence a quick diagnosis of a lump in the breast is essential. Fine needle aspiration cytology is an ideal initial diagnostic modality in breast lumps. There is an alternative method of performing needle aspiration, known as fine needle capillary cytology where the specimen is obtained using just a needle without aspiration. Materials and Methods: This hospital-based cross sectional analytical study was carried out in Department of Pathology in National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital for one year. The objective of this study was to compare aspiration and non-aspiration cytology of palpable breast lumps and correlation with histopathology. Results: The five criteria scored for each technique were background blood, amount of cellular material, cellular degeneration, cellular trauma and architectural preservation. Compared to fine needle aspiration cytology, fine needle <b>capillary</b> cytology <b>yields</b> less bloody smears with minimal degenerative changes and offers more diagnostically superior specimens. Fine needle aspiration cytology, on the other hand, gives a good yield of diagnostic material. Conclusion: Fine needle aspiration cytology and fine needle capillary cytology are quick, easy, safe and cost-effective techniques.. A high sensitivity and specificity of cytological diagnosis in this study proves that it is comparable to final histology report in its diagnostic efficiency. Thus, fine needle aspiration cytology is a very important preliminary diagnostic test in palpable breast lumps and the results show a high degree of correlation with the final histopathology report.

Here we report a diode-end-pumped single-frequency Nd:YAG laser using a novel fiber-based pump beam conditioning element to achieve lasing on the lowest order donut (LG 01) mode. The pump conditioning element was fabricated from a capillary (hollow-core) silica fiber with a 200 µm outer diameter and a 105 µm diameter inner air hole. The fiber was tapered and spliced to a fiber-coupled laser diode with a maximum output power of 4 W at 808 nm. The <b>capillary</b> fiber <b>yielded</b> ~ 3. 5 W of output in a beam with a ring-shaped near-field profile.

Core samples taken through the unsaturated zone allow for the acquisition of gravimetrically determined water content data {{as a function of}} elevation at 3  inch intervals. This dense spacing of data provides several measurements of the water content within the capillary fringe, which are utilized to determine capillary pressure function parameters via least-squares calibration. The water content data collected above the capil-lary fringe are used to calculate dimensionless flow as a function of elevation providing a snapshot characterization of flow through the unsaturated zone. The water content at a flow stagnation point provides an in situ estimate of specific yield. In situ determinations of capillary pressure function parameters utilizing this method, together with particle-size distributions, can provide a valuable supplement to data libraries of unsaturated zone hydraulic parameters.

It was found that for blends with low Vectra contents, i. e., small Vectra particles, or below a minimum strain rate, no fibril formation takes place. These phenomena could be explained by the balance between interfacial tension and shear stress in the flow field. The critical conditions for fibril formation, estimated from these experiments, are comparable to the literature data. Furthermore, the elongational viscosity of the blends was calculated from the pressure gradient over the capillary. The elongational viscosity was found to decrease with Vectra content, to observe power-law behavior, and to be three orders of magnitude larger than the shear viscosity of the blends.

Methods to improve corrosion resistance of materials are described herein which utilize the reversibility of the Diels-Alder reaction to impart thermal responsiveness upon materials. Such stimuli responsiveness can potentially {{play a role in}} self healing properties which lead to reduced cracking and thus increased corrosion protection. Reversible Diels-Alder chemistry was utilized to manipulate the surface energy of glass substrates. Hydrophobic dieneophiles were prepared and attached to glass slides and <b>capillaries</b> to <b>yield</b> a nonwetting surface. Thermal treatment of the surfaces cleaved the Diels-Alder linkage, and resulted in the fabrication of a hydrophilic surface. Preliminary analysis utilized contact angle (CA) measurements to monitor the change in surface energy, and observed a hydrophilic state (CA - 70 ± 3 °) before attachment of the dieneophile to a hydrophobic state (CA - 101 ± 9 °) followed by regeneration of the hydrophilic state (CA - 70 ± 6 °) upon cleavage of the Diels-Alder linkage. The treatments were then applied to glass capillaries, with effective treatment confirmed by fluid column measurements. Patterned treatments were also demonstrated to provide effective fluid flow gating. Reversible Diels-Alder linkages were incorporated into polymer thermoset binding resins in order to provide a means by which a crosslinked thermoset could undergo stimuli responsive reversible crosslinking.

40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of liquid}} drops over solid substrates with a liquid {{source in the}} centre of the drop is considered from both theoretical and experimental points of view. For conditions of complete wetting the spreading is an overlapping of two processes: a spontaneous spreading and a forced flow caused by the liquid source in the centre. Both capillary and gravitational regimes of spreading are considered and power laws are deduced. In both cases of small and large droplets the exponent is a sum of two terms: the first term corresponds to the spontaneous spreading and the second term is determined by the intensity of the liquid source. In the case of a constant flow rate from the source the latter gives for the radius of spreading the following law R(t) ∼ t 0. 4 {{in the case of the}} capillary spreading and R(t) ∼ t 0. 5 in the case of gravitational spreading.

40|$|The present review {{presents}} {{basic concepts}} of blood rheology related to vascular diseases. Blood flow in large arteries {{is dominated by}} inertial forces exhibited at high flow velocities, while viscous forces (i. e., blood rheology) play an almost negligible role. When high flow velocity is compromised by sudden deceleration as at a bifurcation, endothelial cell dysfunction can occur along the outer wall of the bifurcation, initiating inflammatory gene expression and, through mechanotransduction, the cascade of events associated with atherosclerosis. In sharp contrast, {{the flow of blood}} in microvessels is dominated by viscous shear forces since the inertial forces are negligible due to low flow velocities. Shear stress is a critical parameter in microvascular flow, and a force-balance approach is proposed for determining microvascular shear stress, accounting for the low Reynolds numbers and the dominance of viscous forces over inertial forces. Accordingly, when the attractive forces between erythrocytes (represented by the yield stress of blood) are greater than the shear force produced by microvascular flow, tissue perfusion itself cannot be sustained, leading to <b>capillary</b> loss. The <b>yield</b> stress parameter is presented as a diagnostic candidate for future clinical research, specifically, as a fluid dynamic biomarker for microvascular disorders.

40|$|Coating {{shrinkage}} upon drying is {{a phenomenon}} well known to the paper coating industry, where it often causes changes in the final structure of the coating layer leading to poor results in terms of gloss, light scattering, surface strength, coverage, uniformity and printability. Such shrinkage has in previous studies been wrongly associated with shrinkage of the polymeric binders used in the coating formulation, by making erroneous comparison with solvent-based paint systems. Natural binders, as starch or proteins, which come from renewable resources and are therefore environmentally friendly, suffer more from this shrinkage phenomenon than synthetic binders. The aim of this research project was to improve {{the understanding of the}} processes involved in the drying of a coating layer and to create a model able to describe them. Shrinkage while the coating layer dries has been successfully measured by observing the deflection of coated strips of a synthetic elastically-deformable substrate. Ground calcium carbonate was used as the coating pigment, together with latex binders of both low and high glass transition temperature, Tg, respectively, and also with starch which is a natural film-forming water soluble binder. The final dry coatings were studied with mercury porosimetry and by scanning electron microscopy in order to characterise their porous structure. The flow and rheological properties of the coating colour formulations were measured in order to probe the particle-particle interaction between the different species in the wet coating colour. The void space of the dry coating layers was modelled using Pore-Cor, a software which generates simulated porous networks. A new algorithm was developed to model, within the simulated void space, the effective particles or "skeletal elements" representative of the solid phase of the dried porous system. The water-filled porous structures {{at the beginning of the}} shrinkage process (first critical concentration, FCC) were subsequently modelled by creating Pore-Cor structures with the same solid skeletal elements distribution as at the second critical concentration (at which the particles lock their positions), but with higher given porosity to account for the water present The capillary forces acting on the surface of the simulated coating were calculated, and found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the measured shrinkage forces. The shrinkage process was thus described as resulting from the effect of capillary forces in the plane of the coating layer resisted by a stick-slip process, where the <b>capillary</b> forces <b>yield</b> shrinkage only if a resistance force within the drying coating layer holds the structure in place and allows the menisci to form.

40|$|Cough is a {{very common}} symptom in the community, and lower {{respiratory}} tract infections (LRTIs) occur very frequently in all seasons. The primary goal in the diagnostic work-up of LRTI is to differentiate serious conditions like community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from self-limiting conditions and to prevent unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics. To improve diagnostic accuracy additional diagnostic testing is potentially useful. A promising additional test is C-reactive protein (CRP). A point-of-care (POC) test in <b>capillary</b> blood <b>yields</b> CRP results within a few minutes, and can thus be applied in decision making (whether or not to prescribe antibiotics) during consultation. POC CRP testing was introduced in Dutch primary care after incorporation in the guideline LRTI of the Dutch College of General Practice in 2011. So far, {{little is known about}} the compliance of GPs with these guidelines and the impact of POC CRP introduction on prescription of antibiotics for LRTI. This thesis aimed to evaluate optimal use of the point-of-care (POC) C-reactive protein (CRP) in primary care and its impact in day-to-day practice. More specifically our aims were to determine: [1] the (added) diagnostic value of CRP in the diagnostic work-up of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in primary care, [2] the suitability of POC CRP test devices for primary care and [3] the impact of the POC CRP test result on the general practitioner’s (GP) decision to prescribe antibiotics. The first part of this thesis showed that a prediction model including coryza, dyspnoea, crackles, diminished breath sounds, fever, and tachycardia, had the best diagnostic performance in diagnosing CAP. Moreover, adding CRP to signs and symptoms in the diagnostic workup of CAP improved both discrimination and risk classification. Nevertheless, in the majority of patients uncertainty about the diagnosis remained after adding CRP, because their predicted risk of CAP after application of the risk model remained in the ‘intermediate’ range. The second part of this thesis showed that five different POC CRP test devices show considerable variation in analytical performance and agreement with a laboratory reference test. These differences do not translate into differences in accuracy of predicting (radiographic) CAP, both as single test as well as in combination with available clinical findings. In the third part of this thesis we concluded that implementation of POC CRP testing did not reduce overall antibiotic prescribing for patients presenting with acute cough. Moreover, only a minority of patients who underwent POC CRP testing had an indication for testing according to guideline recommendations. The POC CRP test result did influence the GPs’ decision making to prescribe antibiotics in nearly one third of all cases. Finally, only a quarter of all eligible patients were recruited in our implementation study, which resulted in overestimation of POC CRP test use, antibiotic prescribing and in an overestimation of the effects of POC CRP test use on antibiotics prescribing...|$|R

The parents of mapping population, i. e., SH 349 (D genome grounded drought tolerant synthetic hexaploid wheat) and bread wheat (Opata M- 85, drought susceptible) were also grown individually in the field and tunnel. The biochemical analysis included osmolytes determination, i. e. soluble sugar; proline and antioxidant included superoxide dismutase activity, cell membrane stability followed by molecular diagnostics including DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction and <b>capillary</b> electrophoresis. <b>Yield</b> and Yield Components were included Days to heading, Days to physiological maturity, Plant height (cm), Spike length (cm), Number of grains per spike, 1000 Grain weight (g), pubescence, awn color and prostrate vs. erect habit. In this study, STATISTIX software was used for Two Factors Factorial Analysis of Variance, LSD (Least Significant Difference) did a comparison of means, and STATISTICA software was used to find out the correlation among different traits under control and stress conditions. For linkage and QTL analyses, JoinMap 4 and MapQTL 5 were used. Five Drought tolerant wheat lines were identified (18, 34, 54, 56 and 59). A linkage map was built by using SSR markers. One hundred and seventy four SSRs markers were used to screen the parents, (Opata, drought sensitive, and SH 349, drought tolerant). Seventy-nine polymorphic markers were identified and applied to drought mapping populations. Interval mapping (IM) and Multiple QTL mapping (MQM) did detection of QTLs. In IM analysis, fifteen QTLs were found for stress condition and thirty-eight QTLs were found in control conditions. In MQM analysis, twelve QTLs were found to control under field conditions and sixteen QTLs were detected in MQM analysis under stress. Eleven Novel QTLs have been identified for different traits, six by IM and five by MQM. In the end the results of this research presented that there are some drought tolerant or resistant alleles have been identified which can be moved to vulnerable genotypes using MAS (Marker Assisted Selection). In addition, this study provided additional evidence that the QTL strategy is useful and able to enhance performance of existing cultivars. Further QTL studies will assist in the contribution of positive allelic diversity in the future...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{approach}} that allows cost-effective automated purification of recombinant proteins in levels sufficient for functional characterization or structural studies is described. Studies with four human stem cell proteins, an engineered version of green fluorescent protein, and other proteins are included. The method combines an expression vector (pVP 62 K) that provides in vivo cleavage of an initial fusion protein, a factorial designed auto-induction medium that improves {{the performance of}} small-scale production, and rapid, automated metal affinity purification of His 8 -tagged proteins. For initial small-scale production screening, single colony transformants were grown overnight in 0. 4  ml of auto-induction medium, produced proteins were purified using the Promega Maxwell 16, and purification results were analyzed by Caliper LC 90 <b>capillary</b> electrophoresis. The <b>yield</b> of purified [U- 15 N]-His 8 -Tcl- 1 was 7. 5  μg/ml of culture medium, of purified [U- 15 N]-His 8 -GFP was 68  μg/ml, and of purified selenomethione-labeled AIA–GFP (His 8 removed by treatment with TEV protease) was 172  μg/ml. The yield information obtained from a successful automated purification from 0. 4  ml was used to inform the decision to scale-up for a second meso-scale (10 – 50  ml) cell growth and automated purification. 1 H– 15 N NMR HSQC spectra of His 8 -Tcl- 1 and of His 8 -GFP prepared from 50  ml cultures showed excellent chemical shift dispersion, consistent with well folded states in solution suitable for structure determination. Moreover, AIA–GFP obtained by proteolytic removal of the His 8 tag was subjected to crystallization screening, and yielded crystals under several conditions. Single crystals were subsequently produced and optimized by the hanging drop method. The structure was solved by molecular replacement at a resolution of 1. 7  Å. This approach provides {{an efficient way to}} carry out several key target screening steps that are essential for successful operation of proteomics pipelines with eukaryotic proteins: examination of total expression, determination of proteolysis of fusion tags, quantification of the yield of purified protein, and suitability for structure determination...|$|R
40|$|A major {{translational}} {{challenge in}} the fields of therapeutic angiogenesis and tissue engineering is the ability to form functional networks of blood vessels. Cell-based strategies to promote neovascularization have led to the consensus that co-delivery of endothelial cells (ECs) with a supporting stromal cell type is the most effective approach. However, the choice of stromal cells has varied across studies, and their impact on the functional qualities of the capillaries produced has not been examined. Our lab has developed methods to form interconnected networks of pericyte-invested capillaries both in vitro in a 3 D cell culture model and in vivo. However, if the engineered vessels contain ECs that are misaligned or contain wide junctional gaps, they may function improperly and behave more like the pathologic vessels that nourish tumors. The purpose of this thesis was to determine if stromal cells of different origins <b>yield</b> <b>capillaries</b> with different functional properties, in complementary in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, a fluorescent dextran tracer was used to visualize and quantify transport across the endothelium. In EC-fibroblast co-cultures, the dextran tracer penetrated through the vessel wall and permeability was high through the first 5 days of culture, indicative of vessel immaturity. Beyond day 5, tracer accumulated at the vessel periphery, with very little transported across the endothelium. When ECs were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or adipose-derived stem cells (AdSCs), tighter control of permeability was achieved. In vivo, all conditions yielded new vessels that inosculated with mouse dorsal vasculature and perfused the implant, but there were significant functional differences, depending on the identity of the co-delivered stromal cells. EC alone and EC-fibroblast implants <b>yielded</b> immature <b>capillary</b> beds characterized by high levels of erythrocyte pooling in the surrounding matrix, while EC-MSC and EC-AdSC implants produced more mature capillaries characterized by less extravascular leakage and expression of mature pericyte markers. Injection of dextran tracer into the circulation also showed that EC-MSC and EC-AdSC implants formed vasculature with more tightly regulated permeability. These results suggest that the identity of the stromal cells is key to controlling the functional properties of engineered capillary networks...|$|R
