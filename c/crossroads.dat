40|$|The {{condition}} of vehicle movement in signaling BCA <b>crossroad</b> today are all vehicle left turn on red (LTOR), however based on street body {{there should be}} movement from west direction (Semeru Street) that can be LTOR when the red light on. In other word, it is not allowed for the movement from others ways. While in signaling Galunggung <b>crossroad</b> all vehicle movement are LTOR {{because there is no}} traffic sign that prohibits. The existing vehicle movement is not appropriate to traffic discipline, because the lack of society knowledge on the rule of LTOR in signaling <b>crossroad.</b> In this case, it needs to conduct study on LTOR and its best operational LTOR in signaling <b>crossroad.</b> The study focused on Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) in 1997. The study examined the work of signaling <b>crossroad</b> in existing condition and in simulation resulted in vehicle movement that came out with estimation on the effect of LTOR in this part. The work of signaling BCA <b>crossroad</b> in the initial condition has the highest Degree of Saturation (DS) from east direction (Kahuripan Street) about 0. 692 and average <b>crossroad</b> delay was 13. 82 seconds. The signaling Galunggung <b>crossroad</b> has the highest DS from south direction (Galunggung Street) about 0. 75 and average <b>crossroad</b> delay was 22. 79 seconds. The vehicle movement of LTOR resulted in (increased) <b>crossroad</b> work. The best operational of vehicle movement in signaling BCA <b>crossroad</b> is movement from north (Basuki Rachmat Street) not LTOR; the vehicle from other directions should be LTOR. In Galunggung <b>crossroad,</b> all vehicle movements should be LTOR from all directions of <b>crossroad...</b>|$|R

5|$|Operation Sandstone was {{a series}} of nuclear weapon tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, {{following}} Trinity in 1945 and <b>Crossroads</b> in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the <b>Crossroads</b> tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from <b>Crossroads</b> in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.|$|E

Vehicle Ve_ 1 is coming to <b>crossroad</b> A from A_ 3 and it has just two choices: turning right on {{intersection}} A to A_ 2 or turning left to A_ 4.

50|$|Under the hood, the <b>Crossroad</b> sports {{one of two}} straight-4 {{engines of}} 1.8 L and 2.0 L in displacement.

Honda's Real-Time AWD system has been thoroughly revised for the <b>Crossroad.</b> It now {{works in conjunction with}} stability and traction control as well as ABS brakes. For {{the first time in a}} Honda, the <b>Crossroad</b> will be equipped with Hill-Start Assist which temporarily maintains brake pressure after the brake pedal is released when starting on a hill. Under normal driving conditions, the <b>Crossroad</b> behaves as a FWD vehicle.|$|R

40|$|<b>Crossroad</b> {{is among}} the most {{dangerous}} parts outside for the visually impaired people. Numerous studies have exploited navigating systems for the visually impaired community, pro-viding services ranging from block detection, route planning to realtime localization. However, none of them have ad-dressed the safety issue in <b>crossroad</b> and integrated three key factors necessary for a practical <b>crossroad</b> navigation system: detecting the <b>crossroad,</b> locating zebra patterns, and guiding the user within zebra crossing when passing the road. Our CrossNavi application responds to these needs, providing an integrated <b>crossroad</b> navigation service that incorporates all the essential functionalities mentioned above. The overall service is fulfilled by the collaboration of built-in sensors on commodity phones, and requires minimal human participa-tion. We describe the technical aspects of its design, imple-mentation, interface, and further improvements to make the system practical on a wider basis. Experimental results from three visually impaired volunteers show that the system ex-hibits promising behavior in both urban and rural areas...|$|R
