5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Cougar Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Surgeon General Dr. <b>C.</b> <b>Everett</b> <b>Koop,</b> Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.|$|E

[...] Since that time, Global Protection Corp. has become known for its innovative approach to condom marketing and its support of more than 3500 non-profit organizations worldwide. The company has numerous patents and trademarks to its name, including the only FDA-approved glow-in-the-dark condom, the Pleasure Plus condom and the original condom keychain. In 2005 the company introduced its newest product, One Condoms. One represents a complete reinvention of retail condom brands, combining sleek metal packaging, innovative condom wrappers and innovative marketing programs.

In South Africa, some manufacturers have considered introducing an extra-large variety of condoms after several complaints from South African men claiming the condoms were too small and causing discomfort.|$|R
40|$|According to a USDA {{study on}} nutrition, major health issues are diet related and the {{solution}} to illness {{can be found in}} nutrition. The real potential from improved diet is preventative in that it may defer or modify the development of a disease state. These findings are corroborated by Surgeon General <b>C.</b> <b>Everett</b> <b>Koop’s</b> 1988 Report on Nutrition and Health. Fifty years ago, grocery stores stocked about 200 items. Seventy percent of those were grown, produced or processed within a 100 -mile radius of the store. Today, the average supermarket carries 50, 000 food items or more; most of these foods are highly processed and refined, most of which are transported thousands of miles to their final destination. Americans spend over 90 percent of their food dollars on these processed foods- foods that contain high levels of refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, refined polyunsaturated oils and trans fatty acids as well as highly processed protein isolates. The reduction in nutrients in these foods requires that we eat more to satisfy the body’s nutritional requirements. The current Dietary Guidelines and Food Pyramid strongly favor a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. The caloric proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates advocated by USDA’s Food Pyramid and Dietary Guidelines are alarmingly similar to the USDA guidelines for fattening cattle and other livestock. Only during the last century has man’s diet included a high percentage of refined carbohydrates. Ou...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Medication {{adherence}} usually {{refers to}} whether patients take their medications as prescribed (eg, twice daily), {{as well as}} whether they continue to take a prescribed medication. Medication nonadherence {{is a growing concern}} to clinicians, healthcare systems, and other stakeholders (eg, payers) because of mounting evidence that it is prevalent and associated with adverse outcomes and higher costs of care. To date, measurement of patient medication adherence and use of interventions to improve adherence are rare in routine clinical practice. The goals of the present report are to address (1) different methods of measuring adherence, (2) the prevalence of medication nonadherence, (3) the association between nonadherence and outcomes, (4) the reasons for nonadherence, and finally, (5) interventions to improve medication adherence.
