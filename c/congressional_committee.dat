5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint <b>Congressional</b> <b>Committee</b> on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Washington's death, a <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> {{recommended}} {{a different type}} of monument. John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's reluctance to move his body prevented progress on any project.|$|E
5|$|The Overman Committee was {{a special}} {{subcommittee}} of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary chaired by North Carolina Democrat Lee Slater Overman. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it investigated German and Bolshevik elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known House Un-American Activities Committee, and represented the first <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> investigation of communism.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans has {{prompted}} many government officials to call for many <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> hearings and investigations.

5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> {{that a group of}} wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations.

5|$|On June 21, the <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> {{met again}} at the State House {{with members of the}} Pennsylvania Executive Council, {{including}} its president, John Dickinson. The members of Congress asked the council to do more to protect the federal government. Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day. The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|With {{the initial}} peace treaty {{articles}} ratified in April 1783, a recently formed <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> under Hamilton was considering needs {{and plans for}} a peacetime army. On May 2, 1783, the Commander in Chief submitted his Sentiments on a Peace Establishment to the Committee, essentially providing an official Continental Army position. The original proposal was defeated in Congress in two votes (May 1783, October 1783), with a truncated version also being rejected in April 1784.|$|E
5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican <b>Congressional</b> <b>Committee</b> (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E

5|$|The District of Columbia City Council passed {{legislation}} to enable {{bars and restaurants}} to stay open around‑the‑clock to provide hospitality services to the inaugural festivities attendees. After reaching {{an agreement with the}} <b>congressional</b> <b>committee,</b> District of Columbia MayorAdrian Fenty signed legislation to temporarily allow bars and restaurants to operate 24hours during the weekend leading up to the inauguration, but with 4:00am EST as the cut‑off for alcoholic beverage service. The Hotel Association of Metropolitan Washington agreed to pay for extended train service provided by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on January 19 to accommodate visitors attending inaugural events and workers providing support for those events.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} on June 20, the State House was mobbed {{by as many}} as 400 {{soldiers}} demanding payment. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Alexander Hamilton, then a delegate from New York, persuaded the soldiers to allow Congress to meet later to address their concerns. The soldiers did allow the members of Congress to peacefully adjourn that afternoon. That evening, a small <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee,</b> headed by Hamilton, met in secret to draft a message to the Pennsylvania Council, asking them to protect Congress from the mutineers. The letter threatened that Congress would be forced to move elsewhere if the Council did not act.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} first session of the Tenth Congress, Rowan {{proposed}} that a <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> be formed to investigate accusations against General James Wilkinson that, in 1788, he took money from the government of Spain in exchange for efforts to separate Kentucky from Virginia and unite it with Spain rather than the United States. Aaron Burr {{had been accused of}} working with Wilkinson in the so-called Spanish Conspiracy, and when Burr had approached Rowan in 1806 to solicit his services in defending Burr against the charges, Rowan had declined because he believed Burr to be guilty. Rowan's proposal to form an investigative committee against Wilkinson failed, but he succeeded in gaining approval for a committee to investigate federal judge Harry Innes' purported role in the Conspiracy. Rowan was appointed to the committee and delivered its report April 19, 1808; the report stated that the committee could find no evidence of wrongdoing by Innes.|$|E
