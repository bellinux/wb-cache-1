The ability of the abovementioned technique to record intracrystalline concentration profiles during uptake/release of guest molecules revealed oddities of the system under study. In other words, these crystals have the tendency to break in the middle, enhancing in this way diffusion. On the other hand, molecules have to <b>confront</b> high <b>surface</b> barriers when they try to diffuse through the other sides of the crystal, where it is not broken. 2...|$|R

In their art, the Kuba have developed all the geometric possibilities of repetitive variations of border patterns, and of the seventeen ways that a design can be repetitively varied on a surface, the Kuba have exploited twelve. This exploration {{does not mean that they}} confine themselves to repetitive patterning in <b>confronting</b> a <b>surface</b> to be decorated.|$|R

40|$|The time-space {{distribution}} of chlorophyll a in the Southwestern Atlantic is examined using 6 years (1998 - 2003) of sea surface color images from Sea-viewing Wide Field of View Sensor (SeaWiFS). Chlorophyll a (chl a) distribution is <b>confronted</b> with sea <b>surface</b> temperature (SST) fronts retrieved from satellite imagery. Histogram {{analysis of the}} color, SST, and SST gradient data sets provides a simple procedure for pixel classification from which eight biophysical regions in the SWA are identified, including three new regions with regard to Longhurst (1998) work: Patagonian Shelf Break (PSB), Brazil Current Overshoot, and Zapiola Rise region. In the PSB region, coastal-trapped waves are suggested as a possible mechanism leading to the intraseasonal frequencies observed in SST and chl a. Mesoscale activity associated with the Brazil Current Front and, in particular, eddies drifting southward is probably responsible for the high chl a values observed throughout the Brazil Current Overshoot region. The Zapiola Rise {{is characterized by a}} local minimum in SST gradient magnitudes and shows chl a maximum values in February, 3 months later than the austral spring bloom of the surroundings. Significant interannual variability is present in the color imagery. In the PSB, springs and summers with high chl a concentrations seem associated with stronger local northerly wind speed, and possible mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the Brazil-Malvinas front is detected using both SST gradient and SeaWiFS images. The time-averaged position of the front at 54. 2 °W is estimated at 38. 9 °S and its alongshore migration of about 300 km. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union. Fil:Saraceno, M.

40|$|Friction {{and gravity}} {{represent}} two basic physical constraints of terrestrial locomotion that affect both motor patterns and the biomechanics of bipedal gait. To provide {{insights into the}} spatiotemporal organization of the motor output in connection with ground contact forces, we studied adaptation of human gait to steady low-friction conditions. Subjects walked along a slippery walkway (7 m long; friction coefficient approximately 0. 06) or a normal, nonslippery floor at a natural speed. We recorded gait kinematics, ground reaction forces, and bilateral electromyographic (EMG) activity of 16 leg and trunk muscles and we mapped the recorded EMG patterns onto the spinal cord in approximate rostrocaudal locations of the motoneuron (MN) pools to characterize the spatiotemporal organization of the motor output. The results revealed several idiosyncratic features of walking on the slippery surface. The step length, cycle duration, and horizontal shear forces were significantly smaller, the head orientation tended to be stabilized in space, whereas arm movements, trunk rotations, and lateral trunk inclinations considerably increased and foot motion and gait kinematics resembled those of a nonplantigrade gait. Furthermore, walking on the slippery surface required stabilization of the hip and of the center-of-body mass in the frontal plane, which significantly improved with practice. Motor patterns were characterized by an enhanced (roughly twofold) level of MN activity, substantial decoupling of anatomical synergists, {{and the absence of}} systematic displacements of the center of MN activity in the lumbosacral enlargement. Overall, the results show that when subjects are <b>confronted</b> with unsteady <b>surface</b> conditions, like the slippery floor, they adopt a gait mode that tends to keep the COM centered over the supporting limbs and to increase limb stiffness. We suggest that this behavior may represent a distinct gait mode that is particularly suited to uncertain surface conditions in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} for direct investigation of thermal emission from isolated neutron stars was opened about 25 {{years ago with}} the launch of the first X-ray observatory, Einstein. A significant contribution to this study was provided by ROSAT in 1990 's. The outstanding capabilities of the currently operating observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton, have greatly increased the potential to observe and analyze thermal radiation from the neutron star <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Confronting</b> observational data with theoretical models of thermal emission, presumably formed in neutron star atmospheres, allows one to infer the surface temperatures, magnetic fields, chemical composition, and neutron star masses and radii. This information, supplemented with model equations of state and neutron star cooling models, provides an opportunity to understand the fundamental properties of the superdense matter in the neutron star interiors. I review the current status and most important results obtained from modeling neutron star thermal emission and present selected Chandra and XMM-Newton results on thermal radiation from various types of these objects: ordinary radio pulsars with ages ranging from about 2 kyr to 20 Myr (J 1119 - 6127, Vela, B 1706 - 44, J 0538 + 2817, B 2334 + 61, B 0656 + 14, B 1055 - 52, Geminga, B 0950 + 08, J 2043 + 2740), millisecond pulsars (J 0030 + 0451, J 2124 - 3358, J 1024 - 0719, J 0437 - 4715), putative pulsars (CXOU J 061705. 3 + 222127, RX J 0007. 0 + 7302), central compact objects in supernova remnats (in particular, 1 E 1207. 4 - 5209), and isolated radio-quiet neutron stars.
