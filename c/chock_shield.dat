40|$|Field {{observation}} {{were conducted}} on behaviour of <b>chock</b> <b>shield</b> support of capacity 800 T during extraction of longwall panel no. 3 D 2 at 250 m depth and 150 m face length of GDK 10 A Incline, Singareni Collieries Company Limited. Chock leg pressures and leg closures were regularly monitored {{at different stages of}} extraction of longwall panel. During extraction of the panel, maximum leg closure and pressure on the <b>chock</b> <b>shield</b> were 600 mm and 490 bar, respectively (not on all chocks). Setting and yielding pressures were 300 bar and 400 bar corresponding to setting load and yielding load 600 T and 800 T, respectively. During major fall condition, 27 % of chock shields were loaded upto 800 T. During normal periods, maximum load was about 640 T. Parametric studies for depth covers of 150 m to 1200 m for the face advance of 6 m to 150 m was simulated in 2 D numerical model. At each depth, a fall in vertical stress was found between 80 m to 100 m face advance indicating major roof falland for 250 m depth cover, it was varying from 6 MPa to 4. 5 MPa. Vertical stress and roof sag above the support was increasing as the depth was varying from 150 m to 1200 m and maximum found was 50 MPa and 1500 mm respectively at 1200 m depth and 150 m face advance...|$|E
40|$|Shield {{sections}} {{change their}} configuration to suit mining mode. Articulation cylinders raise rear shield to advance position, and locking cylinders hold it there. To change to retreat position articulation cylinders lower shield. Locking pins at edge of outermost shield plate latch <b>shield</b> to <b>chock</b> base. <b>Shield</b> accommodates roof heights ranging from 36 to 60 inches (0. 9 to 1. 52 meters) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{hydraulic}} jacks, called powered roof supports, <b>chocks</b> or <b>shields,</b> which are typically 1.75 m wide {{and placed in}} a long line, side by side for up to 400 m in length in order to support the roof of the coalface. An individual chock can weigh 30-40 tonnes, extend to a maximum cutting height of up to 6 m and have yield rating of 1000-1250 tonnes each, and hydraulically advance itself 1 m at a time.|$|R
