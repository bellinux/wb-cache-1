50|$|Protruding pistons. The pumping pistons {{protrude}} {{from the}} opposite end of the cylinder block. There are numerous configurations used for the exposed ends of the pistons but in all cases they bear against a cam. In variable displacement units, the cam is movable and commonly referred to as a swashplate, yoke or hanger. For conceptual purposes, the cam can be represented by a plane, the orientation of which, in combination with shaft rotation, provides the cam action that leads to piston reciprocation and thus pumping. The angle between a vector normal to the cam plane and the cylinder block axis of rotation, called the <b>cam</b> <b>angle,</b> is one variable that determines the displacement of the pump or the amount of fluid pumped per shaft revolution. Variable displacement units have the ability to vary the <b>cam</b> <b>angle</b> during operation whereas fixed displacement units do not.|$|E
5000|$|The RB25 {{series of}} engines was first {{introduced}} in the GTS-25 R32 Nissan Skyline. RB25DE and DET engines produced from August 1993 also featured NVCS (Nissan Variable Cam System) for the intake cam. This gave the new RB25DE more power and torque at lower rpm than the previous model. From 1995,(Series 2 Engines) both the RB25DE and RB25DET had a revised electrical system and the turbocharger on the RB25DET(S2) had a ceramic compressor wheel rather than aluminium. The most obvious change to the system was the introduction of ignition coils with built in ignitors, therefore the coil ignitor that was on previous models was not used. Other changes were, different air flow meter, engine ECU, <b>cam</b> <b>angle</b> sensor and throttle position sensor. Mechanically Series 1 and Series 2 are very similar, the only mechanical difference would be the camshafts as the Series 2 <b>Cam</b> <b>Angle</b> Sensor's shaft {{that goes into the}} exhaust cam is slightly different.

5000|$|These {{consist of}} three or four cams mounted on a common axle or two {{adjacent}} axles, {{in such a way that}} pulling on the shaft connected to the axle forces the cams to spread further apart. The SLCD is used like a syringe, by pulling the cams via a [...] "trigger" [...] (a small handle) which forces them closer, inserting it into a crack or pocket in the rock, and then releasing the trigger. The springs make the cams expand and grip the rock face securely. A climbing rope may then be attached to the end of the stem via a sling and carabiner. SLCDs are typically designed to maintain a constant <b>camming</b> <b>angle</b> with the rock to ensure that the normal force provided by the cam lobes against the rock face will supply enough friction to hold a cam in equilibrium with the rock. These devices are also known as [...] "friends" [...] for example, as they are in the UK.|$|R

It also has an improved intake system (a better flowing cylinder head because of the angle of the intake ports being changed). There was also a switch from the earlier problematic hydraulic lifters to solid lifters. The United States 2004-2005 Mazdaspeed MX-5 turbo is based on this engine rather than the newer BP-Z3 and produces 178 hp (133 kW) and 166 lb·ft (225 N·m) with slightly reduced compression.

50|$|The 5S-FE was {{available}} in several variations each being distinguished by valve cover design. The first generation, introduced in the 1990-92 Celica GT/GT-S and MR2, had a power rating of 130 hp and 144 lbs-ft/torque. The second generation was introduced in 1993 with the fifth generation (ST184) Celica, and continued through the sixth generation (ST204) Celica. The second generation was also used in the MR2 (SW21) and Camry/Scepter (XV10) series and had a power output of 135 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque. It had slightly less aggressive cams, no cold start injector, a knock sensor, and more aggressive tuning to give it slightly more power. In states that had adopted California emission standards the 5S-FE was rated at 130 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque due mainly to emission equipment used to meet those emission regulations. The third generation was the last 5S-FE engine produced and {{was used in the}} 1997-01 Camry XV20 and 1999-01 Camry Solara; however, from 1996 onward, the engine received a crank angle sensor instead of a <b>cam</b> <b>angle</b> sensor for a smoother idle. From 1997 to 1999 the engine produced 133 hp at 5,200 rpm and 147 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. From 2000 to 2001, the engine received modest improvements to increase power output to 136 hp at 5,200 rpm and 150 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm.

40|$|Purpose: The {{subject of}} the {{research}} was wear of camshaft cams studied in accordance with results of operation tests. Based on the said tests, the dependence of wear intensity of cams from their angular position was established. The respective calculation results enabled the function of cam fallibility to be determined. Design/methodology/approach: The research conducted included measurements of normal and excessive wear of camshaft cams. Based on measurements of several dozen cams, their angular positions at which the most intense wear occurred were established. They were described statistically {{by means of the}} Weibull distribution. Findings: Wear intensity of the camshaft cams examined {{is a function of the}} <b>cam’s</b> <b>angle</b> of rotation. This dependence is characterised by occurrence of two maxima for the angles of ca. - 40 ° and 30 °. The cam wear intensity at the first maximum is usually smaller than at the second one. The wear intensity distribution does not depend on the cam type. Research limitations/implications: During operation, camshaft cams may be subject to accelerated wear. In this study, an attempt was made to assess this phenomenon based on measurements of the cams’ geometry aimed at determination of the areas exposed to the most intense wear. Originality/value: In order to counteract the phenomenon of excessive wear of cams, one should consider altering the geometry of cams in the areas exposed to the most intense wear...|$|R

This study focus on the performance of methane fuelled engine and optimize it by varying the <b>cam</b> timing <b>angle</b> for both intake and exhaust valves. The engine performance was measured on the brake torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure (Bmep) and incylinder peak pressure. The engine model was developed based on Modenas Kriss 110 cc 4 -stroke single cylinder gasoline engine. CATIA software was used in developing the 3 D engine model and followed by utilization of GT-Suite software in analyzing the engine performance. The engine performance results for methane fuelled engine were found to be lower at about 20. 1 % for engine torque, brake power and bmep and 12. 0 % for in-cylinder peak pressure when compared to gasoline engine. In the case of different valve timing, it was found that retarding the exhaust valve open timing at about 10 ° would produce the highest brake power in the range 5 – 10 %.

Studying powder/moisture interaction under pressure with radial die-wall pressure (RDWP) tool was never done. The aim of our study was to use this tool to study this interaction at high compression pressure and speed. Moreover, the effect of changing ejection <b>cam</b> <b>angle</b> (EA) of the machine on ejection force (EF) was investigated. Also, a new tool for prediction of tablet sticking was proposed. Materials with different deformation behaviors stored at low and high moisture conditions were used. Compaction simulation guided by modeling was applied. High Aw resulted in a low residual die-wall pressure (RDP) for all materials, and a high maximum die-wall pressure (MDP) for plastic materials, p> 0. 05. This was due to the lubricating and plasticizing effects of water, respectively. However, microcrystalline cellulose showed capping at high Aw and compaction pressure. By increasing compression pressure at high Aw for all materials, effective fall time (EFT) was increased, p> 0. 05, showing tendency for sticking.
