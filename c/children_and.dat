40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} describing {{the content and}} time allocated to undergraduate medical education curricula in <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry and make recommendations about <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry teaching goals and curricula content. METHOD: A literature search from 1970 to February 2007 using the key words undergraduate, curriculum, teaching, education, psychiatry, <b>child,</b> adolescent, <b>and</b> medical school, was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. RESULTS: There is limited agreement about curricula content for undergraduate <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry teaching programs in medical schools, {{with a wide range}} of objectives identified by different programs. On average, the time allowed for teaching <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry is small. There is also great variation in the time allocated by different medical schools. In many countries, the number of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatrists with academic appointments is limited, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry programs are developed and taught by a small number of teaching staff at each medical school. CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools should reconsider the relatively low priority given to teaching <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry to medical students. The <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry profession must identify clear learning goals for a longitudinal developmentally appropriate model of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> adolescent psychiatry education commencing at an undergraduate level in medical schools and continuing through residency and fellowships. There is a need to promote national and international standards for teaching in this area and to encourage stronger collaborations between teaching staff across different medical schools.

The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E
