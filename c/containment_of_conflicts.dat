40|$|Since {{the past}} decade {{conflict}} prevention {{has become a major}} focus on the international agenda. Key intra- and interstate <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> the nine-ties indeed shed the light on the urgent necessity to build an appropriate normative framework for the role of the international community in the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> violent <b>conflicts.</b> The centre <b>of</b> attention has been driven towards conflict prevention, and a growing concern among international actors epitomises then Secretary General Kofi Annan’s injunctions to move the United Nations “from a culture of reaction to a culture of pre-vention”. However, the crucial challenge concerning prevention is now to shift from conceptualisation to practical implementation {{in order to reduce the}} “unacceptable gap [that] remains between rhetoric and real-ity”. 1 Although the strong focus on conflict prevention only emerged at the end of the twentieth century, the concept is not entirely new. It can in-deed be traced back at least to the Congress of Vienna in 1814 - 1815 that aimed at preventing new wars by a range of measures and principles such as the creation of demilitarised areas and neutral states. 2 More re-cently, the Marshall Plan and the European integration were consciously conceived of as insurance against renewed conflict between the Western European peoples as evidenced in, for example, Winston Churchill in his avant-gardist Zurich speech in 1946. The UN charter moreover includes a wide array of coercive or non-coercive measures intended to prevent violent conflicts from emerging or recurring (Chapter VI and VII). The ambition to prevent conflict is indeed one of the cornerstones that hav...|$|R
30|$|Throughout {{the study}} villages, the {{relationship}} between pastoralists and government officials {{when it comes to}} either <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> FMD, elephants-related <b>conflicts</b> or control and access to rangeland resources came close to institutionalised mistrust. Dealing with a complex social-ecological system requires that government do more than pay lip service to the concept of consultation and participation. While governments have access to information on climate or disease, pastoralists can provide a compact account of local conditions based on years of practical experience, thus enabling a more appropriate and locally relevant policy environment. In this process, historical perspectives can form a point of reference by which institutions perceive issues, assess scientific findings and justify decisions. In Botswana, relatively little effort has been made to integrate historical perspectives into land use planning. Past attempts to support pastoral development have failed to successfully balance the needs of critical ecological pastoral areas through appropriate policy and technical approaches. Progress from here will depend not so much on the pastoralists but on the willingness of government agencies responsible for policy to talk to people through genuine participation.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE Attainment of safe, calm {{inpatient}} psychiatric wards {{that are}} conducive to positive therapeutic care is crucial. On such wards, rates of coerced medication, seclusion, manual restraint {{and other types}} <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> are comparatively low, and, usually, rates of conflict-for example, aggression, substance use, and absconding-are also low. Sometimes, however, wards maintain low rates <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> even when <b>conflict</b> rates are high. This study investigated wards with the counterintuitive combination <b>of</b> low <b>containment</b> and high conflict or high containment and low conflict. METHODS The authors conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected from 136 acute psychiatric wards across England in 2004 - 2005. The wards were categorized into four groups {{on the basis of}} median splits <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> and <b>conflict</b> rates: high conflict and high containment, high conflict and low containment, low conflict and low containment, and low conflict and high containment. Features significantly associated with these ward types were identified. RESULTS Among the variables significantly associated with the various typologies, some-for example, environmental quality-were changeable, and others-such as social deprivation of the area served-were fixed. High-conflict, low-containment wards had higher rates of male staff and lower-quality environments than other wards. Low-conflict, high-containment wards had higher numbers of beds. High-conflict, high-containment wards utilized more temporary staff as well as more unqualified staff. No overall differences were associated with low-conflict, low-containment wards. CONCLUSIONS Wards can make positive changes to achieve a low-containment, nonpunitive culture, even when rates <b>of</b> patient <b>conflict</b> are high...|$|R
40|$|The costs {{associated}} with organisational and institutional disputes and scandals are significant, as evidenced in the Chico University hazing case 2005, {{which resulted in the}} death of Matthew Carrington. Because this affair became public, it was possible to conduct an analysis of materials. However, since the 1960 s, specific workplace measures to keep issues within the organisation, including humanisation and psychologisation of the workplace, have resulted in the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> issues as private affairs, making them difficult to investigate. Cases that breach containment and enter the public domain offer an opportunity to explore, not only escalations <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> but also the private, contained phase of events. Using Boltanski's affair model to explore the phases of the Chico affair, specific differences between psychological and social affairs are examined. This case highlights key phases that a conflict or scandal may pass through from psychological to social affair. Key phases of the process are outlined and discussed in light <b>of</b> the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> the issues and implications for main players, including the organisation or institution. This study contributes to an understanding <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> processes and outcomes. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional StudiesFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Disruptive {{behaviours}} {{of acute}} psychiatric inpatients have typically been studied separately, as have {{the methods used}} to contain them. There are indications that behaviours and containment methods are systematically related. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the frequency and relationship between the differing <b>conflict</b> behaviours <b>of</b> patients, and explore the relationship between professional containment measures and those conflict behaviours. Methods: A cross-sectional survey <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> behaviours and <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> 238 two-week admissions to 12 acute psychiatric wards in London, UK was carried out. Results: Factor analysis revealed seven patterns <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> behaviours, with aggression being separately associated with absconding and medication refusal. Neither substance misuse nor self-harm were associated with aggression. Aggressive behaviour attracted the widest range <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> measures, including the use of special observation. Conclusions: The <b>conflict</b> behaviours <b>of</b> patients form complex patterns, and should be studied together rather than separatel...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the potentiality {{of ethnic}} politics and violent conflicts in Ghana. It {{is a fact}} that involvement of ethnicity in politics has been a source <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> in some Africa countries. Most <b>of</b> these <b>conflicts</b> often tend to become a nationwide conflict with its alarming destructive impacts on humans and property. Ghana has not been spared the spectre of violent ethnic and communal conflcits that have engulfed the sub-region since the 1980 s. However, in Ghana, most of these conflcit have been limited within some ethnic groups and have not threatened the stability of the state. The potentials are there espcially when the perceptions like ethnic rivalries, inequalities, ethnic imbalance, chieftaincy disputes, land litigations, fear of exclusion and ethnic tension comes to mind. It can be said that Ghana is sitting on a time bomb and ready to explode but that has not happened. This {{can be attributed to the}} institutional arrangements, public policies, Constitutional provisions and other laws that have help to regulate political competition and to manage ethnic diversity, by setting out the rules for all Ghanaians, irrespective of one’s background and ethnic affiliation which emphasis on national integration. The study therefore concludes that though there is undeniable fact that ethnicity remains a major problem in Ghanaian politics, the country has not experienced any major conflict as a result. Conflicts in Ghana has been contained by an over arching national identity which unifies people across ethnic boundaries. The strength of such a national identities is a major reason why nationwide conflicts have been limited and also why the risks <b>of</b> future violent <b>conflicts</b> are unlikely. However the success <b>of</b> the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> ethnicity and <b>conflict</b> as obtain now will by and large depend on how political and economic power will be distributed among the political elites and the various ethnic groups in the country especially as the Fourth Republic politics progresses...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial drug {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{widely recognized as}} a global public health threat because it endangers the effectiveness of treatment of infectious diseases. In 2001 WHO issued the Global Strategy for <b>Containment</b> <b>of</b> Antimicrobial Resistance, but it has proved difficult to translate {{the recommendations of the}} Global Strategy into effective public health actions. The purpose of the Antimicrobial Resistance Containment and Surveillance (ARCS) approach is to facilitate the formulation of public health programmes and the mobilization of human and financial resources for the <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR. The ARCS approach highlights the fundamental link between rational drug use and <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR. Clinical management of human and animal infections should be improved through better disease control and prevention, high quality diagnostic testing, appropriate treatment regimens and consumer health education. At the same time, systems for supplying antimicrobial drugs should include appropriate regulations, lists of essential drugs, and functional mechanisms for the approval and delivery <b>of</b> drugs. <b>Containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR is defined in the ARCS approach as the continuous application of this package of core interventions. Surveillance of the extent and trends of antimicrobial resistance as well as the supply, selection and use of antimicrobial drugs should be established to monitor the process and outcome <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> AMR. The ARCS approach is represented in the ARCS diagram (Fig. 2) which provides a simplified, but comprehensive illustration of the complex problem <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> and monitoring <b>of</b> AMR...|$|R

40|$|George Gissing invites {{constant}} rediscovery {{because he}} eludes it; the very tensions and contradictions that make his novels troubling are precisely what demand analysis. At {{the center of}} these contradictions, I contend, are <b>conflicting</b> constructs <b>of</b> class and gender. It {{has become something of}} a critical commonplace, perhaps, to say that class and gender “intersect. ” But my project is to trace precisely the way in which these categories overlap and interact in Gissing 2 ̆ 7 s novels, to demonstrate their dependence on each other, and to understand how this functions within each text as a whole. Novelistic strategies for establishing gender and class, I argue, may serve equally well to dismantle them. My dissertation examines the ideological implications of this interplay of class and gender in relation to narrative itself. ^ In order to structure his explicitly social fictions, Gissing presides over the collapse of the marriage plot, both as a narrative convention that, with few exceptions, dominates the Victorian novel, and as a symbolic mechanism for the resolution (or <b>containment)</b> <b>of</b> social <b>conflict.</b> While Gissing continues to work within the basic structure of domestic fiction, his novels ultimately elude the conditions of this framework. According to Nancy Armstrong, “[i]t is only by…subordinating all social differences to those based on gender that these novels bring order to social relationships”; the mechanism for imposing this order, of course, is often—though not always—the eventual marriage of protagonists who conform to very specific models of gender. Gissing 2 ̆ 7 s novels systematically project class conflict onto gendered courtship plots, but rather than providing the resolution Armstrong describes, Gissing 2 ̆ 7 s disrupted marriage plots tend to insist that social relationships ultimately cannot be thus subordinated. In doing so, they expose the social fantasy that might be said to structure most Victorian novels, and destabilize the rigid constructs of gender upon which, according to Armstrong, the suppression of social difference depends. I establish a certain mutability of gender as a recurring characteristic of Gissing 2 ̆ 7 s novels, and I identify this as a site where social change can be imagined. ...|$|R
