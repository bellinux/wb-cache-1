25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the <b>chainstay</b> so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elevated}} <b>chainstay</b> bicycle {{was popular}} in the early 90s. It featured a rear triangle with elevated bottom frame stays, negating {{the need for the}} chain to be drawn through the rear frame. [...] This allowed for a shorter wheelbase and improved handling during technical ascents, at the cost of compromised integrity and resultant increased bottom bracket flex (unless reinforced) compared to a frame with traditional chainstays.|$|E
50|$|Two-wheel {{trailers}} which {{attach to}} the rear axle or <b>chainstay</b> generally have an angled towbar {{to help keep the}} trailer central behind the bicycle.|$|E
5000|$|... 525-Triathlon - almost {{identical}} to 525, with the only differences being seat stays are 0.1mm thinner, and <b>chainstays</b> are 0.1mm thicker, than standard 525 ...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Booties {{had a different}} frame and wheels. The frame was mostly of tubular steel without lugs, but the <b>chainstays</b> were still made of flat steel strip.|$|R
25|$|Bottom-bracket dynamos are {{attached}} between the <b>chainstays</b> behind the bottom bracket and are {{powered by a}} roller against the tire. These are easy to fit and do not wear the tire sidewall.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{was moved}} to Sportech. With this move came several {{improvements}} {{to the design of}} the Burner, including a single machined block to support the bottom bracket, rear shock mount and <b>chainstay</b> swing-arm pivot.|$|E
5000|$|The CD0.1, Illicito, and PRsix all feature various {{iterations}} of SHIFT {{technology in}} their design. The CD0.1 and Illicito feature a downtube offset by 18mm. The CD0.1 {{has a more}} [...] "traditional" [...] rear-end (two seat-stays and two-chainstays), but the Illicito features only a massive <b>chainstay</b> on the non-drive side. This <b>chainstay,</b> combined with SHIFT, creates a [...] "sail" [...] effect across certain degrees of yaw. The PRsix features {{what is known as}} SHIFT+, a new take on QR's SHIFT technology. Combining a boat tail tube cross-section with a 12mm offset downtube, the PRsix is faster across all degrees of yaw than either the CD0.1 or the Illicito.|$|E
5000|$|The {{elevated}} <b>chainstay</b> bicycle {{was popular}} in the early 90s. It featured a rear triangle with elevated bottom frame stays, negating {{the need for the}} chain to be drawn through the rear frame. This allowed for a shorter wheelbase and improved handling during technical ascents, at the cost of compromised integrity and resultant increased bottom bracket flex (unless reinforced) compared to a frame with traditional chainstays.|$|E
50|$|A soft tail (also softail) {{relies on}} the flexing of the <b>chainstays</b> of a regular diamond frame to create {{suspension}} travel, sometimes incorporating a specific flexing member within the <b>chainstays.</b> A shock absorber (or elastomer) is placed {{in line with the}} seat stays to allow the <b>chainstays</b> to move up and down, and for shock absorption. As the suspension moves through its travel the seat stay and shock absorber move out of alignment. This misalignment creates a mechanical lever for suspension forces, causing torque on the joint between chain- and seatstays. This is an inherent structural disadvantage of the soft tail design and severely limits the amount of travel possible, typically around 1 to 2 inches. Soft tails have few moving parts and few pivot points making them simple and requiring little maintenance. Some notable examples include the KHS Team Softail, Trek STP and the Moots YBB. Some bikes (such as the Cannondale Scapel, Yeti ASR Carbon and older Yeti bikes) use a four-bar suspension design where one of the pivots is replaced by a flexing link.|$|R
5000|$|... a {{wheelbase}} shortened {{as much as}} possible, {{for increased}} turning ability, with the shortest <b>chainstays</b> possible, and a slightly shortened top tube (often causing some toe overlap with the front wheel on smaller frame sizes).|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame of}} the first {{generation}} Bootie was made of pairs of half inch steel tubes, with the flattened tube ends bolted to aluminium head, saddle and bottom bracket castings. The <b>chainstays</b> were of flat steel strip.|$|R
50|$|They do allow {{use of a}} {{slightly}} shorter cable, tend to keep the cable more clean (as it is more protected from grit thrown up from the road), and the loop of housing at the rear derailleur {{does not need to}} bend quite as tightly, since the cable stop is on the top side of the <b>chainstay,</b> rather than beneath it. Despite the advantages this routing is almost exclusively found on older bikes.|$|E
5000|$|In the English case of Welsh v Lawrence (11 April 1818), the plaintiff's {{horse was}} killed by the {{defendant}}'s cart. Its <b>chainstay</b> had broken, causing the defendant's horse to run away. [...] "If the defendant is driving negligently as to the tackle," [...] Bayley J said, [...] "he is driving negligently." [...] This case has been cited as authority {{on the issue of}} negligence, both in tort and in criminal law, in both England and South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The first shaft drives for cycles {{appear to}} have been invented {{independently}} in 1890 in the United States and Britain. A. Fearnhead, of 354 Caledonian Road, North London developed one in 1890 and received a patent in October 1891. His prototype shaft was enclosed within a tube running {{along the top of the}} chainstay; later models were enclosed within the actual <b>chainstay.</b> [...] In the United States, Walter Stillman filed for a patent on a shaft-driven bicycle on Dec. 10, 1890 which was granted on July 21, 1891.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} MC2 frames, Klein used [...] "Gradient tubing", where the wall {{thickness}} varied {{along the length}} and diameter of the tube. Highly manipulated <b>chainstays</b> on mountain bikes allowed a tighter rear triangle to accommodate large off-road tyres, and facilitated efficient transfer of power.|$|R
25|$|Other {{materials}} besides carbon fiber, such as metallic boron, can {{be added}} to the matrix to enhance stiffness further. Some newer high end frames are incorporating Kevlar fibers into the carbon weaves to improve vibration damping and impact strength, particularly in downtubes and seat- and <b>chainstays.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Trek bicycles' [...] "Full Floater" [...] is {{a system}} where the rear shock is only {{attached}} to the rear triangle. The <b>chainstays</b> pivot on the seat-tube, and then extend into the front triangle, and the lower shock bushing attaches to the <b>chainstays.</b> The seatstays are attached to an [...] "Evo" [...] link, which then attaches to the shock top bushings. This system enables finer tuning of suspension kinematics, as the shock angle relative to the linkages during the travel changes in a more linear fashion. Trek also combines [...] "Full Floater" [...] with its [...] "ABP" [...] rear axle, where the rear suspension pivot is the rear axle, which reduces pedal feedback and prevents the braking forces on the wheel from altering the suspension movement. It also provides better traction and control through braking over rough terrain.|$|R
5000|$|DMD : Direct-Mount-Derailleur — Initiated by Specialized Bicycles, {{this type}} of {{derailleur}} is bolted directly to bosses on the <b>chainstay</b> of the bike. They are mostly used on dual suspension mountain bikes, where suspension movement causes changes to the chain angle as it enters the front derailleur cage. By utilizing a DMD system, the chain and derailleur move together, allowing for better shifting when the suspension is active. A DMD derailleur {{should not be confused}} with Shimano's Direct Mount, which uses a different mounting system. However, SRAM's direct mount front derailleurs are compatible with DMD, and certain Shimano E-type derailleurs can be used with DMD if the e-type plate is removed.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Virtual Pivot Point" [...] or VPP, is {{the name}} given to a four-bar linkage {{suspension}} with relatively short links connecting the rear triangle to the frame. It is characterized by having a <b>chainstay</b> lengthening effect and an 'S' shaped axle path. Some variations may have the links rotate in opposite direction as the suspension moves. The instant centre of rotation, as found in all linkage systems, is also called virtual pivot point. The [...] "Virtual Pivot Point" [...] suspension was developed by Jamie Calon and James Klassen for Outland Bikes in the nineties and the associated patents are now owned by Santa Cruz Bicycles.|$|E
50|$|Mopeds {{occasionally}} resemble powered bicycles, {{more commonly}} called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 {{there has been}} a glut of engine kits shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the spokes to break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the spokes to break, as well as lodging the chain in the <b>chainstay</b> and causing injury to the operator.|$|E
50|$|Bicycles {{may have}} eyelets, tapped with a {{standard}} thread, at the dropouts on the rear <b>chainstays,</b> and on the front fork blades. Mounting a bike rack is possible without these eyelets, but requires additional hardware. A style of rack clamps only to the seatpost, does not require eyelets or additional hardware, but has a limited capacity.|$|R
50|$|The first road frame from Cannondale was {{produced}} in 1983. It sold for $350 and included the frame and fork. The fork was steel with helical reinforcement ribs inside the steel steering tube. The frame was recognizable by its oversized down tube and enlarged head tube. The seatstays and <b>chainstays</b> were ovalized to reduce flex. Unlike steel frames, there were no lugs: the aluminum tubes were mitered, hand welded, and then heat treated.|$|R
5000|$|U-brakes {{were used}} on {{mountain}} bikes {{through the early}} 1990s, particularly under the <b>chainstays,</b> a rear brake mounting location that was then popular. [...] This location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness, an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase lever travel and reduce effective braking force. Unfortunately it is also very prone to clogging by mud, which meant that U-brakes quickly fell out of favour on cross-country bikes.|$|R
50|$|This British WWII Airborne BSA {{folding bicycle}} was rigged so that, when parachuted, the {{handlebars}} and seat {{were the first}} parts to hit the ground (as bent wheels would disable the bike). BSA abandoned the traditional diamond bicycle design as too weak for the shock and instead made an elliptical frame of twin parallel tubes, one forming the top tube and seat stays, and the other the <b>chainstay</b> and down tube. The hinges were {{in front of the}} bottom bracket and in the corresponding position in front of the saddle, fastened by wing nuts. The peg pedals could be pushed in to avoid snagging and further reduce the space occupied during transit.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the years}} bicycle {{designers}} have produced belt-driven bicycles. While these belts cannot be shifted between gears like a chain, they offer singlespeed or hub geared drivetrains with improved increased wear resistance, quieter operation, and lubrication-free cleanliness. Belts {{also do not}} change length during their lifespan {{in the same way}} that chains [...] "stretch" [...] or increase in pitch as their link pivots wear. This keeps the pitch of the belt's teeth constant and dramatically decreases wear on gear teeth. Belts have failed to overtake chains in popularity for bicycles because they have historically been less efficient. Also replacement of the one-piece belt requires traditional diamond bicycle frames to have a split <b>chainstay</b> or seatstay.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{derailleur}} {{systems were}} {{designed and built}} in the late 19th century. One example is the Protean two-speed derailleur available on the Whippet safety bicycle. The French bicycle tourist, writer and cycling promoter Paul de Vivie (1853-1930), who wrote under the name Vélocio, invented a two speed rear derailleur in 1905 which he used on forays into the Alps.Some early designs used rods to move the chain onto various gears. 1928 saw {{the introduction of the}} [...] "Super Champion Gear" [...] (or [...] "Osgear") from the company founded by champion cyclist Oscar Egg, as well as the Vittoria Margherita; both employed <b>chainstay</b> mounted 'paddles' and single lever chain tensioners mounted near or on the downtube. However, these systems, along with the rod-operated Campagnolo Cambio Corsa were eventually superseded by parallelogram derailleurs.|$|E
50|$|Touring {{bicycles}} {{may appear}} similar to road bicycles {{if they have}} drop handlebars. However, they greatly differ by typically having a longer wheelbase and more stable steering geometry, with numerous attachments for luggage racks, fenders (mudguards), lights, high capacity water bottles, tools and spare parts. <b>Chainstays</b> must be long enough to accommodate panniers without them brushing the rider's heels, and the entire structure must be stiff enough to safely handle long, fast descents with the machine fully loaded.|$|R
50|$|Zipp’s 2010 {{product line}} {{featured}} two new wheel models. The Super-9 is a flat-sided, 27.5mm disc that Zipp claims matches the Sub-9’s {{ability to generate}} forward lift, but avoids the interference issues that have occurred with the Sub-9’s bulged section on bikes with very narrow <b>chainstays.</b> The new 101 wheelset featured the first aluminum clincher rim with a fully toroidal profile and reaches a lower price point than Zipp’s carbon wheels. 2010 also saw a redesign of the 303 wheelset with claimed improvements to strength, durability, and aerodynamics.|$|R
50|$|Four-cross (4X), {{also called}} mountain-cross, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with fourcross, is a relatively new style of mountain bike racing where four bikers race downhill on a prepared, BMX like, track, simply trying to get down first. These bikes are generally either full suspension with 3 to 4 inches of travel, or hardtails, and typically have relatively strong frames. They run a chainguide on front and gears on the back. They have slack head angles, short <b>chainstays</b> and low bottom brackets for good cornering and acceleration. In recent years the tracks raced on have been rougher and less like those used in BMX.|$|R

5000|$|Bertoni was a brand {{created by}} Ben Lawee circa-1980. The frames were {{manufactured}} in Italy, sometimes mistakenly assigned to Bianchi, {{which had no}} connection to the Bertoni brand other than Ben Lawee's Bianchi imports during the 1960s. Earlier Bertonis have frame details {{that are similar to}} the Torresini-made Italvegas. The 1984 and later steel frames do not bear the typical Torresini details. These [...] "second series" [...] frames all utilized Columbus tubesets of Matrix, SL or SLX type tubing and featured Columbus [...] "short point" [...] lugs and Cinelli-type Columbus bottom brackets & semi-sloping fork crowns. Seat stay lugs were Gipiemme, brazed into the contour of the rear quarters of the seat tube lug. Other braze-ons were also Gipiemme, including the two styles of brake stay bridges used, depending on the model, and the induction-cast [...] "box arch" [...] <b>chainstay</b> bridge which was common to all steel Bertonis, {{with the exception of the}} TSX model - the frame of which was obviously the Daccordi Griffe, but with Bertoni inscriptions and decals. Dropouts were forged Columbus on the lower/mid range and Campagnolo for the upscale models. The line emphasized function over flash (except for the [...] "flash" [...] of the 'cromovelato' - thin paint over chrome - paint jobs) and received favorable press regarding overall functionality and quality, as well as the ride/handling of the steel-frame models. The line itself was fairly large, comprising nine bicycles in 1988. The range included a disc-wheeled TT bicycle and a Bador (Vitus) aluminum model.|$|E
40|$|This report discuss {{about the}} design and {{development}} of mountain bike rear suspension for all-mountain riding style. The objective {{of this study is}} to design and develop a proper geometry of rear suspension system for mountain bike, and to study the motion mechanisms of rear suspension system. This study deals with the path analysis (PA) of a wheel axle and pivot position determination for the crank set of mountain bike. The results show that the new developed rear suspension base on Monolink type have a suitable frame geometry that give a great horizontal and vertical travel for improvement of pedalling efficiency. In addition the crank set position for the Monolink rear suspension also helping for a smooth ride resulting from the less chain growth and <b>chainstay</b> lengthening. These research uses AutoCAD, Autodesk Sketch Pro and SolidWork to design and analyze the path analysis in terms of displacement of “x” and “y” axis of the developed rear suspension. The results are compared between another several types of rear suspension mechanisms...|$|E
50|$|Although many regard {{trails and}} street as being {{completely}} opposite, the attraction is similar — trails riders {{build their own}} jumps so their riding is limited only by their creativity and resourcefulness. Trails riders usually run a rear brake only as they have no use for a front brake, and usually a rotor (gyro) {{to make it easier}} to do barspins, so they do not have to spin the bars back the other way to untangle them, which is hard to do on trails. In general, trail/dirt jumping bikes have longer wheelbases (<b>chainstays)</b> than other BMXs to aid with stability, the added stability is important in trails riding.|$|R
5000|$|The framesets {{were made}} from True Temper 4130 CrMo Steel with Reynolds 531 <b>chainstays,</b> and CBC’s own CrMo fork. The frames were powdercoated to any color to order, or {{to any of the}} several {{predetermined}} models. CBC offered Sachs 3,5, and 7 speed hubs, with Sun M25 rims. A selection of handlebars, saddles, mudguards, racks, were added per customer’s specs. The headbadge was made in Middlebury, Vermont by Danforth Pewterers, by lost-wax casting method. These badges cost $10 each to produce, and were hand fitted to every frame. The factory in Chicago had a second floor loft style sales room where fabrication took place in front of customers and had a test track that customers could try the bikes out indoors.|$|R
50|$|Problems with pedal bob and brake jack {{began to}} be {{controlled}} in the early 1990s. One of the first successful full suspension bikes was designed by Mert Lawwill, a former motorcycle champion. His bike, the Gary Fisher RS-1, was released in 1992. Its rear suspension adapted the A-arm suspension design from sports car racing, {{and was the first}} four-bar linkage in mountain biking. This design reduced the twin problems of unwanted braking and pedaling input to the rear wheel, but the design wasn't flawless. Problems remained with suspension action under acceleration, and the RS-1 couldn't use traditional cantilever brakes since the rear axle, and thus rim, moved in relation to the <b>chainstays</b> and seatstays. A lightweight, powerful disc brake wasn't developed until the mid-1990s, and the disc brake used on the RS-1 was its downfall.|$|R
