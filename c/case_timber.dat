Albert Doyle was sawmilling at Cooran by 1907, and other sawmillers operating in the town prior to World War II included Renshaw and Loseby, George Renshaw, and Straker and Company. Dairy farming also grew as an industry in the Noosa Shire, and butter factories were opened at Kin Kin (1914), Cooroy (1915), Pomona (1919) and Eumundi (1920). During the 1920s the Shire boomed, and a 1926 newspaper report on a typical load of goods dispatched from Cooran by train included: bananas, beans, gooseberries, pigs, butter, <b>case</b> <b>timber</b> and log timber, cream, and opossums.|$|E

Once re-erected in 1922, the mill at Jimna was enlarged and in 1924 it was capable of turning out 80,000 super feet of sawn pine weekly. Initially the mill cut only hoop pine using steam-driven saws. In 1933 the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland reported that Jimna Mill milled approximately 23,000 feet of logs into wide boards and building timbers each day while the top logs were milled into <b>case</b> <b>timber.</b> At Brisbane the building timbers were planed on Hancock and Gore's planning machines and manufactured into all kinds of building timbers including lining boards and flooring. The case timbers were re-sawn and manufactured into butter boxes, jam cases, fruit cases, kerosene cases etc. Specially selected logs were transported to Brisbane for manufacture into [...] "Bull-dog" [...] plywood and Hancock and Gore Ltd high class joinery. Bringing timber to the mill were 15 bullock teams and 11 lorries, while five lorries delivered the sawn and seasoned timber to Kilcoy railway station for transportation to Hancock and Gore establishments in Brisbane. The record for the greatest daily output of pine was 48,000 super feet in 8 hours and for 10 hours work {{on the same day}} the cut was 64,500 super feet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Searching and {{organizing}} growing musical collections for the Algerian radio requires classifying the music signals into {{a hierarchy of}} genres to structure them. Musical genres are defined as categorical labels that auditors use to characterize pieces of music. So, a musical genre can be characterized {{by a set of}} common perceptive parameters shared by its members. These perceptive parameters are closely related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure and also harmonic content of the music. An automatic genre classification would actually be very helpful to replace or complete human genre annotation, which is actually used. In this paper, we explore the automatic genre classification of a musical Algerian database. More specifically, two feature sets composed of signal objective descriptors and which are closely related to perceptive ones (in this <b>case</b> <b>timber)</b> are proposed. The automatic classification of this database is then evaluated through an artificial neural network, more specifically a multiplayer perceptron (MLP). The parameters of this MLP are optimized to obtain the best scores in each case. We thus obtain scores of 60 % to 80 % for eight genres. Interesting comparative results are reported and commented...|$|E
40|$|For {{many kinds}} of assets, {{the growth rate of}} the real asset stock is a {{nonlinear}} function of the economic owner’s decision whether to invest or extract the asset. Examples within the economy are primarily biological assets, both privately owned (such as those found in aquaculature and agriculture) and publicly owned or regulated (such as fish stocks, and in some <b>case,</b> <b>timber</b> stocks.) Optimal exploitation of the asset necessitates thatthefuturepossiblegrowthratesintheassetmustbeconsideredwhen determining the optimal amount of extraction today. In this sense, the level of the asset is determined by the economic owner or regulator and is thus said to be endogenous. This paper considers existing methods for the valuation of these endogenous assets when observed transaction prices are lacking. In particular, we consider valuation in a near-market context, whereby the the economist can only observe income flows from the asset. This near-market approach to asset valuation is particularly important for environmental accounting when transaction prices for the asset or the right to exploit the asset are lacking. We give sufficient restrictions on the revenue and cost structure of the firm in order to permit asset valuation based on average profits. In an emprical application, we combine economic and biomass data to value the US Bering Sea crab fisheries. ∗The views expressed herein {{are those of the authors}} and not those of the Bureau o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Regarding the {{redevelopment}} of existing residential buildings the timber-concrete-compo-site (TCC) construction is an innovative possibility to toughen up timber beam ceilings. Thereby a concrete slab {{is added to}} the timber beams. Both parts of the construction are connected by using special shear connectors. In this <b>case</b> <b>timber</b> is mainly loaded in tension and concrete is generally loaded in compression. The bearing capacity as well as the serviceability of the ceiling can be improved by this composite construction. The idea of combining the construction materials timber and concrete {{in the way that they}} both can take and carry on loads is not new. In Germany it was mentioned in 1939 for the first time. The cityscape of Central European towns is mainly characterized by buildings constructed before the 50 th of the last century. The protection of the historical main structure of these buildings is getting more important today. Floors built up till that time were primarily made of timber. Research in Germany has been intensified during the last decade. This paper will show the specific properties of timber-concrete composite floors. Several metallic combing agents exist currently. Type and distance of the connection members influence the load bearing behavior of the composite construction. The main types used in Germany will be presented in this paper. The possible ways of calculating timber-concrete composite ceilings will be given and the design basis will be explained...|$|E

40|$|Using timber as a {{structural}} material for commercial projects will certainly gain importance and {{popularity in the}} coming decades as more focus is placed on reducing environmental effects created by a dependence on steel and concrete in the construction industry. Timber is a clean alternative that despite its historical use is too often overlooked by designers when they are choosing materials for ordinary commercial projects like office buildings. This thesis presents a <b>case</b> for using <b>timber</b> as the primary structural material in a medium-rise office building (up to ten stories), where currently only concrete and steel are normally used. The study accomplishes this using a custom structural design for a typical office building and exploring the structural issues that presumably prohibit timber from being used more commonly. Such issues are strength capacity, stiffness, material reliability, natural defects, area of required material, fire protection, and constructability. Addressing these issues in terms of building codes and in general comparison to steel and concrete makes up the bulk of the feasibility study. Future work essential to completing the structural <b>case</b> for <b>timber</b> is also identified, and the study concludes that timber is indeed a viable alternative material in typical office building design. The motivation behind the thesis is one based on obtaining and sharing an introduction to a material that finds little application in traditional engineering education yet will grow to play a large role in the field of structural engineering in the coming age of sustainability-minded design. by Mohsen Nasr.
