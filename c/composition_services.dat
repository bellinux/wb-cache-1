40|$|Abstract — Web <b>Service</b> <b>composition</b> {{technique}} {{provides the}} features to users {{that an individual}} web service cannot perform. There are several web services available over the web for performing different tasks. When there is no unique service capable of performing user request, {{there must be some}} way to sufficiently compose basic services to satisfy the user’s request. Now it becomes very important to determine which <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> system is the most efficient one. This paper presents the requirement for <b>service</b> <b>composition,</b> the required technologies to perform <b>service</b> <b>composition.</b> It also provides several different graph based web <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> techniques. At <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> time, the <b>composition</b> of these <b>services</b> depends on the requester’s inputs, outputs parameters and other non-functional parameters.

40|$|Nowadays, several organisations provide {{services}} on the Internet with similar functionality but different price and pricing schemes.

40|$|Abstract.

We suggest a taskbased, pervasive, semantic, and P 2 P-based approach for <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> for everyday life. We first address these fundamental characteristics. We give terminologies related to <b>service</b> <b>composition,</b> pervasive computing, ontology, and Pervasive <b>Service</b> <b>Composition.</b> Secondly, we analyze requirements for describing everyday activities.

40|$|Abstract [...] Web <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> {{is defined}} as an {{orchestration}} of multiple web services into a single composite web <b>service.</b> Web <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> is done in three ways such as static web <b>service</b> <b>composition,</b> dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition,</b> semi dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition.</b> The dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> is done on the fly. When the user gives the request the dynamic composer searches for suitable web services and it is composed accordingly. When the services composed dynamically they need to execute in different environment. The dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> leads to several faults such as poor response, incorrect order, service incompatibility, unavailability etc. If the failure occurs {{the cause of the}} failure has to be detected and healed. The healing should be done automatically. Hence this paper focuses on self-healing mechanism for dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition.</b> Self healing is a property of autonomic computing which makes the system to heal itself from the faults. This paper focuses on QoS faults. We proposed a self-healing solution for dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition</b> faults. We proposed architecture for self-healing which heals the QoS faults in dynamic web <b>service</b> <b>composition.</b> We have given procedure for our healing mechanism.

30|$|Different {{approaches}} {{are used for}} service planning. Service composition is initially applied to create composite services for various complex business requirements. Services can be considered {{the building blocks of}} what an agent can undertake at a certain time. To fulfill a goal, the agent should execute a sequence of services. Overtime, the idea is adopted by ubiquitous, pervasive computing and robotic. In order to support service <b>composition,</b> <b>services</b> come with semantic markups that describe their functionalities, properties and conditions (pre and post conditions of the service). With the semantic markup, it is much more convenient to plan, reason and monitor services, instead of relying on detailed descriptions of the functions. It endows them with capabilities of being a planning operator.|$|E
40|$|On {{building}} a service-oriented architecture for Grid systems, {{more and more}} researches have been focused on service <b>composition.</b> <b>Services,</b> however, are not always exactly compatible and much effort {{has to be addressed}} to mediate incompatible services, which is an unavoidable problem and recognized as service composition mismatches. To address it, a classification of composition mismatches is significant and helpful to divide the whole problem into different sub-problems which require corresponding mediators to deal with. However, there exist very few classification approaches specific to such problem and a comprehensive classification is still lacking. In this paper, a classification of most kinds of composition mismatches is introduced. Besides that, several basic protocol mismatch patterns are presented, which can be viewed as basic constructs of existing protocol mismatches. Finally, conclusions and the future work are drawn up...|$|E
40|$|Many {{information}} system developers face high cost in adopting service-oriented architectures {{because of the}} high cost of locating appropriate services to customise and integrate into their system. This chapter aims at reducing this cost by automating much of the composition and service selection effort. It illustrates the use of a peer-to-peer multi-agent system (MAS) to facilitate service selection with multiple quality of service properties. The system will use semantic enrichment of services in order to facilitate their identification and composition. With semantic-driven <b>composition,</b> <b>services</b> can be shared between teams of developers and across multiple organisations connected via the Internet.
