5|$|The {{division}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} logging in the Pacific Northwest. Logging companies adopted working <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those the division had, and they took advantage of new logging roads and rail lines that the division had built to access more timber.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> what existed during the earlier {{part of the}} 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|Submarine springs found {{along the}} coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula produce water with a {{naturally}} low pH (relatively high acidity) providing <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those expected to become widespread as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide. Surveys discovered multiple species of live coral that appeared to tolerate the acidity. The colonies were small and patchily distributed, and had not formed structurally complex reefs such as those that compose the nearby Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System.|$|E
50|$|Facilities using {{diamagnetism}} {{may prove}} workable for laboratories simulating low gravity conditions here on Earth. The mouse was levitated against Earth's gravity, creating a <b>condition</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> microgravity.

5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5|$|Australia having {{declared}} war on 3September 1939, the RAAF Air Board met in November to discuss Mary Bell's letter, but postponed taking any further action. Bell continued to lobby, as did various women's groups seeking to support the war effort and free male staff for overseas postings. In July 1940, the new Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, invited her to produce {{a proposal for a}} women's auxiliary, supervised by her husband John, who had rejoined the Air Force at the war's outbreak and was now a wing commander in the Directorate of Organisation at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Mary recommended forming the new service under the Air Force Act to permit women to enlist {{for the duration of the}} war under <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> RAAF members, rather than enrolling on a short-term contractual basis, a radical idea at the time which would not be put in place until 1943. She also suggested a volunteer reserve or 'citizen' force to augment the enlisted women, effectively the existing WATC, though this was seen as placing too much emphasis on her personal command. Various senior Air Force officers, including the recently promoted Air Marshal Williams, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, opposed a women's service. Burnett, an RAF member who appreciated how the WAAF proved its worth during the Battle of Britain, championed its establishment as the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).|$|E

25|$|Thinolite is {{an unusual}} form of calcium {{carbonate}} found on the shore (Greek: thinos = shore) of Mono Lake, California. This and other lakes now largely in the desert or semi-desert environments of the southwestern US {{were part of a}} larger post-glacial lake that covered much of the region {{near the end of the}} last glaciation. It is thought that at this time, <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of the Ikka fjord allowed for the growth of massive ikaite.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a cargo hold with <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> {{the conditions of}} Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated {{the air in the}} cargo hold. This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. When the door between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the passenger cabin.|$|E

25|$|Under most {{entry-level}} programs (SEI, SDI, PADI, BSAC, SSAC, NAUI, SSI, and PDIC), divers can {{complete a}} certification with {{as few as}} four open water dives. This complies with the minimum requirements of ISO 24801-2 Autonomous diver. Such a qualification allows divers to rent equipment, receive air fills, and dive without supervision to depths typically restricted to 18 meters (60 feet) with an equally qualified buddy in <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to,</b> or easier than those {{in which they were}} trained. Certification agencies advise their students to dive within the scope of their experience and training, and to extend their training to suit the conditions in which they plan to dive.|$|E
25|$|Both {{voluntary}} and compulsory {{drug treatment programs}} are provided in China, although the compulsory treatment is more common. Most addicts who attend these centers do so involuntarily upon orders from the Government. Voluntary treatment is provided at centers operated by Public Health Bureaus, but these programs are more expensive and many people cannot afford to attend them. Addicts, who return to drug use after having received treatment, and who cannot be cured by other means, may be sentenced to rehabilitation at {{any one of the}} special centers for re-education through labor. These centers are run under <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> prisons, including isolation from the outside world, restricted patient movement and a paramilitary routine.|$|E
25|$|Migrating {{butterflies}} {{often have}} smaller and lighter body sizes {{that allow them}} to fly longer distances. Additionally, these butterflies tend to have larger wing-to-body ratios. Temperatures and day length have been found to influence development. When larvae were exposed to short days and cool temperatures (20 °C), similar to conditions found in the spring, larval development was accelerated. This produced small adults with low body weights, ideal for migration. A similar phenomenon occurred when the larvae were exposed to longer days at warm temperatures (30 °C), <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those in the late summer. Seasonal changes could trigger the development of spring and fall body forms that are ideal for the migration patterns described above.|$|E

25|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that {{environmental}} enrichment was significant in aiding recovery of motor coordination and some recovery of BDNF levels in female mice with <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of Rett syndrome. Over the course of 30 weeks female mice in enriched environments showed superior ability in motor coordination to those in standard conditions. Although {{they were unable to}} have full motor capability, they were able to prevent a more severe motor deficit by living in an enriched environment. These results combined with increased levels of BDNF in the cerebellum led researchers to conclude that an enriched environment that stimulates areas of the motor cortex and areas of the cerebellum having to do with motor learning is beneficial in aiding mice with Rett syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Around 1790 dry <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> {{those of}} the late 20th century set in and {{continued}} until around 1870. After that, a very wet period set in for around 25 years, followed by a return to drier conditions. While the drying begun around 1895 and caused its first large famine only in the early 20th century, the 1820s and 1830s saw a 12 to 15-year drought and regional instances of major famine from Senegal to Chad. Historical records suggest this drought caused a large-scale emigration from the Bornu Empire, contributing to its rapid decline in the 19th century. In what is now northern Senegal, the Imamate of Futa Toro {{was struck by a}} famine caused by the failure of 1833’s rainy season, leading to waves of famine until 1837.|$|E
25|$|After World War II and the {{beginning}} of a Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, US diplomats became interested in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and frequently waged proxy wars against the Soviet Union in these countries. The US sought {{to stop the spread of}} communism. Latin American countries generally sided with the US in the Cold War period, even though they were neglected since the US's concern with communism were focused in Europe and Asia, not Latin America. Between 1946 and 1959 Latin America received only 2% of the United States foreign aid despite having poor <b>conditions</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the main recipients of The Marshall Plan. Some Latin American governments also complained of the US support in the overthrow of some nationalist governments, and intervention through the CIA. In 1947, the US Congress passed the National Security Act, which created the National Security Council in response to the United States's growing obsession with anti-communism.|$|E
