50|$|Soyuz TMA-1 disembarked from ISS on May 4, 2003 and {{immediately}} began its return to Earth, marking the first entry and descent for this Soyuz <b>class.</b> <b>A</b> technical <b>malfunction</b> caused the Soyuz control system {{to abandon the}} gentler controlled entry and descent and instead fall back to the harsher ballistic reentry and descent. This resulted in a steep and off target landing of the spacecraft. The craft landed 300 miles short of the planned area, and the crew was subjected to severe gravitational loads. Communication with the Soyuz was lost because one antenna was ripped off during descent, and two more did not deploy. The crew regained communications through an emergency transmitter after landing. Due to this event, future crews would be provided with a satellite phone to establish contact with recovery forces.|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to present a new logic of {{technical}} malfunction. The need for this logic is motivated by a simple-sounding philosophical question: Is <b>a</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> corkscrew, which fails to uncork bottles, nonetheless a corkscrew? Or in general terms, is <b>a</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> F, which fails to do what Fs do, nonetheless an F? We argue that ‘malfunctioning’ denotes the modifier <b>Malfunctioning</b> rather than <b>a</b> property, and that the answer depends on whether Malfunctioning is subsective or privative. If subsective, <b>a</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> F is <b>an</b> F; if privative, <b>a</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> F is not an F. An intensional logic is required to raise and answer the question, because modifiers operate directly on properties and not on sets or individuals. This new logic provides the formal tools to reason about technical malfunction {{by means of a}} logical analysis of the sentence “a is <b>a</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> F”.

2500|$|Equipment failure rarely causes {{fatalities}} and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a {{main parachute}} result in <b>a</b> <b>malfunction.</b> Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, {{and must be}} jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute. [...] Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of <b>an</b> unlikely main <b>malfunction</b> multiplied by the even less likely probability of <b>a</b> reserve <b>malfunction.</b> This yields <b>an</b> even smaller probability of <b>a</b> double <b>malfunction</b> although the possibility of <b>a</b> main <b>malfunction</b> that cannot be cutaway causing <b>a</b> reserve <b>malfunction</b> is <b>a</b> very real risk.|$|R
