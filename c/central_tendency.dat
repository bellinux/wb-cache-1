25|$|In statistics, {{measures}} of <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> and statistical dispersion, {{such as the}} mean, median, and standard deviation, are {{defined in terms of}} L'p metrics, and {{measures of}} <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> can be characterized as solutions to variational problems.|$|E
25|$|Core to any {{statistical}} analysis {{is the concept}} that measurements vary: they have both a <b>central</b> <b>tendency,</b> or mean, and a spread around this central value, or variance. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the standard deviation.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that some}} of these (such as median, or mid-range) are {{measures}} of <b>central</b> <b>tendency,</b> and are used as estimators for a location parameter, such as the mean of a normal distribution, while others (such as range or trimmed range) are measures of statistical dispersion, and are used as estimators of a scale parameter, such as the standard deviation of a normal distribution.|$|E

30|$|The data {{collected}} was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS®), IBM, version 22. The study population was statistically described using absolute case numbers and percentages, while <b>central</b> <b>tendencies</b> were described using means, medians, standard diviations and interquartile ranges.|$|R
25|$|The median is used {{primarily}} for skewed distributions, which it summarizes {{differently from the}} arithmetic mean. Consider the multiset { 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 14 }. The median is 2 in this case, (as is the mode), {{and it might be}} seen as a better indication of <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> (less susceptible to the exceptionally large value in data) than the arithmetic mean of 4.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{statistical}} methods {{are used in}} data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes {{the extent to which}} members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.|$|E
500|$|Brains {{are most}} simply {{compared}} {{in terms of}} their size. The relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species. As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion. In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size. For mammals, the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0.75. [...] This formula describes the <b>central</b> <b>tendency,</b> but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior. For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey, relative to body size.|$|E
40|$|Items {{that are}} rated good {{examples}} of a category have gener-ally been assumed to be highly typical as well. However, most previous studies have used categories defined by simple features in which exemplar goodness and typicality are strongly related. We report a study using categories based on the relationships between features instead of the features themselves, allowing manipulation of relational ideals inde-pendent of featural <b>central</b> <b>tendencies.</b> Goodness-of-exemplar (GOE) judgments were based on relational ideals, whereas typicality judgments {{were based on a}} mix of ideals and featu-ral <b>central</b> <b>tendencies.</b> These results indicate that exemplar goodness and typicality can lead to two distinct forms of graded category structure, and should not be treated as equivalent...|$|R
50|$|It {{has more}} {{statistical}} power than the Friedman test against the alternative {{that there is}} a difference in trend. Friedmans test considers the alternative hypothesis that the <b>central</b> <b>tendencies</b> of the observations under the n conditions are different without specifying their order.|$|R
30|$|It {{is obvious}} that ordinal and nominal scales have large {{disadvantages}} when computing additive scales. Because the relevant task domains are unevenly covered by task items, the indices regularly vary in their measures of <b>central</b> <b>tendencies</b> and variance purely by construction (see Sect.  3.3).|$|R
2500|$|Measures of <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> as {{solutions}} to variational problems ...|$|E
2500|$|Estimators {{capable of}} coping with {{outliers}} {{are said to be}} robust: the median is a robust statistic of <b>central</b> <b>tendency,</b> while the mean is not. However, the mean is generally more precise estimator.|$|E
2500|$|In {{probability}} and statistics, {{population mean}} and expected value are used synonymously {{to refer to}} one measure of the <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution. In {{the case of a}} discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together, giving [...] An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution. Not every probability distribution has a defined mean; see the Cauchy distribution for an example. Moreover, for some distributions the mean is infinite: for example, when the probability of the value [...] is [...] for n = 1, 2, 3, ....|$|E
5000|$|The {{implications}} of this effect on stereotyping have been noted. [...] Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those <b>central</b> <b>tendencies</b> or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations.|$|R

2500|$|Judgemental {{evaluation}} {{appears to}} be a collection of methods, and as such, could be considered a methodology. A common approach to obtaining PAs is by means of raters. [...] Because the raters are human, some error will always be present in the data. [...] The most common types of error are leniency errors, <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> errors, and errors resulting from the halo effect. [...] Halo effect is characterized by the tendency to rate a person who is exceptionally strong in one area higher than deserved in other areas. It is the opposite of the Horns effect, where a person is rated as lower than deserved in other areas due to an extreme deficiency in a single discipline. These errors arise predominantly from social cognition and the theory in that how we judge and evaluate other individuals in various contexts is associated with how we [...] "acquire, process, and categorize information".|$|E
2500|$|In {{descriptive}} statistics, {{the mean}} may {{be confused with}} the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may be called an [...] "average" [...] (more formally, a measure of <b>central</b> <b>tendency).</b> The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic average of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income, and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions.|$|E
2500|$|Employee-Comparison Methods: {{rather than}} {{subordinates}} being judged against pre-established criteria, they are compared with one another. [...] This method eliminates <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> and leniency errors but still allows for halo effect errors to occur. [...] The rank-order method has raters ranking subordinates from [...] "best" [...] to [...] "worst", but how truly {{good or bad}} one is on a performance dimension would be unknown. [...] The paired-comparison method requires the rater to select the two [...] "best" [...] subordinates out of a group on each dimension then rank individuals according {{to the number of}} times each subordinate was selected as one of the [...] "best". [...] The forced-distribution method is good for large groups of ratees. [...] The raters evaluate each subordinate on one or more dimensions and then place (or [...] "force-fit", if you will) each subordinate in a 5 to 7 category normal distribution. [...] The method of top-grading {{can be applied to the}} forced distribution method. [...] This method identifies the 10% lowest performing subordinates, as according to the forced distribution, and dismisses them leaving the 90% higher performing subordinates.|$|E

50|$|In statistics, a <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> (or {{measure of}} <b>central</b> <b>tendency)</b> {{is a central}} or typical value for a {{probability}} distribution. It may also be called a center or location of the distribution. Colloquially, measures of <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> are often called averages. The term <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> dates from the late 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> of a {{distribution}} is typically contrasted with its dispersion or variability; dispersion and <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> are the often characterized properties of distributions. Analysts may judge whether data {{has a strong}} or a weak <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> based on its dispersion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{measures}} of <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> are the arithmetic mean, the median and the mode. A <b>central</b> <b>tendency</b> {{can be calculated}} for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution.

We also consider the relative accuracy of the two sets of forecasts. Rationality; point forecasts; probability distributions...|$|R
30|$|EVT is {{a branch}} of {{statistics}} that deals with the statistical techniques for modelling and estimation of rare events.
