If the boundary layer is thin compared to the radius of curvature of the wall, the pressure remains constant across the boundary layer.

The effects of curvature {{and the resulting}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>instabilities</b> on local heat transfer distributions are studied in a curved channel at Dean numbers ranging from 50 to 200.

40|$|International audienceLinear {{stability}} of the Stuart vortices {{in the presence of}} an axial flow is studied. The local stability equations derived by Lifschitz & Hameiri (Phys. Fluids A, vol. 3 (11), 1991, pp. 2644 – 2651) are rewritten for a three-component (3 C) two-dimensional (2 D) base flow represented by a 2 D streamfunction and an axial velocity that {{is a function of the}} streamfunction. We show that the local perturbations that describe an eigenmode of the flow should have wavevectors that are periodic upon their evolution around helical flow trajectories that are themselves periodic once projected on a plane perpendicular to the axial direction. Integrating the amplitude equations around periodic trajectories for wavevectors that are also periodic, it is found that the elliptic and hyperbolic instabilities, which are present without the axial velocity, disappear beyond a threshold value for the axial velocity strength. Furthermore, a threshold axial velocity strength, above which a new <b>centrifugal</b> <b>instability</b> branch is present, is identified. A heuristic criterion, which reduces to the Leibovich & Stewartson criterion in the limit of an axisymmetric vortex, for <b>centrifugal</b> <b>instability</b> in a non-axisymmetric vortex with an axial flow is then proposed.

Turbulent flows are furthermore {{known to be}} dominated by small- and large-scale vortex structures. Owing to the wide range of applications, knowledge of conditions under which a given vortex becomes unstable is beneficial. Here, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>instability</b> of two-dimensional, non-axisymmetric vortices in the presence of an axial flow (w) and a background rotation (Ω_z) is studied using the local stability approach. The local stability approach, based on geometric optics and similar in formulation to the rapid distortion theory bib:godeferd 2001, considers the evolution of shortwavelength perturbations along streamlines in the base flow. This approach, developed by Lifschitz & Hameiri bib:lifschitz 1991, is particularly useful for base flows for which a global stability analysis is computationally expensive. A sufficient criterion for <b>centrifugal</b> <b>instability</b> in an axisymmetric vortex with (w) and (Ω_z) is first derived by analytically solving the local stability equations for wave vectors that are periodic upon evolution around a closed streamline. This criterion is then heuristically extended to non-axisymmetric vortices and written in terms of integral quantities on a streamline.
