5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on <b>chocks</b> on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E

The two cutters were situated immediately aft of the bridge, one to port and the other to starboard. While Titanic was at sea they were positioned outboard so that they could be lowered instantly in the event of an emergency, such as needing to rescue a person who had fallen overboard. The lifeboats were assigned odd numbers on the starboard side and even numbers on the port side, running from forward to aft, while the collapsible lifeboats were lettered A to D.|$|E
2500|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} the first officer {{had been unable to}} find all the control <b>chocks</b> {{normally}} used to lock the control surfaces on the aircraft while it was parked. [...] There were concerns that one of the aircraft's control <b>chocks</b> might have been left in position instead of being removed before takeoff. The inquiry heard that all <b>chocks</b> were eventually accounted for. There was also a concern that one of the aileron <b>chocks</b> might have been inadvertently inserted in the elevator circuit. [...] Chief Inspector James Harper told the inquiry that he made some test flights in a DC-3 aircraft in a similar configuration to the Fitzroy on the accident flight. [...] One test showed that the DC-3 could be flown satisfactorily even with an aileron chock in the elevator circuit.

40|$|Transportation {{safety of}} {{supercritical}} CO 2 pipeline {{is a key}} aspect of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS). For reducing the high pressure in supercritical pipeline when accidental cases arise, man-made release will be applied using <b>chocking</b> process. The downstream parameters of <b>chocking</b> process can be predicted based on the adiabatic process assumption. In the critical <b>chocking</b> process, the critical velocity at outlet is sonic. A <b>chocking</b> pipe can be designed for buffering between different <b>chocking</b> orifices according to the length of turbulence area produced by jetting momentum. For the effect of noise hazard produced by large jetting velocity, a muffler can be applied at the outlet of final stage orifice to atmosphere. For the influence of impurities on the <b>chocking</b> process of anthropogenic CO 2 pipeline, the presence of SO 2 as an impurity is helpful for increasing the downstream temperatures through the <b>chocking</b> device to prevent the frozen hazard, whereas the presence of N 2 as an impurity indicates a lower downstream temperature. The higher initial temperature can prevent the dry ice formation at the outlet of vent pipe when the multistage <b>chocking</b> is applied...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{important}} to know which wheels are providing the braking action when lifting the car with a jack. [...] Usually the rear wheels are stopped with parking brakes. Most Citroens, the Alfasud, Saab 99s, Pre-Facelift 900s, and most early Subarus applied the handbrake force to the front wheels, which makes them notable exceptions. If one lifts the braking wheels off the ground then the car can move and fall off the jack. This is the reason manufacturers recommend jacking be conducted on level ground and with <b>chocks</b> immobilizing the wheels that will remain on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting highway freight {{trailers}} on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included wheel <b>chocks</b> and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|E

[...] On the morning after the accident an MMA apprentice found the missing elevator chock on the tarmac close to where VH-MME was positioned for an engine test run the previous afternoon. The investigators carried out a flight test on a DC-3 to determine what effect, if any, was caused by installing an aileron chock on the elevator. [...] They found there was no effect and the presence of the chock did not prevent the pilot having full control of the elevator.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of optimum <b>chock</b> (support) capacity is very crucial {{for a successful}} longwall mining. The {{selection of}} <b>chock</b> capacity depends on the site-specific geotechnical parameters, constraints and longwall panel geometry, which are generally not known in detail in priority. Hence, based {{on the field and}} laboratory data, various possible combinations should be analyzed to cater for the unforeseeable mining conditions. This paper discusses the use of numerical model for selecting an appropriate <b>chock</b> capacity based on the site-specific geological and geotechnical information and longwall panel geometry. The fracture mechanisms of immediate and main roofs are also discussed for various panel widths and support capacities. For the models considered, the <b>chock</b> convergence is predicted to increase by about 33 % due to the increase in face width from 100 to 260 m. Similarly, the massive roof strata are found to yield higher <b>chock</b> convergence compared to bedded strata...|$|R

2500|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{immediately}} {{appointed a}} panel of two to investigate the accident. Examination of the wreckage showed that the flaps and undercarriage were retracted and both engines had been producing high power {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] All trim tabs were in typical positions for takeoff and all control cable runs were intact. [...] Nothing was found in the wreckage to indicate any prior defect or failure that might have caused the aircraft to crash or the pilot to lose control. [...] The setting of the automatic pilot could not be determined due to destruction of the forward fuselage. The investigation initially focussed on possible failure to remove one of the flight control <b>chocks,</b> defective flight instruments, misuse of the wing flaps, structural failure of the tailplane, defective elevator control system, misuse of the automatic pilot, and incorrect loading.|$|E
2500|$|Most climbers {{choose to}} wear {{specialized}} rubber climbing shoes {{which are often}} of a smaller size than their normal street shoes {{in order to improve}} sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage. [...] Climbing chalk (MgCO3) is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use protection. The most basic protective equipment is a climbing rope. Climbing [...] would attach the rope to themselves; {{in the event of a}} fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized harnesses, carabiners which are used for clipping into belay and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and belay devices which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of bolts with the use of quickdraws led to the rise of sport climbing. Traditional climbers developed the spring-loaded camming device, which increased safety over <b>chocks,</b> hexes, and pitons. Some climbers choose to wear a specialized climbing helmet to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.|$|E

From the <b>chocks</b> it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp-- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.|$|E

That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.|$|E
