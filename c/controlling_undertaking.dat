40|$|An {{alternative}} to theories positing visual or phonological deficits, the “cognitive dysmetria” hypothesis proposes the aetiology of dyslexia {{to take the}} form of a general functional coordination deficit or cognitive dysmetria. The term “dysmetria ” describes a general impairment in the temporal correlation of brain activity. The purpose of the current research was to investigate the empirical basis for this idea in an experimental task designed to measure simultaneity thresholds. Twenty children diagnosed with developmental dyslexia, alongside twenty, age and IQ matched <b>controls,</b> <b>undertook</b> a series of threshold determination procedures designed to measure the location of simultaneity thresholds in time and the influence of subthreshold synchrony upon perceived simultaneity. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in simultaneity thresholds for dyslexics in comparison to controls, indicating no evidence of a cognitive dysmetria. Dyslexic readers did perform significantly differently to controls on the experimental task. The results are discussed with reference to weak synchronisation and extended visual persistence in dyslexia. The possibility that the results might indicate a temporal processing deficit is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} whether an accumulated brisk walking programme, performed during the school day, is effective in changing body composition in primary school children aged 5 – 11 years. Altogether, 152 participants (79 boys and 73 girls) took part in this repeated-measures intervention study, divided into groups of walkers and controls. The walkers took part in the intervention during school time, which involved brisk walking around the school grounds for 15 min in the morning and afternoon, at least three times a week for 15 weeks. This represented an additional 90 min of moderate physical activity per week. The <b>controls</b> <b>undertook</b> their usual school day activities. Pre- and post-intervention anthropometric and body composition measures were taken. Body fat (− 1. 95 ± 2. 6 %) and fat mass (− 0. 49 ± 1. 0 kg) were significantly reduced in the walkers after the intervention, whereas the controls showed no significant changes in these measures. Our results show that regular accumulated bouts of brisk walking during the school day can positively affect body composition in primary school children...|$|R
