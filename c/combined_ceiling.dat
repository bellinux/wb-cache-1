The system uses a new ceiling air outlet concept, which allows for simultaneous supply of air and further functions like e. g. lighting or acoustic damping in future applications. Six different ventilation scenarios, among them mixing ventilation, cabin displacement ventilation, ceiling based displacement as well as <b>combined</b> <b>ceiling</b> and floor based dis-placement ventilation were studied and compared. Passenger thermal dummies were used to simulate ex-perimentally {{the impact of the}} passengers under real conditions. Flow velocities, fluid temperatures and sur-face temperatures were measured in the cabin, including the vicinity of the passenger dummies. This data was used to determine integral quantities like the temperature difference between cabin air and incoming air, the heat removal efficiency, the mean temperature stratification and the mean velocity levels in order to analyze and score the ventilation scenarios. A combined operation of the floor and ceiling based displacement ventilation system can ensure at once high heat removal efficiencies as well as predictably comfortable flow conditions...|$|E

To validate the computational fluid dynamics simulations, temperature, air velocity and CO 2 concentration were measured and compared. The simulation results of various combinations of ceiling and floor-based air distribution systems show that the exhaust should be located above the occupant and the window in summer; due to the large thermal plume as heat sources that could be generated by {{the window and the}} occupant. Whereas in winter, the supply should be located on the ceiling far from the window and the exhaust should be positioned on the floor near the occupant; as the downward airflow around the cold window surface would become more dominant when compared to the upward airflow associated with any other heat sources.

The results indicate that a chilled-ceiling system combined with desiccant cooling could save up to 30 %o of primary energy consumption and would result in 40 % more annual hours in the comfort zone of relative humidity, compared to a conventional constant volume all-air system. The results also indicate that starting the dehumidification and ventilation system prior to the operation of ceiling panels is required to reduce condensation risks in hot and humid climates.

The modeling {{results show that the}} air flows in the attics are steady and exhibit a general streamline pattern that is qualitatively insensitive to the investigated variations of roof pitch and ceiling insulation. Furthermore, it is predicted that the ceiling insulation plays a control role on the attic cooling load and that an increase of roof pitch from 3 / 12 to 8 / 12 results in a decrease in the cooling load by around 9 % in the investigated cases. The results suggest that the increase of roof pitch alone, without changing other design parameters, has limited impact on attics cooling load and airflow pattern. The research results also suggest both the predicted ventilating mass flow rate and attic cooling load can be satisfactorily correlated by simple relationships in terms of appropriately defined Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers...|$|R

The author focuses on the implicit taxation of financial assets through seigniorage, reserve requirements, lending targets, and interest <b>ceilings</b> <b>combined</b> with inflation. The last instrument has often been overlooked, but it has generated {{more than a third}} of implicit revenues in some cases by lowering the cost of government borrowing. Tax revenues are difficult to measure because of regulations that prevent the use of market prices for computation and distort the meaning of some definitions. For some countries, the standard method of seigniorage grossly underestimates the revenue from financial taxation. The author discusses various sources of distortion but ignores potential impacts on the level of saving and the growth rate. Although taxes on financial assets have a low administrative cost, the excess burden that stems from the misallocation of resources is probably a much higher fraction of revenues than that of other taxes.

40|$|The largest {{potential}} for decreasing green house gas emissions, and therewith mitigating {{the effects of}} global climate change, comes from improving energy efficiency. Through the integration of heating and cooling systems into building elements, such as the thermo-active ceiling, improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved. Utilizing thermal mass to buffer temperature variations and to level out peak loads reduces the instantaneous power demands and enables traditional cooling equipment to operate in temperature ranges with higher coefficients of performance. Additional savings in both energy and money can be obtained {{through the use of}} free cooling, especially in northern climates. As the coolant temperature in a thermoactive ceiling approaches room temperature, the cooling potential of outdoor ambient air increases. This temperature difference enables free cooling at the mere cost of blowing outdoor air through a heat exchanger.

40|$|The airflow {{pattern and}} {{contaminant}} distribution under non-isothermal turbulent flow conditions in a swine growing/finishing building were investigated experimentally and numerically. In the test facility, the ventilation system consisted of discontinuous ceiling inlets with recirculation assisted slots. Air speed, dust and ammonia concentration at selected locations in the-building were measured {{during the winter}} ventilation season in a cold climate. The corresponding temperature distribution at one cross section within the air space also was measured. Experimentally {{it was found that}} both the ventilation rate and the recirculation rate had a limited effect on the dust concentration. The ventilation rate had a significant effect on the ammonia concentration in the air space, while the recirculation rate did not affect the ammonia concentration. The FLUENT computer code was used to simulate the air flow pattern and ammonia concentration in the swine building. The numerical simulation model used was the k-ε turbulence model which includes a buoyancy term. The predicted airflow pattern indicated that the flow structure in such a ventilated swine barn is a three-dimensional flow. The three-dimensional flow structure and the contaminant concentration and temperature at the human breathing line were highly affected by the <b>combined</b> behavior of <b>ceiling</b> inlet jets and recirculation slot jets. The presence of pigs in the swine building had three effects: the air stream near the pigs was deflected; the air speed above the pigs was increased; and the ammonia concentration in the air space was decreased. Both experimental and numerical results showed that temperature and ammonia concentration were uniformly distributed across most of the air space in a building ventilated with discontinuous ceiling inlets and recirculation slots. Numerical results also indicated that the heat generated by animals affected the airflow pattern. Increasing the heat load at the floor resulted in increased air speed, temperature, contamination level, turbulence kinetic energy, dissipation rate and effective viscosity along the breathing line. The placement of the ceiling inlet and the recirculation duct affected airflow patterns, but had only a slight effect on the distribution of temperature and ammonia concentration along the human breathing line. Increasing the flow rate of cleaned recirculation airflow resulted in lower ammonia contaminant level along the human breathing line. However, higher flow rates of cleaned recirculation air means there will be higher fan operation and air cleaning costs.

50|$|Control of {{building}} design {{was transferred to}} the Department of Public Works in 1893 and the department's architects trialled a number of technical innovations. Queensland's education architecture became markedly more advanced and the range of standard building types increased. The most noticeable change in Queensland school architecture was the introduction of high-set buildings. This provided better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play space underneath. Also, windows were rearranged and enlarged and sills were lowered to approximately 1m above floor level. By 1909 windows were altered so that the maximum amount of light came from one direction and desks were rearranged so that this light fell onto the left hand side of students. Since students were forcedly right-handed, no shadow would be cast onto the page. The wall supporting the blackboard had no windows. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing older buildings. Dormers were sometimes added to the roof to provide better light and ventilation and the larger classrooms favoured in earlier designs were partitioned to create smaller ones with better lighting. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists. A technical innovation developed at this time was a continuous ventilation flap on the wall at floor level. This hinged board could be opened to increase air flow into the space and, <b>combined</b> with a <b>ceiling</b> vent and large roof fleche, improved internal air quality and decreased internal temperatures effectively. This type was introduced around 1909 and was constructed until approximately 1920. Significantly, Dr Eleanor Bourne was appointed the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911 and under her instruction the relationship between classroom environment and child health was given prominence. Accordingly, school architecture evolved through iteration and experimentation to improve interior light and ventilation.Such design innovations were included in a new building for the Boys' School at Bowen, constructed in 1917 {{to the west of the}} 1884 boys' building. Called the Big Room, it was a high-set timber building with a gable roof and a northerly and southerly verandah. It had a large number of windows in the gable end walls with sill heights approximately 1m from floor level. It incorporated a hinged board, ceiling vent, and large roof fleche for ventilation. The roof fleche was removed at some time prior to 2006. This building survives and in 2012 is named Block C.In 1919 an Honour Board memorialising 70 past students who served in World War I was installed in the Big Room and unveiled by the mayor in the presence of a crowded audience. The board took the form of a Grecian temple facade decorated to represent marble. It was claimed to be the largest in a North Queensland school, measuring 5 ft 6in wide by 6 ft high (1.67m x 1.82m). This board was moved to the Bowen Historical Museum some time after its installation although no evidence has been discovered as to when or why it was moved.|$|R

The evolution of thermal comfort conditions, using the PMV index, is made by the multi-nodal human thermal comfort model. In this numerical model, that works in transient or steady-state conditions and simulates simultaneously a group of persons, the three-dimensional body is divided in 24 cylindrical and 1 spherical elements. Each element is divided in four parts (core, muscle, fat and skin), sub-divided in several layers, and protected by several clothing layers. This numerical model is divided in six parts: human body thermal system, clothing thermal system, integral equations resolution system, thermoregulatory system, heat exchange between {{the body and the}} environment and thermal comfort evaluation. Seven different radiant systems are combined to three convective environments. In the radiant systems (1) no radiant system without warmed curtain, (2) no radiant system with warmed curtain, (3) radiant floors cooling system with warmed curtain, (4) radiant panels cooling system with warmed curtain, (5) radiant ceiling cooling system with warmed curtain, (6) radiant floor and panels cooling system with warmed curtain and (7) radiant ceiling and panels cooling system with warmed curtain are analysed, while in the convective environments (1) without air velocity field and with uniform air velocity field of (2) 0. 2 m/s and (3) 0. 6 m/s are also analysed. The internal air temperature and internal surfaces temperature are 28 degrees C, the radiant cooling surfaces temperature are 19 degrees C and the warmed internal curtains surfaces temperatures, subjected to direct solar radiation, are 40 degrees C. The numerical model calculates the Mean Radiant Temperature field, the human bodies' temperatures field and the thermal comfort level, for the 25 occupants, for the 21 analysed situations. Without uniform air velocity field, when only one individual radiant cooling system is used, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people is lowest when the radiant floor cooling system is applied and is highest when the radiant panel cooling system is applied. When are <b>combined</b> the radiant <b>ceiling</b> or the floor cooling systems with the radiant panel cooling system the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people decreases. When the uniform air velocity increases the thermal comfort level, that the occupants are subjected, increases. When the radiant floor cooling system or the combination of radiant floor and panel cooling systems without uniform air velocity field is applied, the Category C is verified for some occupants. However, with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 2 m/s the Category B is verified and with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 6 m/s the Category A is verify for some occupants.

The supply flow rate from the LCB could be adjusted by the occupant within the range of 10 L/s to 13 L/s by means of a desk-mounted knob. The integration of mixing ventilation (MV) system and chilled ceiling panels was the second ventilating and cooling strategy. Twenty- four subjects (12 female and 12 male) were exposed to different indoor environment established by two cooling systems. Each experiment session lasted 120 min and consisted of 30 min acclimatization period and 90 min exposure period. The performance of the systems was identified and compared by physical measurements of the generated environment and the response of the human subjects. The study showed that perceived air quality (PAQ), overall thermal sensation (OTS) acceptability and local thermal sensation (LTS) acceptability clearly improved inside the micro-environment by using LCBCC system. Moreover, at the main workstation, OTS and LTS votes were close to “neutral” thermal sensation (ASHRAE seven point scale) when LCBCC system was used. However, OTS and LTS votes increased to the “slightly warm” side of the scale by applying CCMV system which implied the better cooling performance of the LCBCC system. Acceptability of work environment apparently increased under the room condition generated by LCBCC system. In agreement with human subjective study, the results from physical measurements and thermal manikin study showed that uniform thermal condition was generated all over the room. Air and operative temperature distribution was almost uniform with no difference higher than 1 °C between the measured locations in the room. Thus, both LCBCC and CCMV systems performed equally well outside of the micro-environment region. The use of the chilled ceiling had impact on the airflow interaction in the room and changed the airflow pattern. It can be concluded that the combination of convective and radiative systems can be considered as an efficient strategy to generate acceptable thermal condition in rooms...|$|R
