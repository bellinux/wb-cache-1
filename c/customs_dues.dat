25|$|Between 1384 and 1496, {{a letter}} in the localities of Freixial, Murça and Abreiro obligated the {{transfer}} of <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> {{to the construction of}} the new castle. But, in order to quicken the construction these funds were supported by the church funds. In 1443, the regent Peter funnelled the taxes from Freixiel, Abreiro and Vilarinho da Castanheira to support the repair of the walls of the castle.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} twentieth century Assab would become Ethiopia's main port, but it was long overshadowed by nearby Djibouti, whose railway (completed to DireDawa in 1902) {{permitted}} it to quickly supplant traditional caravan-based routes to Assab and Zeila. Massawa remained the primary port for most of northern Ethiopia, but its relatively high <b>customs</b> <b>dues,</b> dependence on caravans, and political antagonism limited the volume on its trade with Ethiopia.|$|E
25|$|Before 1878 {{the silver}} Russian ruble was valued so highly as {{to drive the}} native coins out of circulation. Consequently, in 1889, Romania {{unilaterally}} joined the Latin Monetary Union and adopted a gold standard. Silver coins were legal tender only up to 50 lei. All taxes and <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> were to be paid in gold and, owing to the small quantities issued from the Romanian mint, foreign gold coins were current, especially French 20-franc pieces (equal at par to 20 lei), Turkish gold lire (22.70), old Russian imperials (20.60) and British sovereigns (25.22).|$|E
2500|$|In 1637, the Surveyor General of Customs {{issued a}} report {{compiled}} from accounts of <b>customs</b> <b>due</b> from each port and their [...] "subsidiary creeks".

25|$|The Main Guard was a civic {{building}} until 1810 when it {{was converted}} to shops. During recent restoration, some of its sandstone columns {{were found to have}} been 'reclaimed' from the now demolished abbey of Inislounaght at Marlfield. It has been used in the past as a Tholsel or office to collect tolls, duties and <b>customs</b> <b>dues,</b> a place for civic gatherings and as a court. It now houses an exhibition showing the historic development of Clonmel, including a model of the town as it appeared in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Limites did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.|$|E
2500|$|Wingate's {{second term}} as consul was {{relatively}} uneventful and lasted only until October when he again contracted malaria. [...] The only major event {{came when the}} citizens of the town of Sur refused to pay their customs duties. [...] In order to coerce the town into payment, Wingate sent a detachment of 50 soldiers with machine guns to the town. [...] Under the cover of darkness, the soldiers landed on the narrow spit of land connecting Sur to the mainland, cutting the town off from its water supply. [...] The people of the town made no attempt to resist militarily and after two days without water, they paid the <b>customs</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{bank was}} {{instrumental}} in providing British loans to the Shah between 1892 and 1911. These loans were secured using Caspian fisheries and the <b>custom</b> <b>dues</b> of the Persian Golf ports and raised the alarm of the Persian nationalists.|$|R

6000|$|Under {{our present}} system we should want none, nor {{would we have}} any, were it not that <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> must be paid in coin {{and because of the}} pledge to pay {{interest}} on the public debt in coin. The yield of precious metals would flow out for the purchase of foreign productions and the United States [...] "hewers of wood and drawers of water," [...] because of wiser legislation on the subject of finance by the nations with whom we have dealings.

60|$|But Natalians {{have got}} other dangers to fear besides those {{arising from the}} {{presence}} of this vast mass of barbarism in their midst. After a period of anarchy a new king may possess himself of the throne of Zululand, and it is even possible that he might, under circumstances that will arise hereafter, lead his armies into Natal, and create a difficulty with which the 1500 available white men would find it difficult to cope. Or the Boers of the Orange Free State and Transvaal may get tired of paying <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> at Durban, and march 5000 men down to take possession of the port! Perhaps Natal might provide herself with an effective force by enrolling an army of 10,000 or 20,000 Kafirs, {{but it seems to me}} that the proceeding would be both uncertain and expensive, and, should the army take it into its head to mutiny, very dangerous to boot.|$|E
6000|$|It may, perhaps, {{be asked}} why the silver dollar of 412-½ grains, [...] being worth {{intrinsically}} only from 86 to 89 cents, does not [...] depreciate to that value. The Government buys the silver, owns the [...] coin, and holds all {{that it can not}} induce the public to receive [...] voluntarily; so that but a part of the total coinage is out of the [...] Treasury. And most of the coins issued are returned for deposit [...] and silver certificates received in return. There being no free [...] coinage, and no greater amount in circulation than satisfies the [...] demand for change, instead of small bills, the dollar-pieces will [...] circulate at their full value, on the principle of subsidiary [...] coin, even though overvalued. And the silver certificates [...] practically go through a process of constant redemption by being [...] received for <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> equally with gold. When they become too [...] great in quantity to be needed for such purposes, then we may look [...] for the depreciation with good reason.(240) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{town was}} one of the two urban {{communities}} developed by the London Companies in County Londonderry in the Plantation of Ulster {{at the start of the}} 17th century. The slightly skewed street pattern of Coleraine's town centre is legacy of that early exercise in town planning, along with traces of the lines of the ramparts that provided the Plantation town with its defences. In 1637 the Surveyor General of Customs issued a report compiled from accounts of <b>customs</b> <b>due</b> from each port and their [...] "subsidiary creeks".

6000|$|The only {{suggestion}} that I have yet seen {{as regards the}} arrangements for the future defence of the colony should it become independent, is a somewhat ominous one, namely:--that Natal should enter into a close alliance, offensive and defensive, with the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. But, as the advocates of [...] "freedom" [...] would soon find, the Orange Free State (for even if willing to help them, the Transvaal will for some years have enough {{to do with its}} own affairs) will not come forward for nothing. There would first have to be a few business formalities with reference to the <b>customs</b> <b>dues</b> collected in Durban, on goods passing through to the interior, which yield the bulk of the Natal revenue: and possibly, some concessions to Boer public opinion as regards the English mode of dealing with the Natal natives. I incline to the opinion that in relying on the assistance of the Boers in time of trouble the inhabitants of Natal would be leaning on a broken reed. They are more likely to find them in arms against them than fighting on their side.|$|E
