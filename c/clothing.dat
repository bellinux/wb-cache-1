5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used <b>clothing</b> between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on <b>clothing</b> and feed on the body. Because body lice require <b>clothing</b> to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of <b>clothing</b> in human evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|Chinese Ming style <b>clothing</b> {{was forced}} on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser <b>clothing</b> of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing {{tradition}} was worn by the Vietnamese.

The Chinese <b>clothing</b> in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty <b>clothing</b> was referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong).

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial <b>clothing</b> out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new <b>clothing</b> had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial <b>clothing</b> contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse.
