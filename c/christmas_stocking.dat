2500|$|The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his <b>Christmas</b> <b>stocking.</b> The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in the bustle of Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the velveteen rabbit he once loved.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Christmas</b> <b>stocking</b> is {{an empty}} sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Christmas Eve so that Santa Claus (or Father Christmas) can {{fill it with}} small toys, candy, fruit, coins or other small gifts when he arrives.

In some Christmas stories, the contents of the <b>Christmas</b> <b>stocking</b> are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus; in other stories (and in tradition), some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree. Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece or pile of coal. However, coal is rarely if ever left in a stocking, as it is considered cruel.

5000|$|Don't Spurn “Cow Palace"Almost {{ever since}} the Panama Pacific International Exposition twenty years ago San Francisco {{has been talking about}} holding an annual {{livestock}} show. It has made a few attempts in temporary quarters. For the past few years agitation has been quite active until now there is a possibility of establishing a million-dollar stock show plant in Visitacion Valley. Instead of doing what they can toward accomplishing this worthy enterprise {{there seems to be a}} determined effort on the part of many misguided souls to decry what they call a “cow palace.” Some of the San Francisco newspapers have been most sarcastic in their reference to the “million-dollar cow palace” and now comes the Bureau of Governmental Research with a blast that San Francisco’s appropriation of $250,000 is illegal because some of the ground upon which the money is to be spent lies outside the city limits. That part is all bosh. San Francisco has expended plenty in San Mateo county, the most recent investment of prominence being the new county jail. It is too bad that such a selfish attitude should be taken toward this most worthy project to which the state is committed to add another $250,000, the Federal government $199,000 immediately and later stretch it to an even million. That is a better proposition than many other cities have even been offered when they came to lay out an agricultural exposition grounds. The great stock shows like the International at Chicago, the Kansas City Royal, the Pacific Coast International at Portland and of late the <b>Christmas</b> fat <b>stock</b> show in Los Angeles and even the junior stock show at South San Francisco all have proven their worth many times over to the cities in which they are held. They bring country dollars to town as well as pry loose some of the local money that comes out for a different type of amusement. The great good that is done for the livestock industry, which in turn is for the ultimate benefit of the consumer, warrants every support that the city interests can give. Instead of spoofing the “million dollar cow palace” the city papers and organizations should get behind it 100 per cent. It will mean new business for them, afford pleasure and education to the city dwellers and provide the farmers and growers with the medium through which encouragement is given better products of the farm, field and range.Sausalito News, Number 27, 5 July 1935 ...|$|R
