5000|$|The {{building}} {{design of the}} reactor differs: Bruce uses a squarish [...] "close-in" [...] design, in which {{as much of the}} equipment as possible is arranged outside the main <b>containment</b> <b>envelope</b> for easier access during maintenance and emergencies. The steam generators penetrate the containment. The primary coolant pumps and primary piping systems are inside the containment enclosure, but the pump motors are outside containment and the drive shaft seals form the containment boundary. Pickering has round domes which enclose much of the secondary cooling equipment.|$|E

As safety standards improve and permitted operator dose uptake reduces, so the total containment {{of the high}} force compactor equipment will become obligatory, particularly when dealing with alpha contaminated materials. Entering such primary containment with drums of waste is already an accepted discipline, employing double airlock door systems to prevent the release of airborne particulate from the <b>containment</b> <b>envelope.</b> The external surfaces of the drums entering the system are radiologically clean and, therefore, present minimal threat to the operators. During the compaction process, the drums of radioactive material become contaminated, as does the equipment and interior surfaces of the containment. Currently, the only satisfactory developed procedure for transferring these contaminated pucks from the primary <b>containment</b> <b>envelope</b> is the high cost 500 litre overpack drum system and bagless transfer process. Reducing the volume of waste and, therefore, the cost for disposal is largely negated by {{the need for the}} expensive overpack system. This review investigates the possibility of designing a cost effective but safe alternative transfer procedure. The safe bag change system for alpha contaminated HFC pucks addresses the present shortfall in wast...|$|E
