40|$|The rapid {{build-up}} of debt by Irish households {{over the}} past decade has attracted attention to all aspects of personal borrowing. While most of the increase in personal debt has come from residential mortgages, the ease with which debt can be run up on credit cards makes trends in credit card borrowing of particular interest. The Statistics Department introduced a new and expanded monthly return for credit card issuers in early 2004; data from this return are now available and are analysed in this article. Trends in total personal borrowing and consumer credit relative to personal disposable income are also presented, to provide a broader context for the discussion of credit card debt. While credit card debt now accounts for a higher proportion of consumer credit than it did a decade ago, this has taken place in the context of greater use of cards for <b>convenience</b> <b>credit.</b> Measures of competition and profitability in the Irish credit card market show that competition has increased since a previous study in 1999 and that margins on credit card business have narrowed as a result. While market penetration here is above the euro-area average, international comparisons reveal that it is well below that of countries like Finland, the UK and the US. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the level of financial satisfaction of the family money manager in relation to socioeconomic characteristics, attitudes towards credit, and credit practices. The population was members of the USU Community Credit Union. Data were collected with a mail survey questionnaire from {{a random sample of}} 500 subjects. After multiple follow-up attempts, the response rate was 55. 2 percent. The dependent variable was financial satisfaction; the independent variables were categorized into three groups: socioeconomic characteristics, credit attitudes, and credit practices. The conceptual model of this study hypothesized that there is a relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Age, education, home value, household income, and savings were positively related to financial satisfaction. Those who felt comfortable with larger amounts of credit payment were associated with higher income levels and higher satisfaction levels. People with favorable attitudes toward borrowing money to pay for houses {{were more likely to be}} satisfied with their financial conditions. <b>Convenience</b> <b>credit</b> card users were more satisfied than installment users. Higher debt repayment-to-income ratios were associated with lower levels of financial satisfaction. Respondents 2 ̆ 7 feeling about their credit obligations was the most powerful predictor of financial satisfaction; people who were concerned about their credit obligations were likely to be less satisfied with their financial situations that those who were not. Concern over credit obligations was not highly related to socioeconomic characteristics or debt repayment-to- income ratio. Accordingly, the subjective assessment of credit obligations was more important in explaining financial satisfaction than the objective measurement of family debt burden such as debt repayment-to-income ratio. Fifty-two percent of the variation in financial satisfaction was accounted for by socioeconomic characteristics, credit attitudes, and credit practices. Credit practices were more powerful predictors of financial satisfaction than socioeconomic characteristics. This result illustrates the importance of credit management as a contributing factor in financial satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} the RN to BSN student's perceptions about what they need from curricula and the faculty to meet their educational goals. In addition, the study looked at the relationship between student identified needs and those identified by the faculty in regard to the RN to BSN curriculum. Evidence was collected using three focus group interviews with RN to BSN students and three focus group interviews with faculty who teach in RN to BSN programs. The number of participants in faculty focus group totaled 13 while participants in student focus groups totaled 16 participants. Individual follow-up interviews were conducted with participants from five of the six focus groups. A total of 50 concepts and a total of 20 subcategories were identified as significant {{as a result of the}} student data analysis. Seven themes emerged from the data analysis: 1) reasons for seeking BSN degrees (personal reasons, job advancement or maintenance, bridge to graduate school); 2) curricular content (nursing research, nursing leadership/management, health assessment, politics, computer technology, and general education); 3) curricular outcomes (professionalism, professional self-esteem, critical thinking); 4) institutional factors (advising and admissions processes, separation from traditional BSN students); 5) teaching methodologies (discussion, sharing, student presentations); 6) adult learning principles (self-direction, choices, peer learning, respect for experience); and 7) accommodations (acknowledgement for multiple roles, <b>convenience,</b> flexibility, <b>credit</b> for previous work, choices, physical environment).

40|$|Household {{surveys are}} the source {{of some of the most}} widely studied data on {{consumer}} balance sheets, with the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) generally cited as the leading source of wealth data for the United States. At the same time, recent research questions survey respondents' propensity and ability to report debt characteristics accurately. We compare household debt as reported by borrowers to the SCF with household debt as reported by lenders to Equifax using the new FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel (CCP). Moments of the borrower and lender debt distributions are compared by year, age of household head, household size, and region of the country, in total and across five standard debt categories. The debt reports are strikingly similar, with one noteworthyexception: the aggregate credit card debt implied by SCF borrowers' reports is less than 50 percent of the aggregate credit card debt implied by CCP lenders' reports. Adjustmentsfor sample representativeness and for small business and <b>convenience</b> uses of <b>credit</b> cards raise SCF credit card debt to somewhere between 52 and 66 percent of the CCP figure. Despite the credit card debt mismatch, bankruptcy history is reported comparably in the borrower and lender sources, indicating that not all stigmatized consumer behaviors are underreported...|$|R

40|$|The micro finance policy, {{regulatory}} and supervisory framework released by Central bank of Nigeria (CBN 2005) {{has put the}} accountants, managers and players in the microfinance sector in Nigeria on gear so as to meet the requirement for minimum capital base, increased profit performance, better liquidity position, increased volume of deposits and effective customer’s service delivery. The main thrust of the policy frame work was to purvey credit {{to the poor and}} the low income group. However the recent CBN report (2011) on poor performance of MFBs has put the capacity of the banks on enquiry as to micro credit delivery. The extent to which the SMEs have benefited from the credit scheme of MFBs has not received much attention in the literature. The study attempted to evaluate the <b>convenience</b> at obtaining <b>credit,</b> adequacy of the credit supplied relative to demand, timeliness of credit to operation, and cost of credit as a component of total overhead to selected SMEs located in Osun state of Nigeria. Data were collected through Questionnaire administered on SMEs as well as the annual reports and accounts of the selected MFBs. Analysis of the data and hypotheses tested showed positive and significant relationship between microcredit delivery service of selected MFBs and SMEs performance. However most MFBs seem to be competing with the commercial banks in universal banking rather than the microfinance banking they were purposely established to undertake. This manifested in the hesitation of credit to SMEs for fear of repayment. The study is expected to be useful to policy makers and players in the micro finance sub sectors of the economy...|$|R
40|$|Banks, banking regulators, and {{community}} organizations have spent nearly thirty years interpreting and re-interpreting the simple but ambiguous {{mandate of the}} Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The statute imposes an affirmative duty requiring 2 ̆ 2 regulated financial institutions to have continuing [...] . obligations to help meet the credit needs of the local communities {{in which they are}} chartered. 2 ̆ 2 The CRA was met with much resistance and lax enforcement for almost a decade. Active protest from community groups, a more defined CRA exam, and innovative, profitable lending strategies, have resulted in a dramatic increase in community reinvestment dollar commitments and in loans to low- and moderate-income (LMI) and minority households. Banks have accepted reinvestment as a means of meeting the <b>convenience</b> and <b>credit</b> needs of communities and preventing urban deterioration. Yet, implementation and enforcement of the CRA remain problematic. The increase in lending has created another trouble - less vigorous and less qualitative enforcement. In an era of potentially lessened accountability due to almost laissez-faire enforcement, the CRA can benefit from increased use of regulatory enforcement powers and from more standardized performance reports. The CRA is designed to make lending institutions more accountable to the communities they affect. By definition, accountability requires banks to have some input from constituent communities. Measuring the CRA 2 ̆ 7 s efficacy according to outcome - that is, the real improvement of physical infrastructures, maintenance of social and economic stability, and the actual influx of credit and investment capital into communities - is desirable. The dilemma presented when balancing community participation and inclusiveness while preserving as much autonomy as possible for financial institutions {{is the subject of this}} article. Part I discusses the CRA 2 ̆ 7 s explicit and implicit objectives. Part II discusses the CRA 2 ̆ 7 s evaluative tools: the traditional three-part test and the strategic CRA plan. The three-part test measures a bank 2 ̆ 7 s actual performance in service, investment, and lending. As an optional way to comply with the CRA, the strategic CRA plan envisions that lenders will seek community input in setting five-year CRA objectives. The strategic plan brings to the forefront the conflict and pressure that banks experience when community groups organize to halt an institution 2 ̆ 7 s merger or expansion plans based on past CRA performance. Part III discusses the potential pitfalls that can be produced by the CRA 2 ̆ 7 s obligations. Such obligations, if not carefully crafted, could limit the flow of capital into communities even from banks that are willing to reinvest. Efforts to increase capital must be paired with sensitivity to a community 2 ̆ 7 s redevelopment concerns. Vocal communities that are able to determine their sustainable economic need must have the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the funding process. The conflict between allowing communities to participate in shaping the bank 2 ̆ 7 s funding commitments and requiring a bank to pledge its financial support in advance is discussed in Part III. Part IV discusses the definition and role of community participation and outlines various ways that communities can be better included in a bank 2 ̆ 7 s reinvestment process. The section concludes with a suggestion of factors to use in evaluating the level of community participation and inclusiveness. Part V discusses the importance of the strategic plan option to community participation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of {{consumer}} credit by teenagers in Klamath Falls, Oregon. Data for the study were obtained from a questionnaire administered to junior and senior students in Klamath Union and Henely High Schools. Of the 295 questionnaires administered, 285 were tabulated and analyzed. The following hypotheses were tested: 1. There is no relationship between the use of teenage consumer credit and: (a) sex, (b) age of parents, (c) residence, (d) amount of weekly spending, and (e) income of parents. The following parts of hypothesis one: (a) sex, (b) age of parents, (c) residence were accepted; but parts: (d) amount of weekly spending, and (e) income of parents were rejected. 2. Items purchased with credit by male teenagers do not differ from those purchased with credit by female teenagers. This hypothesis was rejected. Of the 285 teenagers, 157 were males and 128 were females. One hundred seven were credit users and 178 were noncredit users. Sixty-four males and 43 females reported using credit. Seventy-one percent of the credit users and 88 percent of the noncredit users had 10 or less to spend weekly. The primary source of their income was from earnings outside of the home. Forty-four percent of the credit users and 26 percent of the noncredit users reported earning 500 or more from summer employment. Fifty-five percent of the credit users and 43 percent of the noncredit users saved 100 or more of their summer employment earnings. Fifty-three percent of the 285 teenagers indicated the annual income of their parent ranged from 5, 000 to 14, 999. The credit users came from families with higher incomes than the noncredit users. Twenty-two percent of the credit users and only six percent of the noncredit users reported annual incomes of over 15, 000. Twenty-nine of the 107 credit users reported having a charge account in their own name. Seventeen of these 29 teenagers reported they had only one account. The main reason given for opening an account was to make buying easier. The most common type of credit used by the teenagers was credit cards in their parents' name. Seventy-two percent of the teenage credit users reported using this type of credit. Oil company cards and department store cards were the kinds more often used. Also under the parents' name, 28 percent had used 30 -day charge accounts, 21 percent installment credit and 20 percent revolving credit. Under the teenagers' own name, both 30 -day charge accounts and installment credit were used by 20 percent. Twenty males and nine females reported having charge accounts in their own name. Gasoline and clothes were the main items purchased with credit. The males reported 73 percent purchasing gasoline, 52 percent purchasing clothes, and 23 percent making car purchases with credit. Clothing was the item most females purchased with credit. Eighty- eight percent purchased clothes and 63 percent purchased gasoline. About one-half of the teenagers reported the largest amount they had charged at one time was 50 or less. The males charged larger amounts than the females. Over 50 percent of the males and only 19 percent of the females had charged over 76 at one time. Only 37 percent of the teenage credit users were required by their parents to pay for all of their credit purchases. Twenty-three percent were not required to pay for any of their credit purchases. Thirty-two percent were required to pay part of the debt. The teenagers enjoyed the <b>convenience</b> of using <b>credit</b> but they disliked paying for the interest and the purchase, and the danger of overspending...|$|R
