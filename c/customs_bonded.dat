50|$|Many {{intermediaries}} {{exist to}} assure product quality or to hold stocks until needed by retailers who often have limited storage and retail space; they also help smaller retailers avoid issues like <b>customs</b> <b>bonding</b> {{and the need}} to secure an import license. The distributor sells large quantities of clothing stocks to a reseller, who tries to charge sufficient mark-ups to cover his costs and still make a profit. Often the supply chain will include more than one intermediary, although retailers usually strive for the fewest middlemen and lowest prices. Since the emergence of the Internet, many retailers have begun using it for just this purpose, and many new online-only wholesalers have emerged as a result. Nowadays, many websites offer this opportunity.|$|R
50|$|The {{partition}} of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Donegal {{into an international}} frontier. This changed trade patterns to the railways' detriment and placed border posts on the Joint Committee's FV and S&L lines and on the GNR line to Derry. Stops for customs inspections greatly delayed trains and disrupted timekeeping. Over {{the next few years}} customs agreements between the two states enabled GNR trains between Strabane and Derry to pass through the Free State without inspection unless they were scheduled to serve local stations on {{the west bank of the}} Foyle, and for goods on all railways to be carried between different parts of the Free State to pass through Northern Ireland under <b>customs</b> <b>bond.</b> The Joint Committee's Strabane-Derry line was closed in 1954, followed by the remainder of the narrow gauge system in 1960. In 1958 the Ulster Transport Authority took over the remaining GNR lines on the Northern Ireland side of the border. In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the former GNR line through Strabane to Derry in 1965.|$|R

40|$|Current thermosonic {{flip chip}} bonding {{technologies}} are adversely affected by chip-to-substrate co-planarity errors and bump/pad height variations {{which can lead to}} uneven bonding strength and, in extreme cases, chip cratering. This has limited the industrial uptake of thermosonic flip chip assembly. The aim of the research reported here was to explore the use of laser-generated ultrasound as an alternative ultrasound source in {{flip chip bonding}}. The research was motivated by the idea that, with greater control over the distribution of ultrasonic energy applied over the bonding interface, {{it should be possible to}} compensate for and mitigate the above effects. The main objective of this research work was to establish a working flip-chip bonding process using laser induced ultrasonic vibration. Initially, a literature review on current flip-chip bonding methods and laser ultrasonic methods was carried out. This suggested that confined laser ablation would be the most appropriate technique for generating strong ultrasonic vibration. Next, through modelling and simulation, an investigation was carried out to determine the suitable parameters and methods to be implemented during the experimental stage, including the pressure pulse amplitude, cavity width (irradiance spot size) and type of sacrificial material. Additional investigations were also carried out to explore the effect of applying different materials in generating ultrasonic vibration and also to show the effect of applying multiple pressure pulses simultaneously. In the experimental phase, a <b>custom</b> <b>bonding</b> rig was developed and used to explore the parameter space for thermosonic bonding on polymer substrates using ultrasound generated by a diode-pumped solid-state laser (355 nm wavelength). Initial experiments showed unstable bond strength due to the accumulation of heat which resulted in the appearance of an unwanted glue-like substance at the bonding interface. However, this issue was overcome through careful choice of process parameters combined with the introduction of off-axis laser irradiation. A process for bonding dummy test chips to flexible substrates was successfully established, and in the best case a die shear strength of 9. 3 gf/bump was achieved. Open Acces...|$|R
5000|$|International {{ocean freight}} {{forwarders}} arranging for shipments {{to and from}} the US must be licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries. An Ocean Transportation Intermediary is either an ocean freight forwarder or a non-vessel-operating common carrier (NVOCC). An ocean freight forwarder is [...] "an individual or company in the United States that dispatches shipments from the United States via common carriers and books or otherwise arranges space for those shipments on behalf of shippers; ocean freight forwarders prepare and process documentation and perform related activities pertaining to shipments." [...] An NVOCC is [...] "a common carrier that holds itself out to the public to provide ocean transportation, issues its own bills of lading or equivalent documents, but does not operate the vessels that transport cargo"; or, [...] "a shipper in its relationship with the vessel-operating common carrier involved in the movement of cargo." [...] Companies may obtain both licenses and may act in both capacities. The U.S. legal distinction between the two is that a freight forwarder acts as the agent of a principal (typically a shipper or consignee) whereas the NVOCC is a transportation company (carrier) that is physically responsible for the carriage of goods and acts as its own principal. Companies acting strictly as an Ocean Freight Forwarder typically do not issue their own contract of carriage (bill of lading) and as agent are generally not liable for physical loss or damage to cargo except in cases of errors in judgment or paperwork or fiduciary responsibility. NVOCC s act as ocean freight carrier and issue their own bill of lading and are legally responsible for physical loss or damage in accordance with the terms and conditions of their bill of lading and tariff. Similar to other countries, freight forwarders that handle international air freight frequently obtain accreditation with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a cargo agent; however, they must obtain an Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) certification from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
