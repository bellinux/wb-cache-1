5|$|Michel's plan to {{sell his}} camera to the Swiss Army failed, as {{he was unable to}} find a {{manufacturer}} to produce it in quantity; only about 100 of his <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> constructed. After the outbreak of the Second World War Michel patented a shell and harness for the transport of items such as film rolls by carrier pigeon. Between 2002 and 2007 three of his <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> auctioned by Christie's in London.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, NASA {{announced}} the flight would carry a small television camera to broadcast {{live from the}} Command Module. The camera would {{also be used to}} allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecraft's instrument panel in flight. Television <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> carried aboard all manned Apollo missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve road safety, traffic <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> first {{introduced}} to Canberra by the Carnell Government in 1999. The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red-light and speed cameras and point-to-point speed cameras; together they bring in revenue of approximately $11million per year in fines.|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> identical in every respect. The left <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated {{as a master}} while the right <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated as a slave but this distinction is merely {{the result of the}} way the outputs from the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> treated by the video concentrator.|$|R
50|$|Intermittent motion <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} {{hundreds}} of frames per second. Rotating prism <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> capable of thousands of frames per second. Rotating mirror <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> capable of millions of frames per second.|$|R
50|$|Remote <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{most widely}} used in sports photography. 35mm digital or film, and medium format <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> the most common types of <b>cameras</b> that <b>are</b> used.|$|R
5|$|The Javelins were {{transferred}} {{away from the}} route shortly prior to Stagecoach's sale of the operation to Transdev, and the service was briefly operated with 15-year-old Leyland Olympians. In July 2001 a fleet of 15 new Volvo B7TLs, which included improved interiors and CCTV <b>cameras,</b> <b>were</b> introduced to the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{cameras on}} the top of each kiosk's tablet posed a concern in some {{communities}} where these cameras face the interiors of buildings. However, , the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> not activated.|$|E
5|$|Despite the War Ministry's {{position}} {{immediately after}} the First World War, in 1932 {{it was reported that}} the German army was training pigeons for photography, and that the German pigeon <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, the French claimed that they had developed film cameras for pigeons as well as a method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by trained dogs.|$|E
50|$|The main (rear-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 8MP, {{while the}} {{secondary}} (front-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 5MP <b>camera.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gun <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> <b>cameras</b> used {{primarily}} in aircraft to help measure tactical effectiveness. These <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{triggered by the}} firing of a weapon, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|A press <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{a medium}} or large format view <b>camera</b> that <b>was</b> {{predominantly}} used by press photographers {{in the early}} to mid-20th century. It was largely replaced for press photography by 35mm film cameras in the 1960s, and subsequently, by digital cameras. The quintessential press <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> the Speed Graphic. Press <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> still used as portable and rugged view cameras.|$|R
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} the IPCC, said on 9 April {{that there were no}} CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After {{photographs}} of the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in Threadneedle Street near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.|$|E
5|$|Omaha Police {{arrived at}} Westroads Mall about six minutes after {{receiving}} the first 911 call. During the entire 70 seconds of that first call, all the dispatcher heard was gunshots. Audio tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls, along with images captured by mall security surveillance <b>cameras,</b> <b>were</b> released by the police on December 7, 2007. In one 911 call, gunshots can be heard.|$|E
5000|$|A folding <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a <b>camera</b> type. Folding cameras fold into {{a compact}} and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are {{attached}} to a lens-board which {{is connected to the}} body of the camera by a light-tight folding bellows. When the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of folding <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> folded for storage.|$|R
50|$|The main (rear-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 13 MP {{autofocus}} {{camera with}} 0.25s autofocus while the secondary (front-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 3.7 MP camera.|$|R
30|$|Video <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{present in}} many parts of our daily lives. In {{surveillance}} applications they are used to monitor train stations, airports, or public places in cities [1]. Enforcement applications and traffic monitoring [2] are another application area where <b>camera</b> systems <b>are</b> frequently used. In all those applications multiple, spatially distributed <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> used to cover large areas. But the deployment of <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> no longer limited to public places. An example where <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> installed in private environments is assisted living. Elderly people are monitored in their homes to detect unusual behavior such as the collapse of persons [3].|$|R
5|$|The Beatles {{made their}} last {{official}} live appearance in Britain on 1 May 1966, at the NME Annual Poll-Winners' All-Star Concert at the Empire Pool, Wembley Park. Although the concert was televised, the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> switched off while the Beatles played, because Brian Epstein and ABC TV {{had failed to}} agree over terms. They were filmed receiving their awards, however.|$|E
5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
50|$|Some special {{models of}} color <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> only capable of {{outputting}} raw digital image data. Such <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> called ColorRAW or Bayer <b>cameras.</b> They <b>are</b> {{often used in}} industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science. In form of photo <b>cameras,</b> they <b>are</b> used by professional photographers. Semi-professional photo cameras often offer an optional RAW mode.|$|R
40|$|An atomic {{infrared}} (IR) streak <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{demonstrated that}} operates in the mid- and far-infrared (λ = 5 - 85 μm), {{well beyond the}} long wavelength cutoff of conventional streak cameras. The temporal and spectral characteristics of the streak <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> determined using the FELIX free-electron laser as the IR light source. The temporal resolution of the streak <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> found to be as short as 1. 2 ps. The high sensitivity of the streak <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated by single-shot characterization of the IR pulses of FELIX...|$|R
5000|$|Each phone has {{a camera}} and both front and back <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> available. Front <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> 5 {{megapixel}}. A 13 megapixel <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> also available on rear side. Many powerful feature are also active. 3GB ram and 16GB phone memory are available. Proximity Sensor, Light Sensors, Gravity, Accelerometer, Orientation {{are a few of}} the sensors available.|$|R
5|$|Alongside the {{twinning}} of the skyway, the QEW was widened {{to eight}} lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway2) in Burlington, and to six lanes {{north to the}} Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs and traffic <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> added {{to create a new}} traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built {{at the same time to}} relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.|$|E
5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E
5|$|Majority of Nartanasala {{portions}} were {{filmed in}} the sets erected at Vauhini and Bharani studios in Madras (now Chennai). All the musical instruments {{used in the}} film were borrowed from the Madras Sangeetha Vidyalaya. The war sequences in the climax portion were filmed at Gudur, a town in Andhra Pradesh; two <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> simultaneously used to film the scenes. For the Gograhana (retrieving the kidnapped cows) episode, five thousand animals were brought {{with the help of}} Gogineni Venkateswara Rao. Nartanasala was produced on a budget of 400,000 with a runtime of 174 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|While some {{disposables}} {{contain an}} actual cartridge as used for loading normal, reusable cameras, others {{just have the}} film wound internally on an open spool. The whole <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> handed in for processing. Some of the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> recycled, i.e. refilled with film and resold. The <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> returned for [...] "processing" [...] {{in the same fashion}} as film cameras.|$|R
30|$|Normally, {{the target}} of CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> people, therefore, the average height of humans is adopted as the target height. The {{corresponding}} parameter of the Revit <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> “target elevation”.|$|R
50|$|In general usage, this rear <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{used to take}} higher-resolution images, {{whereas the}} front-facing <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> used for lower-resolution {{face-to-face}} conversations with other users using the FaceTime communication platform.|$|R
5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at night, because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable. Bakshi recounts that during {{the first day of}} shooting, the actors were unable to play their roles naturally, but began casually talking and acting the way he wanted their characters to act when the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> off, including flirting with an actress. However, the camera man was not around to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A. Fraker about this, Fraker quit the production, and was replaced by a young cinematographer who had never worked in film before.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 7, 1988 {{with a budget}} of $15 million. Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the production team filmed a church being burned down. The sequence required a multiple-camera setup; {{a total of three}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> used during the shoot. On March 8, the production team filmed a scene set in a motel where Anderson (Hackman) delivers a monologue to Ward (Dafoe). On March 10, production moved to a remote corner of Mississippi, where the crew filmed the burning of a parish church.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{indicated}} that Holloway {{did not appear}} on any nighttime surveillance camera footage of her hotel's lobby; however, Twitty has made varying statements {{as to whether the}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> operational that night. According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by Twitty, the video cameras at the Holiday Inn were not functioning the night Holloway vanished. Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book. Police Commissioner Jan van der Straaten —the initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement— said that Holloway did not {{have to go through the}} lobby to return to her room.|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of the}} NACA high-speed <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> completely explained. This camera, operating {{at the rate of}} 40, 000 photographs per second, took the photographs presented in numerous NACA reports concerning combustion, preignition, and knock in the spark-ignition engine. Many design details are presented and discussed, details of an entirely conventional nature are omitted. The inherent aberrations of the <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> discussed and partly evaluated. The focal-plane-shutter effect of the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> explained. Photographs of the <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> presented. Some high-speed motion pictures of familiar objects [...] photoflash bulb, firecrackers, <b>camera</b> shutter [...] <b>are</b> reproduced as an illustration {{of the quality of the}} photographs taken by the camera...|$|R
30|$|After {{determining}} world coordinates, the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{registered to}} obtain the camera matrix, namely focal length of camera, optical center, and radial distortion parameters of image. Therefore, <b>camera</b> labeling <b>is</b> required. In the work, the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> labeled by Yang and Patras [31] {{to obtain the}} camera matrix.|$|R
50|$|The SSWF {{has been}} {{included}} in all Olympus, Panasonic, and Leica Four Thirds DSLRs, and is often cited as a key advantage of the system by reviewers and users. One disadvantage to the implementation on all current Four Thirds <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> that the SSWF is triggered whenever the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> turned on, causing a delay of about 0.8 seconds before the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> ready to shoot.|$|R
