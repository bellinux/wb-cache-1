Some approaches center {{on the question of}} compliance: why states follow international norms {{in the absence of a}} <b>coercitive</b> power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international law norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature; while other perspectives are policy oriented: they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing norms and to make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic legal theory, some are interdisciplinary, and others have been developed expressly to analyse international law. Classical approaches to International legal theory are the Natural law, the Eclectic and the Legal positivism schools of thought.|$|E

This happened under the impulse of Henri Adan, {{the director of the}} Royale Belge, a Belgian insurance company. In the speech he gave on the first meeting of the board, Adan strongly expressed his faith in private initiative instead of state interference:Comme le disait M. Westerroiien van Mesteren, le promoteur de l'Association Néerlandaise pour prévenir les accidents dans les fabriques et chantiers, il est de la plus haute importance pour un petit pays de se joindre au mouvement international qui permet à l'initiative privée de l'industriel, de faire le bien sans qu'une loi <b>coercitive</b> lui prescrive ce devoir et le rende odieux.Cette appréciation trouvait particulièrement application en notre pays; il était impossible que nos traditions de liberté nous permissent d'hésiter entre un régime coercitif et les enseignements d'un régime libre.Of course, as described in the previous section of this article, the Belgian state would introduce legislation concerning the safety of the workplace only ten years later, slightly undermining the pure laissez-faire philosophy enunciated here. Thus, later presidents of the Association such as Yvon Verwilst would rather claim (in 1940) that AIB is [...] "le corollaire de celle de pouvoirs publics et qu'elle se considérait comme l'auxiliaire de ceux-ci" [...] This switch in rhetoric between claiming to anticipate the state and merely serving it as a supplement, is a constant in AIB's speeches up to 1940.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{differential}} strategies employed by Canadian print and broadcast media with respect to reporting of mental illness. Specifically, we analyse media coverage in newspaper articles and television news broadcasts of two separate, violent events that occurred in July 2008, involving racialized persons with lived experience of mental illness. We follow these events over a 3 -year period across the national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation news network to examine the role of media in constructing ideas and images about mental health issues and persons with lived experience of mental illness. our work is situated within {{a growing body of}} literature on media and mental illness which has, to date, demonstrated both challenges to, and perpetuation of, stigmatization and discrimination against persons with lived experience of mental illness. the role of the media in constructing negative images of mentally ill people and perpetuating stigmatization has been drawn into increasingly sharp focus since the 1950 s. avast body of empirical evidence has grown in support of the notion that media coverage of mental illness is most often negative, inaccurate, and stigmatizing towards persons with lived experience of mental illness. Nunnally (1957; 1962) {{was one of the first}} researchers to systematically demonstrate the many inaccuracies and negative portrayals of mental illness that exist across various forms of media. to date, a range of media effects and audience reception studies have produced similar findings, lending credence to idea that media sensationalize and stereotype experiences of mental illness (Matas et al, 1986; Day & Page, 1986; Wahl, 1995; Philo et al, 1996; Wilson et al, 1999; rose, 1998; olstead, 2002; nairn & Coverdale, 2005; Corrigan et al, 2005; nairn, Stuart, 2006). in a 2001 review of the literature, Francis et al. concluded that media portrayals are overwhelmingly negative, that media authors consistently link together violence and mental illness, and that media promote negative stereotypes about persons with mental illness. representations of mental illness in mainstream media often link together mental illness with an alleged propensity for violence, criminality, and unpredictability. Blood and Holland (2004 : 330) point out that media stories are often organized in ways that "resonate with previous public understandings of the mentally ill as violent, unpredictable and as dangerous others" and note that individual news items are framed around "community fear, danger, and unpredictability. " the content and frequency of such representations are of grave concern because they risk misrepresenting the potential for criminal violence among persons with mental illness and, consequently, contribute to the stigmatization and avoidance of persons with lived experience of mental illness (Philo, 1996; rose, 1998; olstead, 2002; Sampietro, 2010). in turn, Cutcliffe and Hannigan (2001) point out that negative attitudes toward mental illness may lead to mental health policies that involve increasingly coercive treatment (in law and health care), and efforts to protect the public rather than invest in community mental health. negative effects of media-fuelled moral panic and discrimination against persons with mental illness also extend to employment, education, housing, and ultimately to people's beliefs in and support for recovery or rehabilitation (link et al 2001). news media, in particular, have consequently been under increasing scrutiny by mental health service users, survivors, and their families and advocates to review their standards of practice and to provide accurate and ethical reporting of mental illness (Patterson 1994; Montgomery 1989; Wahl 1995; Brawley and Martinez-Brawley 2003; Pirkis et al. 2006). nGos, research centers and ad-hoc commissions have sought to provide guidelines and codes of practice, and to create public forums for monitoring media messages. in the Canadian context within which our analyses are situated, the recently formed Mental Health Commission of Canada (2007) launched a nation-wide anti-stigma campaign (the opening Minds initiative) to combat stigma at multiple societal levels. recently, researchers have reported some positive changes in media coverage of mental illness, in part thanks to anti-stigma initiatives (Stuart 2003; Francis et al. 2004; Henson et al. 2010). in this paper, we employ a discourse analytic approach to examine the differential strategies employed by Canadian media authors with respect to reporting of mental illness. our interest in this work emerged from our current participation in an ongoing major research study funded by the Mental Health Commission of Canada, which involves the coding and analysis of Canadian print and broadcast media representations of mental illness from 2005 to 2012. We selected two events for analysis that occurred within close proximity to each other -during the month of July 2011 - and received extensive and recurrent coverage until at least July 2011 (the last month for which we conducted our analyses). Both cases involve immigrant men from east asia who committed aberrant acts for which they were eventually judged not criminally responsible; the first individual, Vincent li, beheaded a stranger on a Greyhound bus, and the second man, narin Sok, killed his wife. the nearly simultaneous occurrence of these events, the similarly abhorrent nature of the acts committed, and their ongoing media coverage facilitated our comparisons of their representational trajectories (changes in the nature of how they are depicted and discussed over time) within Canadian news media. a range of questions guide our analyses of these cases: How did print and broadcast media formats differ in their constructions of these stories? What strategies of communication were most salient in print versus broadcast media coverage of the events? What discursive practices were adopted by journalists to represent the dyad of criminality and mental illness? How was race, as a social construct, employed within media discourses in relation to mental illness and criminality? our discourse analytic approach engages with these questions at multiple levels of media production, interpretation, and reception to investigate: (a) patterns and regularities in textual content; (b) broader themes and discursive practices, and (c) the larger socio-cultural context in which such content is situated and produced (Fairclough, 2001). We draw on lull's (2000) three zones of indeterminacy to suggest that comparisons of the two events across both print and broadcast news media formats provides a broader, polysemic canvas for interpretation and analysis. Procès de la maladie mentale :une analyse critique et comparativede la couverture médiatique dominante sur la maladie mentale, l'ethnicité et le crime au canada (2008 - 2011) Cet article examine les stratégies différentielles employées par les journaux et autres médias Canadiens dans les différents reportages sur la maladie mentale. Plus spécifiquement, cette analyse porte sur les rapports médiatiques écrits et télévisés au sujet de deux évènements violents survenus en 2008, lesquels impliquaient des personnes racialisées aux prises avec une maladie mentale. nous avons examiné une fenêtre de trois ans du réseau Canadian Broadcasting Corporation afin de mieux comprendre le rôle des médias d'information dans le façonnement des perceptions du public au sujet de la maladie mentale et des personnes qui en sont affectées. notre travail fait partie d'une littérature croissante qui se penche sur les médias et la maladie mentale, laquelle littérature a démontré la récurrence et les défis associés aux phénomènes de stigmatisation et de discrimination. xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office " / > Le rôle des médias dans la représentation péjorative des personnes atteintes de maladies mentales perpétue la stigmatisation et ce, de façon notoire depuis les années 1950. Un large éventail de preuves empiriques tend à démontrer que les reportages médiatiques sur la maladie mentale sont souvent négatifs, erronés et néfastes pour les personnes en souffrant. nunnally (1957; 1962) fut l'un des premiers chercheurs à démontrer de façon systématique les nombreuses erreurs et les à-priori souvent négatifs contenus dans les rapports médiatiques. À ce jour, de nombreuses études sur le conditionnement des auditoires ont reproduit des résultats similaires, démontrant ainsi que les médias propagent et accentuent les stéréotypes au sujet de la maladie mentale (Matas et al, 1986; Day & Page, 1986; Wahl, 1995; Philo et al, 1996; Wilson et al, 1999; rose, 1998; olstead, 2002; nairn & Coverdale, 2005; Corrigan et al, 2005; nairn, Stuart, 2006). Dans un recensement de la littérature pertinente fait en 2001, Francis et al. ont conclu que les représentations médiatiques sont majoritairement négatives, que les journalistes associent constamment la violence et la maladie mentale, et que les média tendent à promouvoir des stéréotypes péjoratifs envers les gens vivant avec une maladie mentale. les représentations médiatiques dominantes établissent souvent des liens entre la maladie mentale et une propension à la violence, à la criminalité et à l'imprévisibilité. Blood et Holland (2004 : 330) soulignent que les reportages médiatiques sont fréquemment conçus de façon à ''perpétuer l'idée populaire à l'effet que la personne atteinte d'une maladie mentale est violente, imprévisible et dangereuse '' et également, ils notent que ces bulletins d'information ont comme thèmes sous-jacents ''la peur collective, le danger et l'imprévisibilité''. le contenu et la fréquence de telles nouvelles ont de sérieuses répercussions puisqu'il y a risque de fausse représentation du potentiel violent et criminel des individus atteints de troubles mentaux, ce qui contribue conséquemment à la stigmatisation et à la discrimination de ces personnes (Philo, 1996; rose, 1998; Guillen, 2009; olstead, 2002). Quant à Cutcliffe et Hannigan (2001), ils remarquent que tous ces clichés négatifs peuvent induire des politiques en santé mentale misant davantage sur des approches <b>coercitives</b> (sanitaires et juridiques) et sur des mesures de protection publique plutôt que sur de réels investissements en soins de santé mentale. les effets néfastes de la torpeur morale et de la discrimination issus de reportages biaisés ont des répercussions sur l'employabilité, sur l'éducation et sur le logement des personnes concernées et, ultimement, ils conditionnent les attitudes de la société envers la réhabilitation et le rétablissement (link et al 2001). les couvertures médiatiques ont conséquemment été examinés par les services de santé mentale, leurs usagers, les gens en rétablissement et leurs familles, afin de revoir les normes journalistiques dans le but de générer une information véridique et éthique de la maladie mentale (Patterson 1994; Montgomery 1989; Wahl 1995; Brawley and Martinez-Brawley; Pirkis et al. 2006). Divers onG, centres de recherches et commissions d'enquêtes se sont penché sur le sujet afin d'une part de proposer des lignes de conduite qui encadrent les normes journalistiques et afin, d'autre part, de créer des forums publics visant à analyser les contenus médiatiques. Dans le contexte Canadien où se situe cette présente analyse, la Commission de la Santé Mentale du Canada (créée en 2007) a inauguré une campagne nationale anti-stigmatisation (The Opening Mind Initiative) afin de contrer ce phénomène observé à divers niveaux sociaux. Dernièrement, des chercheurs ont noté des changements positifs dans la couverture médiatique de la maladie mentale, en partie grâce à ces initiatives anti discriminatoires (Stuart 2003; Francis et al. 2004; Henson et al. 2010). Dans cet article, nous employons une approche analytique pour examiner les stratégies différentielles employées par les journalistes canadiens dans leurs reportages sur les maladies mentales. notre intérêt pour ce travail est issu de notre actuelle participation à une recherche d'envergure financée par la Commission de la Santé Mentale du Canada, laquelle inclut la codification et l'analyse des articles et télédiffusions au sujet de la maladie mentale entre les années 2005 et 2012. nous avons sélectionné pour cette analyse deux évènements qui ont eu lieu en juillet 2008 et qui ont attiré une abondante couverture médiatique qui s'est prolongée jusqu'en juillet 2011 (le dernier mois est inclut dans l'analyse). Ces deux cas impliquent des hommes émigrés de l'asie de l'est. Ces derniers ont commis des actes grotesques pour lesquels ils ont été jugés non criminellement responsables. le premier individu, Vincent li, a tranché la tête d'un homme à bord d'un autobus Greyhound alors que le second, narin Sok, a tué sa femme. la coïncidence de ces occurrences presque simultanées, la commune aberrance de leurs actes et l'étendue de la couverture de presse ont contribué à l'analyse comparative des trajectoires médiatiques canadiennes à leur sujet (c. à. d. l'évolution dans le temps du portrait et des discussions médiatiques). Une série de question guide notre analyse de ces deux cas : Comment la présentation médiatique diffère-t-elle entre la presse écrite et la presse audio-visuelle ? Quelles ont été les principales caractéristiques des stratégies de communication écrites et audio-visuelles ? Comment les journalistes ont-ils discouru au sujet du lien entre la criminalité et la maladie mentale et selon quelles lignes de conduite? Comment l'ethnicité, en tant que déterminant social, a-t-elle été abordée en lien avec la criminalité et la maladie mentale? notre analyse discursive s'intéresse à ces questions (précédentes) à divers niveaux de la production, de l'interprétation et de la réception médiatique afin d'investiguer : a) les modèles et les tendances des contenus textuels, b) les grands thèmes sous-jacents et les pratiques discursives, c) le contexte socio culturel global au sein duquel ces textes sont situés et produits (Fairclough, 2000). Nous puisons dans les trois zones indéterminées de Lull's (2002) afin de suggérer qu'une comparaison des couvertures médiatiques écrites et audio-visuelles (de ces deux cas) offre une toile d'interprétation et d'analyse qui soit englobante et polysémique...|$|R

The movement of the critical curves in the Preisach plane in constant and variable magnetic field processes is taken into consideration in respect with the results of the simulations using a model with the master equation distributed in the Preisach plane. Using this model we have simulated in-field and remanent magnetization curves and the deltaM curves...|$|E

But not everyone is competent – for we know that voters are often ignorant, irrational, and morally unreasonable. Universal suffrage thus violates what Brennan names the Competence Principle: it is unjust to impose <b>coercitive</b> decisions on innocent people when these decisions are incompetent. Brennan therefore claims {{that we have a}} «right to a competent electorate». After having presented Brennan's argument in more detail, the paper adresses one critical question: can an electorate be considered as a collective intentional agent? If not, an electorate cannot have duties. And if it cannot have duties, there is no sensible way to understand Brennan's purported «right to a competent electorate». What is left of Brennan's position is thus rather banal: it is regrettable that some voters are incompetent. And nothing compels us to abandon universal suffrage...|$|E
40|$|Actual fiscal structures' {{functioning}} {{is greatly}} constrained by some distortions, such as efficiency costs, {{due to the}} <b>coercitive</b> nature of tax collection. The mainstream optimal taxation literature ignores, however, the incurring tax system costs. Given these costs and in presence of fiscal evasion and fiscal avoidance, the policy tools' efficiency is clearly diminished. Integrating fiscal avoidance and evasion into normative analysis of taxation means introducing {{a new set of}} policy instruments whose optimal setting is at issue. It also invites to consider the theory of " optimal tax systems ". In order to study these institutional and societal tax features a methodological reorientation is needed. The effective cost of taxation would be then more visible and thus easier to integrate into public economics topics. Subsequently, this investigation requires a new efficiency costs typology jointly with a revision of social welfare effects. Efficiency costs, fiscal avoidance, fiscal evasion, optimal taxation. ...|$|E

We used conducting polymers (polypyrrole, PPy; polyethylenedioxythiophene, PEDOT) sprayed on different substrates and in addition composite materials based on carbon black (CB) mixed either with polyethylene (PE) or with polycarbonate (PC). In the latter case, the conducting material is easily shaped out in various forms. When deposited {{on some of these}} substrates, the alloys appear as an interesting material for magneto-optic recording. The electrochemical process was used for the preparation of Gd/Co and Dy/Fe alloys for which the measured <b>coercitive</b> fields ranged from 250 – 300 Oe (Dy/Fe) to about 350 Oe (Gd/Fe). We demonstrated also the feasibility of an additional electrografting of a transparent protective layer of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) {{in order to avoid the}} corrosion of the alloys by the atmosphere.

Historicamente, como é sabido, eles foram criados contra o Estado, ou seja, como forma de coibir a interferência arbitrária do poder público na esfera individual. Mas como a globalização relativizou a soberania do Estado e reduziu drasticamente sua força coercitiva, qual é o futuro dos direitos humanos nesse contexto sócio-económico? This article {{attempts}} {{to draw attention}} to what has been globalization and avaluate the impact of this phenomenon on Human Rights. Historically, this kind of fundamental legal garantees, known as Human Rights, were created against the Nation-State, that is to say, they were conceived to protect citizens against the arbitrariness of public power. However, in so far globalization has undermined the sovereignity of the Nation-State and has decreased the <b>coercitive</b> force of the public power, what is the future of Human Rights in this new social and economic context...|$|E

And Ni(1 -x) CuxFe 2 O 4 (x= 0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6) ferrite ceramics {{with the same}} raw materials were prepared by solid state reaction. The results of X-ray diffraction showed that the main phase, NiCu ferrite with {{fine particles}} {{were obtained from the}} nitrates-egg white or nitrates-citrate acid mixture calcined at 400 °C for 3 hs. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) measurements indicated the NiCu material with fine particles were typical soft magnetic materials. Combined results of magnetization curves, saturation magnetization (Ms), residual magnetization (Mr), <b>coercitive</b> force (Hc), it has been found that the NiCu ferrite material synthesized from nitrates - egg white has better magnetic performance than that from nitrates -citrate acid. Cu doping can increase the Ni-ferrite's permeability. The Ni 0. 6 Cu 0. 4 Fe 2 O 4 (x= 0. 4) fine particle and bulk ceramic have excellent magnetics properties...|$|E

Characterizations of the milled powders were carried by X-ray diffraction, a vibratory sample magnetometer at 300 K and Mössbauer spectrometry. It is observed {{the formation of the}} α-bcc-Fe (Cr,Si) phase after 3 hours of milling. The grain size decreases with the increase of the milling time and attains 10 nm at 15 hours. At the temperature of 300 K, the saturation magnetization (Ms) decreases with the milling time. Its value at 10  h of milling time is 167. 4  emu/g. Also, the <b>coercitive</b> force decreases with the milling time. These variations are related to the microstructural changes and the increase of defects induced by milling processes. The Mössbauer spectroscopy shows two phases. The first one is ferromagnetic and is attributed to α-Fe (Si,Cr) phase. The second phase rich in Cr and Si is paramagnetic...|$|E

MnxCu 1 -xFe 2 O 4 ferrite samples were prepared by uniaxial pressing from the oxide mixture, synthesized at 1000 °C during 45 hours and finally heated to 1200 °C by 5 h, at room atmosphere. The X-ray diffractograms show that the samples with different compositions were formed by compact structure spinel with cubic cell. The saturated magnetization of the MnxCu 1 -xFe 2 O 4 ferrites increased with x up to 0. 46, which presented the smallest <b>coercitive</b> field. All samples showed hysteresis characteristic of soft magnetic materials. This electrical behavior is compatible with an insulator.

By means of secondary data - books, articles, dissertations, pages of the Internet, among others ¿- it was investigated the conditions that had propitiated the institutionalization of new standards of performance of the public agricultural S&T organizations. The research showed that to increase the financial resources destined to the financing of the research, the organizations of agricultural S&T had searched for bigger competitiveness, using models of enterprise management. This occurred in national scope, with the Brazilian Company of Farming Research (Embrapa), like in the state, with the Agronomic Institute of Paraná (Iapar). Thus, if analyzing the ambient conditions for which the organizations had passed and the structural changes tending to the similarity, it was observed mainly the <b>coercitive</b> isomorphism, because the ambient pressures of the organizational field...|$|E

Freedom {{constraints}} in <b>coercitive</b> closed environments {{such as a}} jail always {{cause problems}} with sadness, loneliness, abandonment causing to a grater or lesser degree, stable depressive phenomena or general psychological uneasiness. An aspect which has been inadequately assessed up to now in literature is that of eating disorders. Such pathologies in this last twenty years have been increasingly affecting different age bands with various relational-existential problems at the individual level. Materials and methods. For this reason we have thought about observing such phenomena within structures where different aspects regarding food, body perceptions, space and above all freedom are altered. The group from us taken in examination originates from four jail of Sicily. Three tests of self-administration have been delivered: Zung for the anxiety, Zung for the depression and EDI- 1 modified to 38 items. Conclusions. Our study has shown {{that there are some}} meaningful correlations between freedom restrictions regime and some dimensions that interest the pathogenesis of eating disorders. We did not find evidence of eating disorders in a narrow sense but observed changed attitudes towards food and relationships with one's own body imag...|$|E
