40|$|This paper evaluates some {{contentious}} {{issues in}} women’s liberation struggles in Nigeria as recreated in Ezeigbo’s play, Hands that <b>Crush</b> <b>Stone.</b> The particularities of gender are neglected in the anti-colonial struggle for Nigerian independence, and women’s issues are subsumed within the nationalist literatures of cultural regeneration. With {{the influence of}} feminism, many Nigerian women embark on the identification of women’s personhood by controverting the representations of Nigerian women in male-centered works. African theatre, in particular, is very skeptical about the feminist ideology aimed at changing {{the status of women}} in society. Similarly, many people are suspicious of women’s liberation struggle and its consequent effect on the society. Hence feminism in Nigeria is rent with many contentious issues. Taking Marxist and feminist perspectives in the analysis of Hands that <b>Crush</b> <b>Stone,</b> the researcher explores some of the major issues in the character’s revolutionary gender-cum-class struggle for a pay rise. The proposition is that Hands that <b>Crush</b> <b>Stone</b> embodies most of the concerns in women’s struggle for survival in contemporary Nigeria...|$|E

40|$|Using {{sea sand}} and <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> is the {{distinctive}} feature of concrete in Okinawa Prefecture. The characteristics of such concrete has already published in many papers by the auther and others. There {{are two kinds}} of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> used in Okinawa Island. One is hard and called "Motobu" <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and has large density and small specific water content. So the static and dynamic Young's maduli of the concrete which uses Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> are much larger than ones which described in the specifications of AIJ and JSCE in the practical range of compressive strength between 150 and 400 kg/cm². The other is relatively soft and called Ryukyu lime <b>stone</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> The concrete using the relatively soft <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> has smaller Young's moduli than the concrete with Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> but still lightly larger than specified values in the AIJ specification. There are many factors which affect the values of the Young's maduli of concrete. In this study, compressive strength and unit weight of concrete are the most affecting factors. Formulae for both static and dynamic Young's moduli are presented by using the method of the least square. The formulae are described in terms of compressive strength and unit weight of concrete. The increasing pattern of compressing strength of the concrete using hard <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> as the time passes is almost the same as described in common technical books. The rate of increase of Young's moduli as the time passes is much slower than ones of compressive strength. The concrete using larger maximum size <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> exhibits much larger Young's moduli than the concrete with small maximum size. Bleeding behavior of the concrete using <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and sea sand will be much improved by using "Ishigū" as a part of fine aggregate. Bleeding rate or quantity becomes half or one-third, if "Ishigū" is used properly with other materials...|$|R

In {{order to}} study the {{mechanical}} properties of Crushed Stone-Loess (CSL), a mixture of loess and <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> and Geogrid-reinforced CSL (GCSL), a series of unconfined compression tests were conducted using samples prepared respectively with CSL, GCSL, Pure Loess (PL) or Geogrid-reinforced PL (GPL). Samples varied either {{in the number of}} geogrid-reinforcement layers or in the relative compaction / in the content of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> Based on the analysis of the test results, the following conclusions are given: (1) The pattern of compressive stress-strain curves of GCSL changes gradually from obvious strain softening to strain hardening with the increase of the geogrid-reinforcement layers and the relative compaction. (2) While the compressive strain is greater than a certain value, the compressive strength of GCSL increases significantly with the increase of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> content. (3) Under a larger compressive strain, the <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> inclusions improve apparently the compressive property of GCSL with closely spaced geogrid-reinforcement layers due to the interlocking between the <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and the geogrid...|$|R

50|$|Transportation is a {{major factor}} in the {{delivered}} price of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> The cost of moving <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of transportation and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material. Economies of scale, which might be realized if fewer, larger operations served larger marketing areas, would probably not offset the increased transportation costs.|$|R
