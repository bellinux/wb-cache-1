50|$|The Indian Forest Act, 1927 {{was largely}} based on {{previous}} Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878. Both the 1878 act and the 1927 one sought to <b>consolidate</b> and <b>reserve</b> the areas having forest cover, or significant wildlife, to regulate movement and transit of forest produce, and duty leviable on timber and other forest produce. It also defines the procedure to be followed for declaring an area to be a Reserved Forest, a Protected Forest or a Village Forest.

2500|$|The 97th Brigade (Brigadier-General J. B. Jardine) was {{to attack}} on an [...] front, {{with the right}} flank to attack the Leipzig Salient with the 17th and 16th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry (HLI) leading and the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (2nd KOYLI) in support. The forward {{companies}} of the 17th HLI were to advance from the British front line at [...] until [...] from the German front trench, ready to rush the Trench {{as soon as the}} artillery lifted. As soon as the redoubt was captured the 11th Battalion, Border Regiment would advance against the southern face from Authuille Wood and mop up the defences, after which all the 97th Brigade would advance towards Mouquet Farm.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, it was {{determined}} to <b>consolidate</b> all Army <b>Reserve</b> infantry regiments into one regiment per state. With this move, several proud regimental histories were ended and {{a new chapter in}} the history of Victorian volunteer military forces had begun. The Royal Victoria Regiment was formed on 1 July 1960, as a non-tactical grouping of all Army Reserve infantry battalions in the state of Victoria. It inherits and embodies the traditions of the infantry in Victoria from the earliest units formed since 1854. To fully understand the heritage of the regiment it is necessary {{to go back to the}} very founding of the colony, however, this summary will concentrate on the history of the Melbourne battalions since the conclusion of World War II.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of gas industry in Russia is largely {{dependent upon the}} export of natural gas to the CIS countries. The transition from the command based economy {{to that of the}} free market can be characterized by a decline in gas consumption in these countries that {{can be explained by the}} solvency of consumers for the supplied energy resources. The latter has played a negative role in determining the volumes of gas extraction and transport in Russia. It is hard to overestimate the role of Russia, which possesses huge potential of energy resources. Of all <b>consolidated</b> world <b>reserves,</b> Russian mineral wealth comprises 32 % of prospected gas reserves, 23 % of coal, and 13 % of oil. The oil and power sector (OPS) of Russia supplies the other sectors of economy as well as consolidation with Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Cooperation in the sphere of energy between the CIS countries is among the priority directions of the long-term field policy of Russia. Moreover, both the exporters and the importers of the raw hydrocarbon are equally interested in the {{development of}} such cooperation. This cooperation guarantees for the former such strategic interests as the creation and development of a predictable consumer market of gas and other kinds of fuel, dependability of transit flows of energ...|$|R
40|$|Predictions on the {{efficacy}} of marine reserves for benefiting fisheries differ in large part due to considerations of models of either intra- or inter-cohort population density regulating fish recruitment. Here, I consider both processes acting on recruitment and show using a bioeconomic model how for many fisheries density dependent recruitment dynamics interact with harvest costs to influence fishery profit with <b>reserves.</b> <b>Reserves</b> <b>consolidate</b> fishing effort, favoring fisheries that can profitably harvest low-density stocks of species where adult density mediates recruitment. Conversely, proportion coastline in reserves that maximizes profit, and relative improvement in profit from reserves over conventional management, decline with increasing harvest costs and {{the relative importance of}} intra-cohort density dependence. Reserves never increase profit when harvest cost is high, regardless of density dependent recruitment dynamics. I quantitatively synthesize diverse results in the literature, show disproportionate effects on the economic performance of reserves from considering only inter- or intra-cohort density dependence, and highlight fish population and fishery dynamics predicted to be complementary to reserve management...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the south}} {{bank of the}} Ancre, the 36th (Ulster) Division (Major-General Oliver Nugent) {{objective}} was set at the fifth line of German trenches, known as the D line, with the right flank at sector D 8. The ground rose in a convex slope {{to the top of}} Bazentin Ridge, towards [...] Redoubt and a series of parallel trenches, from the B line to the C line. The attack front was divided into two sections south of the Ancre, to be attacked by the 109th Brigade on the right and the 108th Brigade on the left. The 109th Brigade was advance with two battalions to capture the A line (the German front line), the immediate support trench (A1) and then the B line, before moving on to the Grandcourt–Thiepval road and <b>consolidating.</b> Two <b>reserve</b> battalions were to occupy the A and B lines, when the advanced battalions had reached the final objective. The 108th Brigade was to capture the A and B lines and then dig in along the C line at the north-east corner of Schwaben Redoubt, with a detachment posted as a flank guard to the left and to send a party northwards, to observe the ground along the Grandcourt–St. Pierre Divion road, as two platoons advanced along the A and B lines to St. Pierre Divion. The attack on the D line was to be made by the 107th Brigade with three battalions. The attacking battalions were to advance in eight waves at [...] intervals and the 107th Brigade was to advance in artillery formation until resistance was met.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{regulation}} projects from control {{organisations such as}} the European solvency II reform and recent economic events, insurance companies need to <b>consolidate</b> their capital <b>reserve</b> with coherent amounts allocated to the whole company and to each line of business. The present study considers an insurance portfolio consisting of several lines of risk which are linked by a copula and aims to evaluate not only the capital allocation for the overall portfolio but also the contribution of each risk over their aggregation. We use the tail value at risk (TVaR) as risk measure. The handy form of the FGM copula permits an exact expression for the TVaR of {{the sum of the}} risks and for the TVaR-based allocations when claim amounts are exponentially distributed and distributed as a mixture of exponentials. We first examine the bivariate model and then the multivariate case. We also show how to approximate the TVaR of the aggregate risk and the contribution of each risk when using any copula.

5000|$|Beginning in the mid-2000s, the Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>consolidated</b> its check-handling {{services}} {{as the number}} of paper checks fell rapidly in favor of check cards, debit cards and electronic bill payments. The most recently completed payments study (released in late 2010) revealed that more than three-quarters of noncash payments in America were done electronically. [...] On March 3, 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland became the Fed’s single paper check processing and adjustments site and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta became the Fed’s single electronic check processing site. However, the St. Louis Fed still serves as the nation’s central processing site for Treasury checks and postal money orders. As led by senior vice president Karl W. Ashman, the St. Louis Fed provides currency and coin handling services for the Eighth District and beyond, which includes helping to ensure that depository institutions have enough currency and coin to meet public demand through currency ordering and depositing services. The St. Louis Fed also checks currency for fit status (money that can still be circulated), destroys notes that can no longer be circulated and reports counterfeit money to the United States Secret Service.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of the balance sheet of the <b>consolidated</b> Federal <b>Reserve</b> Banks (FRB) is analyzed in an historical context. The analysis reveals {{that the nature of}} Fed involvement in U. S. financial markets has changed dramatically and its expansion is several orders of magnitude beyond what is usually reported. The associated fiscal risks and potential exit strategies are then considered. Although risks are considerable in certain unlikely scenarios, FRB capital, earnings capacity, and reserves are more than ample to preserve their financial independence. Nevertheless, the occurrence of losses or a significant drop in FRB profit might lead to an eventual curtailment of Fed operational independence. The paper concludes by considering options to enhance FRB risk management and to assign responsibilities for monetary, financial stability and fiscal policies once the current crisis is overcome.
