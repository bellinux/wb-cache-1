Nevertheless, few tools are specifically designed to cope with cell cycle proteins. In fact, a vast amount of data is currently scattered among many databases. Here, we present a first detailed analysis of known cell cycle proteins. We combined databases mining and literature searches with an evaluation of evolutionary conservation. The objective was to identify <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> in various proteomes. In total we found 595 experimentally annotated cell cycle control proteins; these clustered into 113 distinct structural families.

40|$|Among arthropods, ticks lead as vectors {{of animal}} {{diseases}} and rank second to mosquitoes in transmitting human pathogens. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) participate in cell cycle control in eukaryotes. CDKs are serine/threonine protein kinases and these catalytic subunits are activated or inactivated at specific {{stages of the}} cell cycle. To determine the potential of using CDKs as anti-tick vaccine antigens, hamsters were immunized with recombinant Ixodes persulcatus CDK 10, followed by a homologous tick challenge. Though it was not exactly unexpected, IpCDK 10 vaccination significantly impaired tick blood feeding and fecundity, which manifested as low engorgement weights, poor oviposition, {{and a reduction in}} 80 % of hatching rates.

40|$|Vascular {{smooth muscle}} (VSMC) migration, prolifera-tion, and {{hypertrophy}} following physical, chemical, or biological injury are key {{events in the}} onset and progression of vascular proliferative disorders, such as atherosclerosis, postangioplasty stenosis, venous bypass graft failure, and transplantation. Under normal conditions, VSMCs exist in a quiescent state of growth that supports contractile function and structural and functional integrity of the vascular wall. Vascular injury disrupts critical cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, leading to activation of VSMCs. The activated VSMC phenotype is characterized by gradual loss of differ-entiated characteristics, increased response to chemotactic agents, and uncontrolled proliferation. Not surprisingly, the quest for molecular triggers of VSMC proliferation led investigators to studies of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> and mitogenic signaling within the vascular wall.

40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} 16 (HPV 16) is {{a high-risk}} DNA tumour virus, {{which is a}} major causative agent of cervical cancer. Cellular transformation is associated with deregulated expression of the E 6 and E 7 oncogenes. E 7 {{has been shown to}} bind a number of cellular <b>proteins,</b> including the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein</b> pRb. In this study, RNA aptamers (small, single-stranded oligonucleotides selected for high-affinity binding) to HPV 16 E 7 were employed as molecular tools to further investigate these protein-protein interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study is focused on one aptamer (termed A 2). Transfection of this molecule into HPV 16 -transformed cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation (shown using real-time cell electronic sensing and MTT assays) due to the induction of apoptosis (as demonstrated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining). GST-pull down and bead binding assays were used to demonstrate that the binding of A 2 required N-terminal residues of E 7 known to be involved in interaction with the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein,</b> pRb. Using a similar approach, A 2 was shown to disrupt the interaction between E 7 and pRb in vitro. Furthermore, transfection of HPV 16 -transformed cells with A 2 appeared to result in the loss of E 7 and rise in pRb levels, as observed by immunoblotting. Conclusions/Significance: This paper includes the first characterisation of the effects of an E 7 RNA aptamer in a cell line derived from a cervical carcinoma. Transfection of cells with A 2 was correlated with the loss of E 7 and the induction o...|$|R

Tenidap discharges intracellular Ca 2 + store, resulting in a depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + store in cultured human gingival fibroblasts. It also inhibited cell growth, DNA and collagen syntheses, lowered intracellular pH in nicardipine responder cells, and enhanced matrix metalloproteinase- 1 formation in NIFr cells. 18 α-GA inhibited cell proliferation and G 1 /S transition induced in NIFr cells. It was also shown that <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> were down-stream targets in the growth-inhibition activity of 18 α-GA in NIFr cells.

40|$|The CD 95 death {{receptor}} activates caspases that cleave {{a variety}} of intracellular substrates, including <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, {{the significance of this}} cleavage for the induction of apoptosis is unclear. In this study, CD 95 -induced cleavage of the G 1 /S checkpoint regulator proteins, retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and murine-double-minute- 2 (mdm- 2), was associated with an increased protein concentration of a key transcription factor, E 2 F- 1, which is regulated by both of them. Furthermore, DNA-binding activity to E 2 F sites is increased. In thymocytes, CD 95 -induced apoptosis was associated with increased E 2 F- 1 DNA-binding activity, while thymocytes that lacked E 2 F- 1 were less susceptible to CD 95 -induced apoptosis. We conclude that the G 1 /S checkpoint is an important target of CD 95 signalling. CD 95 -activated caspases cleave regulator proteins to increase E 2 F- 1 activity, and inappropriate activation of E 2 F- 1 is part of the mechanism of CD 95 -induced apoptosis...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Both oncogenic {{viruses and}} <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> are fast-growth {{research}} areas. More and more {{evidence indicates that}} virus infection and replication are often associated with apoptosis and interfere with cell cycle pathways. To understand the mechanisms by which viral proteins regulate apoptosis and target the cellular pathways {{may lead to the}} development of new remedies for some cancers. Data sources English literature searched by MEDLINE from January 1995 to August 1998. Study selection and data extraction More than one hundred research papers published in these areas over the past three years. Only new and important breakthroughs in these papers are selected. The review focuses on DNA viruses associated with the development of human cancers. Results and conclusions Some DNA viruses contain oncogenic proteins which transform normal cells in vitro and induce tumors in animals. These viral proteins target the cellular pathways and block apoptosis induced by receptors or in response to signal transduction. Viral interference with host cell apoptosis leads to enhanced viral replication and may promote carcinogenesis. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, such as Retinoblastoma (RB) and p 53, play important roles in regulation of these interactions. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

KSHV establishes a latent infection in human B cells expressing the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), {{a critical factor in}} the regulation of viral latency. LANA is known to modulate viral and cellular gene expression. We report here on some initial proteomic studies to identify cellular proteins associated with the amino and carboxy-terminal domains of LANA. The results of these studies show an association of known cellular proteins which support LANA functions and have identified additional LANA-associated proteins. These results provide new evidence for complexes involving LANA with a number of previously unreported functional classes of proteins including DNA polymerase, RNA helicase and <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins.</b> The results also indicate that the amino terminus of LANA can interact with its carboxy-terminal domain. This interaction is potentially important for facilitating associations with other cell cycle regulatory proteins which include CENP-F identified in association with both the amino and carboxy-termini.

Our previous data demonstrated that phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) treatment, a PKC activator, for 48 h decreases retinal cells proliferation by a mechanism mediated by muscarinic receptor activation, involving a decrease in M 1 receptors levels. The aim of this work was to analyze how PMA interferes in the levels of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> p 53, p 21 and cyclin D 1 and also to investigate its influence on M 3 receptor levels. Our results show that PMA (50 ng/mL) produces {{a significant increase in}} p 21 and p 53 levels, decreases cyclin D 1 levels, and also enhances M 3 receptors levels in cell cultures. Evaluating the postnatal retinal tissue development until 30 days, we observed that tissue differentiation is accompanied by an increase in M 3 and p 21 levels. Based on our results we suggest that PMA treatment is promoting a change in muscarinic receptors expression mimicking the pattern observed during tissue differentiation, indicating that PMA is probably accelerating the cholinergic differentiation in rat retinal cell cultures...|$|E

40|$|Current {{treatment}} modalities for malignant gliomas do {{not allow}} long-term survival. Here, we identify suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC), as an effective experimental anti-glioma agent. Administration of SAHA to various glioma cell lines obtained from human, rat and mouse inhibited tumour cell growth {{in a range of}} 1 - 10 microm. This anti-glioma property is associated with up-regulation of the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein</b> p 21 /WAF, as well as the induction of apoptosis. A novel tumour invasion model using slice cultures of rat brain corroborated the anti-glioma properties of SAHA in the organotypic brain environment. In this model, glioma invasion compromised adjacent brain parenchyma, and this tumour-associated cytotoxicity could be inhibited by SAHA. In addition, a 10 -fold dose escalation experiment did not challenge the viability of cultured brain slices. In vivo, a single intratumoural injection of SAHA 7 days after orthotopic implantation of glioma cells in syngeneic rats doubled their survival time.

We aimed to investigate whether MAPK phosphorylation of Cx 43 directly regulates VSMC proliferation. Using in vivo models of VSMC proliferation e. g. carotid treatments with platelet-derived growth factor–BB (PDGF), we identified that MAPK phosphorylated Cx 43 interacts with the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> cyclin E and CDK 2. To confirm this in vitro we isolated primary Cx 43 –/– VSMC and transfected these with constructs for Cx 43 containing null phosphorylation (alanine) or phospho-mimetic (aspartate) mutations of the MAPK serines. Co-immunoprecipitation and proliferation studies in transfected cells combined with analytical size exclusion studies of purified Cx 43 C-terminus and cyclin E proteins demonstrated that MAPK phosphorylation of Cx 43 is critical for its binding with cyclin E and for VSMC proliferation in vitro. Finally, using a novel knock-in mouse containing Cx 43 MAPK alanine mutations (Cx 43 -MK 4 A), we showed that the null-phosphorylation mutation disrupts interactions between Cx 43 and cyclin E and VSMC proliferation in vivo. We conclude that MAPK phosphorylated Cx 43 is a novel interacting partner of cyclin E and is required to promote VSMC proliferation...|$|E

We have tested whether differentiation and division share overlapping control mechanisms in these cells. To do this, we have perturbed {{the activity of}} proteins known to participate in cell-cycle regulation by introducing the E 1 A oncogene or its mutant forms via microinjection into PC 12 cells. The E 1 A protein binds to several putative <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins,</b> including p 105 Rb (the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene), {{as well as others}} of unknown function such as p 130, p 107, and p 300.

However, NGF does cause neurite outgrowth in the presence of E 1 A mutants known to have greatly reduced binding to either p 105 Rb and p 130 or p 300. Our experiments suggest that p 105 Rb, p 130, and p 300 may participate either in E 1 A-mediated inhibition of differentiation or in the NGF signal transduction pathway. We also report here that NGF affects phosphorylation of p 105 Rb, suggesting that Rb mediates at least some of NGF's effects.

Here we have successfully isolated Xenopus laevis Mad 2 B and PRCC cDNAs. The full-length xMad 2 B cDNA encodes a 211 amino acid protein that is highly homologous to human Mad 2 B, thus pointing to an important function for this protein in higher eukaryotes. The full-length xPRCC cDNA encodes a 544 amino acid protein. Remarkably, this protein contains an amino-terminal region distinct from that in mouse and human, whereas the C-terminal region is highly conserved. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed a relatively low expression of both xMad 2 B and xPRCC in most tissues examined. However, an abundant expression was observed in testis and oocyte, indicating a role in meiotic division processes. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that, despite its distinct amino terminus, the xPRCC-protein is still capable of interacting with xMad 2 B and of shuttling this protein to the nucleus. Therefore, the well-established animal model Xenopus laevis {{can be used as a}} powerful system to study in detail the role of xPRCC and xMad 2 B in the intricate processes of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

Ac-cumulation of p 34 cdc 2 to a maximum level in dividing cells and the cessation of its accumulation during subsequent cell growth and expansion indicate that it contributes specifically to division.

A basal level of p 34 cdc 2 in fully differen-tiated cells that is one-sixteenth of that in dividing cells correlates with their loss of capacity to divide.

40|$|Although {{chemotherapy}} has revolutionized cancer treatment, {{the associated}} side effects induced {{by lack of}} specificity to tumor cells remain a challenging problem. We have previously shown that TAT-RasGAP(317 - 326),a cell-permeable peptide derived from RasGAP, specifically sensitizes cancer cells to the action of genotoxins. The underlying mechanisms of this sensitization were not defined however. Here, we report that TAT-RasGAP(317 - 326) requires p 53, but not the Ras effectors Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, to mediate its tumor sensitization abilities. The TAT-RasGAP(317 - 326) peptide, although not modulating the transcriptional activity of p 53 or its phosphorylation and acetylation status, nevertheless requires a functional p 53 cellular status to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to genotoxins. Genes regulated by p 53 encode proapoptotic proteins, such as PUMA, and <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins,</b> such as p 21. The ability of TAT-RasGAP(317 - 326) to sensitize cancer cells was found to require PUMA but not p 21. TAT-RasGAP(317 - 326) did not affect PUMA levels, however, but increased genotoxin-induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase- 3 activation. These results indicate that TAT-RasGAP(317 - 326) sensitizes tumor cells by activating signals that intersect with the p 53 pathway downstream of, or at the level of, proapoptotic p 53 target gene products to increase the activation of the mitochondrial death pathway...|$|E

To improve therapeutic efficiency, novel therapeutic targets and prognostic factors must be discovered. Our studies have identified several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as promising candidates. Significant epigenetic silencing of GPCR expression occurs in HNSCC compared with normal tissue, and is significantly correlated with clinical behavior. Together with the finding that GPCR activity can suppress tumor cell growth, this indicates that GPCR expression has potential utility as a prognostic factor. In this review, we discuss the roles that galanin receptor type 1 (GALR 1) and type 2 (GALR 2), tachykinin receptor type 1 (TACR 1), and somatostatin receptor type 1 (SST 1) play in HNSCC. GALR 1 inhibits proliferation of HNSCC cells though ERK 1 / 2 -mediated effects on <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> such as p 27, p 57, and cyclin D 1, whereas GALR 2 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Hypermethylation of GALR 1, GALR 2, TACR 1, and SST 1 is associated with significantly reduced disease-free survival and a higher recurrence rate. Although their overall activities varies, each of these GPCRs has value as both a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target.

40|$|The {{activity}} of the cell cycle control protein p 34 cdc 2 is post-translationally regulated {{in a variety of}} cell types. Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we find that p 34 cdc 2 -directed tyrosine kinase activity increases at fertilization in sea urchin eggs, leading to a gradual accumulation of phosphotyrosine on p 34 during {{the early part of the}} cell cycle. Loss of phosphotyrosine from p 34 accompanies entry into mitosis and phosphotyrosine reaccumulates as the embryo enters the next cell cycle. A similar pattern is seen when eggs are parthenogenetically activated with ammonium chloride. Tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles are suppressed when embryos are treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. On the other hand, a cycle persists when protein synthesis is inhibited with emetine, indicating that it is independent of the synthesis of another class of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins,</b> the cyclins. Additional experiments with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate, demonstrate that activating protein synthesis alone in unfertilized eggs does not result in stimulation of p 34 cdc 2 tyrosine kinase activity. Our results indicate that p 34 tyrosine phosphorylation cycles are triggered by the fertilization Cai transient. The first cycle is independent of the fertilization pHi signal, confirming that, in sea urchin embryos, the cycle is not tightly coupled to the cycle of cyclin abundance that is a prominent feature of the eukaryotic cell division cycle...|$|E

In short-term coculture with AGS gastric cells, H. pylori inhibits <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> progression and induces dose-dependent apoptosis. Based on the concept that an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis may contribute to the emergence of gastric cancer, we chronically exposed AGS cells to H. pylori as a model of chronic exposure in humans. The AGS derivatives selected by this process were stably resistant not only to H. pylori-induced apoptosis but also to apoptosis induced by other enteric bacteria and by several toxic agents including radiation and cancer chemotherapy. Like the parental AGS cells, the derivatives underwent G 1 /S-phase <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> inhibition in response to H. pylori. The AGS derivatives displayed a marked decrease in cellular levels of the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein</b> p 27 kip 1.

This is the first demonstration that bacterial infection can lead to apoptosis resistance and to cross-resistance to other inducers of apoptosis such as bacteria, chemotherapeutic agents, and radiation. The development of apoptosis resistance and downmodulation of p 27 kip 1 may contribute to the increased risk for gastric cancer observed in humans chronically exposed to H. pylori...|$|R

Presently, developing a drug targeted delivery system is suggested {{as one of the}} most promising approaches to minimize the side effects of cisplatin. Here, we found that each human serum transferrin (HTf) has the potential to bind with over 22 cisplatins, and the complex of apo-HTf-cisplatin can specifically deliver cisplatin to HepG 2 cells (human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line) in vitro, and facilitate HepG 2 cells to apoptosis. Moreover, proteomics methods revealed that the abundances of 23 proteins in HepG 2 cells were remarkably altered in response to cisplatin/apo-HTf-cisplatin exposure, and Realtime-PCR revealed that a number of important genes related to chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity and chemotherapeutic resistance are differentially transcribed between the HepG 2 cells of cisplatin exposed and HTf-cisplatin exposed. The pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins and gene transcriptions indicated that those regulated proteins and gene transcriptions are involved in apoptosis regulation, transcription, <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control,</b> <b>protein</b> biosynthesis, energy metabolism, signal transduction, protein binding and other functions. It indicated that the cisplatin toxicity in HepG 2 cell is diverse, the transport process has an effect on the cisplatin cytotoxicity, and the mechanism of the apoptosis of HepG 2 cells induced by apo-HTf-cisplatin is different from that of cisplatin.

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} if and how cannabinoid receptor stimulation regulates macrophageal differentiation, {{which is one of}} the key steps in the immune effector reaction. For that reason, we used a well established differentiation model system of human U 937 myelocytic leukemia cells that differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA. Constant cannabinoid receptor (CB) stimulation was performed using WIN 55212 - 2, a potent synthetic CB agonist. We found that WIN 55212 - 2 inhibited CB 1 / 2 -receptor-dependent PMA-induced differentiation of human myelocytic U 937 cells into the macrophageal phenotype, which was associated with impaired vimentin, ICAM- 1 and CD 11 b expression. In the presence of WIN 55212 - 2, cdc 2 protein and mRNA expression was progressively enhanced and Tyr- 15 -phosporylation of cdc 2 was reduced in differentiating U 937 cells. Additionally, p 21 Waf 1 /Cip 1 expression was up-regulated. PMA-induced apoptosis was not enhanced by WIN 55212 - 2 and differentiation-associated c-jun expression was not altered. In conclusion, we suppose that WIN 55212 - 2 -induced signals interferes with cell-cycle-arrest-signaling in differentiating myelocytic cells and thus inhibits macrophageal differentiation. Thus, it is possible that the cannabinoid system is able to influence one of the key steps in the immune effector function, the monocytic-macrophageal differentiation by alteration of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> cdc 2 and p 21, and is therefore representing a promising option for therapeutic intervention in exacerbated immune reactions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency-associated genes {{activates}} {{cell cycle}} progression and drives immortalization of the infected cell. In contrast, {{progression of the}} EBV replication program occurs most efficiently in growth-arrested cells. Previous studies showed that the EBV-encoded immediate-early transcription factor, Zta, can induce expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p 21 and p 27, the tumor suppressor, p 53, and cell growth arrest. Moreover, Zta-mediated induction of growth arrest occurs independently of its transcriptional transactivation function. Here we show that substitution of Zta’s basic DNA binding domain with the analogous region of the Zta homologue, c-Fos, abrogates Zta’s ability to induce growth arrest and to induce p 21, p 27, or p 53 expression, suggesting that protein-protein interactions between this region of Zta and key <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>proteins</b> are involved in signaling cell cycle arrest. We also show that despite the crucial role for Zta’s basic domain in eliciting cell growth arrest, its amino terminus is required for efficient induction of p 27 and it modulates the level of p 53 induction. Last, we provide evidence that Zta-mediated inductions of p 21, p 27, and p 53 occur, at least in part, through distinct pathways. Therefore, Zta interacts with multiple growth arrest pathways, a property which may have evolved partly {{as a means to}} ensure that lytic replication occurs in a growth-arrested setting in multiple different tissues in various states of differentiation...|$|E

One of the most important function of p 53 protein is its ability to stimulate transcription of other genes that inhibit <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> progression and DNA repair mechanisms or apoptosis pathways. p 53 gene activity is controlled by a series of mechanisms among which redox regulation has taken little attention. Because of its importance as a tumor suppressor, its role as a <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein</b> and transcription factor, we decided to focus on p 53 transcriptional activity. Human p 53 can be studied in yeast where genetic tools can be used to identify proteins that affect its ability to stimulate transcription of reporter genes. Several studies have shown that the p 53 protein is prone to oxidative inactivation. Although yeast does not contain a p 53 gene, the similarity of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms and oxidative stress response pathways prompted us to ask whether human p 53 was active in yeast cells lacking individual antioxidant genes. In this study, using yeast deletion mutants, p 53 reporter gene activity was assayed in different antioxidant mutants that were identified by REDOX-Cys-Search bioinformatic tool by previous studies. Seven antioxidant genes were found to be important in regulating p 53 activity. These genes played role in phosphatidylinositol pathway, protein dephosphorylation, cellular iron metabolism, DNA mismatch repair, and three other unknown biochemical pathways. Identification of these new proteins that regulate p 53 activity may have broad implications in understanding the complex behaviour of p 53 and tumor formation in humans...|$|R
40|$|Cyclin D 1 is a <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein</b> {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in regenerating liver and many types of cancer. Previous reports have shown that cyclin D 1 can directly enhance estrogen receptor activity and inhibit androgen receptor activity in a ligand-independent manner and thus may play an important role in hormone-responsive malignancies. In this study, we examine a distinct mechanism by which cyclin D 1 regulates sex steroid signaling, via altered metabolism of these hormones at the tissue and cellular level. In male mouse liver, ectopic expression of cyclin D 1 regulated genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of sex steroid hormones in a pattern that would predict increased estrogen and decreased androgen levels. Indeed, hepatic expression of cyclin D 1 led to increased serum estradiol levels, increased estrogen-responsive gene expression, and decreased androgen-responsive gene expression. Cyclin D 1 also regulated the activity of several key enzymatic reactions in the liver, including increased oxidation of testosterone to androstenedione and decreased conversion of estradiol to estrone. Similar findings were seen in the setting of physiological cyclin D 1 expression in regenerating liver. Knockdown of cyclin D 1 in HuH 7 cells produced reciprocal changes in steroid metabolism genes compared with cyclin D 1 overexpression in mouse liver. In conclusion, these studies establish a novel link between the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> machinery and sex steroid metabolism and provide a distinct mechanism by which cyclin D 1 may regulate hormone signaling. Furthermore, these results suggest that increased cyclin D 1 expression, which occurs in liver regeneration and liver diseases, may contribute to the feminization seen in these settings...|$|R

From previous studies, we identified differentially expressed genes in each menstrual cycle phase by microarray, then subjected them to functional in vitro analyses. Microarray studies disclosed genes that are upregulated in the luteal phase and follicular phase. TOB- 1 is a tumor suppressor gene and was expressed exclusively in the luteal phase in our microarray study. Therefore, we further functionally characterized the protein product of TOB- 1 in vitro. To our knowledge, no studies have yet been conducted on reactive oxygen species-regulated tumor suppressor interactions {{in accordance with the}} biphasic nature of progesterone. This work demonstrates that progesterone can produce reactive oxygen species in MCF- 7 cells and that TOB- 1 exerts a series of non-genomic interactions that regulate antiproliferative activity by modulating the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, this study implicates PTEN as an interacting partner for TOB- 1, which may regulate the downstream expression of <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> <b>protein</b> p 27 via multiple downstream signaling pathways of progesterone through a progesterone receptor, purely in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These results support the hypothesis that surgery conducted during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle may facilitate improved patient survival.
