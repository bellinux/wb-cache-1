This paper reassesses these issues and draws the following conclusions. Firstly, little progress has been made in <b>centralizing</b> financial <b>supervision</b> in the Eurozone. Secondly, with the exception of Germany, all Eurozone countries have made substantial progress in reducing state ownership in their banking systems. Thirdly, limited progress has been made in the reduction of bank exposures to domestic public debt.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has ignited {{a debate about}} the appropriate objectives and the governance structure of Central Banks. We use novel survey data to investigate the relation between these traits and banking system stability focusing in particular on their role in micro-prudential supervision. We find that {{the separation of powers}} between single and multiple bank supervisors cannot explain credit risk prior or during the {{financial crisis}}. Similarly, a large number of Central Bank governance traits do not correlate with system fragility. Only the objective of currency stability exhibits a significant relation with non-performing loan levels {{in the run-up to the}} crisis. This effect is amplified for those countries with most frequent exposure to IMF missions in the past. Our results suggest that the current policy discussion whether to <b>centralize</b> prudential <b>supervision</b> under the Central Bank and the ensuing institutional changes some countries are enacting may not produce the improvements authorities are aiming at. Whether other potential improvements in prudential supervision due to, for example, external disciplinary devices, such as IMF conditional lending schemes, are better suited to increase financial stability requires further research...|$|R

Under hierarchical supervision, the central and the local supervisors simultaneously choose their efforts, so they will be playing a game.

40|$|In {{the year}} 2005 it became {{mandatory}} for listed {{companies in the}} EU to apply IFRS in their consolidated financial statements. The purpose of IFRS is to create harmonization and to facilitate the comparison of financial statements between countries for investors. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the application of regulation has not been harmonized which prevents comparability and creates a significant barrier between companies in different countries. The issue of harmonization was found in, among other, the accounting of acquisitions. Acquisitions have increased with globalization of the financial markets and have been an important driving force in development. This increased importance of acquisitions has led to higher demands on the companies’ published financial information, which resulted in the new accounting standard IFRS 3. This study seeks to analyze how companies in the United Kingdom and Germany account for acquisitions and how they differ between them. It also seeks to compare the countries with previous research from Sweden, and investigate how the influence of supervision affects their accounting. This study concludes that there are some differences in the accounting between the United Kingdom and Germany, but that these differences were not as great as perceived. Between Germany and Sweden there were significant differences despite the fact that they share the same historical accounting. The biggest discovery was that all countries relation between goodwill and intangible assets is becoming <b>centralized.</b> The <b>supervision</b> of companies is also a factor that seems to have a bigger impact in Sweden’s accounting than in Germany and the United Kingdom.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which a central and a local supervisor contribute their efforts to obtain information on the solvency of a local bank, which is then used by the central supervisor to decide on its early liquidation. This hierarchical model is contrasted with the alternatives of decentralized and <b>centralized</b> <b>supervision,</b> where only the local or the central supervisor collects information and decides on liquidation. The local supervisor has a higher bias against liquidation (supervisory capture) and a lower cost of getting local information (proximity). Hierarchical supervision is the optimal institutional design when the bias of the local supervisor is high but not too high {{and the costs of}} getting local information from the center are low but not too low. With low (high) bias and high (low) cost it is better to concentrate all responsibilities in the local (central) supervisor.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{constructs}} a {{model of}} hierarchical supervision in which a central and a local supervisor independently choose supervisory efforts which determine the precision of a signal of the solvency of a local bank. The central supervisor uses this information {{to decide on the}} bank’s early liquidation. Importantly, the local supervisor is assumed to be characterized by a lower cost of effort (due to proximity) and a higher cost of liquidating the bank (due to capture). The model of hierarchical supervision is compared in terms of welfare with two alternative arrangements, namely decentralized supervision, where the local supervisor is fully in charge, and <b>centralized</b> <b>supervision,</b> where the central supervisor is fully in charge. The results show that moving supervision from local to hierarchical to central {{is more likely to be}} optimal when the cost of getting local knowledge is sufficiently low and/or the possible capture of the local supervisor is a significant concern.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a holistic method by integrating three concepts (land resources management, assets supervision and political governance for sustainability) for investigation of land administration in China, {{taking into consideration}} of cultivated land protection for a testimony with econometric method. Theoretically. in this self-organizing integrated method, land resources management focuses on the productivity of land; land assets <b>supervision</b> <b>centralizes</b> on the realization of land usufruct rights in land transference; land political governance for sustainability concentrates on harmonious linkage of economic efficiency, social stability and environmental safety of land use. Their interrelations are complex. Methodologically, {{the results indicate that}} the theoretical model is feasible to explain variations of cultivated land protection with these three concepts. Cultivated land decreases with increasing land value increment multiples, and is positive with political governance concept, but not in a linear fashion. Finally the results suggest that roles of government in land administration need to be changed and strengthened, supporting complete compensation for land expropriation and modification to policies of cultivated land.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the institutional preconditions for stable financial integration in a ‘theory of optimal financial areas’ (OFA). This theory is modelled on the theory of optimal currency areas {{that has been used}} to inform the process of monetary integration. Where it differs from optimum currency area (OCA) theory is in focussing on capital mobility and cross-border financial transactions rather than concentrating on exchange rates or macroeconomic adjustment. We contend that OCA theory misdirects both the analysis and the policy response: it is more pertinent to ask what makes for financial stability under conditions of market integration than what makes for stable currencies and smooth macroeconomic adjustment. The article proposes six ‘criteria’ that should be met in order to stabilize an integrated financial ‘market geography’. Three of these criteria relate to the technical substructure of markets, and include a shared risk free asset, centralized sovereign debt management, and common market infrastructures for communication, clearing, settlement and depository. Three further criteria focus on the macro-prudential considerations like shared rules for financial <b>supervision,</b> <b>centralized</b> lender of last resort facilities for private- and public-sector market participants, and common provision for the resolution of failed private- and public-sector borrowers. These criteria are controversial both individually and as an interdependent package. Nevertheless, they are important to mitigate the costly dynamics of financial market disintegration under crisis conditions. We use case studies of the Great Britain, the United States and Canada to show how national governments have stumbled toward a similar set of arrangements to stabilize domestic financial market integration. The more recent experience of the European Union shows this pattern applies across countries as well. We conclude with a research agenda based on these considerations...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the lessons}} {{financial}} history offers: Macroeconomic stability - low inflation and sound public finance - {{is important for}} creating the right incentives for banks and for facilitating the development of securities markets. High inflation and large fiscal deficits distort economic behavior in favor of short-term speculative projects conducive to sustainable economic development. Central bank independence may contribute to economic stability. One way to increase it is by lengthening the term of central bank governors. There must be incentives for bank owners to behave prudently - a requirement that they have capital commensurate with the risks they assume, for example. Unlimited liability and double liability limits may be less feasible now than in the past, but banks in developing countries that face higher risks should maintain higher capital ratios than banks in the more advanced OECD countries. Effective supervision is also essential. Banks run into solvency problems because they fail to diversify - often because of regulatory (especially geographic) restrictions, {{but also because of}} excessive connected lending or genuine mistakes. Regulators must ensure that banks diversify their risks, which means ending geographic or sectoral restrictions (including prohibitions against holding foreign assets) and restricting connected lending. Developing effective supervision (to ensure meaningful and effective compliance with prudential rules) is difficult and time-consuming but essential. The difficulty of supervising universal banks and financial conglomerates is an argument used against them in developing countries. But universal banks may generate efficiency gains as they overcome the problems of inadequate reliable public information on industrial and commercial companies. Holding small equity stakes and being involved in corporate governance may be productive. The risk of overlending to related firms is likely to be small when banks hold small stakes in industrial firms; it is high when firms control banks. Pension funds and other institutional investors have grown in importance in many countries over the past thirty years or so, because of longer life spans and longer retirement. These funds started as labor market institutions and personnel management tools, but have become important financial intermediaries. Pension funds offer developing countries an alternative both for restructuring their public finances and for promoting their capital markets. Pension funds can play the role that thrift deposit institutions - such as savings banks, credit cooperatives, and building societies - played in developed countries in the nineteenth century. But thrift institutions can still contribute to financial and economic development by promoting thrift and facilitating credit rural areas and among low-income groups. They will contribute more if they involve a three tier structure that combines the benefits of local involvement and monitoring with <b>centralized</b> auditing and <b>supervision.</b> Banks&Banking Reform,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management&Restructuring,Decentralization,Banks&Banking Reform,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management&Restructuring,Banking Law,Environmental Economics&Policies...|$|R
