The treatment efficiency of domestic sewage <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>quenched</b> slag biological aerated filter (BAF) was researched in this paper. And the removal rate of organic compound, ammonium, SS, and chroma was also investigated. The results showed that the quality indexes of the domestic sewage after treatment met the primary standard of the national integrated wastewater discharge standard (GB 8978 - 1996). So the purpose of the waste harnessed by other waste is achieved. The applicative prospect of blast furnace <b>water</b> <b>quenched</b> slag on domestic sewage treatment is very broad...|$|R

40|$|Cutting {{tests of}} wood {{with the grain}} were made to obtain {{fundamental}} data {{on the effects of}} cutting velocity on chip formation, cutting force, and frictional coefficient by the use of an experimental apparatus designed for cutting tests (Fig. 1). The range of cutting velocity (V) employed in these tests were from 0. 0023 to 52. 53 m/sec. The depth of cut (feed of tool per revolution of a steel disk) was varid from 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm by varing the speed of the feed carriage in combination with two variable-speed motors and some pulleys (Fig. 1). The main results obtained were : (1) The type of chip formation, the curvature of the chip (ρ), and the checks occurring in the chip, change with V (Figs. 5 ～ 9). (2) Although the cutting-force components change remarkably with V, the degree of their changes depends not only on the cutting conditions but also on the workpiece conditions. For instance, in the range of very - low cutting - velocity, below about 10 m/sec, the horizontal component (F_H) and the frictional force (F) of the cutting force, when <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> air - dried workpieces, decrease remarkably with increases in V. In the range of V of about 10 ～ 30 m/sec, these components are not affected by V. In the range of V of about 30 ～ 53 m/sec, these components decrease gradually with increases in V. Compared with these, the vertical component (F_V) and the normal force (N) of the cutting force change slightly or vary little with V (Figs. 8 and 9). (3) The frictional coefficient (μ), when <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> - saturated workpieces, is lower in comparison <b>with</b> that when <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> air - dried workpieces, and μ, when <b>cutting</b> not only <b>with</b> <b>water</b> - saturated workpieces but also with air - dried workpieces, decreases with increases in V (Fig. 10) ...|$|R

Both steels are shown to be resistant to the γ → α and γ → e{open} martensite transformations irrespective of the decomposition of a γ solid solution (06 Kh 18 AG 19 M 2 steel). Austenite of the steel with 19 wt% Mn shows lower resistance to recrystallization, which provides its higher plasticity (δ 5) and fracture toughness at a lower strength {{as compared to the}} steel with 13 wt% Mn. Electrochemical studies of the steels tempered at 300 and 500 °C show that they are in a stable passive state during tests in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution and have high pitting resistance up to a potential E pf = 1. 3 - 1. 4 V, which is higher than that in 12 Kh 18 N 10 T steel. In the quenched state, the passive state is instable but pitting formation potentials E pf retain their values. In all steels under study, pitting is shown to form predominantly along the grain boundaries of nonrecrystallized austenite. The lowest pitting resistance is demonstrated by the structure with a double grain boundary network that results from incomplete recrystallization at 1100 °C and from the existence of initial and recrystallized austenite in the 07 Kh 16 AG 13 M 3 steel.

A large portion of gas cleanup research has been directed towards hot gas desulfurization using Zn-based sorbents. However, zinc titanate sorbents undergo reduction to the metal at temperatures approaching 700 {degrees}C and lose reactivity because of volatilization.

Because of these problems with zinc-based sorbents, METC has shown interest in formulating and testing manganese-based sorbents. Currently, many proposed IGCC processes include a <b>water</b> <b>quench</b> prior to desulfurization.

However, zinc titinate sorbents undergo reduction to the metal at temperatures approaching 700 {degrees}C. In addition, sulfate formation during regeneration leads to spalling of reactive 293 surfaces. Due to zinc-based sorbent performance, METC has shown interest in formulating and testing manganese-based sorbents. Westmoreland and Harrison evaluated numerous candidate sulfur sorbents and identified Mn as a good candidate. Later, Turkdogan and Olsson tested manganese-based sorbents which demonstrated superior desulfurization capacity under high temperatures, and reducing conditions. Recently, Ben-Slimane and Hepworth conducted several studies on formulating Mn-sorbents and desulfurizing a simulated fuel gas. Although thermodynamics predicts higher over-pressures with Mn verses Zn, under certain operating conditions Mn-based sorbents may obtain < 20 ppmv. In addition, the manganese-sulfur-oxygen (Mn-S-O) system does not reduce to the metal under even highly reducing gases at high temperatures (550 - 900 {degrees}C). Currently, many proposed IGCC processes include a <b>water</b> <b>quench</b> prior to desulfurization. This is for two reasons; limitations in the process hardware (1000 {degrees}C), and excessive Zn-based sorbent loss (about 700 {degrees}C). <b>With</b> manganese the <b>water</b> <b>quench</b> is obviated due to sorbent loss, as Mn-based sorbents {{have been shown to}} retain reactivity under cycling testing at 900 {degrees}C. This reduces system hardware, and increases thermal efficiency while decreasing the equilibrium H{sub 2 }S over-pressure obtainable with a manganese sorbent...|$|R
