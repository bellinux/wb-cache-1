This study {{investigated}} on the cooling characteristics of AC 4 C aluminum alloy and AC 7 A aluminum alloy {{used as a}} <b>casting</b> <b>material</b> for manufacturing automobile tire mold by experiment. The metal mold device by gravity casting method was manufactured. AC 4 C <b>casting</b> <b>material</b> and AC 7 A <b>casting</b> <b>material</b> were heated in smelting furnace at about 650 °C and 670 °C, and then they injected into the metal mold device when the melting process was completely finished, respectively. When the melted <b>casting</b> <b>material</b> was completely injected into the metal mold device, the temperature inside the casting was measured by 9 measurement points. Also, when the temperature inside the casting was measured approximately 500 °C during the cooling process, the casting is separated to metal mold device and carried out cooling at normal temperature. The separating time from metal mold device of AC 4 C <b>casting</b> <b>material</b> and AC 7 A <b>casting</b> <b>material</b> have been taken 25 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively.

40|$|Casting is a {{manufacturing}} process where a solid is melted, heated to proper temperature, and is then poured into a cavity or mold, which contains {{it in the}} proper shape during solidification. Casting process generally is classified as expendable mold or permanent mold. These researches consist of design and fabricate mould for die casting process and analyze the structure and surfaces of the <b>casted</b> <b>materials.</b> Objective of the research is to design and fabricates mold for tensile test specimen, following ASTM E 8 standard and to analysis the surface and structure of <b>casted</b> <b>material.</b> Material {{that has been used}} for mold is mild steel meanwhile <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> is aluminum alloys. Furthermore, this research is consisting of several main processes which mold is design by Solidwork software and simulation for machining process is done by mastercam software. Meanwhile, fabrication process is done by CNC milling machine and finally perform casting process to produce <b>casted</b> <b>materials.</b> Subsequently, these researches were carried out in order to analyze the effect of surface roughness, dimension and thickness values on <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> by 3 different pre-heated temperatures. For these experiments, 3 measurements were measured at 3 <b>casted</b> <b>materials</b> from three different pre-heated mold temperatures. Therefore, 100 °c, 250 °c and 350 °c temperatures were tested to observe the effects of surface roughness, dimension and thickness of <b>casted</b> <b>material.</b> For surface roughness,the analysis of results indicated the value of surface roughness does not affected by different preheated temperature. Other than that, the values of thickness and dimensions of the <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> were slightly decreased at different pre-heated temperature. When the dimension and thickness pre-heated at 150 °c, the values decreased compared with other pre-heated temperature. For pre-heated mold temperature 150 °c, the dimension and thickness values are 8. 18 mm and 3. 29 mm. Meanwhile, for 250 °c and 350 °c pre-heated mold temperature, the dimension and thickness values is 12. 55 mm, 12. 57 mm, 3. 37 mm and 3. 54 mm. For pre- heated temperature 200 °c and 350 °c, the values of dimension and thickness not significantly different. In addition, the morphology examinations through scanning electron microscope (SEM) were examined in order to investigate the effects of porosity defects by different pre-heated mold temperature. The result shows that porosity still occurred at <b>casted</b> <b>material</b> with different pre-heated mold temperatures. However, for pre- heated 150 °c mold temperature, porosity occurred more than other pre-heated mold temperature. It proved that the undesirable pre-heated mold temperatures causes more porosity will occurred on <b>casted</b> <b>material.</b> The appropriate pre-heated temperature is 280 °c and 350 °c for aluminum alloys to produce good casted products...|$|R

50|$|Grey {{cast iron}} is characterised by its graphitic microstructure, which causes {{fractures}} {{of the material}} to have a grey appearance.

Most cast irons have a chemical composition of 2.5-4.0% carbon, 1-3% silicon, and the remainder iron. Grey cast iron has less tensile strength and shock resistance than steel, but its compressive strength is comparable to low- and medium-carbon steel.

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{attraction of}} magnesium alloys lies in their extraordinarily good machining properties, in which respect they are superior even to screwing brass. The power required in cutting them is small, and extremely high speeds (5000 ft per min in some cases) may be used. The best cutting tools have special shapes, but the tools for machining other metals can be used, although somewhat lower efficiency results. When magnesium is cut at high speed, the tools should be sharp {{and should be}} cutting at all times. Dull, dragging tools operating at high speed may generate enough heat to ignite fine chips. Since chips and dust from grinding can therefore be a fire hazard, grinding {{should be done with}} a coolant, or with a device to concentrate the dust under water. The magnesium grinder should not be used also for ferrous metals, since a spark might ignite the accumulated dust. If a magnesium fire should start, it can be smothered with cast-iron turnings or dry sand, or with other materials prepared especially for the purpose. Water or liquid extinguishers should never be used, because they tend to scatter the fire. Actually, it is much more difficult to ignite magnesium chips and dust than is usually supposed, and for that reason they do not present great machining difficulties. The special techniques that must be used in fabricating magnesium (working, casting, and joining) add considerably to the manufacturing cost. In selecting between aluminium and magnesium or a given part, the base cost of the metal may not give much advantage to either, but usually the manufacturing operations make magnesium more expensive. [...] There is, perhaps, no group of alloys where extrusion is more important than it is to these, since the comparatively coarse-grained structure of the <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> makes most of them too susceptible to cracking to work by other means until sufficient deformation has been imparted to refine the grain. Therefore, except for one or two soft alloys, machining is invariably a preliminary step before other shaping processes.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{paediatric}} traumatology fractures {{are commonly}} {{treated with a}} cast. In this course cast wedging is sometimes performed aiming to reduce the fracture angulation. However, the impact of various factors and measures such as <b>cast</b> <b>material,</b> optimal position of the wedge and wrist position were not assessed in a systematic manner. METHODS: A laser supported model was developed to evaluate the biomechanical processes of cast wedging manoeuvre in {{a model of a}} distal diaphyseal forearm fracture. Consecutive measurements were performed to find out the influence of wedge position, <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> and wrist position. FINDINGS: The result of the manoeuvre was revealed to be independent of the <b>cast</b> <b>material</b> (plaster of Paris vs. synthetic cast) used. The optimal position for placing the wedge was shown to be on the concave side of the cast {{at the level of the}} fracture. The result of a cast wedging manoeuvre in a dorsally displaced forearm fracture can be optimized with the wrist held in extension. INTERPRETATION: The cast wedging model is not a meticulous copy of the human anatomy but it allows some basic studies on cast wedging technique. The results that can be achieved are similar to the experiences of practical paediatric traumatology. Furthermore the present model may be beneficial for use in education and training programs...|$|E
