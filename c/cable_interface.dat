40|$|The {{authors have}} {{previously}} outlined a proposed path {{for the development}} of electrical networks for deepwater wave farms. This path broadly followed that of offshore wind farms as the least cost solution. The main differences between wind farm and wave farm electrical networks were identified as the method of installation and maintenance and the components at the WEC interface with the electrical network. Components such as dynamic cables, submarine connectors, submarine switchgear all form part of these interfaces. This paper examines the key electrical interfaces for WEC arrays such as the dynamic cable to WEC interface, dynamic cable to static <b>cable</b> <b>interface,</b> and the WEC medium voltage switchgear interface. The cost and functionality of these interfaces are evaluated for a variety of options. The paper also looks at array electrical configurations beyond radial under the same criteria. The paper concludes with an optimised solution for the key interfaces between the WEC and the electrical which minimises cost but maintains important functionality of the electrical network within the array. The preferred solution uses a combination of permanent cable joints, mateable connectors, and onboard switchgear. The paper outlines the challenge to get the electrical systems to a cost level that will be competitive with other renewable sources, particularly offshore wind...|$|E

The ANSI T 11. 1 task force has standardized HIPPI- 6400 also known as Gigabyte System Network (GSN), a physical-level, point-to-point, full-duplex, link interface for reliable, flow-controlled, transmission of user data at 6400 Mbit/s, per direction. A parallel copper <b>cable</b> <b>interface</b> for distances of up to 40 m is specified in HIPPI- 6400 -PH [1]. Connections to a longer-distance optical interface are standardized in HIPPI- 6400 -OPT [3]. HIPPI- 6400 -PH [1] defines the encapsulation of IEEE 802. 2 LLC PDUs [10] and by implication, IP on GSN.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaPortable Telemetry Data Receive/Record Sets (TDRRS) are {{temporarily}} {{installed in}} Navy ships to record and display data from tactical surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles (e. g., STANDARD, HARPOON, TOMAHAWK and SEA SPARROW). The Arleigh Burke DDG 51 AEGIS class Destroyer is the fleet’s newest Man-of-War. The first ship of this class, the USS Arleigh Burke (DDG 51), was recently commissioned on 4 July 1991. Permanent telemetry data RF and control transmission cabling systems will {{be installed in}} these Destroyers. The purpose of the dedicated cabling system is to deliver high quality telemetry data to the portable TDRRS. A dedicated quality interface guarantees reliable communications with the STANDARD Missile (SM) 2 during the pre-exit and initial airborne stages during missile launched from the ship’s Vertical Launch System (VLS). Previous ship classes depended on portable cables and equipment to provide for this function. Cables were brought through hatchways and bulkheads to the telemetry receiving and recording equipments. The DDG 51 AEGIS Class Destroyer uses a Collective Protection System (CPS) that provides for differential inside air pressure that {{is greater than the}} outside air pressure. This is intended to prevent chemical, biological, and nuclear contamination from entering the ship. To preserve CPS integrity, telemetry cabling is routed through airtight bulkhead connectors. This paper introduces the new integrated shipboard telemetry <b>cable</b> <b>interface</b> and the recently developed fleet telemetry receive and record system.

40|$|The CDI 400 blood {{gas monitor}} was {{evaluated}} by investigating its clinical performance in 30 patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Arterial and venous blood samples were withdrawn during stable hypothermic conditions. Reference {{analysis was performed}} on the ABL 4 blood gas analyser. A total of 229 samples were included for calculations of bias and precision. Simple regression analysis was utilized to illustrate the relationship between the tested monitor and its reference. Results revealed an acceptable agreement for pH and arterial pO 2 measurements. Venous pO 2 bias and precision were poor (+ 0. 76 &plusmn; 1. 07 kPa). Arterial and venous pCO 2 were generally overestimated (+ 0. 5 &plusmn; 0. 4 kPa and + 0. 2 &plusmn; 0. 4 kPa). Performance given as correlation coefficients indicated a similar pattern. Slopes and intercepts deviated from the line of identity for all parameters analysed. In summary: the CDI 400 is a valid instrument in guiding the perfusionist with crucial trend information. However, its general performance implies that a reference blood gas analyser is still needed. On-line blood gas monitoring enjoys an increas-ing popularity. A strict control of critical physio-logical limits favours both patient outcome and safety. 1 - 3 The accuracy of on-line monitors, how-ever, still appears inferior to the conventional blood gas analyser. 4 - 6 In this study we are evaluating a new on-line monitor and its clinical performance.
