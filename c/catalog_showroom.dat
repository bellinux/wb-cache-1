50|$|Fred Meyer Jewelers {{started in}} 1973 as a <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> concept by Fred Meyer. As the <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> fad started to die down, Fred Meyer was {{experiencing}} excellent sales {{growth in the}} fine jewelry category. To capitalize on this sales growth, Fred Meyer placed fine jewelry stores in their large multi-department stores and eventually shopping malls throughout the Western United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{store was}} begun by Huey John Wilson in 1947 as a jewelry vendor in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ten years later, Wilson opened his first <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom.</b> By 1982, Wilson's was the third-largest <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> chain in the United States.

50|$|In 1982, Best {{acquired}} catalog competitors: Basco, a chain with 19 <b>catalog</b> <b>showrooms</b> in the Northeast and Ohio; and Modern Merchandising, {{headquartered in}} Minnetonka, Minnesota with 76 showrooms under the names LaBelle's, Dolgin's, Jafco, Miller Sales, Rogers and Great Western.

50|$|In 1996, Witmark {{experienced}} {{its fourth}} consecutive year of declining sales and earnings, {{and the company}} announced changes to its operating strategy. Unfortunately, vast barriers—such as long-term leases on real estate—limited the company's ability {{to adapt to the}} changing business climate. The following year, Witmark liquidated its assets and laid off its 700+ employees. Like the larger national chains of <b>catalog</b> <b>showrooms</b> (such as Best Products), the retail concept collapsed in the late 1990s due to overwhelming competition from big box stores and Internet shopping.|$|R
50|$|Raymond Zimmerman, {{son of the}} {{original}} founders (who had been instrumental {{in the process of}} building the family business into a multibillion-dollar empire) resigned as Chairman of the Board in November 2000.

50|$|From the consumer's {{point of}} view, there are {{potential}} advantages and disadvantages. The <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> approach allows customers to shop {{without having to}} carry their purchases throughout the store as they shop. Possible downsides include that customers {{may be required to}} give their contact information when an order is placed, take the time to fill out order forms, and wait a period of time for their order to be available for purchase. This wait may be days long, one of the chief vulnerabilities of the <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> approach.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason behind}} {{offering}} the <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> approach to retailing {{was that it}} reduced the risk of merchandise theft (known in the industry as shrinkage) and also enabled customers to shop without the inconvenience of physically dragging purchases throughout the store. The downside to this approach was that it required the customers to give their names, addresses, and phone numbers with each order. The risk of identity theft made some customers wary of shopping in such stores, particularly when purchasing simple household items such as batteries.|$|E
