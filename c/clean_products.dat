50|$|Divalents Lanthanides are {{extremely}} reducing (can reduce alkali cations) compounds. Of these divalent lanthanides, SmI2 {{is a common}} reducing agent that is used {{in a variety of}} synthetic applications, mainly because all other divalent lanthanides are unstable. Complexes of Sm(II) have also been investigated and used in similar applications. However, even though Sm(II) complexes and compounds have had tremendous success when used in conjunction with a variety of substrates. There have been instances where chemistry of certain materials cannot be performed due to unclean reactions in which products are not easily isolated from reaction mixtures when Sm(II) compounds are used to perform the desired reduction. In these cases, adjusting the size of the metal (which is commonly and easily done for the trivalent lanthanide compounds) may fine tune the nature of a specific reaction, which should produce desired and <b>clean</b> <b>products.</b> One drawback to this notion is that Sm(II) is uniquely stable compared to other divalent lanthanides, where the other metals in the series tend to exist freely in the trivalent state. The discovery and application of sterically induced reductions allows the unique reducing properties and chemistry to be applicable to all of the lanthanide metals while remaining in their more stable trivalent state.When Sm(III) is complexed with C5Me5 (pentamethylcyclopentadiene) to give the compound (C5Me5)3Sm, this trivalent species has been shown to have the same reducing reactivity of the Sm(II) derivative.|$|E
5000|$|The concentrating {{machine for}} slimes, which has {{hitherto}} {{been a great}} favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and revolving cast-iron heads, shafting, bevel wheels, and driving pulleys, are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head the liquid stream, which {{should be in a}} uniform thin film, falls {{over the edge of the}} fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical line of holes, and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is stopped, a groove is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no <b>clean</b> <b>products</b> can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.|$|E

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of crowding out of intrinsic motivation in real purchasing decisions from a field experiment {{in a large}} supermarket chain.

40|$|This paper employs real {{purchasing}} decisions {{observed during}} a field experiment to examine consumer choices {{in response to}} alternative environmental policy interventions: a carbon-footprint label, a monetary instrument and a regulatory ban. We consider a range of com-monly purchased products, manipulating the choice set of consumers initially purchasing ‘clean ’ or ‘dirty ’ products. We explore whether the existence of close substitutes matters for the effectiveness of policy instruments to regulate the public good by using two environmen-tally ‘neutral ’ treatments as implicit measures of how substitutable clean and dirty versions are, namely a price reduction for <b>clean</b> <b>products</b> (an implicit price elasticity) and a neutrally framed removal of the dirty product {{as a measure of}} the propensity of consumers to exit the market when their preferred option is removed from the choice set. Applying a Ran-dom Utility framework, we find that, while all instruments significantly increase the market share of the <b>clean</b> <b>products</b> – on average from 16 - 24 % – regulatory, information-based and monetary instruments perform better when the clean alternative is a good substitute to the dirty, i. e. the private cost of switching to the clean alternative is moderate. Furthermore, motivation crowding effects of monetary incentives on voluntary participation seem to be stronger in the presence of close substitutes. The absence of substitutes acts as a ‘preference constraint ’ lowering both the effectiveness of policies to regulate the public good on average and crowding-out effects...|$|E
