5|$|In 2005, {{the staff}} of The Political <b>Cesspool</b> {{organized}} a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, {{has been the subject}} of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political <b>Cesspool</b> staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.|$|E

A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a <b>cesspool.</b> He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E

40|$|CIVINSIn the United States nearly 70 million (30 %) {{housing units}} {{are served by}} septic tanks. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency {{indicated}} in a survey conducted in 1978 that 32 % {{of the population is}} still not being served by primary, secondary or advanced waste treatment facilities. It follows that several thousand homes in the State of Hawaii are not provided with service connections to the county-operated wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal systems. Specifically, the island of Oahu has an estimated 128, 659 <b>cesspools</b> and 1, 027 septic tanks, Hawaii maintains 29, 084 <b>cesspools</b> and 1, 697 septic tanks, Maui has 14, 086 <b>cesspools</b> and 968 septic tanks, and Kauai has 4, 197 <b>cesspools</b> and 868 septic tanks (Harold Yee, 1999). These homes (57 % of Hawaii's population) must each operate their own on-site system to collect, treat, and dispose sewage[URL]...|$|R

5|$|The Political <b>Cesspool</b> is {{a weekly}} far-right talk radio show founded by Tennessean {{political}} activist James Edwards and syndicated by the organizations Liberty News Radio Network and Accent Radio Network in the United States. First broadcast in October 2004 {{twice a week}} from radio station WMQM, per Edwards it has been simulcast on Stormfront Radio, a service of the white nationalist Stormfront website and as of 2011 is broadcast on Saturday nights on WLRM, a Christian radio station in Millington, Tennessee. Its sponsors include the white separatist Council of Conservative Citizens and the Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust denial group.|$|E
5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and <b>cesspool</b> systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end of}} this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political <b>Cesspool.</b>|$|E

25|$|Basic sewer {{systems were}} used for waste removal in ancient Mesopotamia, where {{vertical}} shafts carried the waste away into <b>cesspools.</b> Similar systems existed in the Indus Valley civilization in modern-day India and in Ancient Crete and Greece. In the Middle Ages the sewer systems built by the Romans fell into disuse and waste was collected into <b>cesspools</b> that were periodically emptied by workers known as 'rakers' who would often sell it as fertilizer to farmers outside the city.|$|R

5|$|The Alsos Mission {{set out on}} 20 April and rendezvoused {{with the}} 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion at Freudenstadt. The intact bridge over the Neckar River at Horb was crossed and Haigerloch was {{occupied}} without opposition on 22 April. The main body of Task Force A arrived on 23 April. In a laboratory in a cellar they found a German experimental nuclear reactor shaped like a cylinder and made of graphite blocks, but the uranium and heavy water were missing. The scientists immediately began dismantling it. Pash left Hambro in charge, while he led troops of Task Force A to Bisingen, {{and then on to}} Hechingen, where 25 scientists were captured, including von Weizsäcker, von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge. At Tailfingen they took Otto Hahn and nine members of his staff into custody. At Haigerloch, a sealed drum of documents was retrieved from a <b>cesspool,</b> and three drums of heavy water and 1.5 tons of uranium ingots were found buried in a field. The uranium and heavy water were loaded onto trucks. The apertures in the cellar were blown up with minor explosions to prevent their capture by the French.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, public {{officials}} and public hygiene experts studied and debated sanitation for several decades. The {{construction of an}} underground network of pipes to carry away solid and liquid waste was only begun in the mid 19th-century, gradually replacing the <b>cesspool</b> system, although cesspools were still in use {{in some parts of}} Paris into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, the Montgomery Advertiser {{reported}} that the single-biggest donor to his campaign (having contributed $50,000 of the total $78,000 received by Moore until December 31, 2011) is Michael Peroutka, a longtime acquaintance of Moore's who is associated with {{organizations such as the}} Constitution Party and white supremacist group League of the South and is a frequent guest on The Political <b>Cesspool.</b> In response, Moore said he did not share the ideas of those organizations.|$|E

50|$|The {{sewage system}} played an {{important}} role in the building placement. In early stages of the university development, there were no constructed services. Water was collected from the roofs of Quadrangle and waste in <b>cesspools.</b> Due to bad sewer system, the Melbourne City Council had forbidden <b>cesspools</b> in 1867 and replaced with the night-cart system. Eventually, iron receiver tanks were installed to store the wastes beyond the Quadrangle before the proper sewer system was completed. Gothic-style architecture remained the architecture of choice until the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|Being a city, however, {{required}} {{thinking about}} {{issues such as}} sewage. Willow Glen had no sewer system - individual homes had their own <b>cesspools</b> or septic systems. Because the area was marshy before being drained for Willow Glen, the high water table resulted in raw sewage often spilling above-ground from flooded <b>cesspools.</b> Rather than build their own very expensive sewage treatment system, in 1936 Willow Glen's residents opted to be annexed to San Jose and be linked to San Jose's sewage system, the measure passing {{by a vote of}} 978 to 871.|$|R
25|$|The {{precursor}} to the modern septic tank was the <b>cesspool</b> in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and the solid waste was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action; it was invented by L.H Mouras in France in the 1860s. Donald Cameron, as City Surveyor for Exeter patented an improved version in 1895, which he called a 'septic tank'; septic having the meaning of 'bacterial'. These are still in worldwide use, especially in rural areas unconnected to large-scale sewage systems.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were {{increasingly}} {{dug into the}} ground near houses in Europe {{as a means of}} collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the <b>cesspool,</b> and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it during the night. This solid waste, euphemistically known as Nightsoil, was sold as fertilizer for agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of ecological sanitation).|$|E
25|$|Before the {{restoration}} work was undertaken, vandalism and illegal encroachments were rampant {{at the site}} of the tomb, presenting a serious danger to the preservation of this invaluable treasure. At the main entrance of Humayun’s Tomb, dingy stalls had been put up under a very corrupt system of municipal patronage known as tehbazari, and all sorts of heavy vehicles were allowed to be parked illegally in these open spaces. On the Nila Gumbad side was a huge citadel of India’s vote bank politics — thousands of ‘slum dwellers’ were kept by an influential section of the political leadership to serve as ‘bonded voters’ during elections. The environment of the dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya had also been ruthlessly degraded and the holy tank had become a messy <b>cesspool.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{the city}} grew, prosperous Wheeling {{residents}} built fine houses, especially on Wheeling Island, but slums also expanded.

500|$|Later that year, Memphis {{city councilman}} E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a {{certificate}} [...] "in appreciation of outstanding {{contributions to the}} community". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political <b>Cesspool.</b> According to The Commercial Appeal, Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, {{another member of the}} Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political <b>Cesspool,</b> but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, [...] "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution...

50|$|Lack {{of water}} {{has always been}} a problem of {{citizens}} of the Upper Posad.

5000|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, the Soho {{district}} of London {{had a serious}} problem with filth due to the large influx of people {{and a lack of}} proper sanitary services: the London sewer system had not reached Soho. Cowsheds, slaughter houses, and grease-boiling dens lined the streets and contributed animal droppings, rotting fluids and other contaminants to the primitive Soho sewer system. [...] Many cellars had <b>cesspools</b> underneath their floorboards, which formed from the sewers and filth seeping in from the outside. Since the <b>cesspools</b> were overrunning, the London government decided to dump the waste into the River Thames, contaminating the water supply. London had already suffered from a [...] "series of debilitating cholera outbreaks". These included outbreaks in 1832 and 1849 which killed a total of 14,137 people.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the layout of Qarmūnâ.
