40|$|Summary {{record of}} {{proceedings}} of the second meeting of the Executive Council, held in London, 16 - 17 April 2002. Discussion of {{the report of the}} 2001 financial outcome was followed by a presentation of guidelines to be used for 2003 financial planning. Discussion of the pilot and regular processes for challenge programs raised concerns over participation of NARS and other stakeholders, which it was decided should be a necessary condition before proposed challenge programs should be considered by the Interim Science Council. The representation within the Executive Council of civil society organizations (small farmers' groups in particular) and of regional development banks was considered as well, while larger farmers would be represented within the Private Sector Committee. Meeting participants discussed the <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>chairmanship</b> of the Executive Council Finance and Program Committees. The Director described a planned Executive Council working group to guide the process of TAC's transition into a Science Council. Non Secretariat members of the Council evaluated the service and performance of the CGIAR Secretariat. IPGRI Director General Geoffrey Hawtin's briefing on the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources, conclusions of the Genetic Resources Policy Committee, and establishment of the Global Conservation Trust, was followed by an overview of preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development and World Food Summit + 5. The report of the External Programme and Management Review of CIP, progress in the conduct of reviews of ISNAR and the systemwide programs on Collective Action and Property Rights and Integrated Pest Management, and scheduled reviews of IPGRI and ICRISAT were presented. The funding stability of systemwide programs, and their relationship to challenge programs were discussed...|$|E

The resolution also identified a series of issues in Hospital governance including Board of Governors size, <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> skills, <b>chairmanship,</b> policy development authority, and reporting relationships of the Chief Executive Officer. To this end, a recommendation was made to address these issues {{within the context of the}} Board of Governors relationship with the Board of Regents, through a Study Committee of Governors and Regents...|$|R

40|$|REITs {{experienced}} phenomenal {{growth in}} the l 990 s. Evidence on ownership structure, board <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> performance of REITs, however, is scarce. For REITs, special regulation, including mandatory distribution of income, limits free cash flow, while restrictions on source of income and asset structure results in widely dispersed stock ownership. This makes external monitoring through the takeover market less likely such that alternative monitoring mechanisms, including external directors, must be in place to discourage deviant managerial behavior. Using a simultaneous equation system, we conclude that while outside directors on REIT boards enhance performance, the effect is weak. Consistent with the evidence on other industry sectors, we find that higher CEO stock ownership and control through tenure <b>and</b> <b>chairmanship</b> of the board reduces the representation by outside members on REIT boards, and adversely affects REIT performance. Institutional ownership or blockownership fails to serve as alternate disciplining mechanism to (inadequate) monitoring by outside board members, although their presence seems to enhance performance...|$|R
