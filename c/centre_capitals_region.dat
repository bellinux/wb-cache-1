Methods: Information on 19 self-reported common somatic symptoms was achieved from a population-based questionnaire survey of 36, 163 randomly selected adults in the <b>Capital</b> <b>Region</b> of Denmark (55. 4 % women). The participants stated whether they had been considerably bothered by each symptom within 14  days prior to answering the questionnaire. We used latent class analysis to identify the somatic symptom profiles. The profiles were further described by their association with age, sex, chronic disease, and self-perceived health. Results: We identified 10 different somatic symptom profiles defined by number, type, and site of the symptoms. The majority of the population (74. 0 %) had a profile characterized by no considerable bothering symptoms, while a minor group of 3. 9 % had profiles defined by a high risk of multiple somatic symptoms. The remaining profiles were more likely to be characterized by a few specific symptoms. The profiles could further be described by their associations with age, sex, chronic disease, and self-perceived health. Conclusion: The identified somatic symptom profiles could be distinguished by number, type, and site of the symptoms. The profiles have the potential to be used in further epidemiological studies on risk factors and prognosis of somatic symptoms but should be confirmed in other population-based studies with specific focus on symptom burden.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{potential}} of the Copenhagen <b>capital</b> <b>region</b> to maintain a leading position in development and provision of mobile technologies. The paper presents empirical data on the mobile sector in the <b>capital</b> <b>region</b> in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of the <b>Capital</b> <b>Region</b> of Copenhagen. Denmark is as the rest of Scandinavia considered to be among the leading countries with regard to mobile and wireless communication. This position has been confirmed in a long series of benchmarking analyses comparing e-readiness in countries and regions. Denmark is also doing well with regard to connectivity of broadband and Internet access, and Denmark has also developed an advanced market for mobile services. The major share of the Danish mobile sector is concentrated in the <b>capital</b> <b>region.</b> In relative terms the mobile sector is largest in Northern Jutland, but in absolute terms the <b>capital</b> <b>region</b> is more important - especially if Scania on the Swedish site of Oresund is included.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} migration between <b>capital</b> <b>regions</b> and non-capital regions {{and the level of}} human capital in Korea using the method of multinomial logistic regression. This paper aims to show whether the high level of human capital of migrants who move to <b>capital</b> <b>regions</b> statistically differs from the other migrants. For analysis, this paper uses the 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 panel data from Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS). The analysis is divided into two parts of migration based on the region of origin: the migration of individuals who live in non-capital regions and the migration of individuals who live in <b>capital</b> <b>region.</b> In this paper, we consider personal characteristics such as educational attainment and occupations as an indicator of human capital of individual, gender, age, and marriage status as explanatory variables. Our empirical finding is that the educational attainment of individual representing a level of human capital significantly affects the migration behavior moving from non-capital <b>regions</b> to <b>capital</b> <b>regions.</b> According to analysis of migration from Gyeonggi and Incheon to Seoul, the migration within <b>capital</b> <b>regions,</b> individuals who engage in occupation with high skilled and non-manual are more likely to move to Seoul <b>capital</b> <b>regions</b> where favorable conditions for workers in terms of higher wage and better job opportunities can provide. Those results can be understood in the context of human capital theory to maximize personal socioeconomic utilities by migrating to <b>capital</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
