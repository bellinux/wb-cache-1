25|$|Diagnosis of Asperger {{syndrome}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tricky</b> {{as there}} is a lack of a standardized diagnostic screening for the disorder. According to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, physicians look for the presence of a primary group of behaviors to make a diagnosis such as abnormal eye contact, aloofness, failure to respond when called by name, failure to use gestures to point or show, lack of interactive play with others, and a lack of interest in peers.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{crossovers}} {{are commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tricky</b> to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|E

2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tricky</b> working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what he is talking about when it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I {{think this is a good}} innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were too smart to be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E

25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trickier</b> than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for {{just enough time to}} allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify.
