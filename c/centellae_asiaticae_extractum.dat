30|$|Our results here {{reported}} {{were also}} in agreement with recent tea fermentation study on <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> by Ariffin et al. (2011). They explained that tea fermentation induces polyphenols oxidation reactions by the enzyme of polyphenols oxidase {{which resulted in the}} breakdown of phenolic compounds as main contributor to the antioxidant activities. The tea fermentation time is affected the level of phenolic compounds (Heong et al., 2011). Heong et al. (2011) reported that prolonged fermentation time caused more severe damage of polyphenols in <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> tea as compared to partial fermentation. This damage resulted in a drastic decrease of the potential antioxidant activities of <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica.</b> In agreement with that study by Heong et al. (2011), we also observed that the longer fermentation in full-fermented IOSC had lower level of total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities than in partial-fermented IOSC. Thus, the results implies that time for tea fermentation is quite crucial which may affect the level of phenolic compounds and potential antioxidant activities of the tea plants.|$|R
40|$|Hyperlipidemia {{and many}} other {{metabolic}} diseases are related to oxidative stress. <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> is a traditional Chinese medicine whose antioxidant effect in vitro has been reported. We are interested in whether it possesses this effect in vivo and hence modulates lipid metabolism. Therefore, experiments were carried out on mice and golden hamsters regarding its antioxidant and hypolipidemic effect. We observed that a fraction (CAF 3) of the ethanol extract (CAE) of <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> had a cholesterol decrease of 79 % and a triglyceride decrease of 95 % in acute mice model, so CAF 3 was further investigated in high-fat-fed hamster model. It was shown that CAF 3 increased SOD and GSH-Px activities and decreased MDA level, and it also improved TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, AST, and ALT levels. L-CAT and SR-BI gene expression in hamsters were increased. Taken together, our {{data suggest that the}} CAF 3 fraction of <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> has antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the healing}} effects of <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> water extract (CE) and asiaticoside (AC), an active {{constituent}} of CE, on acetic acid induced gastric ulcers (kissing ulcers) in rats were examined. CE was prepared from <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> dry plant and {{the concentration of}} AC in CE was quantitatively determined {{with the use of}} high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Different concentrations of CE and AC were orally administered to rats with kissing ulcers. They were found {{to reduce the size of}} the ulcers at day 3 and 7 in a dose-dependent manner, with a concomitant attenuation of myeloperoxidase activity at the ulcer tissues. Epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis were on the other hand promoted. The expression of basic fibroblast growth factor, an important angiogenic factor, was also upregulated in the ulcer tissues in rats treated with CE or AC. These results further suggest the potential use of <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> and its active ingredient as anti-gastric ulcers drugs. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} in which focal cartilage destruction {{is one of}} the primary features. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of a <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> fraction on in vitro and in vivo cartilage degradation. Bovine cartilage explants and bovine chondrocytes cultured in alginate were stimulated with IL- 1 beta in {{the presence or absence of}} different concentrations (2, 5 and 10 microg/ml) of a standardized <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> triterpenes (CAT) fraction. The CAT fraction inhibited the IL- 1 beta-induced proteoglycan (PG) release and nitric oxide (NO) production by cartilage explants in a dose-dependent manner. The IL- 1 beta-induced reduction in PG synthesis and proliferation of chondrocytes cultured in alginate were counteracted by the CAT fraction at a concentration of 10 microg/ml. In a zymosan-induced acute arthritis model, the CAT fraction inhibited PG depletion without modulating joint swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time that the tested <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> fraction was able to inhibit the zymosan-induced cartilage degradation in vivo without affecting the zymosan-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and joint swelling. The in vitro data indicate that the cartilage protective activity might at least partially be induced by the inhibition of NO production.

Medical Faculty, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the effects of Extract Ethanol Pegagan (<b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica)</b> treatment after stressed restraint stress by measuring the eight arms radial maze performance of rats. Pre test and post test controlled group design was applied in {{this research}}. Male Wistar rats (Rattus novergicus) with the mean age of 8 weeks and the body weight of 150 - 200 grams which used for sample were divided randomly into 4 groups, each consists of 6 rats i. e. Control Group (without any treatment), Stress Group (was given restraint stress 2 hours/days for each rats), Pegagan Group (was given 0. 3 mg/gBW/day/rat Extract Ethanol Pegagan (<b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica)),</b> Pegagan and Stress Group (was given 0. 3 mg/gBW/day/rat Extract Ethanol Pegagan (<b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica)</b> and restraint stress 2 hours/days for each rats). The treatment was given for 21 days. Within 12 days for each pre and post treatment, a test on the Eight Arm Radial Maze was conucted for individual rat to observe its performance. Assesment of rats performance in the Eight Arm Radial Maze test was based error type B. Kruskall-Wallish and Mann-Whitney tests with SPSS for Windows 16 version were applied to statistically analyzed the difference between four groups. By using Kruskall-Wallish test showed that significant performance level difference between four groups of rats with p= 0. 001. By using Mann-Whitney test, it was found that significantly different between Stress Group and Pegagan Group (p= 0. 001), also Stress Group and Pegagan and Stress Group (p= 0. 001). There was no significant differences are showed between Control Group and Stress Group (p= 0. 051), Control Group and Pegagan Group (p= 0. 143), Control group and Pegagan and Stress Group (p= 0. 143) also Pegagan Group and Pegagan and Stress Group (p= 0, 952).
