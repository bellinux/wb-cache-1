5|$|Plant {{biochemistry}} is {{the study}} of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and <b>crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Others make specialised materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their bodies, and secondary products like resins and aroma compounds.|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting <b>crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism,</b> allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during the day, or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E
500|$|The {{concentration}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like <b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> and the [...] carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common [...] carbon fixation pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.|$|E

50|$|This process occurs {{only when}} light is {{available}}. Plants do {{not carry out}} the Calvin cycle during nighttime. They instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves. This process happens when light is available independent {{of the kind of}} photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and <b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work.

500|$|<b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> (CAM) is a {{mechanism}} adopted by cacti and other succulents {{to avoid the}} problems of the [...] C3 mechanism. In full CAM, the stomata open only at night, when temperatures and water loss are lowest. [...] enters the plant and is captured in the form of organic acids stored inside cells (in vacuoles). The stomata remain closed throughout the day, and photosynthesis uses only this stored [...] CAM uses water much more efficiently at the price of limiting the amount of carbon fixed from the atmosphere and thus available for growth. CAM-cycling is a less efficient system whereby stomata open in the day, just as in plants using the C3 mechanism. At night, or when the plant is short of water, the stomata close and the CAM mechanism is used to store [...] produced by respiration for use later in photosynthesis. CAM-cycling is present in Pereskia species.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> (CAM) plants {{keep their}} stomata (on the {{underside}} of the leaf) closed during the day, which conserves water but prevents the light-independent reactions (a.k.a. the Calvin Cycle) from taking place, since these reactions require [...] to pass by gas exchange through these openings. Evaporation through the upper side of a leaf is prevented by a layer of wax.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} mostly desert plants called [...] "CAM" [...] plants (<b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism,</b> after the family Crassulaceae, which {{includes}} the species in which the CAM process was first discovered) open their stomata at night (when water evaporates more slowly from leaves for a given degree of stomatal opening), use PEPcarboxylase to fix carbon dioxide and store the products in large vacuoles. The following day, they close their stomata and release the carbon dioxide fixed the previous night into the presence of RuBisCO. This saturates RuBisCO with carbon dioxide, allowing minimal photorespiration. This approach, however, is severely limited by the capacity to store fixed carbon in the vacuoles, so it is preferable only when water is severely limiting.|$|E

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis of}} specializations for dispersal vs. reproduction is an understudied aspect of dispersal polymorphism in insects. Using a radiolabelled amino acid, we quantified differences in in vivo amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> between morphs of the wing-polymorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus, that trade-off early age reproduction and dispersal capability. Studies {{were conducted in}} crickets fed a variety of diets expected to influence amino <b>acid</b> and lipid <b>metabolism.</b> On the day of molt to adulthood, prior to the morph-specific trade-off between ovarian growth and biochemical preparation for flight (e. g. biosynthesis of triglyceride flight fuel), morphs {{did not differ in}} any aspect of amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism.</b> However, on day 5 of adulthood, when the morph-specific trade-off between ovarian growth and flight fuel production was manifest, the morphs differed substantially {{in each of the three}} aspects of amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> studied: conversion to protein, oxidation, and conversion to lipid. Morphs also differed in degree of allocation of products of amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> to ovaries vs. the soma. Most importantly, morphs differed in the relative metabolism of radiolabelled glycine through these pathways (i. e. biochemical trade-offs), and in the relative allocation of end products of amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> to the soma vs. ovaries (allocation trade-offs). A functionally important interaction between amino <b>acid</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> was noted: greater oxidation of amino acids in the flight-capable morph spared fatty acids for enhanced conversion into triglyceride flight fuel. By contrast, greater oxidation of fatty acids by the flightless morph spared amino acids for enhanced conversion into ovarian protein. Diet significantly affected amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism.</b> However, MORPH×DIET interactions were rare and morphs differed in amino <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> to a similar degree under the range of diets tested...|$|R
2500|$|Photorespiration {{can occur}} when the oxygen {{concentration}} is too high. RuBisCO cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, or CCMs. These include <b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism,</b> [...] carbon fixation, and pyrenoids. Chloroplasts in [...] plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.|$|E
2500|$|Water is [...] "consumed" [...] {{in plants}} by the {{processes}} of photosynthesis (see above) and transpiration. [...] The latter process (which is responsible for about 90% of water use) {{is driven by the}} evaporation of water from the leaves of plants. [...] Transpiration allows plants to transport water and mineral nutrients from the soil to growth regions, and also cools the plant. Diffusion of water vapour out of a leaf, the force that drives transpiration, is regulated by structures known as stomata. These structure also regulate the diffusion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the leaf, such that decreasing water loss (by partially closing stomata) also decreases carbon dioxide gain. [...] Certain plants use alternative forms of photosynthesis, called <b>Crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism</b> (CAM) and C4. These employ physiological and anatomical adaptations to increase water-use efficiency and allow increased primary production to take place under conditions that would normally limit carbon fixation by C3 plants (the majority of plant species).|$|E
2500|$|When {{molecular}} oxygen is the substrate, {{the products of}} the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called photorespiration, which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes (this is a case of metabolite repair). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as glycine. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5. [...] Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic capacity of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [...] carbon fixation, <b>crassulacean</b> <b>acid</b> <b>metabolism,</b> and the use of pyrenoid.|$|E

These chemical signatures reflect long-term dietary patterns, rather than a single meal or feast. Stable isotope analysis monitors the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 (13C/12C), which is expressed as parts per mil (per thousand) using delta notation (δ13C). [...] The ratio of carbon isotopes varies according to the types of plants consumed with different photosynthesis pathways.
