60|$|Only in the barn, far away, {{people were}} singing and {{laughing}} and making merry. Klara {{could hear the}} gipsy band, the scraping of the fiddles and banging of the <b>czimbalom,</b> followed now and then by one of those outbursts of jollity, of clapping of mugs on wooden tables, of banging of feet and shouts of laughter which characterize all festive gatherings in Hungary.|$|E
60|$|The gipsies were {{scraping}} their fiddles, blowing their clarionets {{and banging}} their <b>czimbalom</b> {{with all the}} vigour of which they were capable. They, at any rate, were determined to be heard above the din. The leader, with his violin under his chin, had already begun his round of the two huge tables, pausing for awhile behind every chair--just long enough to play into the ear of every single guest his or her favourite song.|$|E
60|$|A csárdás it must be, {{and of the}} liveliest! And {{after that}} another and yet another. Would it not be an awful pity to waste Erös Béla's money, {{even though he was}} not here to enjoy its fruits? So dancing was kept up till close on eight o'clock in the morning--till the sun was high up in the heavens and the bell of the village church tolled for early Mass. Until then the gipsies scraped their fiddles and banged their <b>czimbalom</b> almost uninterruptedly; {{hundreds}} of sad and gay folk-songs were sung in chorus in the intervals of dancing the national dance. Cotton petticoats of many hues fluttered, leather boots--both red and black--clinked and stamped until the morning.|$|E
60|$|The gipsy musicians, hot and perspiring, {{have blown}} and scraped and banged for fifteen solid hours; {{no one would}} ever think of {{suggesting}} that a gipsy needed rest; the clarinetist, it is true, rolled off his seat at one time, and had to be well shaken ere he could blow again, but the leader--as good a leader, mind you, as could be found in the kingdom--had only paused when the dancers were exhausted, or when bite and sup were placed before him. There they were, perched up on a rough platform made up of packing-cases borrowed from the station-master; the <b>czimbalom</b> player in the centre, his fat, brown hands wield the tiny clappers with unerring precision, up and down the strings, with that soft, lingering tone which partakes of the clavecins and the harp alike. At the back the double-bass, lean and dark, with jet-black eyes that stare stolidly at his leader.|$|E
