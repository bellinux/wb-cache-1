5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study <b>conducted</b> <b>earlier,</b> which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|Cavendish {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Harland & Wolff {{shipyard}} in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918. In June she was renamed Vindictive, the fifth ship of that name in the RN, to perpetuate {{the name of the}} old protected cruiser , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May. She commissioned on 1 October and, after briefly working up, joined the Grand Fleet's Flying Squadron on 18 October only {{a few weeks before the}} Armistice on 11 November. For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises, including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft, of which two were lost in accidents. The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet's last operational Sopwith Pup. Experiments <b>conducted</b> <b>earlier</b> aboard the larger , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels, had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed. Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2012, a {{poll by the}} Global Views Monthly {{indicated}} that support for Taiwanese independence has risen.

Asked whether Taiwan would eventually declare itself a new and independent nation, 49.1 percent replied yes while 38 percent responded negatively, the Global Views Monthly said. Only 22.9 percent agreed that Taiwan should eventually unify with China, while 63.5 percent disagreed.|$|E

500|$|State {{acceptance}} testing of two production aircraft was conducted between 27 January and 26 February 1941. They {{were found to}} be over [...] heavier than the MiG-1, which reduced maneuverability and field performance. Time to [...] decreased by over a minute and the service ceiling proved to be [...] less. The MiG-3 was faster at sea level and at altitude. While the ranges reached by both aircraft were farther than that of the older aircraft, they were still less than the [...] required. Mikoyan and Gurevich protested against the range results as their calculations showed that the MiG-3 could reach [...] based on a specific fuel consumption (SFC) of 0.46kg/km (1.64lb/mile). During the State acceptance trials the SFC was 0.48kg/km (1.71lb/mile) but the operational trials <b>conducted</b> <b>earlier</b> showed a SFC of 0.38kg/km (1.35lb/mile). They blamed the deficiency on a failure to use an altitude correction and that the engines had not been properly adjusted. They went as far as arranging for two more flights between Leningrad and Moscow to prove that the MiG-3 could fly 1,000km (621mi). Two production aircraft were flown on ranges of [...] and , flying at 90% of maximum speed and at an altitude of , contradicting the report of the NII VVS (Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Voyenno-Vozdooshnykh Seel—Air Force Scientific Test Institute).|$|E
500|$|The Mets' {{losing streak}} {{late in the}} season led Jayson Stark to label them a [...] "sinking ship" [...] in a column on September 30. However, the Mets broke this streak with a win over {{dominant}} pitcher Greg Maddux and then, following a loss, swept three games from the Pittsburgh Pirates. The sweep included a walk-off win in the final game of the series. The Mets and Pirates were tied 1–1 {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning when Pirates closer Brad Clontz threw a wild pitch which allowed Melvin Mora to score and win the game, 2–1, tying the Reds' 96–66 record. The New York Daily News described this late-season performance as an [...] "agonizing roller coaster ride" [...] for Mets fans. With the Mets and Reds holding the best non-division winning records in the league a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. Bob Costas said at the time he did not like the wild-card system as he believed it [...] "diminishes the drama and authenticity of a pennant race", although he approved of the playoff teams in 1999. Tim McCarver disagreed, arguing that the late-season race between the Mets, Astros, and Reds showed the excitement a wild card can add to the season. A coin flip <b>conducted</b> <b>earlier</b> that September set the Reds' home park of Cinergy Field as the location for the tie-breaker game.|$|E

Here also the number of lions, roaming loose through the thoroughfares, increased, and also for the first time Tarzan noted the idiosyncrasies of the people.|$|E
