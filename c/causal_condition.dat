The results show two types of corporate networks: cohesive corporate networks which are based on unification, centralization and strength ties; and dispersed corporate networks which are characterized by fragmentation, decentralization and single ties.

We test folk intuitions regarding the causal theory of perception by asking our participants to what extent they agree that they would ‘see’ an object in various Gricean scenarios.

Using objective measures of antecedents and outcomes, a large-scale study of exporting firms in the cut-flower industry in two South American countries (Colombia and Ecuador) supports the theory. The theory includes the following and additional propositions. No single (simple) -antecedent condition is sufficient for accurately predicting a high membership score in outcome conditions; the outcome conditions include a firm’s adoption or rejection of a product certification. No single (simple) -antecedent condition is necessary for accurately predicting high scores in the outcome condition. A few complex antecedent conditions (configurations) are sufficient but the occurrence of each is not necessary for accurately predicting high scores (e. g., adoption) in an outcome <b>condition.</b> <b>Causal</b> asymmetry of antecedent conditions indicating adoption versus non-adoption of specific ethical standards occurs—that is, <b>causal</b> <b>conditions</b> leading to rejection are not the mirror opposites of <b>causal</b> <b>conditions</b> leading to adoption...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{clarify the}} status of the {{so-called}} <b>causal</b> minimality <b>condition</b> in the theory of causal Bayesian networks, which has received much attention in the recent literature on the epistemology of causation. In doing so, we argue that the condition is well motivated in the interventionist (or manipulability) account of causation, assuming the <b>causal</b> Markov <b>condition</b> which is essential to the semantics of causal Bayesian networks. Our argument has two parts. First, we show that the <b>causal</b> minimality <b>condition,</b> rather than an add-on methodological assumption of simplicity, necessarily follows from the substantive interventionist theses, provided that the actual probability distribution is strictly positive. Second, we demonstrate that the <b>causal</b> minimality <b>condition</b> can fail when the actual probability distribution is not positive, {{as is the case in}} the presence of deterministic relationships. But we argue that the interventionist account still entails a pragmatic justification of the <b>causal</b> minimality <b>condition.</b> Our argument in the second part exemplifies a general perspective that we think commendable: when evaluating methods for inferring causal structures and their underlying assumptions, it is relevant to consider how the inferred causal structure will be subsequently used for counterfactual reasoning. 1...|$|R

40|$|Counterfactual {{analysis}} {{has a long}} and distinguished history in comparative research. To some, counterfactual analysis is central to comparative inquiry because such research typically embraces {{only a handful of}} empirical cases (Fearon 1991). If {{there are only a few}} instances (e. g., of revolution), then researchers, of necessity, must compare empirical cases to hypothetical cases. The affinity between counterfactual analysis and comparative research, however, derives not from its focus on small Ns, but from its configurational nature. Case-oriented explanations of outcomes are often combinatorial in nature, stressing specific configurations of causal conditions. Rather than focus on the net effects of causal conditions, case-oriented explanations emphasize their combined effects. To support an argument emphasizing combinations of causal conditions, it is necessary for researchers to compare cases that are closely matched with each other. The ideal comparison is between pairs of cases that differ on only one <b>causal</b> <b>condition</b> (Mill 1843). Such comparisons help researchers establish whether or not a specific <b>causal</b> <b>condition</b> is an integral part of the combination of conditions that generates the outcome in question.

Specifically, {{this study was designed to}} determine if participants experienced changed perceptions and behaviors resulting from the Agroecosystems Analysis Course. ^ Research questions were addressed via a triangulation validating quantitative data mixed methods approach, with a written survey comprised of both quantitative and open-ended questions serving as the evaluation document. Qualitative data garnered from the 2001 - 2007 Agroecosystems Analysis daily evaluations were also analyzed to locate and categorize central factors essential for the development of an experiential learning environment (N= 140). ^ Study participants consisted of students and instructors who participated in Agroecosystems Analysis. A matched study design method was utilized, with matched subjects serving as the control group to assist in the formation of baseline comparisons (N= 66). ^ Quantitative responses were collected and analyzed statistically using item analysis and ANCOVA. Qualitative responses were coded in accordance with grounded theory research practices. Although there was no significant difference between the responses of the course participants and the control group, five <b>causal</b> <b>conditions</b> were identified as playing a major role in creating an experiential environment more conducive to behavior change: hands-on experience, emotional response, human interaction, self-efficacy, and intensity of experience.
