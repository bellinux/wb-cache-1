5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, <b>critical</b> <b>care</b> <b>medicine,</b> emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergency}} physician, in German , {{must be a}} Physician with a Notfallmedizin (Emergency Medicine) board certification, {{issued by}} the State Chamber of Physicians. In order to obtain the board certification, a minimum term of residency in a specialty related to <b>critical</b> <b>care</b> <b>medicine,</b> additional training in techniques of anaesthetics and <b>critical</b> <b>care</b> <b>medicine</b> and the passing of a board examination is required. While the position is technically open to any physician who completes the board certification process, due to the inderdisciplinary nature of medical emergencies, most of the physicians employed as Notarzt are anaesthesiologists. The latter have mandatory service as a Notarzt during their specialty training.|$|E

25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} (usually simply {{referred to}} as intubation), an invasive medical procedure, is the placement of a flexible plastic catheter into the trachea. For millennia, tracheotomy was considered the most reliable (and most risky) method of tracheal intubation. By the late 19th century, advances in the sciences of anatomy and physiology, {{as well as the}} beginnings of an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had reduced the morbidity and mortality of this operation to a more acceptable rate. Also in the late 19th century, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved {{to such a degree that}} direct laryngoscopy had finally become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route.
