Comparison with IR extinction maps from the <b>c</b> 2 <b>d</b> <b>project</b> requires most of the gas to have a temperature of 8 - 10 K. Estimates of the cloud mass from 13 CO emission are roughly consistent with most previous estimates, while the line widths are higher, around 2 km/s. CO 4 - 3 emission is found throughout Lupus I, indicating widespread dense gas, and toward Lupus III and IV. Enhanced line widths at the NW end and {{along the edge of the}} B 228 ridge in Lupus I, and a coherent velocity gradient across the ridge, are consistent with interaction between the molecular cloud and an expanding HI shell from the Upper-Scorpius subgroup of the Sco-Cen OB Association. Lupus III is dominated by the effects of two HAe/Be stars, and shows no sign of external influence. Slightly warmer gas around the core of Lupus IV and a low line width suggest heating by the Upper-Centaurus-Lupus subgroup of Sco-Cen, without the effects of an HI shell.

Material and Methods: Diabetes was induced by a combination of ketamine (60 mg/Kg) and xylazine (10 mg/Kg) which induces a sustained hyperglycemia. Mice were divided into 12 groups: 1) control, 2) normal saline, 3 and 4) 50 mg/Kg <b>C.</b> <b>d,</b> 5 and 6) 100 mg/Kg <b>C.</b> <b>d,</b> 7) insulin, 8) insulin and <b>C.</b> <b>d,</b> 9) EMF (110 KHz, 700 ± 20 mG), 10) insulin and EMF, 11) EMF plus <b>C.</b> <b>d</b> and 12) insulin plus <b>C.</b> <b>d</b> and EMF. Blood glucose level was measured after 5 and 60 minutes in <b>C.</b> <b>d</b> administrated groups, and 5 minutes in the other groups by a glucometer set.

O veneno <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> ruruima foi purificado pela primeira vez através de HPLC em uma coluna Protein Pack SW 300, onde foi obtida a crotoxina e a crotamina (os demais venenos já foram purificados e os dados publicados). O estudo neurotóxico foi realizado em duas preparações nervo-frênico diafragma de camundongo e biventer cervicis de pintainho. Dos experimentos realizados em mamíferos e aves obteve-se o efeito neurotóxico esperado nas concentrações de 10 mg/ml. Os venenos brutos e as crotoxinas das {{serpentes}} <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> terrificus e <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> ruruima em preparações de mamífero produziram aumento da amplitude seguido de bloqueio total da resposta contrátil, diferentemente dos venenos e das crotoxinas das serpentes <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> cascaavella e <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> collilineatus, que causaram apenas bloqueio total neuromuscular. Em preparações de aves os quatro venenos e crotoxinas estudados induziram bloqueio total, porém sem causar facilitação. As crotaminas-positivas, estudadas em nervo-frenico diafragma de camundongo das serpentes <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> terrificus e <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> ruruima, na concentração de 10 mg/ml, causaram efeito facilitatório retornando à amplitude controle após 120 min de incubação. Ao recombinar a crotoxina 10 mg/ml e crotamina 5 mg/ml houve o aumento da amplitude seguido de bloqueio total da resposta contrátil. Nas preparações ensaiadas em aves, apresentou um efeito facilitatório fugaz seguido de bloqueio neuromuscular total. No segundo momento, as isoformas de crotapotina e PLA 2 isoladas a partir da crotoxina dos venenos das serpentes de <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> terrificus, <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> cascavella e <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> collilineatus, foram ensaiadas em mamíferos e aves nas concentrações de 10 mg/ml. As crotapotinas e PLA 2 isoladas não causaram diferenças significativas em relação ao controle em preparações de mamíferos. O mesmo não ocorrendo com as PLA 2 testadas em aves que causaram bloqueio neuromuscular, efeito este não esperado. Após a recombinação (5 mg/ml crotapotina) + (5 mg/ml PLA 2), o complexo crotoxina causou bloqueio neuromuscular total em ambas preparações. Na terceita etapa deste trabalho, foram produzidos antivenenos específicos contra o veneno bruto e crotoxina do veneno <b>C.</b> <b>d</b> ruruima e PLA 2 do veneno de <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> collilineatus. O título de anticorpos e a especificidade dos antivenenos produzidos foram avaliados por ELISA. A neutralização da atividade neurotóxica foi avaliada em preparações biventer cervicis de pintainho. A capacidade neutralizante dos antivenenos produzidos em coelhos foi comparável ao soro anticrotálico comercial contra o veneno e crotoxina na proporção 1 : 1.

In preparations of birds the four studied venoms and crotoxin had induced complete blockade, however without causing facilitation. The crotamine-positive, studied in nerve-frenico diaphragm of mouse of snakes <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> terrificus and <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> ruruima, in the concentration of 10 mg/ml, had caused facilitatori effect returning to the 120 after amplitude have controlled min of incubation. When crotoxin being recombined 10 mg/ml and 5 crotamine mg/ml had the increase of the followed amplitude of complete blockade of the contractil reply. In the preparations assayed in birds, fast followed of blockade presented a facilitatori effect to neuromuscular complete. At as the moment, isoforms of isolated crotapotin and PLA 2 from the crotoxin of the venoms of the rastnakes of <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> terrificus, <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> cascavella and <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> collilineatus, had been assayed in mammals and birds in the concentrations of 10 mg/ml.

We show that all a. u. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> spaces with $ 1 $-FDD are isometric and contain isometric $ 1 $-complemented copies of every separable Banach space with $ 1 $-FDD. Both assertions fail without the FDD assumption. We then study spaces of universal complemented disposition (u. <b>c.</b> <b>d.)</b> and provide different constructions for such spaces. We also consider spaces of u. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> with respect to separable spaces. In the last section we consider $p$-Banach versions of all previous constructions showing that there are striking differences with either the Banach case or the classical case of simple universal disposition...|$|R

Introduction. In their attempt, to deduce the parallel postulate from the other ax-ioms of Euclid, G. Saccheri and H. J.

40|$|Abstract. Call <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> -group a {{completely}} decomposable Abelian group of finite rank. Butler’s Theorem {{proves that the}} class of pure subgroups of <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> groups equals the class of torsionfree quotients of <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> -groups. While one implication of the equivalence is proved by an applicable construction, {{the other is a}} far from applicable finite induction, and even its later proof in Arnold’s book is not constructive. We give an alternative proof of this implication by providing a workable algorithm, which minimizes the construction in certain cases, building not only the <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> container of the Butler group but also the inclusion morphism...|$|R

M. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> magnetization curves determined at different wavelengths reveal the presence of two paramagnetic species. Curves at 576, 613 and 640 nm fit well to those expected for an x,y-polarized haem transition with g values of 3. 03, 2. 21 and 1. 45, i. e. cytochrome a 3 +. The m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> features at 515, 785 and 817 nm magnetize as a S = 1 / 2 paramagnet with average g values close to 2, and simulated m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> magnetization curves obtained by using the observed g values of CuA 2 +, i. e. 2. 18, 2. 03 and 1. 99, fit well to the experimental observations. The form of the m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> magnetization curve at 466 nm is curious, {{but it can be}} explained if CuA 2 + and cytochrome a 3 + contribute with oppositely signed bands at this wavelength. By comparing the m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> spectrum of the enzyme with that of extracted haem a-bisimidazole complex it has been possible to deconvolute the m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> spectrum of CuA 2 +, which shows transitions throughout the spectral region from 450 to 950 nm. The m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> -spectral properties of CuA 2 + were compared with those of a well-defined type I blue copper centre in azurin isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The absolute intensities of the m. <b>c.</b> <b>d.</b> signals at equal fields and temperatures for CuA 2 + are 10 - 20 -fold greater than those for azurin. The optical spectrum of CuA 2 + strongly suggests an assignment as a d 9 ion rather than Cu(I) bound to a thiyl radical...|$|R
