A proportion {{of these elements}} had a coherent orientation (horizontal/vertical) with the remainder assigned random orientations. The observer's task was to identify the global orientation. The spatial configuration of the signal was modulated by a checkerboard pattern of square checks containing potential signal elements. The other locations contained either randomly oriented elements (''noise check'') or were blank (''blank check''). The distribution of signal elements was manipulated by varying the size and location of the checks within a fixed-diameter stimulus. An ideal detector would only pool responses from potential signal elements. Humans did this for medium <b>check</b> <b>sizes</b> and for large <b>check</b> <b>sizes</b> when a signal was presented in the fovea.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} different stimulus frame rates and <b>check</b> <b>sizes</b> on blue−yellow multifocal visual evoked potentials (mVEP). Methods:  Subjects were examined at the Save Sight Institute at the University Sydney. Experiment 1 involved five adult subjects who underwent binocular stimulation by the Accumap multifocal objective perimeter. The eyes were stimulated with a cortically scaled dartboard pattern consisting of isoluminant blue and yellow checks. These were arranged in three concentric rings extending to an eccentricity of 26 ° in the visual field. The stimulus pattern was driven by binary sequences resulting in pseudorandom binary exchange of two opposite checkerboard patterns at each of the 32 sites in the visual field. The mVEP were recorded at two different rates of display of the pattern stimulus. In experiment 2, mVEP were tested on 10 normal subjects. Each of the 36 stimulation sites contained a checkerboard pattern of 20, 30, 42 or 56 checks/site, the stimulation pattern was displayed at the optimum rate found in experiment 1. The <b>size</b> of the <b>checks</b> was inversely proportional to the number of checks per site. Results: In experiment 1, the slow frame rate significantly increased the average amplitude throughout the field tested by 50 ± 10. 1 % (P = 0. 001). Latency was significantly shortened by 6. 3 % (P < 0. 01). In experiment 2, the average amplitude peaked at 30 checks per segment; however, this was only calculated to be significantly different from the smallest <b>check</b> <b>size</b> (Fcrit range 4, 27 = 0. 09 P < 0. 05, anova, Tukey's T method). A similar difference was found in ring 1 (Fcrit range 4, 27 = 0. 09, P < 0. 05, anova, Tukey's T method). In ring 2, however, there was also a significant difference between 56 checks and 20, 30 and 42 (Fcrit range 4, 27 = 0. 09, anova, P < 0. 05). Altering the <b>check</b> <b>sizes</b> did not significantly affect the amplitudes in ring 3. The latencies were not significantly modified by altering <b>check</b> <b>size</b> at any eccentricity.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that low ambient lighting conditions increase the amplitude of the PERG, but no data has been available on this issue. We recorded the transient PERG (0. 8 ◦ <b>check</b> <b>size)</b> and steady-state PERG (15 rev/s, 0. 8 ◦ and 16 ◦ <b>check</b> <b>size)</b> under three lighting conditions: dark room, only illuminated by the stimulus (resulting in 30 lux), our standard room lighting (windows occluded, one lighted lamp, 200 lux) and fully lit room (full ceiling illumination with eight fluorescent tubes) resulting in rather bright 2300 lux. The stimulus luminance was 50 cd/m 2. The sequence of lighting conditions varied for each subject and followed a balanced permutation of an ABCCBA scheme. Results showed a significant effect (P< 0. 01) across lighting conditions, with no relevant difference between the 30 and 200 lux conditions, but a reduction down to 70 % at the 2300 lux condition. This obtained across all <b>check</b> <b>sizes</b> and temporal conditions. As an example, the transient PERG P 50 -amplitudes were as follows: dark, 5. 6 ± 0. 8 µV; medium, 5. 3 ± 0. 6 µV and bright, 3. 8 ± µV (mean ± SEM). Peak times decreased significantly with illumination (dark, medium or bright) : 45. 9 ± 0. 9, 43. 1 ± 0. 6 or 40. 8 ± 0. 8 ms. Contrast measurements quantitatively explained the noticeable reduction of PERG amplitude at the brightest illumination level simply by straylight, which reduced the display contrast. This suggests that bright sunlight should be excluded, and that lighting conditions should be moderately standardized at low or medium luminance levels for reproducible amplitudes and peak times...|$|R

Local orientation signals can be pooled over a texture to estimate global orientation, with psychophysical performance improving {{as a function of}} signal area. We used a novel stimulus to investigate how orientation signals are combined over space (whether observers could ignore signalsfrom irrelevant locations), and the effect of spatial configuration on this pooling. Stimuli were 24 × 24 element arrays of 4 c/deg log-Gabors, spaced 1 degree apart. A proportion of these elements had a coherent orientation (horizontal/vertical), with the remainder assigned random orientations. The observer’s task was to identify the global orientation. The spatial configuration of the signal was modulated by a checkerboard-like pattern of square checks containing either potential signal elements or only irrelevant noise. The distribution of signal elements within the array was manipulated by varying the size and location of these checks within a fixed-diameter stimulus. A blocked staircase procedure found the threshold coherence for identification.

Full optometric screening was imple-mented to identify two age groups: younger adults (n = 12, mean age 21) and older adults (n = 13, mean age 71). Frequency-domain Multi-distance (FD-MD) functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure absolute changes in oxygenated [HbO] and deoxygenated [HbR] haemoglobin concentrations in the occipital cortices. Utilising a slow event-related design, subjects viewed a full field reversing checkerboard with contrast and <b>check</b> <b>size</b> manipulations (15 and 30 minutes of arc, 50 % and 100 % contrast).

40|$|AbstractIsodipole textures are {{pairs of}} texture {{ensembles}} whose autocorrelations, and hence power spectra, are equal. Examples of readily discriminable isodipole textures are well known. Such discriminations appear to require feature extraction, since the isodipole condition eliminates ensemble differences in spatial frequency content. We studied {{the effects of}} phase decorrelation on VEP indices of discrimination of isodipole texture pairs. Phase decorrelation, which ranged from 0. 125 π radians (slight randomization) to π radians (complete randomization), was introduced in two ways: by independent jittering of each spatial Fourier component, and by a product method, which preserved correlations among certain quadruples of spatial Fourier components, despite pairwise decorrelation. For the even/random isodipole texture pair, independent phase decorrelation greater than 0. 5 π radians markedly reduced VEP indices of texture discrimination for all <b>check</b> <b>sizes,</b> and eliminated them entirely for <b>check</b> <b>sizes</b> of 8 min or greater. However, the product method preserved texture discrimination signals even with complete pairwise randomization of spatial phases. For the triangle/random isodipole texture pair, both kinds of phase decorrelation eliminated VEP indices of texture discrimination. These results imply that isodipole texture discrimination is based on fundamentally local processing, and not on global Fourier amplitudes—since the phase manipulations which eliminate texture discrimination preserve the Fourier amplitudes. The dependence of the antisymmetric response component (the odd harmonics) on phase decorrelation and texture type {{is consistent with a}} previously proposed model for feature extraction, and leads to constraints on how texture processing is modulated by contrast.

The influence of optical defocus was investigated in 11 normal individuals at three eccentricities. For a defocus of + 4. 00 DS, sensitivity without the noise mask declined by approximately 1 dB; with the noise mask sensitivity increased by 1 dB. The original ‘Proof of Concept’ threshold algorithm, which enabled the estimation of threshold at one location in approximately 3 minutes, underwent numerous modifications. The final iteration permitted threshold estimation at 45 locations in approximately 7 minutes. Five of the ten individuals with open angle glaucoma who had undergone DNP and standard automated perimetry (SAP) in 2007 were re-examined, using an identical protocol, after a follow-up of four years. The abnormality with DNP at baseline {{was present at the}} follow-up in all five individuals and was more severe in 3 individuals. Only 2 individuals exhibited abnormality by SAP. The influence of the learning effect on the outcome of DNP was evaluated, in one designated eye at each of the five weekly visits, for 10 ‘young’ and 8 ‘elderly’ normal individuals naïve to perimetry. Optimum performance was essentially achieved at the third visit without and with the noise mask...|$|R
5000|$|The sweep {{technique}} is a hybrid frequency domain/time domain technique. A plot of, for example, response amplitude versus the <b>check</b> <b>size</b> of a stimulus checkerboard pattern plot {{can be obtained}} in 10 seconds, far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes.In the original demonstration of the technique the sine and cosine products were fed through lowpass filters (as when recording a SSEP [...] ) while viewing a pattern of fine checks whose black and white squares exchanged place six times per second. Then {{the size of the}} squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus <b>check</b> <b>size</b> (hence [...] "sweep"). Subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency.A single sweep may be adequate or {{it may be necessary to}} average the graphs obtained in several sweeps with the averager triggered by the sweep cycle. Averaging 16 sweeps can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the graph by a factor of four.The sweep technique has proved useful in measuring rapidly adapting visual processes and also for recording from babies, where recording duration is necessarily short. Norcia and Tyler have used the technique to document the development of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity through the first years of life. They have emphasized that, in diagnosing abnormal visual development, the more precise the developmental norms, the more sharply can the abnormal be distinguished from the normal, and to that end have documented normal visual development in a large group of infants. For many years the sweep technique has been used in paediatric ophthalmology (electrodiagnosis) clinics worldwide.|$|R
