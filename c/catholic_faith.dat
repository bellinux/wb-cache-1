5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France.

Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Church's {{power was}} further {{weakened}} by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by the works of German theologian Martin Luther, an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman <b>Catholic</b> <b>faiths.</b> This {{eventually led to the}} Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.
