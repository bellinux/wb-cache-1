5|$|Carrots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> {{for several}} months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can {{be placed in a}} bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E

50|$|Shelf-stable food (sometimes ambient food) is food of a {{type that}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> safely <b>stored</b> at room {{temperature}} in a sealed container. This includes foods that would normally <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> refrigerated but which have been processed so that they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> safely <b>stored</b> at room or ambient temperature for a usefully long shelf life. For instance, the first shelf-stable formulation of ranch dressing, created in 1983, had a shelf life of 150 days.|$|R
5|$|Commercially, apples <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> {{for some}} months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide}} and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the {{taxonomy}} of the genus, {{as the number of}} accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.maxima, C.moschata, and C.pepo. All of these can be treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> for months; however, C.pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.|$|E

In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, {{the result of a}} secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division {{by the use of}} 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a stamina gauge, which constantly depletes during gameplay. Failure to restore the gauge by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles. Food <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in the backpack until it is needed. However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the stamina gauge to deplete faster.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, {{all types of}} resources <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored,</b> some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E
5|$|Xenon is the {{preferred}} propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL's Deep Space 1 probe, Europe's SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA's Dawn Spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|During the story, Tommy meets {{characters}} from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may {{engage in activities}} such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards. As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored.</b> There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a film studio, a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs. Each commercial property {{has a number of}} missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
5|$|The family Cucurbitaceae {{has many}} species used as human food. Cucurbita species are some {{one of the}} most {{important}} of those, with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and seeds of cultivated varieties are quite edible and need little or no preparation. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> for long periods of time, particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, inedible skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into pumpkin seed oil, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared.|$|E

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> and processed.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of female insects {{consist of a}} pair of ovaries, accessory glands, one or more spermathecae, and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E
