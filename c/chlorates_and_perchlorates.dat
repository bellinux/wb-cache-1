40|$|Abstract The {{response}} {{behavior of}} three dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria to different electron acceptors (nitrate, <b>chlorate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate)</b> was investigated with two different assays. The observed response was species-specific, {{dependent on the}} prior growth conditions, and was inhibited by oxygen. We observed attraction toward nitrate when Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB and Azospira suillum strain PS were grown with nitrate. When D. aromatica and Dechloromonas agitata strain CKB were grown with perchlorate, both responded to nitrate, <b>chlorate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate.</b> When A. suillum was grown with perchlorate, the organism responded to <b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate</b> but not nitrate. A gene replacement mutant in the perchlorate reductase subunit (pcrA) of D. aromatica resulted {{in a loss of}} the attraction response toward perchlorate but had no impact on the nitrate response. Washed-cell suspension studies revealed that the perchlo-rate grown cells of D. aromatica reduced both <b>perchlorate</b> <b>and</b> nitrate, while A. suillum cells reduced perchlorate only. Based on these observations, energy taxis was proposed as the underlying mechanism for the responses to (per) chlorate by D. aromatica. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of the response behavior of perchlorate-reducing bacteria to environmental stimuli. It clearly demonstrates attraction toward chlorine oxyanions and the unique ability of these organisms to distinguish structurally analogous compounds, nitrate, <b>chlorate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate</b> <b>and</b> respond accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Chlorine salts (e. g. chlorides, <b>chlorates</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorates)</b> are an {{important}} factor in the stability of water on the surfaces of planetary bodies. Here we have shown that perchlorate and chlorate salts will lower the freezing point of water, allowing it to be liquid down to ~ 204 K. These salts will also slow down the evaporation rate, extending the lifetime of the liquid water solution. Chlorine salts have been detected on Mars, which has significant implications for the stability of water and hence its habitability. To study their effects on the stability of water on planetary surfaces, we need to first locate where these chlorine salts exist; this is typically done by remote sensing. To date, only anhydrous chlorides have been remotely detected, mostly {{due to the lack of}} hydrated chlorine salts in the spectral libraries used to identify features. To address this deficit, we measured reflectance spectra for numerous chlorine salts. Hydration bands were most common in near-infrared spectra, with band depth and width increasing with increasing hydration state. In the mid-infrared, oxychlorine salts exhibit spectral features due to Cl-O vibrations. We also investigated the spectral features of these salts at low temperature (80 K) to compare with remote sensing data of the outer satellites, specifically Europa. At low temperature, water bands become narrower and shallower than their room temperature counterparts. We show that chlorine salts do possess distinct spectral features that should allow for their detection by remote sensing, though care must be taken to acquire laboratory spectra of all hydrated phases at the relevant conditions (e. g. temperature, pressure) for the planetary body being studied...|$|E

The time evolution of chlorine species (i. e. active chlorine, chlorite, chlorine dioxide, <b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate),</b> {{as well as}} their faradic efficiency, were investigated to understand whether their formation and consumption was either chemical or electrochemical. Different current efficiency profiles were generally observed for the two explored electrode materials, when the applied current density and the temperature were varied in the above reported experimental intervals. At the Ti/RuO 2. 2 SnO 2 (especially at the lowest current density), similar current efficiencies for the synthesis of active chlorine <b>and</b> <b>chlorate</b> were estimated. On the contrary, rather low current efficiencies for active chlorine and high current efficiencies for <b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate</b> were measured at the Ti/Pt electrode. The concentration trends of <b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate</b> indicated that the electrochemical route was responsible for their presence in the bulk solution, instead of a chemical path. This insight was corroborate by the measured anodic potentials: high values for the anode potential were indeed related to high current efficiencies for <b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate.</b> The low concentration levels (and thus low current efficiencies) assessed for chlorite and chlorine dioxide throughout the tests were not useful for discriminating between a chemical and an electrochemical depletion processes; however, further potentiodynamic tests suggested that chlorites are highly reactive towards both anodic and cathodic surfaces, thus suggesting that the electrochemical path of depletion could prevail over the chemical one.

While concerns remain over formation of toxic byproducts during treatment, rigorous studies examining byproduct formation are lacking. Experiments treating authentic latrine wastewater over variable treatment times, current densities, chloride concentrations, and anode materials were conducted to characterize byproducts and identify conditions that minimize their formation. Production of inorganic byproducts (<b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate)</b> <b>and</b> indicator organic byproducts (haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes) during electrolysis dramatically exceeded recommendations for drinking water after one treatment cycle (∼ 10 – 30   000 times), raising concerns for contamination of downstream water supplies. Stopping the reaction after ammonium was removed (i. e., the chlorination breakpoint) was a promising method to minimize byproduct formation without compromising disinfection and nutrient removal.

The results at BDD anodes show that low current densities and perfect mixing of the system should be adopted {{in order to obtain}} high values of the concentration of oxidising agents avoiding the formation of such undesired by-products as chlorite, <b>chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate</b> ions. Runs were also performed in which BDD was substituted by a commercial (Ti/RuO 2) DSA anode and the results obtained with the two materials are compared...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chlorate</b> <b>and</b> <b>perchlorate</b> pollutions {{have become}} {{a problem in the}} {{environment}} in the last decades. Studies have shown that some bacteria can degrade these substances into unharmful substances such as chloride and molecular oxygen. One of these chlorate degrading bacteria is Ideonella dechloratans that uses <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>and</b> chlorite dismutase to process chlorate. In the promoter gene sequence of chlorite dismutase there might be regulator sequences such as fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator (FNR) and aerobic respiration control protein (ArcA) that might control the transcription of this enzyme. This promoter sequence was placed in a pBBR 1 MCS- 4 -LacZ reporter vector and the possible regulatory sequences were changed through site-directed mutagenesis and tested on activity through beta-galactosidase assays. The changes in the FNR binding sequence gave beta-galactosidase activity that was close to a negative control which might give conclusions that either FNR has an important role or {{an important part of the}} promoter was hit. The changes in the ArcA regulator binding sequence did not give such big differences and no certainty can be given if this made important changes to the promoter...|$|R
