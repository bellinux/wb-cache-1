50|$|Flor and Ongkiko (1998), {{in their}} book- Introduction to Development <b>Communication,</b> <b>state</b> that {{development}} communication is purposive as it primarily uses communication {{not merely to}} give information but practically to influence the people- the receivers of information. Coyle (2008), in his article- Theory of Development Communication, articulates that where people have options to change their ways of life, communication becomes important in informing, persuading, listening, data gathering, educating, training and managing change. Communication then becomes an instrument in facilitating changes in people {{in order for them}} to realize their full potentials. Through it, people would improve their ways of thinking, their ways of acting and their ways of living resulting in a higher quality of life. In agreement, McKee (1992) explicated that the central objective of policy sciences is helping people make better decisions.|$|E

In our design, processes in distributed computation communicate one another via message passing and are migration-enabled. Due to mobility, mechanisms to maintain reliability and correctness of data communication are needed. Following an event-based approach, such mechanisms are derived to handle various communication situations when a process migrates. These mechanisms collectively preserve the semantics of the communicationand support efficient <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> transfer. ...|$|E

40|$|Wide-area {{distributed}} systems offer {{new opportunities for}} executing large-scale scientific applications. On these systems, communication mechanisms {{have to deal with}} dynamic resource availability and the potential for resource and network failures. Connectivity losses can affect the execution of workflow applications, which require reliable data transport between components. We present the design and implementation of π-channels, an asynchronous and fault-tolerant pipe mechanism suitable for coupling workflow components. Fault-tolerant communication is made possible by persistence, through adaptive caching of pipe segments while providing direct data streaming. We present the distributed algorithm for implementing: (a) caching of pipe data segments; (b) asynchronous read operation; and (c) <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> transfer to handle dynamic process joins and leaves. Through <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> transfer, pipe segments from the cache and the writer can be concurrently streamed to the reader. Finally, we present an evaluation of the π-channel implementation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{gain insight}} into patient-perceived {{communication}} barriers and facilitators at different stages after the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. We have detected patterns to explain when these factors influence communication predominantly. Method: A qualitative approach was applied, derived from the context mapping framework. A total of 28 patients completed a set of assignments about their experiences with provider-patient communication during medical consultations. Subsequently, these patients and nine companions shared their experiences during a semistructured (group) interview, which was recorded on audiotape. The audiotapes and assignments were analysed with MAXQDA software. Results: From the patients' viewpoint, communicating effectively appears to depend on their own attributes (e. g. emotions), the health care professionals' attributes (e. g. attitude) and external factors (e. g. time pressure). Three patient <b>communication</b> <b>states</b> were identified: (i) overwhelmed, passive; (ii) pro-active, self-motivated; and (iii) proficient, empowered. Patients seem to behave differently in the three <b>communication</b> <b>states.</b> Conclusions: This study lists patient-perceived communication barriers and facilitators and identifies three different <b>communication</b> <b>states,</b> which indicate when certain barriers and facilitators are encountered. Practical implications: These findings may support health care professionals to tailor the provision of support and information and remove communication barriers accordingly. Additionally, they provide input for interventions to support patients in effective communication. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

This paper presents a set of data communication and process migration protocols to support <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> transfer in a dynamic, distributed parallel environment. The protocols preserve semantics of point-to-point communication; they guarantee message delivery, maintain message ordering, and do not introduce deadlock when blocking send or receive operations are performed during process migration. Analytical proofs and prototype implementation are conducted to confirm the correctness of the protocols. Analytical and experimental results show the proposed design is valid and has a true potential in network computing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- There are {{considerable}} serious {{propagation delay}} rate and high error rate {{in case of}} data transmission in the poor and causal environment, such as underwater. Like this environment usually has heavy fluctuation of error rate and limited wireless <b>communication</b> <b>state.</b> Therefore, mechanism using in such environment has to be efficient and simple. This paper suggests a novel block ack mechanism, called the Pervasive Block ACK (PBA), which transmits aggregated ACKs. This mechanism takes effect on {{reducing the amount of}} traffic, decreasing overhead and delay rate in poor environment networks like underwater. Additionally, we are able to look forward to reducing the energy consumption of whole network. We can find the proposed PBA is more efficient than other methods, such as BA and ARQ through analyzing numerical result based analytical formula in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} and efficiency {{aspects of a}} distributed application protocol (e. g., replicated data access, decentralized commit) are often intertwined with the application-specific communication requirements between protocol entities and the underlying support for communication. For example, the choice between recovery by application from a mis-ordered message delivery versus providing message ordering property in the communication layer (CL) is based on tradeoffs between protocol {{complexity and}} efficiency. The paper systematically analyzes these tradeoffs in a quantitative manner. The analysis is based on message ordering and atomicity, which refer to consistent event ordering at protocol entities. Enforcing these properties in the CL leads to uniform communication structure of applications. However, the CL incurs message and execution time overhead due {{to the need to}} maintain extensive <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> (e. g., message sequencing). When these properties are not supported by CL but a [...] ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Internet Engineering Task Force {{proposed}} a Network based Local Mobility Management (NETLMM) scheme called Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) to provide efficient mobility {{support for the}} IPv 6 enabled nodes, without {{the involvement of the}} nodes themselves. Here the burden of maintaining the mobility is transferred from Mobile Nodes(MNs) to the networking architecture. But frequently moving MNs suffered from considerable latency and packet loss during handovers even within the PMIPv 6 domain. The number of signalling messages required for handover was also high. A <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> dependent chaining scheme is used in this paper to meet these inherent drawbacks of PMIPv 6 domain and is called the Chaining Based PMIPv 6 (CB-PMIPv 6). Here the Mobility Access Gateways(MAGs) are chained to support movements within the PMIPv 6 domain. Packet loss is mitigated by using a buffering scheme and handover latency is reduced {{with the help of a}} triggering scheme...|$|E
40|$|Behaviorism {{as defined}} in 1913 by John B. Watson was a science that used repeated, {{observable}} human activity to develop hypotheses that would eventually predict and control responses. Through repeated experiments, Watson developed a thorough knowledge of what he defined as base human reactions. Stanley Resor, then president of J. Walter Thompson Agency, hired Watson to promote a partnership between advertising and science, and the subsequent 15 years of Watson’s career included some notable scientific contributions. This study shows that though these outcomes may not have provided many measurable positive results, they set into motion industry-wide change that continued to develop until the present. The study also argues that though behavioristic principles may not have found solid footing in a mass media environment, the current networked <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> provides much more fertile ground for analyzing message receivers and eliciting desired responses.

40|$|Wireless {{low-power}} {{embedded devices}} are populating indoor environments, where everyday activities drastically impact communication. We explore a statistical approach to iden-tify {{changes to the}} communication links state during system operation. The long-term behavior of the link RSSI is mod-eled with a normal distribution and compared against {{the model of the}} most recent measurements. A Welch’s t-Test is then employed to identify whether the short-term and long-term link evolutions stem from the same distribution. Upon significant divergence, the long-term model is updated and a significant change in the underlying <b>communication</b> <b>state</b> is inferred. We investigate this technique to efficiently store a compressed fingerprint of the evolution of communication. Considering the memory constraints of low-power embed-ded systems, this approach allows to gather extensive in-formation on the behavior of communication directly from the deployed network. This fingerprint could then be used to replay the network dynamics in simulation. We imple-mented the introduced techniques to prove their feasibility. In controlled experiments, we evaluate the reactivity and sensitivity of the approach to changes in the environment, as well as the accuracy of the resulting channel fingerprint...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Improving the {{traditional}} remote monitoring system requires {{the implementation of}} a wireless sensor front-end and to develop communication server and client applications. All the relevant control devices must be developed parallel to one another, which likely entails involved developments and difficulty in controlling the development cycle as well as cost. Based on the Ayla IOT (Internet Of Things) cloud platform, this paper proposes a design method of the remote monitoring system for boilers. The Ayla cloud platform provides the standard IOT control services that are idea for this task, for it only allows for the development of crucial elements such as the front controller, client application, Internet-based <b>communication,</b> <b>state</b> synchronization, as well as message driven, SNS release, database storage, and short message gateways. What’s more, these functions do not require separate developments, which greatly reduce the burden of parallel development of within an IOT remote control system. This in turn reduces costs and maintenance. Furthermore, the solution system can also be applied to the wireless control systems of electronic control devices, which should further anticipate its far reaching applications...|$|E

The agencies have no authority to impose ecosystem management on private land, and the challenge is to convince property owners of the benefits of EM. According to Coggins, private property rights are not absolute, are subject to the rights of other community members, and the Supreme Court has generally favored social interest. However, in recent years the judiciary has moved more toward a property-rights position. Coggins stressed that much of public input will be adversarial and antagonistic to public agencies. He believes that new legislation will be needed to define the level of public participation. While stressing the importance of collaboration between agencies and other groups, Thomas pointed out the impediments posed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
