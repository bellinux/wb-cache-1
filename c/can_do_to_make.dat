2500|$|A {{variation}} of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section {{to the game}} that either already existed in the game's code or was recently developed after the game had already been released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, {{and other things that}} weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is Bungie's most recent game, Destiny, when they released the [...] expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, higher levels, and also remade old missions so that the difficulty would be meet the new levels that were added to the characters. Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game all together. Developers at times plan out their games life and already have the code for the expansion in the game but inaccessible by players and they would unlock the expansions as time went on to the players, sometimes at no extra cost and other times it costs extra to get the expansion. There are also some developers who make the game and then make the expansions as time goes on so that they could see what the players would like to have and what they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the game better. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, an example of that is Ubisoft's expansion [...] Freedom's Cry which takes place control of a different character than that of the original game.|$|E

2500|$|The {{versions}} of the game for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One have better graphics and more memory than their counterparts for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. When discussing the additional power of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, John Vignocchi stated [...] "I’d say, specifically related to Xbox One, the graphical prowess of that system is incredible. So, we’re looking at what we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure the game looks incredible on [...] From a features perspective, I’d say the thing we’re most excited about is that players {{are going to be}} able to create Toy Boxes now that are much, much larger than they were before," [...] and [...] "In terms of what we're doing with , we're planning on making use of the graphical prowess of those machines — they can pump out some amazing-looking graphics. In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint. In Disney Infinity there were certain platforms that were constrained by the amount of RAM, so people couldn't truly build the toy box of their dreams. We've optimized the engine to allow the last-gen, PS3 and 360, to still build compelling Toy Box levels, but with Xbox One and PS4, the sky's the limit." [...] The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 {{versions of}} the game are more advanced than the others, as executive producer John Vignocchi said [...] "one of the most unique features of Disney Infinity 2.0 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, just because of the memory footprint of those systems, is that the size of the toy boxes you can create are just gigantic." [...] The game engine is improved and expanded.|$|E
