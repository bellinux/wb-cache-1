The purpose of <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> is filled into a cold formed steel section to contribute to the environmentally friendly with reasonable strength and can also reduce production costs without concrete beams. The cold-formed steel material is selected and combined with the <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> to construct the beam that could increase the ultimate moment. <b>Compacted</b> <b>soil</b> from the Kaolinite group is prepared and tested to find out its properties. Two cold-formed steel channels are connected face to face to form a built-up box section, tightened with bolts and nuts. Three different bolt spacing arrangements are prepared. The main purpose of the study is to determine the ultimate load of the beam with and without <b>compacted</b> <b>soil,</b> as well as to investigate the relationship of the bolt spacing arrangement to ultimate load resistance. From the result, built-up CFS beam with <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> (CFSBCS) showed higher values of the ultimate moment compared to built-up CFS beam without <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> (CFSB). Bolt arrangement in the middle spacing influenced the overall ultimate load resistance of the beam.

We conducted a study on an urban park soil to investigate how compaction impacts denitrification. By using N- 15 labeling method and acetylene inhibition technique, we performed three coherent incubation experiments to quantify denitrification in <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Uncompacted soil was set as the control treatment. When monitoring soil incubation without extra substrate, higher nitrous oxide (N 2 O) flux and denitrification enzyme activity were observed in the <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> than in the uncompacted soil. In aerobic incubation {{with the addition of}} (KNO 3) -N- 15, N 2 O production in the <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> reached 10. 11 ng N h(- 1) g(- 1) as compared to 0. 02 ng N h(- 1) g(- 1) in the uncompacted soil.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{vesicular-arbuscular}} mycorrhizal (VAM) colonisation on phosphorus (P) uptake {{and growth of}} clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) in response to soil compaction were studied in three pot experiments. P uptake and growth of the plants decreased as the bulk density of the soil increased from 1. 0 to 1. 6 Mg m⁻³. The strongest effects of soil compaction on P uptake and plant growth were observed at the highest P application (60 mg kg⁻¹ soil). The main observation {{of this study was}} that at low P application (15 mg kg⁻¹ soil), P uptake and shoot dry weight of the plants colonised by Glomus intraradices were greater than those of non-mycorrhizal plants at similar levels of compaction of the soil. However, the mycorrhizal growth response decreased proportionately as soil compaction was increased. Decreased total P uptake and shoot dry weight of mycorrhizal clover in <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> were attributed to the reduction in the root length. Soil compaction had no significant effect on the percentage of root length colonised. However, total root length colonised was lower (6. 6 m pot⁻¹) in highly <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> than in slightly <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> (27. 8 m pot⁻¹).

50|$|The {{gametophyte}} of L. obscurum is disc shaped prothallus, measuring {{an average}} of 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) in diameter. It closely resembles other gametophytes of genus Lycopodium, so it cannot be identified by gametophyte alone. Doing so would be difficult nonetheless, as this type of gametophyte grows only underground, years after a disturbance has taken place. Therefore, the <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> caused by repeated human traffic would disturb these areas, causing L. obscurum spores not to germinate and existing gametophyes to be damaged or killed.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{pathogen}} {{is in the}} soil, avoid fluctuation in moisture, <b>compact</b> <b>soil,</b> and prevent flooding by providing good drainage. Specifically, keep {{the tops of the}} bed dry to avoid the fruit rot.This will provide a less than ideal environment for {{the pathogen}} to survive and grow. Crop rotations every 3 to 4 years can be another alternative to control the disease. Since the pathogen is found in the soil, avoiding contact of the fruit with the soil can decrease infection. You can do this by using plant stakes or support cages that will hang the plants above the soil. Another control is mulching with newspapers, plastic, and other materials that will prohibit soil from splashing up on the plants during heavy rainfall.|$|E
50|$|Turf {{necrotic}} ring pathogen requires cooler temperatures. The {{temperatures of}} {{spring and fall}} are ideal for this pathogen, as they are cool to warm and damp. The pathogen also requires soils lower in nitrogen (2). Factors such as high soil pH and the correct level of moisture are critical {{for the development of}} this disease. So fertilizer and watering frequency (or infrequency) are crucial environmental factors for this pathogen. However, it is possible for this fungal pathogen to grow past the growing season and throughout summer. O. korrae certainly benefits from thicker and more <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> layers. It also benefits from thicker thatch layers (11). To summarize, the conditions that provide the most severity for this disease are environments of cooler temperatures, high dense thatch, a lower mowing height, and incorrect application and timing of fertilization (Nitrogen content too low) (11). Excessive watering may also promote disease growth.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{temporary}} haul {{roads and}} landings in west-central Alberta were tilled with a winged subsoiler {{specifically designed for}} tilling <b>compacted</b> forest <b>soils.</b> Surface soil {{had been removed from}} all sites during construction, and spread over three of the four landings prior to tillage. Soil bulk density at the 0 – 10, 10 – 20, and 20 – 30 cm depths, and clod size distribution at the 0 – 30 cm depth were measured immediately after tillage. Bulk density of undisturbed and <b>compacted</b> (untilled) <b>soil</b> was also measured. Mean bulk density of <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> in haul roads was significantly greater than the bulk density of undisturbed soil, but not for landings. Tillage significantly reduced mean bulk density on three haul roads and two landings; subsurface soil was relatively dry at these sites. Most soils were difficult to fracture into small clods because these weakly aggregated soils were severely remoulded and compacted by equipment, particularly logging trucks operating on the haul roads. The degraded soil was massive and the strenght of the surface soil layers was generally much higher than was the strength of lower soil layers; this resulted in the subsoil deforming around the wings of the subsoiler rather than fracturing the surface <b>soil.</b> Fracturing of <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> into small clods was apparently enhanced by at least 2 years of frost action. The winged subsoiler was only moderately effective at fracturing recently <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> because of an often high soil water content, but it was observed that sites where soil was broken into large clods was loosened by frost action the following winter. Alternative methods of tilling <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> that insure soil fracturing over a wider range of soil water contents are needed for loosening <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> in northern boreal forests...|$|R
30|$|Theoretically, {{pre-consolidation stress}} is the maximum stress {{to which a}} natural soil mass in the field has been {{subjected}} in the past during its geological life time [9], or, {{it is the largest}} overburden under which the soil had been consolidated [12, 13]. Whereas, artificially <b>compacted</b> <b>soil</b> mass also exhibits a characteristic termed as yield stress (σy), similar to the pre-consolidation stress exhibited by the natural soil [9].

5000|$|Resilience has two {{components:}} {{that provided}} by nature, and that provided through human action and interaction. An example of climate resilience provided by nature is {{the manner in}} which porous soil more effectively allows for the drainage of flood water than more <b>compact</b> <b>soil.</b> An example of human action that affects climate resilience would be the facilitation of response and recovery procedures by social institutions or organizations. This theory of human resilience largely focuses on the human populations and calls for building towards the overall goal of decreasing human vulnerability in the face of climate change and extreme weather events. Vulnerability to climatic disturbances has two sides: the first deals with the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards, which one can effectively identify as susceptibility. The second side deals with the capacity to recover from disaster consequences, or resilience in other words. [...] The looming threat of environmental disturbances and extreme weather events certainly calls for some action, and human resiliency theory seeks to solve the issue by largely focusing on decreasing the vulnerability of human populations.|$|E
50|$|The sweat bee has {{a simple}} nesting {{architecture}} {{consisting of a}} vertical tunnel into the ground ending in a compartment reserved for brood-rearing. They nest underground, like Lasioglossum zephyrum, {{but they do not}} form the same complex structures. Nest entrances are frequently concealed using scattered foliage. For L. malachurum, thousands of nests can be found located within a small region in nesting aggregations, which suggests that the bees likely have some sort of identification mechanism for conspecific nests. In fact, nest entrances and brood cell linings are both impregnated with secretions from the Dufour's gland of the bees, which plays a role in nest orientation. Nests are dug into hard, <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> and can be sealed from within by the queen using her abdomen. Because nests are dug into hard soil, construction of a nest represents a significant energy expense to a queen, which explains why gynes frequently usurp other nests rather than founding one of their own. L. malachurum is a Western Palaearctic species and nests can be found across Southern England and the Channel Islands, most of continental Europe, and North Africa.|$|E
40|$|Plants {{growing in}} soils {{typically}} experience {{a mixture of}} loose and <b>compact</b> <b>soil.</b> The hypothesis {{that the proportion of}} a root system exposed to <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> and/or the timing at which this exposure occurs determines shoot growth responses was tested. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica cv. Greenbelt) seedlings were grown in pot experiments with compact, loose and localized soil compaction created by either horizontal (compact subsoils 75 or 150 mm below loose topsoil) or vertical (adjacent compact and loose columns of soil) configurations of loose (1. 2 Mg m- 3) and compact (1. 8 Mg m- 3) soil. Entirely <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> reduced leaf area by up to 54 %, relative to loose soil. When compaction was localized, only the vertical columns of compact and loose soil reduced leaf area (by 30 %). Neither the proportion of roots in <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> nor the timing of exposure could explain the differing shoot growth responses to localized soil compaction. Instead, the strong relationship between total root length and leaf area (r 2 = 0. 92) indicated that localized soil compaction reduced shoot growth only when it suppressed total root length. This occurred when isolated root axes of the same plant were exposed to vertical columns of compact and loose soil. When a single root axis grew through loose soil into either a shallow or deep compact subsoil, compensatory root growth in the loose soil maintained total root length and thus shoot growth was unaffected. These contrasting root systems responses to localized soil compaction may explain the variable shoot growth responses observed under heterogeneous conditions. 7 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The key {{components}} of watershed processes are inputs in precipitation, interactions of vegetation, soil and water including evapotranspiration (water yield), overland flow (erosion), and storage and filtering (nutrients), and outputs in streamflow. Fire effects occur at the vegetation-soil interface and can result in altering overland flow and infiltration rate of water. Fire can affect infiltration rates by collapsing soil structure and reducing soil porosity, contributing ash and charcoal residues which can clog soil pores, and raindrop splash can <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> and firther contribute to loss of soil porosity.
