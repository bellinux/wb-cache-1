50|$|Basu had {{difficulties}} {{to maintain}} a fluent course as a full-time artist, and did survival jobs for his basic upkeep and materials. On graduating from art school in 1954, Basu joined B.N. Academy {{in a small town}} called Suri, Birbhum district, as a drawing teacher. By the autumn break Basu fell ill and could not return to Suri to his job. By the year end, he joined a printing press- Calcutta <b>Chromotype</b> in Calcutta. There he engaged with technical aspects of colour analysis and feasibility testing. After a year of working with the press, Basu was jobless {{as a result of a}} lock-out at the factory. His friend and well-wisher Dilip Das Gupta got him a teaching job at the Indian Art College where he worked alongside his old friend Somnath Hore.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFour similar sponges of {{different}} colors, all unknown to science, {{were collected in}} submarine caves of New Caledonia. We aimed at determining whether the four <b>chromotypes</b> represented different species or phenotypic variations of a unique new species. We used an integrative taxonomic approach combining morphologic, molecular and metabolomic analyses. The main traits that define these specimens are a skeleton made of monolophose, trilophose and tetralophose calthrops only, high chemical diversity and a high abundance and diversity of prokaryotic symbionts. The symbiotic community includes two unique prokaryote morphotypes, which are described {{for the first time}} in Homoscleromorpha, and appeared to be vertically transmitted. Although several features slightly differ among <b>chromotypes,</b> the most parsimonious conclusion was to propose a single new species Plakina kanaky sp. nov. Our phylogenetic analysis indicated the paraphyly of the Plakina genus, with P. kanaky sp. nov. belonging to a clade that includes Plakina jani and Plakina trilopha. The present work demonstrates that integrative taxonomy should be used in order to revise the entire Plakinidae family and especially the non-monophyletic genus Plakina...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome 4 of diploid wheat (chromosome d 4) is {{not present}} in {{hexaploid}} wheat. This chromosome {{has been added to}} hexaploid wheat and observed not to pair meiotically with its 21 chromosomes. Also, chromosome d 4 compensates for Cornerstone male sterility, which involves a recessive mutation in chromosome arm 4 AS. Chromosome d 4 has been separately substituted for chromosomes 4 A and 4 B. These two substituted hexaploid <b>chromotypes</b> have the entire genome of diploid wheat and may have agricultural significance. An alternative hypothesis of the evolution of polyploid wheats is proposed that involves the loss of chromosome d 4 and the retention of two versions of chromosome 4 B at the early tetraploid stage...|$|R
40|$|The Galapagos octocorals {{were almost}} unknown until recent years. Of the three orders within the {{subclass}} Octocorallia (Anthozoa, Cnidaria), the Pennatulacea (sea pens) and Alcyonacea (soft corals and gorgonians) {{occur in the}} Galapagos. Recent collections and research bring the total known octocorallian fauna to three sea pens (Virgularia galapagensis, Ptilosarcus undulatus and Cavernulina darwini) and 15 gorgonians. Of the 13 gorgonians that we have collected, several are new species. Pacifigorgia is widely distributed in the archipelago, with four named species (P. dampieri, P. symbiotica, P. rubripunctata, and P. darwinii), three of them recently described, and two others yet to be described. The genus Muricea contains three widely distributed undescribed species, one of which appears in three <b>chromotypes,</b> and one deepwater species {{that has not been}} collected recently. Two species of Heterogorgia occur in the central archipelago, H. verrucosa and the recently described and widely distributed H. hickmani. The remaining gorgonians are Eugorgia daniana, Leptogorgia alba and Adelogorgia telones...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock {{isolates}} of microaerophilic Lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Of particular interest {{were members of}} six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women, namely, Lactobacillus jensenii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum. Six main groupings were identified {{on the basis of}} ribotyping. This technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. In the case of the ribotype A grouping for L. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (<b>chromotyping).</b> Many isolates did not possess plasmids. Six L. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to L. rhamnosus ATCC 21052. The molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating Lactobacillus isolates. Studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined...|$|R
40|$|U ovom su radu na jednom mjestu izložene dosadašnje, a pridodane su i neke nove spoznaje vezane uz rad fotografa Franje Pommera. Osim što je ostao zabilježen kao prvi zagrebački rezidentni fotografski majstor te autor prvoga zaokruženog fotografskog projekta zamišljenog i izvedenog u Hrvatskoj, značajan je i po uvođenju određenih noviteta u standardnu fotografsku praksu. Tekst u prvom dijelu donosi dopunjeni pregled Pommerove biografije nastao na osnovi proučavanja arhivskog gradiva i periodike, a u drugom se, analizirajući sačuvane primjerke, osvrće na tehniku izrade fotografija i formate snimki koje je majstor u svome radu koristio, precizno ih određujući te usklađujući nazivlje sa suvremenom terminologijom. In {{the history}} of Croatian {{photography}} Franjo Pommer is documented not only {{on account of the}} quality of his photographic work, but also for being Zagreb’s first resident photographer. His Upper Town studio located in today’s Kuševićeva Street was the oldest photographic studio in Zagreb, active from 1854 at the latest. In May of the said year Pommer is recorded as its owner alongside photographer Joseph Kallain, while the following year the local press mentioned him as an independent artisan who photographed distinguished Croatian writers, whose photo portraits accompanied by their biographies Pommer planned to offer for sale to the Croatian public. The said news report dated August 1855 represents the terminus post quem non for the opening of the first photographic studio in Zagreb, although there is a possibility of Pommer’s autonomous activity in the same studio already {{during the second half of}} 1854. Due to the high quality of his photographs and his continuing interest for the novelties in the field of photographic technology, over the following two and a half decades Pommer earned the status of one of the most distinguished photographers in Zagreb, a reputation he would maintain until his death in 1879. Pommer’s photographic activity in Zagreb can be divided in three phases: the first, datable in the 1850 s, is characterized by large-format prints on salted paper; the second, mature phase is distinguished by the prevalence of albumen prints of carte-de-viste format, and finally the third, late phase roughly corresponds to the period from his relocation to a new studio until his death, during which he introduced cabinet-format photographs and carbon prints or <b>chromotypes.</b> In the present article the author precisely defines photographic processes used in the master’s work through the analysis of preserved prints and through the use of contemporary photography terminology...|$|R
