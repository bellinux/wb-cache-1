5|$|Amanita regalis, {{commonly}} known as the royal fly agaric or the king of Sweden Amanita, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family. Common in Scandinavian countries, it is also found in eastern and northern Europe. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska. The fruit bodies of the fungus somewhat resemble the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), and it was formerly regarded as a variety of this species. A.regalis differs from it in being larger, with a liver-brown <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> numerous scabs, and in having a stem which is yellow-ochre at the base, with patches or rings of patches. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains muscimol, the same psychoactive compound found in A.muscaria.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} St. Louis Cardinals {{began a series}} of games against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, in 1963, the Los Angeles Times {{published}} a large cartoon, drawn by artist Pete Bentovoja, modeled on the movies about the German submarine captain. The captain is Cards' manager Johnny Keane; his [...] "lieutenant" [...] is Stan Musial. They wear Cardinal uniforms with naval officers' caps bearing the [...] "St.L" [...] emblem. While Keane and Musial are speaking, other crew members load bats, like torpedoes, into torpedo tubes; the bats have players' faces (and names and batting averages) drawn on them.

2500|$|Police {{have not}} ruled out links {{with the murder of}} estate agent Suzy Lamplugh (who {{disappeared}} in July 1986 and whose body has never been found) and the case of a serial sex attacker in Bath, nicknamed the [...] "Batman rapist" [...] after he left a baseball <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> a Batman logo at the scene of one attack. The unknown assailant is known to have attempted to carjack a woman at knifepoint, leaving her wounded when she fought back and managed to escape, in the same area of the city a few hours before Hall was abducted. In spring of 2011, police investigating the murders of Sian O'Callaghan and Becky Godden-Edwards also began to look for a possible link between those murders and that of Melanie Hall. It has also been suggested {{that there may be a}} link between Hall's murder and Levi Bellfield, who is serving life imprisonment with a whole life order for three murders committed between 2002 and 2004.|$|E

50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Chrysler and Ford {{employed}} Y-blocks, {{meaning that the}} block skirts extended below the centreline of the crankshaft. The main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> could then be fixed with an additional cross-bolt, which was a horizontal bolt going into or through the main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R

A white-coloured cap means the vinegar has aged for at least 12 years and a gold <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> the designation extravecchio (extra-old) shows the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.|$|E
50|$|Differences in the Japanese {{block to}} Mexican are also present. The Mexico blocks (all DEs except {{those found in}} the S series) {{implemented}} a distributor and oil pump drive similar to the L series; from the crank nose. They also used a single row chain for the upper timing assembly without valve cover mounted guide. In addition to this, they removed the rearmost cam journal in the Mexico head. The crank rides on individually <b>capped</b> <b>bearings</b> with a slightly smaller diameter than the Japanese block, with shorter, slightly lower compression pistons in cylinders that have thicker walls than the Japanese DE. They retained the knock sensor and piston oilers.|$|R

50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R
50|$|Road {{wheels on}} all {{vehicles}} {{are of a}} five-spoke alloy design in a clear-lacquered finish. Two distinct patterns were used: the Mondial 8 and QV models have wheels with a flat centre and pronounced edges to the five spokes, whereas the 3.2 and t models' wheels have a convex centre and smoother, angled spokes. All wheels feature a yellow circular centre <b>cap</b> <b>bearing</b> Ferrari's black Cavallino Rampante rearing-horse logo.|$|E

With the side <b>cap</b> <b>bearing,</b> the operator can hold the yo-yo in many different planes and perform different styles of tricks which are difficult (or impossible in some cases) to be performed with conventional yo-yos. These configurations may be called hubstacks, bearing caps, synergy caps, or jimmy hats.|$|E

Thus the Montgomery Guards of Boston were provided with custom-designed green uniforms with scarlet facings and gold trim, and <b>caps</b> <b>bearing</b> their own company emblem: an American eagle alighting on an Irish harp.

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> from each side.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} The Lily is {{inspired}} by several windmills from the Netherlands but most notably by that of De Lelie (Dutch for [...] "The Lily") located in Puttershoek.The tapering brick tower of The Lily is five storeys high and is of circular cross section.

A sub-camp was established on 31July at Donja Reka, [...] north of Jastrebarsko, under the same administration as the main camp. It was situated in an old brick factory, and barracks and stables previously used by the Italian Army. Conditions at this sub-camp were even worse than at the main camp, with no electricity, running water or sanitary facilities. Food was extremely poor, and disease and death were common among the up to 2,000 children kept there.|$|R
50|$|In water polo, players wear swim <b>caps</b> <b>bearing</b> a number. Under FINA rules, the {{starting}} goalkeeper wears Number 1, the substitute goalkeeper wears Number 13, and remaining players wear numbers 2 though 12. In road bicycle racing, numbers {{are assigned to}} cycling teams by race officials, meaning they change from race to race. Each team has numbers in {{the same group of}} ten, excluding multiples of ten, for example 11 through 19 or 21 through 29. If a race has squads of smaller than nine, each still uses numbers from the same group of ten, perhaps 31 through 36 where the next squad will have 41 through 46. Usually, but not always, the rider who wears a number ending in 1 is the squad's leader and the one who will try for a high overall placing. If the race's defending champion is in the field, he or she wears number 1.|$|R
