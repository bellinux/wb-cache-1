25|$|A {{multi-needle machine}} may consist of {{multiple}} sewing heads, {{each of which}} can sew the same design onto a separate garment concurrently. Such a machine might have 20 or more heads, each consisting of 15 or more needles. A head is usually capable of producing many special fabric effects, including satin stitch embroidery, <b>chain</b> <b>stitch</b> embroidery, sequins, appliqué, and cutwork.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding the {{categorical}} {{assertion of}} a purely British origin, there is solid {{evidence of a}} connection between French tambour embroidery and crochet. The former method of production was illustrated in detail in 1763 in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable {{from that of a}} present-day inline crochet hook and the <b>chain</b> <b>stitch</b> separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 Penélopé instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for crochet and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms tambour and crochet as synonyms. This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.|$|E

In order to achieve a distinct angle at the corners the designer uses extra <b>chain</b> <b>stitches.</b> [...] Subsequent rounds are added by wrapping multiple stitches around the existing <b>chain</b> <b>stitches.</b> Hundreds of variant motifs are in use and entire books have been devoted to granny square designs.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are five}} main types of basic {{stitches}} (the following description uses US crochet terminology which {{differs from the}} terminology used in the UK and Europe). [...] 1. [...] <b>Chain</b> <b>Stitch</b> – {{the most basic of}} all stitches and used to begin most projects. [...] 2. [...] Slip Stitch – used to join <b>chain</b> <b>stitch</b> to form a ring. [...] 3. [...] Single Crochet Stitch (called Double Crochet Stitch in the UK) – easiest stitch to master [...] 4. [...] Half Double Crochet Stitch (called Half Treble Stitch in the UK) – the 'in-between' stitch [...] 5. [...] Double Crochet Stitch (called Treble Stitch in the UK) – many uses for this unlimited use stitch [...] while the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and thickness.|$|E
2500|$|A flag {{attributed}} to the 22nd Arkansas is currently {{in the collection of}} the Old State House Museum Collection in Little Rock Arkansas. The flag is made of wool and cotton flag with a field of five red and white horizontal bars of varying widths. Canton is light blue 11 1/2" [...] on the staff by 11 1/2" [...] on the fly. There are 13 5-pointed stars that are white with gold edges each 1 1/2. Set in an [...] "X" [...] shape. Unit designation is embroidered in white <b>chain</b> <b>stitch</b> Roman uncial and minuscule figure and letters: 22nd Regt. Battle honors are embroidered in contrasting red or white block letters on the red and white bars: OAK HILLS, ELK HORN, PRAIRIE GROVE, HELENA, JENKINS FERRY. The curators of the Old State House Museum believe that the flag was actually carried by the 22nd Arkansas during the war up until the unit surrender at Shreveport, Louisiana May 25, 1865. The flag is believed to have been returned to the State of Arkansas in 1905 by the U.S. War Department. Other historians believe that the flag may be a post war flag created by the veterans of the unit for use during a Reunion.|$|E
6000|$|Let us not forget, however, in our {{sympathy for}} the {{superfluous}} women, that their children must have fathers as well as mothers. Who are the fathers to be? All monogamists and married women will reply hastily: either bachelors or widowers; and this solution will serve as well as another; for it would be hypocritical to pretend that the difficulty is a practical one. None the less, the monogamists, after due reflection, will point out that if there are widowers enough the superfluous women are not really superfluous, and therefore {{there is no reason}} why the parties should not marry respectably like other people. And they might in that case be right if the reasons were purely numerical: that is, if every woman were willing to take a husband if one could be found for her, and every man willing to take a wife on the same terms; also, please remember, if widows would remain celibate to give the unmarried women a chance. These ifs will not work. We must recognize two classes of old maids: one, the really superfluous women, and the other, the women who refuse to accept maternity on the (to them) unbearable condition of taking a husband. From both classes may, perhaps, be subtracted for the present the large proportion of women who could not afford the extra expense of one or more children. I say [...] "perhaps," [...] because it is by no means sure that within reasonable limits mothers do not make a better fight for subsistence, and have not, on the whole, a better time than single women. In any case, we have two distinct cases to deal with: the superfluous and the voluntary; and it is the voluntary whose grit we are most concerned to fertilize. But here, again, we cannot put our finger on any particular case and pick out Miss Robinson's as superfluous, and Miss Wilkinson's as voluntary. Whether we legitimize the child of the unmarried woman as a duty to the superfluous or as a bribe to the voluntary, the practical result must be the same: to wit, that the condition of marriage now attached to legitimate parentage will be withdrawn from all women, and fertile unions outside marriage recognized by society. Now clearly the consequences would not stop there. The strong-minded ladies who are resolved to be mistresses in their own houses would not be the only ones to take advantage of the new law. Even women to whom a home without a man in it would be no home at all, and who fully intended, if the man turned out to be the right one, to live with him exactly as married couples live, would, if they were possessed of independent means, have every inducement to adopt the new conditions instead of the old ones. Only the women whose sole means of livelihood was wifehood would insist on marriage: hence a tendency would set in to make marriage more and more one of the customs imposed by necessity on the poor, whilst the freer form of union, regulated, no doubt, by settlements and private contracts of various kinds, would become the practice of the rich: that is, would become the fashion. At which point nothing but the achievement of economic independence by women, which is already seen clearly ahead of us, would be needed to make marriage disappear altogether, not by formal abolition, but by simple disuse. The private contract stage of this process was reached in ancient Rome. The only practicable alternative to it seems to be such an extension of divorce as will reduce the risks and obligations of marriage to a degree at which they will be no worse than those of the alternatives to marriage. As we shall see, this is the solution to which all the arguments tend. Meanwhile, note how much reason a statesman has to pause before meddling with an institution which, unendurable as its drawbacks are, threatens to come to pieces in all directions if a single thread of it be cut. Ibsen's similitude of the machine- made <b>chain</b> <b>stitch,</b> which unravels the whole seam at the first pull when a single stitch is ripped, is very applicable to the knot of marriage.|$|E
50|$|Filet crochet is {{most often}} worked from a graph or a symbol diagram.

5000|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>stitch</b> is {{a sewing}} and {{embroidery}} technique {{in which a}} series of looped stitches form a chain-like pattern. <b>Chain</b> <b>stitch</b> is an ancient craft - examples of surviving Chinese <b>chain</b> <b>stitch</b> embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period (5th - 3rd century BC). Handmade <b>chain</b> <b>stitch</b> embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near seams on finished fabric. Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic [...] "drawing" [...] in thread.|$|E

40|$|Without {{appropriate}} <b>stitching</b> of scan <b>chains,</b> {{even with}} good diagnosis algorithm and diagnostic pattern generation, it may still result in bad scan chain diagnostic resolution. To improve the diagnostic resolution, we propose a novel Diagnosis and Layout Aware (DLA) scan <b>chain</b> <b>stitching</b> method, which is pattern independent and supports embedded scan compaction. It {{is based on}} three ideas: (1) {{increasing the number of}} sensitive scan cells, which can capture useful diagnostic information; (2) properly distributing the sensitive scan cells along the scan chains to enhance the overall resolution; (3) stitching scan cells based on their placement at layout to preserve the chip performance. Experiments on ISCAS’ 89 /ITC’ 99 benchmark circuits and a real industry circuit based on 20 nm technology with silicon results show that, the proposed DLA scan <b>chain</b> <b>stitching</b> method effectively improves the resolution, with negligible impact on chip performance, embedded scan compaction, transition fault coverage, and test power dissipation. The silicon results even show 7 X average resolution improvement comparing to without using the proposed method. 1...|$|R

The other hand feeds the thread from the underside, and the hook brings it up, making a chainstitch, but it is much quicker than chainstitch done in the usual way: looks like machine-made and can also be embellished with sequins and beads - which are kept on the right side, and the needle goes inside their holes before plunging below, thus securing them to the fabric.|$|R
