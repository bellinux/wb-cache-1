60|$|From {{the same}} {{principles}} we {{are now able to}} arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery, and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose, produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring-class. The characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of circulating capital into fixed: and it was shown in the first book(303) that, in a country where capital accumulates slowly, the introduction of machinery, permanent improvements of land, and the like, might be, for the time, extremely injurious; since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund, the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed, and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished. But in a country of great annual savings and low profits no such effects need be apprehended. It merely draws off at one orifice what was already flowing out at another; or, if not, the greater vacant space left in the reservoir does but cause a greater quantity to flow in. Accordingly, in spite of the mischievous derangements of the money market which have been occasioned by the great sums in process of being sunk in railways, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with those who apprehend any mischief, from this source, to the productive resources of the country. Not on the absurd ground (which to any one acquainted with the elements of the subject needs no confutation) that railway expenditure is a mere transfer of capital from hand to hand, by which nothing is lost or destroyed. This is true of what is spent in the purchase of the land; a portion too of what is paid to agents, counsels, engineers, and surveyors, is saved by those who receive it, and becomes capital again: but what is laid out in the bona fide construction of the railway itself is lost and gone; when once expended, it is incapable of ever being paid in wages or applied to the maintenance of laborers again; as a matter of account, the result is, that so much food and clothing and tools have been consumed, and the country has got a railway instead.|$|E
60|$|Every theorem in {{geometry}} {{is a law}} {{of external}} nature, and might have been ascertained by generalizing from observation and experiment, {{which in this case}} resolve themselves into comparison and measurement. But it was found practicable, and, being practicable, was desirable, to deduce these truths by ratiocination from a small number of general laws of nature, the certainty and universality of which are obvious to the most careless observer, and which compose the first principles and ultimate premises of the science. Among these general laws must be included the same two which we have noticed as ultimate principles of the Science of Number also, and which are applicable to every description of quantity; viz., The sums of equals are equal, and Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another; the latter of which may be expressed in a manner more suggestive of the inexhaustible multitude of its consequences, by the following terms: Whatever is equal to any {{one of a number of}} equal magnitudes, is equal to any other of them. To these two must be added, in geometry, a third law of equality, namely, that lines, surfaces, or solid spaces, which can be so applied to one another as to coincide, are equal. Some writers have asserted that this law of nature is a mere verbal definition; that the expression “equal magnitudes” means nothing but magnitudes which can be so applied to one another as to coincide. But in this opinion I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> The equality of two geometrical magnitudes can not differ fundamentally in its nature from the equality of two weights, two degrees of heat, or two portions of duration, to none of which would this definition of equality be suitable. None of these things can be so applied to one another as to coincide, yet we perfectly understand what we mean when we call them equal. Things are equal in magnitude, as things are equal in weight, when they are felt to be exactly similar in respect of the attribute in which we compare them: and the application of the objects to each other in the one case, like the balancing them with a pair of scales in the other, is but a mode of bringing them into a position in which our senses can recognize deficiencies of exact resemblance that would otherwise escape our notice.|$|E

40|$|Based on meso-damage {{mechanics}} and finite element analysis, {{the aim of}} this paper is to describe the feasibility of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) constitutive model in describing the tensile behavior of corroded reinforcing bars. The orthogonal test results showed that different fracture pattern and the related damage evolution process can be simulated by choosing different material parameters of GTN constitutive model. Compared with failure parameters, the two constitutive parameters are significant factors affecting the tensile strength. Both the nominal yield and ultimate tensile strength decrease markedly with the increase of constitutive parameters. Combining with the latest data and trial-and-error method, the suitable material parameters of GTN constitutive model were adopted to simulate the tensile behavior of corroded reinforcing bars in concrete under carbonation environment attack. The numerical predictions <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>agree</b> very well with experimental measurements, but also simplify the finite element modeling process...|$|R

However, these critics too <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on what then are [...] "true" [...] children expressing themselves, and which books are therefore [...] "good" [...] for them. Finally, a few critics, notably Jacqueline Rose (1984) and Karin Lesnik-Oberstein (1994 and 2004) take this discussion even further, arguing that identities are created and not [...] "inherent", and {{that in the case of}} an identity such as [...] "childhood" [...] it is created by [...] "adults" [...] in the light of their own perceptions of themselves.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of private limited {{companies}} are formed today. The distribution of shares in a corporation {{can be done in}} different ways. The most common one is that the most suitable shareholders, for the future development of the company, have a majority in the company in order to govern and control the company and its affairs. In a company with a solid majority decisions are fairly easy to make and there are seldom disputes, in terms of such decision-making.   But in today's legal arena companies are formed where shares are divided evenly between the partners. This is done to spread the control of the company between several shareholders. But what happens when a company of two people, or groups of equally strong shareholders, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> within the general meeting for a decision on who will be appointed as the Chairman, {{or in the case of}} important issues concerning the company's affairs.   One such company whose shares are scattered among the shareholders is generally called a 50 / 50 company. The company is not regulated in the Swedish Companies Act which makes it difficult to determine how certain decisions will be resolved when there are disagreements. What is regulated in the legislation for limited companies is very generally applied, which is why agreements and contracts are often used as a complement and an instrument to combat locked situations in smaller companies, especially in the 50 / 50 company. Contracts are made to complement the law and statutes. There are many types of contracts which can be conducted between the shareholders however; this essay will deal only with the shareholders and consortium agreements/contracts.   When a small company, such as the 50 / 50 company, with few shareholders does not sign agreements or contracts between them in order to fully regulate the situations and problems that may arise, the results can be devastating. When shareholders <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on decisions in the general meeting it may pertain to two specific decisions. One is the decision which must be taken when appointing the Board to prevent that there is a draw of lots, which is certainly not the optimal way of decision-making for a company. The second decision is the one pertaining to other important issues which must be decided  in the general meeting, and where the Chairman’s casting vote will decide the outcome if the shareholders <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> It is there important to examine which possibilities exist for 50 / 50 companies to remedy a locked situation and maintain an optimal decision-making process...|$|E
