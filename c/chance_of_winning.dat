5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead Johnson had over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the election.

5|$|A {{converted}} {{field goal}} {{would have given}} the Vikings a 10-point lead, which would have almost certainly clinched victory, according to Pro Football Prospectus and the NFL Network documentary The Missing Rings.

Roberto Visentini garnered the most votes from his fellow riders, but Delgado, Hampsten and LeMond also received many votes.

5|$|The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the Second Civil War, and {{as agreed}} with Charles, the Scots invaded England.

Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had a better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the Stanley Cup.

5|$|Liverpool had {{finished}} the 1983–84 Football League as champions. They had also won the 1983–84 Football League Cup beating Everton 1–0 in a replay after the final finished 0–0.

5|$|To have a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made.

For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E

5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning,</b> but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning,</b> and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool played Wolverhampton Wanderers a {{week before}} the final in their last match of the 1964–65 Football League First Division. Shankly rested most of the first-choice players, but Liverpool still won the match 3–1, with goals from Geoff Strong, John Sealey and Alf Arrowsmith, the victory meant they {{finished}} the season in seventh place. Leeds went into their final match of the league season with a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the championship. However, they drew their match with Birmingham City 3–3, which meant they were level on points with Manchester United, who had a match remaining. As United had a superior goal average only a defeat of 17–0 or greater would result in Leeds being champions. United lost 2–1 to Aston Villa in their final match and won the title by a goal average of 0.686.|$|E

5|$|On 3 April 1996, Liverpool faced Newcastle United in a Premier League fixture at Anfield, {{during the}} 1995–96 season. Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle's three. The winning goal was scored by striker Stan Collymore {{in the second}} minute of {{stoppage}} time. Before the match, both clubs had lost their previous fixtures but still had a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the league and wanted {{to close the gap}} between themselves and leaders Manchester United. Newcastle United, who were 12 points ahead in January, had suffered from poor performance throughout March, winning one match out of four that month. Liverpool had won six of their last nine league games during February and March, scored the most goals and conceded the fewest until this match.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning.</b> This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E

5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 but critics {{considered}} England {{to have a}} good <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain {{for the remainder of the}} series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the months}} leading up to the battle, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had {{repeatedly}} retreated from Sherman's superior force. All along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marietta, Georgia, a pattern was played and replayed: Johnston took up a defensive position, Sherman marched to outflank the Confederate defenses, and Johnston retreated again. After Johnston's withdrawal following the Battle of Resaca, the two armies clashed again at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, but the Confederate senior leadership in Richmond was unhappy with Johnston's perceived reluctance to fight the Union army, even though he had little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning.</b> Thus, on July 17, 1864, as he was preparing for the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Johnston was relieved of his command and replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The dismissal and replacement of Johnston remains one of the most controversial decisions of the civil war. Hood, who was fond of taking risks, lashed out at Sherman's army at Peachtree Creek, but the attack failed with more than two thousand five hundred Confederate casualties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons Liverpool {{consolidated}} {{their place in the}} First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game with a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>winning</b> their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0.|$|E
