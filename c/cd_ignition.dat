The Hyland <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> was the first commercially produced solid-state <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> and retailed for $39.95 Canadian. The patents were applied for by Winterburn on September 23, 1963 (United States patent# 3,564,581). The design was leaked to the United States {{in the summer of}} 1963 when Hyland exposed the design to a US company in an effort to expand sales. Afterward, numerous companies started building their own throughout the 1960s and 1970s without licence. Some were direct copies of the Winterburn circuit. In 1971 Bosch bought the European patent rights (German, French, British) from Winterburn.|$|E
50|$|They were unsuccessful, but {{did provide}} much {{data on the}} {{advantages}} of such a system, should one be built. Namely; a fast voltage rise time to fire fouled or wet spark plugs, high energy throughout the RPM range resulting in better starting, more power and economy, and lower emissions. A few engineers, scientists, and hobbyists had built CD ignitions throughout the 1950s using thyratrons (tube type). However, thyratrons were unsuitable for use in automobiles for two reasons. They required a warm-up period which was a nuisance, and were vulnerable to vibration which drastically shortened their lifetime. In an automotive application, the thyratron <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> would fail in either weeks or months. The unreliability of those early thyratron CD ignitions made them unsuitable for mass production despite providing short term benefits. One company at least, Tung-Sol (a manufacturer of vacuum tubes) marketed a thyratron <b>CD</b> <b>ignition,</b> model Tung-Sol EI-4 in 1962, but it was expensive. Despite the failings of thyratron (tube type) CD ignitions, the improved ignition that they gave made them a worthwhile addition for some drivers. For the Wankel powered NSU Spider of 1964, Bosch resurrected its thyratron method for a <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> and used this up until at least 1966. It suffered the same reliability problems as the Tung-Sol EI-4.|$|E

40|$|When carbon is ignited off-center in a CO {{core of a}} super-AGB star, its {{burning in}} a {{convective}} shell tends to propagate to the center. Whether the C flame will {{actually be able to}} reach the center depends on the efficiency of extra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary mixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the center. As a result, a C-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a "hybrid" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1 D stellar evolution computations the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich material, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material from its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would be processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then be transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes associated with high abundances of 23 Na and 25 Mg. They are followed by off-center <b>C</b> <b>ignition</b> leading to convection that occupies almost the entire star. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data for their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized uncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of SN Ia progenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative instances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of explosive <b>C</b> <b>ignition,</b> either off or in the center. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor models have much lower C to O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive <b>C</b> <b>ignition</b> than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed diversity of the SNe Ia.

40|$|White dwarfs accreting from helium stars can stably burn at the accreted {{rate and}} avoid the {{challenge}} of mass loss associated with unstable Helium burning that is a concern for many Type Ia supernovae scenarios. We study binaries with helium stars of mass 1. 25 M_< M_He< 1. 8 M_, which have lost their hydrogen rich envelopes in an earlier common envelope event and now orbit with periods (P_ orb) of several hours with non-rotating 0. 84 and 1. 0 M_ C/O WDs. The helium stars fill their Roche lobes (RLs) after exhaustion of central helium and donate helium on their thermal timescales (∼ 10 ^ 5 yr). As shown by others, these mass transfer rates coincide with the steady helium burning range for WDs, and grow the WD core up to near the Chandrasekhar mass (M_ Ch) and a core carbon ignition.

50|$|It was the Robert Bosch {{company who}} were the pioneers of the first {{electronic}} CD ignitions. (Bosch is also responsible for {{the invention of the}} high-tension magneto.) During World War Two, Bosch had fitted thyratron (tube type) CD ignitions to some piston engined fighter aircraft. With a <b>CD</b> <b>ignition,</b> an aeroplane engine did not need a warm up period for reliable ignition and so a fighter aircraft could take flight more quickly as a result. This early German system used a rotary DC converter along with fragile tube circuitry, and was not suited to life in a fighter aircraft. Failures occurred within only a few hours. The quest for a reliable electronic means of producing a <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> began in earnest during the 1950s.

50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the triggering signal, the triggering circuit stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a <b>CD</b> <b>ignition,</b> the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the <b>CD</b> <b>ignition.</b> Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|E

For the first few hours following unstable 12 <b>C</b> <b>ignition,</b> the nuclear energy release is transported by convection.

This results in a hydrodynamic nuclear runaway, in which the heating time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time.

50|$|It was the SCR, Silicon-controlled {{rectifier}} or thyristor {{invented in}} the late 1950s that replaced the troublesome thyratron, and {{paved the way for}} a reliable solid-state <b>CD</b> <b>ignition.</b> This was thanks to Bill Gutzwiller and his team at General Electric. The SCR was rugged with an indefinite lifetime, but very prone to unwanted trigger impulses which would turn the SCR 'on'. Unwanted trigger impulses in early attempts at using SCRs for CD ignitions were caused by electrical interference, but the main culprit proved to be 'points bounce'. Points bounce is a feature of a points-triggered system. In the standard system with points, distributor, ignition coil, ignition (Kettering system) points bounce prevents the coil from saturating fully as RPM increases resulting in a weak spark, thus limiting high speed potential. In a <b>CD</b> <b>ignition,</b> at least those early attempts, the points bounce created unwanted trigger pulses to the SCR (thyristor) that resulted in a series of weak, untimed sparks that caused extreme misfiring. There were two possible solutions to the problem. The first would be to develop another means of triggering the discharge of the capacitor to one discharge per power stroke by replacing the points with something else. This could be done magnetically or optically, but that would necessitate more electronics and an expensive distributor. The other option was to keep the points, as they were already in use and reliable, {{and find a way to}} overcome the 'points bounce' problem. This was accomplished in April 1962 by a Canadian, RCAF officer F.L. Winterburn working in his basement in Ottawa, Ontario. The design used an inexpensive method that would only recognize the first opening of the points and ignore subsequent openings when the points bounced.|$|E
50|$|A {{company was}} formed in Ottawa in early 1963 called Hyland Electronics {{building}} CD ignitions using the Winterburn design. The discharge capacitor within the <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> {{had the ability to}} provide a powerful spark in excess of 4 times the spark power of the Kettering system using the same coil, with the exception that spark energy could be maintained at high rpm unlike the Kettering system. The Hyland unit consumed only four amperes at 5000rpm (8cyl) or 10,000rpm(4cyl). Dynamometer testing during 1963 and 1964 showed a minimum of 5% increase in horsepower with the system, with 10% the norm. One example, a Ford Falcon, had an increase in horsepower of 17%. Spark plug lifespan was increased to at least 50,000 miles and points lifespan was greatly extended from 8,000 miles to at least 60,000 miles. Points lifespan became a factor of rubbing block (cam follower) wear and the life cycle of the spring with some lasting almost 100,000 miles.|$|E
5000|$|The UK Wireless World {{magazine}} of March 1970 published a detailed Capacitor-discharge Ignition system as an electronic hobby build project by R.M. Marston. The circuit {{of this system}} {{was similar to the}} Winterburn patent in that it used a push-pull converted switch mode oscillator for energy transfer to a store - discharge capacitor and conventional contact breakers to initiate a thyristor triggering discharge of the charged CD capacitor. It was stated to offer several advantages over conventional ignition. Among which: better combustion, easy starting even under subzero conditions, immunity to contactor (points) bounce and 2% - 5% fuel economy. Subsequent letters to Wireless World ( [...] March & May 1970), with Mr. Marston’s replies, further discussed aspects of the design and build. In July 1971 Mr. A.P. Harris, undergraduate of the City University London made a detailed electrical engineering analysis of the Marston design as well as automotive engine measurement trials to verify fuel economy. These confirmed the benefits of the <b>CD</b> <b>ignition</b> system.

We show that, in contrast to previous calculations, electron captures to excited states and subsequent gamma-emission significantly reduces the local heat loss due to weak-interaction neutrinos. Furthermore, temperature-sensitive (gamma,n) rates trigger further energy deposition as the distribution of nuclei evolves toward a lower neutron separation energy. Depending on the initial composition these reactions release up to a factor of ten times more heat at densities < 10 ^{ 11 } g/cc than obtained previously.

40|$|After off-center <b>C</b> <b>ignition</b> in the cores of super-AGB stars the C flame propagates all the {{way down}} to the center, {{trailing}} behind it the C-shell convective zone, and thus building a degenerate ONe core. This standard picture is obtained in stellar evolution simulations if the bottom C-shell convection boundary is assumed to be a discontinuity associated with a strict interpretation of the Schwarzschild condition for convective instability. However, this boundary is prone to additional mixing processes, such as thermohaline convection and convective boundary mixing. Using hydrodynamic simulations we show that, contrary to previous results, thermohaline mixing is too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation. However, even a small amount of convective boundary mixing removes the physical conditions required for the C-flame propagation {{all the way}} to the center. This result holds even if we allow for some turbulent heat transport in the CBM region. As a result, super AGB stars build in their interiors hybrid C-O-Ne degenerate cores composed of a relatively large CO core (M_CO ~ 0. 2 M_sun) surrounded by a thick ONe zone (M_ONe ~ 0. 85 M_sun) with another thin CO layer above. If exposed by mass loss, these cores will become hybrid C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Otherwise, the ignition of C-rich material in the central core, surrounded by the thick ONe zone, may trigger a thermonuclear supernova explosion.

We model the resulting combustion wave during these superbursts as an upward propagating detonation. We solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagates through the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as it travels upward into lower density material. The shock is sufficiently strong upon reaching the freshly accreted H/He layer that it triggers unstable 4 He burning if the superburst occurs during {{the latter half of}} the regular Type I bursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright Type I precursor bursts observed at the onset of superbursts. The cooling of the outermost shock-heated layers produces a bright, ~ 0. 1 s, flash that precedes the Type I burst by a few seconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4 U 1820 - 30 and 4 U 1636 - 54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time resolution.

40|$|Observationally {{inferred}} superburst ignition depths are shallower than models predict. We {{address this}} discrepancy by reexamining the superburst trigger mechanism. We first explore {{the hypothesis of}} Kuulkers et al. that exothermic electron captures trigger superbursts. We find that all electron capture reactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are not a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12 C + 12 C are infeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much shallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm the proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12 C + 12 C triggers superbursts. We then examine the 12 C + 12 C fusion rate. The reaction cross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies, but resonances exist in the 12 C + 12 C system throughout the entire measured energy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a resonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1. 5 MeV. For such a hypothetical 1. 5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the resonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the theoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in this case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord with model predictions {{for a range of}} plausible neutron star parameters. Said differently, such a resonance would decrease the temperature required for unstable 12 <b>C</b> <b>ignition</b> at a column depth 10 ^ 12 g/cm^ 2 from 6 x 10 ^ 8 K to 5 x 10 ^ 8 K. Determining the existence of a strong resonance in the Gamow window requires measurements of the 12 C + 12 C cross-section down to a center-of-mass energy near 1. 5 MeV, which is within reach of the proposed DUSEL facility.

50|$|The {{temperature}} is typically maintained between 1150 and 1250 <b>C</b> in the <b>ignition</b> zone and between 900 and 1000 °C in the soaking zone to prevent sudden quenching of the sintered layer. The top 5 mm from screens {{goes to the}} conveyor carrying the sinter for the blast furnace and, along with blast furnace grade sinter, either goes to sinter storage bunkers or to BF bunkers. Blast furnace-grade sinter consists of particles sized 5 to 12 mm as well as 20 mm and above.|$|R
40|$|Planar sensors {{based on}} tape-cast YSZ layers with {{parallel}} Pt finger electrodes, one coated with WO 3 thick film as sensing electrode, were fabricated. The sensors {{were tested in}} the laboratory at various concentrations of NO 2 and CO at different temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. Field tests were also performed; planar sensors were located close to a commercial oxygen sensor, downstream the three-way catalytic converter of a FIAT fire 1242 <b>c.</b> <b>c.</b> spark <b>ignition</b> engine coupled to a dynamometer. The performance of the gas sensors was measured at the air/fuel ratio stoichiometric point (A/F∼ 14. 3) at different engine regimes (RPM and torque) and thus at different operating temperatures. The response of gas sensors was compared with {{the response of the}} commercial lambda probe and related to the exhaust gas concentrations measured by spectroscopic analytical equipment at the engine exhaust end. Preliminary measurements showed promising results in terms of sensitivity, stability and reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{contracts}} {{have been issued}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to explore candidate technologies considered to be important for the Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) effort. One aspect of the NGLT effort is to explore the potential of incorporating non-toxic propellants for Reaction Control Subsystems (RCS). Contract NAS 8 - 01109 has been issued to Aerojet to develop a dual thrust Reaction Control Engine (RCE) that utilizes liquid oxygen and ethanol as the propellants. The dual thrust RCE incorporates a primary thrust level of 870 lbf, and a vernier thrust level of 10 - 30 lbf. Aerojet has designed and tested a workhorse LOX igniter to determine LOX/Ethanol ignition characteristics {{as part of a}} risk mitigation effort for the dual thrust RCE design. The objective of the ignition testing was to demonstrate successfid ignition from GOX to LOX, encompassing potential two-phase flow conditions. The workhorse igniter was designed to accommodate the full LOX design flowrate, as well as a reduced GOX flowrate. It was reasoned that the initial LOX flow through the igniter would flash to GOX due to the inherent heat stored in the hardware, causing a reduced oxygen flowrate because of a choked, or sonic, flow condition through the injection elements. As LOX flow continued, the inherent heat of the test hardware would be removed and the hardware would chill-in, with the injected oxygen flow transitioning from cold GOX through two-phase flow to subcooled LOX. Pressure and temperature instrumentation permitted oxygen state points to be determined, and gas-side igniter chamber thermocouples provided chamber thermal profile characteristics. The cold flow chamber pressure (P(sub c)) for each test was determined and coupled with the igniter chamber diameter (D(sub c)) to calculate the characteristic quench parameter (P(sub c) x D(sub c)), which was plotted as a function of core mixture ratio, MR(sub <b>c).</b> <b>Ignition</b> limits were determined over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, and ignition was demonstrated with oxygen inlet conditions that ranged from subcooled 173 R LOX to 480 R GQX. Once ignited at cold GOX conditions, combustion was continuous as the hardware chilled in and the core mixture ratio transitioned from values near 1. 0 to over 12. 5...|$|R
