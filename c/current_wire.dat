40|$|Hot wire gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (HW-GTAW) {{process is the}} one where the filler wire is pre-heated close to its melting point before it is fed in to the arc. The effect of HW-GTAW parameters such as welding <b>current,</b> hot <b>wire</b> <b>current</b> and the <b>wire</b> feed rate during welding of super ASS 304 H stainless steel tubes were evaluated in terms of heat input, voltage-current (V-I) characteristics and weld bead characteristics such as bead weight and geometry. The results obtained indicate that for a constant welding current, increasing the hot <b>wire</b> <b>current</b> and <b>wire</b> feed rate provides a stable V-I characteristics and higher bead weight. Further, increasing the hot <b>wire</b> <b>current</b> and <b>wire</b> feed rate also provides better or desired weld pool and hence the bead geometry was described in terms of width, penetration depth, area of fusion and toe angle. By utilising the above knowledge, the tube to tube butt welding of SS 304 H material was carried out. It was observed that, the weld joint is qualified as per the quality requirement of ASME: Sec IX standard...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the real-time on-chip detection and manipulation of single 1 µm superparamagnetic particles in solution, {{with the aim}} to develop a biosensor that can give information on biological function. Our chip-based sensor consists of micro-fabricated <b>current</b> <b>wires</b> and giant magneto resistance (GMR) sensors. The <b>current</b> <b>wires</b> serve to apply force on the particles {{as well as to}} magnetize the particles for on-chip detection. The sensitivity profile of the sensor was reconstructed by simultaneously measuring the sensor signal and the position of an individual particle crossing the sensor. A single-dipole model reproduces the measured sensitivity curve for a 1 µm bead. For a 2. 8 µm bead the model shows deviations, which we attribute {{to the fact that the}} particle size becomes comparable to the sensor width. In the range between 1 and 10 particles, we observed a linear relationship between the number of beads and the sensor signal. The real-time detection and manipulation of individual particles opens the possibility to perform on-chip high-parallel single-particle assay...|$|R

50|$|The {{quality of}} a weld depends, besides the weld {{parameters}} which are important for the welding process (e.g. voltage, <b>current,</b> <b>wire</b> feed and weld speed) also mainly from the type of input of process energy and of the used filler material. The positioning of the torch exerts a direct influence on the material flow. The heat input for the melting of the component edges and the steady heat flow are, furthermore, directly connected with the torch guidance and exert substantical influence on the weld quality and on the resulting residual stresses.In fully mechanised and automated shielded gas welding, the inaccuracies of torch guidance, workpiece handling, groove preparation and thermal distortion are adding to the variations of the edge position and edge geometry. In fully mechanised welding, the information which {{is required for the}} weld quality is detected via sensors. Sensors are applied for checking the position of the component (detection of weld start and end of weld), for joint tracking and for the adaptation of the process parameters to changes of the joints/grooves. It is possible to use the sensors online (together/at the same time with the welding process) or offline (in a separate working step before welding). Sensors are mainly used in online joint tracking.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position changeover switch to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high <b>current</b> <b>wire</b> wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|E

40|$|Welding is a {{manufacturing}} process, which {{is carried out}} for joining of metals. Metal Active Gas (MAG). This is a variation of MIG welding, in which identical equipment is used but the inert gas is replaced by carbon dioxide, which is chemically active. Shielding gas CO 2 is used and consumable electrode is used which also plays role of conductor. MAG-CO 2 welding is versatile, gives very little loss of alloying elements and can be operated as semi as well as fully automated. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a powerful empirical modeling tool, suitable for problems which are not amenable to exact analytical solutions, or, where interrelationships between variables are not fully understood but which provide an abundance of data from which ANN can learn and predict. All welds will be prepared by MAG-CO 2 welding and TIG welding techniques.
