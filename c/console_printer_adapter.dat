5000|$|VS/9 was {{controlled}} by a computer operator at the central site. Computer operators interacted with the system through a system console. Initially, this console was a teletype device, but was later upgraded to a video display device with an attached system <b>console</b> <b>printer.</b> All system <b>console</b> messages were logged to the system <b>console</b> <b>printer.</b> Unsolicited messages originating in the operating system were also logged to the system <b>console</b> <b>printer.</b> Computer operators {{had a number of}} responsibilities: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 04 was the <b>console</b> <b>printer</b> (and any {{associated}} low-speed {{paper tape}} punch).|$|R
50|$|A <b>console</b> <b>printer</b> (up to 85 {{characters}} per second) {{to provide}} hard copy was optional when the console was in display mode, and required {{when it was}} in printer-keyboard mode.|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneously announced, The Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDPA), often {{shortened}} to Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), {{which did}} not support pixel-addressable graphics of any sort, offered a high-quality 80x25 character mode, having a relatively high pixel-resolution of 720x350 (character box size 9x14), {{that could be used}} on a monochrome monitor (originally, specifically the IBM 5151 Personal Computer Display).|$|R
50|$|The {{lowest level}} of the {{hierarchy}} is the driver level, and contains all the device-dependent drivers necessary to interface TurboDOS to the particular hardware being used. Drivers must be provided for all peripherals, including <b>console,</b> <b>printers,</b> disks, communications channels, and network interface.|$|R
50|$|The {{parallel}} port interface was originally {{known as the}} Parallel <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> on IBM PC-compatible computers. It was primarily designed to operate printers that used IBM's 8-bit extended ASCII character set to print text, but {{could also be used}} to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.|$|R
50|$|The Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA, also MDA card, Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter,</b> MDPA) is IBM's {{standard}} {{video display}} card and computer display {{standard for the}} PC introduced in 1981. The MDA {{does not have any}} pixel-addressable graphics modes. It has only a single monochrome text mode (PC video mode 7), which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.|$|R
25|$|Similar {{machines}} {{referred to}} as the IBM 1050 series were used as the <b>console</b> <b>printers</b> for many computers, such as the IBM 1130 and the IBM System/360 series. The IBM 1050 was also offered in a remote terminal configuration, similar in use to the 2741. These were designed and manufactured for this purpose, including the necessary electrical interfaces, and incorporated more rugged components than the office Selectric or even the 2741.|$|R
50|$|The only input was a {{paper tape}} reader {{and the only}} outputs were the <b>console</b> <b>printer</b> and paper tape punch. As the paper tape punch was much faster than the printer, most output was punched, and then listed on an {{off-line}} printer. This Iowa State machine {{should not be confused}} with the Atanasoff-Berry Computer of the late 1930s- Neither John Vincent Atanasoff nor Clifford Berry worked on this machine.|$|R
50|$|IBM {{initially}} offered two video adapters for the PC, the Color/Graphics Adapter and the Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter.</b> CGA {{was intended}} to be a typical home computer display; it had NTSC output and could be connected to a composite monitor or a TV set with an RF modulator in addition to RGB for digital RGBI-type monitors, although IBM did not offer their own RGB monitor until 1983. Supported graphics modes were 40 or 80×25 color text with 8×8 character resolution, 320×200 bitmap graphics with two fixed 4-color palettes, or 640×200 monochrome graphics.|$|R
5000|$|Proprietary {{parallel}} <b>printer</b> port (required <b>adapter</b> {{cable to}} connect to a Centronics-port printer) ...|$|R
5000|$|On the IBM 1620 {{there are}} four switches, and their state can be tested via special forms of the IF-statement offered by the FORTRAN {{compiler}} for the IBM 1620. For the IBM 1130 there are sixteen switches matching the sixteen-bit word size of the computer, plus a toggle switch adjacent to the power on/off switch. These bit-switches are more normally used with the computer stopped to specify some memory address to be viewed (via the indicator lights on the front panel), or set. The state of these switches can be determined by a program, and so a running program might modify its behavior depending on the switches, such as change the amount of progress information printed, alter the tactics of a multi-variable optimization attempt, and so on. The IBM 1130 also has an [...] "Interrupt Request" [...] key associated with the <b>console</b> <b>printer,</b> whose pressing might cause a suitably programmed long-running program to type a progress report on the <b>console</b> <b>printer.</b> In the more usual batch job environment, it was pressed by the computer operator to signal the operating system to terminate a running program that had perhaps overrun its allowed time, or commenced misbehavior such as repeatedly printing blank lines.|$|R
5000|$|Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. {{was formed}} in 1982 in Hercules, California, by Van Suwannukul and Kevin Jenkins {{and was one of}} the major {{graphics}} card companies of the 1980s. Its biggest products were the MDA-compatible Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) and Hercules Graphics Card Plus (HGC+) and the associated standard, which was widely copied and survived into the 1990s. The Hercules Graphics Card included a [...] "Centronics compatible" [...] parallel printer port, the same as the IBM Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> board that the card was based on. The company also produced CGA compatible cards, and with the unsuccessful Hercules InColor Card, it tried to go head-to-head with EGA.|$|R
2500|$|IBM also {{produced}} computer terminals {{based on the}} Selectric mechanism, some of which (all models of the IBM 1050 series, and IBM 2741 models using [...] "PTTC/BCD" [...] code) used a different encoding. Though the elements were physically interchangeable, the characters were differently arranged, so that standard Selectric elements {{could not be used}} in them, and their elements could not be used in standard Selectrics. On the other hand, IBM 2741s using [...] "correspondence coding" [...] used standard office Selectric elements. [...] The IBM 1130 computer used a Selectric mechanism as the <b>console</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} IBM parallel <b>printer</b> <b>adapter</b> for the IBM PC {{was designed}} to support 8-bit data bidirectionally in 1981. This allowed the port {{to be used for}} other purposes, not just output to a printer. This was accomplished by allowing the data lines to be written to by devices on either end of the cable, which required the ports on the host to be bidirectional. This feature saw little use, and was removed in later revisions of the hardware. Years later, in 1987, IBM reintroduced the bidirectional interface with its IBM PS/2 series, where it could be enabled or disabled for compatibility with applications hardwired not to expect a printer port to be bidirectional.|$|R

5000|$|Among other {{novelties}} that Lotus introduced was a graph maker {{that could}} display several forms of graphs (including pie charts, bar graphics, or line charts) but required {{the user to}} have a graphics card. At this early stage, the only video boards available for the PC were IBM's Color/Graphics Adapter and Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> while the latter did not support any graphics. However, because the two video boards used different RAM and port addresses, both could be installed in the same machine and so Lotus took advantage of this by supporting a [...] "split" [...] screen mode whereby the user could display the worksheet portion of 1-2-3 on the sharper monochrome video and the graphics on the CGA display.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1990s, the MIPS {{architecture}} {{was widely}} {{adopted by the}} embedded market, including for use in computer networking, telecommunications, video arcade games, video game <b>consoles,</b> computer <b>printers,</b> digital set-top boxes, digital televisions, DSL and cable modems, and personal digital assistants.|$|R
5000|$|AN/FYA-2 Integrated Data Transfer Console: The AN/FYA-2 ("473L Integrated Console" [...] with Logic Keyboard Display (LKB) {{provided}} the fully equipped 473L operator environment—cf. AN/FYA-3 didn't have a Hard Copy Device (HC) for the Multicolored Display (MC), nor a <b>Console</b> <b>Printer</b> (CP); while the AN/FYA-4 only had an Electronic Typewriter/Display (RT) and CP. The console {{was run by}} a Monitor Program in the DPSS, and [...] "operational capabilities were exercised via operational capability overlays; that is, via plastic masks fitting over the logic keyboard portion of the operator console." [...] The original COC plan was for DPSS output for 11 MCs and 15 CPs (i.e., 4 of the simplest AN/FYA-4 consoles for printing reports).|$|R
50|$|The IBM Personal Computer was {{launched}} in 1981 with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) expansion card and the Monochrome Display And <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter.</b> The CGA offered two basic operating modes: 320×200 pixel (or 40x25 character) low resolution or a 640x200 (or 80×25 characters) pixels high resolution mode. While the low-resolution mode was very comparable to 8-bit home computers of the era, the higher-resolution mode offered a fair advance, used with a suitable RGBI (or RGB) monitor (such as the IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display). Still, since by design CGA {{was able to be}} connected to cheap composite monitors and even to home TVs (via RF modulator), CGA was limited in resolution; its text modes has a character box size of 8x8 pixels, which made text fairly rough-looking, especially in the vertical direction, which had only one pixel row for descenders.|$|R

50|$|Randolph {{was one of}} {{the first}} high schools to provide its {{students}} with a computer lab in 1981, which was donated by Intergraph, a local software company. The lab had a PDP-11/44 with 14 terminals, a <b>console</b> and <b>printer.</b> Wiring ran through the ceiling - a sharp departure from other computer labs of the day.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 2741 came in two {{different}} varieties, one using [...] "correspondence coding" [...] and the other using [...] "PTT/BCD coding." [...] These refer to the positioning of the characters around the typeball and, therefore, the tilt/rotate codes {{that have to be}} applied to the mechanism to produce a given character. A [...] "correspondence coding" [...] machine can use type elements from a standard office Selectric (i.e. elements used for [...] "office correspondence"). [...] "PTT/BCD coding" [...] machines need special elements, and did not have as wide a variety of fonts available. The IBM 1050 and its derivatives were only available in PTT/BCD coding. The two element types are physically interchangeable, but code-incompatible, so a type element from, say, a System/360 <b>console</b> <b>printer</b> (a variety of IBM 1050) produces gibberish on a [...] "correspondence coding" [...] 2741 or an office Selectric, and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in February 1983. Initially, they produced simple peripherals {{such as an}} RS-232 to Centronics parallel <b>printer</b> interface <b>adapter.</b> Later, they designed the Expanderam series of RAM expansion cards for the QL, {{which led to the}} Trump Card combined RAM expansion and floppy disk interface. This was notable in that it mapped RAM into memory space reserved for external peripheral devices, thus allowing the QL's RAM to be expanded to 768 kB rather than the official limit of 512 kB.|$|R

The hard-ware architecture which interferes with the in and output signals is based on a LSI- 11 / 2 microprocessor with sufficient mass storage for data logging, <b>console</b> and <b>printer.</b> The flexibility inherent to this hardware configuration is desired for optimalisation of the rectifier concerning maximum current, power, efficiency and quench stability. The paper describes the structure of the program and the interaction between both computer hardware and software and the superconducting rectifier. However, because the reliability of computersystems is unsatisfactory an additional hardware protection system still handles the most important alarms...|$|R
50|$|All models {{also had}} a 16-bit {{universal}} parallel port with separate input and output buses for connecting peripherals such as printers (Eastern Bloc printers used the incompatible ИРПР interface instead {{of the more popular}} Centronics port, so Centronics <b>printers</b> needed an <b>adapter),</b> mice or Covox DACs for sound output, and tape recorder port for data storage. Later models included a manufacturer-supplied floppy drive controller (that could be plugged into a Q-Bus slot) by default. It was available for earlier models as an aftermarket part, but homebrew ones (that also often extended rather anemic 16K memory of original BK) were more popular. A cottage industry for such peripherals and mods flourished.|$|R
5000|$|NorthStar BASIC was a dialect of the {{programming}} language BASIC originally provided {{for use on}} the NorthStar Horizon and NorthStar Advantage. The interpreter was written using only Intel 8080 instructions {{so that it could}} run also on custom systems. [...] One notable difference with other dialects of BASIC of the time was the array-like way in which strings were addressed. For example, A$(13,17) in NorthStar BASIC corresponded to MID$(A$,13,5) in other dialects. This string addressingtechnique is analogous to the one used in Fortran, and was also used in HP-3000 Basic and Atari BASIC. Strings were allocated 10 bytes maximum length unless DIMensioned otherwise. It was still possible to use arrays of strings, but these were declared in two or more dimensions, for example DIM B$(10,50) created 11 strings (0-10) of maximum length 50 bytes. Input from the keyboard and output to the <b>console</b> and <b>printers</b> were treated {{in the same way as}} reading and writing to data files. Some other differences were that POKE became FILL, PEEK became EXAM, and INSTR became MATCH.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} {{system can be}} located on any storage, but is typically installed on a hard disk or solid-state drive. A Live CD represents the concept of running an {{operating system}} directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the operating system on a hard disk drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard disk drives of similar size (as of mid-2014) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements. Computer communications involve internal modem cards, modems, network adapter cards, and routers. Common peripherals and adapter cards include headsets, joysticks, microphones, <b>printers,</b> scanners, sound <b>adapter</b> cards (as a separate card rather than located on the motherboard), speakers and webcams.|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press <b>console.</b> Thus the <b>printer</b> can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the research carried on developing an MPS (Multipurpose Portable System) which consists of an instrument and many accessories. The instrument is portable, hand-held, and rechargeable battery operated, and it measures temperature, absorbance, and concentration of samples by using optical principles. The system also performs auxiliary functions like incubation and mixing. This system {{can be used in}} environmental, industrial, and medical applications. ^ Research emphasis is on system modularity, easy configuration, accuracy of measurements, power management schemes, reliability, low cost, computer interface, and networking. The instrument can send the data to a computer for data analysis and presentation, or to a printer. ^ This dissertation includes the presentation of a full working system. This involved integration of hardware and firmware for the micro-controller in assembly language, software in C and other application modules. ^ The instrument contains the Optics, Transimpedance Amplifiers, Voltage-to-Frequency Converters, LCD display, Lamp Driver, Battery Charger, Battery Manager, Timer, Interface Port, and Micro-controller. ^ The accessories are a <b>Printer,</b> Data Acquisition <b>Adapter</b> (to transfer the measurements to a computer via the Printer Port and expand the Analog/Digital conversion capability), Car Plug Adapter, and AC Transformer. This system has been fully evaluated for fault tolerance and the schemes will also be presented. ...|$|R
