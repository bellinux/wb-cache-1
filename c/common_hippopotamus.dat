40|$|Herbivores that digest plant {{material}} in the fore-stomach can be divided in ruminants and non-ruminants. This study describes the distribution of feed particles (and inorganic material) and dry matter (DM) in the digestive tract of non-ruminant foregut fermenters. Results from passage trials led us to hypothesize that specific particle-sorting mechanisms, as observed in ruminants, are unlikely in non-ruminants. Therefore, no systematic particle size distribution effects (indicative of a sorting mechanism) should be evident in the fore-stomachs of these animals, but differences in fluid and particle retention suggest that differences in fluid concentration (measured as DM) could occur in the foregut of macropods and hippos. The gut content of eleven Bennett’s wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus), six collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), three pygmy hippos (Hexaprotodon liberiensis), two <b>common</b> hippos (<b>Hippopotamus</b> amphibius) and one two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) were analysed {{with an emphasis on}} the fore-stomach. The ventral and dorsal regions in sacciform compartments, and peripheral and central regions in tubular compartments, were examined. Results were not uniform across the species studied. A potential sedimentation mechanism was observed firstly by the accumulation of sand in the fore-stomach of the peccary and sloth, and secondly by the lower DM content in peripheral versus central and ventral versus dorsal regions of the fore-stomach of the wallabies and common hippos, respectively. However, pair-comparisons for different gut regions of wallabies and peccaries yielded no differences in mean particle size between fore-stomach regions. To conclude, some digesta fractionation does occur in the fore-stomach of the studied groups of non-ruminants, but not in a uniform manner, which in turn is in accordance with morphological dissimilarities of their respective foregut structures. The absence of systematic fractionation effects in non-ruminant foregut fermenters emphasizes the innovative character of the sorting mechanism in ruminants...|$|R

50|$|The {{behavior}} of the pygmy hippo differs from the common hippo in many ways. Much of its behavior is more {{similar to that of}} a tapir, though this is an effect of convergent evolution.

50|$|A moose's diet often {{depends on}} its location, {{but they seem to}} prefer the new growths from {{deciduous}} trees with a high sugar content, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. They also eat many aquatic plants such as lilies and water milfoil. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach plants 4.26 m off the ground. Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat aquatic plants. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to bathe in. Moose have been known to dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater.Hippopotamuses leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to 10 km, to graze on short grasses, their main source of food. They spend four to five hours grazing and can consume 68 kg of grass each night. Like almost any herbivore, they consume other plants if presented with them, but their diet consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. The pygmy hippopotamus emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces.

The important relationships between the hippopotamus and fish were presented. Hippopotamuses usually defecate in water and their excrements enrich the nutrients in the water resulting in favourable conditions for large fish populations.

We surveyed the hippopotamus population in the Masai Mara National Reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in 2006 using foot counts along 155. 3 km of the main rivers. We counted 4, 170 hippopotamuses in 171 schools. Comparisons with earlier surveys suggest that this population increased by 169. 6 % between 1971 and 1980 within the reserve and, although it did not increase within the reserve during 1980 – 2006, it increased by 359. 4 % outside the reserve during this period {{against a background of}} deteriorating habitat conditions. The overall density in 2006 was 26. 9 hippopotamuses km- 1 of river, equivalent to a biomass of 26, 677 kg km- 1 of river. The ratio of calves to 100 adults was 9 : 100 inside the reserve, 10 : 100 outside the reserve and 6 : 100 along tributaries of the Mara River, implying that the population is either increasing or that its spatial distribution is being compressed because of range contraction. The apparent increase in the hippopotamus population contrasts with marked contemporaneous declines in the populations of most other large mammalian herbivore species in the Reserve.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{intake and}} digestibility studies in four <b>common</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> amphibius) and four pygmy (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) hippos from two zoological institutions, using acid detergent lignin as an internal marker for the quantification of faecal output. In {{the case of}} one pygmy hippo, where total faecal collection was also possible, there was no distinct {{difference between the two}} methods of faecal output quantification. Two animals from each species were tested on a conventional zoo diet of hay and concentrates (diet HC) and on hay only (diet H). The other two animals received fresh grass at two different levels of intake (diets G 1 and G 2). Dry matter (DM) intake was higher on HC than on H or G diets, and averaged 37 +/- 11 for common and 35 +/- 14 g/kg(0. 75) for pygmy hippos. There were no species differences in the average digestibility (aD) coefficients. Non-dietary faecal nitrogen averaged 65 +/- 4 % of total faecal nitrogen, aD of crude protein (CP) averaged 67 +/- 9 % and true protein digestibility 89 +/- 3 %. Average digestibility of DM and crude fibre averaged 54 +/- 11 % and 45 +/- 17 %, respectively. In comparison with ruminants, hippos generally achieve lower aD for DM, organic matter and fibre parameters, but equal or higher aD CP coefficients. This is most likely due to the absence of significant fermentative activity in the hindgut and the corresponding low metabolic faecal nitrogen losses. Digestible energy intake was higher on HC than on H or G diets and averaged 0. 30 +/- 0. 11 MJ/kg(0. 75) metabolic body mass. This value is extremely low for ungulates, supporting earlier suspicions that hippos have particularly low metabolic rates, and explains the proneness of this species to obesity in captivity when fed energy-dense pelleted feeds...|$|E

In this study I explore aspects of the spatial and behavioural ecology of hippo within the St Lucia Estuary. More specifically, I investigate select abiotic and biotic predictors of hippo presence and the frequency with which they return to their diurnal lie-up sites. I used binary logistic regression models to evaluate the effects of the selected habitat features on hippo occurrence at two spatial scales (broad and fine). I used a negative binomial with log-link model to evaluate the effects of the selected habitat features on the frequency of use of sites (hippo persistence) in the fine-scale study. In addition, I employed both instantaneous scan sampling and continuous sampling methods in an attempt to determine the diurnal activity budgets and social interactions of a single group near the mouth of the St Lucia Estuary.

40|$|International audiencePolystomatid flatworms (Platyhelminthes) are monogenean parasites that infect {{exclusively}} aquatic or semi-aquatic sarcopterygians {{such as the}} Australian lungfish, amphibians, {{freshwater turtles}} and the African <b>common</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b> Previous studies on the phylogenetic relationships of these parasites, excluding Oculotrema hippopotami infecting common hippos, showed a global coevolution between hosts and their parasites at a macroevolutionary scale. These studies also demonstrated {{a strong correlation between}} the diversification of early neobatrachian polystomes and Gondwana breakup in the Mesozoic period. However the origin of chelonian polystomes is still in question as a switch from presumably primitive aquatic amniotes to turtles {{at the time of their}} first appearance, or soon after during their radiation, was assumed. In order to resolve this sticking point, we extended the phylogeny of polystomes with broader parasite sampling, i. e. 55 polystome species including Nanopolystoma tinsleyi a polystome infecting caecilians and O. hippopotami, and larger set of sequence data covering two nuclear and two mitochondrial genes coding for the ribosomal RNA 18 S and 28 S, the Cytochrome c Oxidase I and the ribosomal RNA 12 S, respectively. The secondary structure of nuclear rRNAs genes (stems and loops) was taken into account for sequence alignments and Bayesian analyses were performed based on the appropriate models of evolution selected independently for the four designed partitions. Molecular calibrations were also conducted for dating the main speciation events in the polystome tree. The phylogenetic position of chelonian parasites that are phylogenetically closer to N. tinsleyi than all other amphibian polystomes and molecular time estimates suggest that these parasites originated following a switch from caecilians, at a geological period when primitive turtles may already have adapted to an aquatic life style, i. e. at about 178 Million years ago, or a little later when the crown group of extant turtles have already diversified, i. e. at about 152 Mya. Similarly, because O. hippopotami constitutes the sister group of chelonian parasites, proposing that an African caecilian could be the ancestral host for this polystome species seems at this stage the most likely hypothesis to explain its occurrence within the common hippo. Regardless of the scenario that may be predicted to explain the origin of polystomes within aquatic or semi-aquatic amniotes, their presence and evolution are indicative of early aquatic ecological habits within ancestral lineages...|$|E
40|$|Although {{several aspects}} of the {{digestive}} physiology of the hippopotamidae-non-ruminating foregut fermenters-have been described, ingesta kinetics and passage characteristics of these species are not well understood. The most outstanding feature of the hippo digestive physiology reported so far is the very long mean ingesta retention times (MRTs) measured by Foose [Foose, T., 1982. Trophic strategies of ruminant versus nonruminant ungulates. PhD dissertation, University of Chicago, Chicago. ]. Since those data had been investigated with animals without water access, we intended to measure MRT in hippos which were allowed to enter water pools during the night. MRT parameters as well as dry matter (DM) digestibility were determined in four <b>common</b> (<b>Hippopotamus</b> amphibius) and four pygmy hippos (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) on two different diets each using cobalt ethylendiamintetraacetate (Co-EDTA) as a fluid, chromium (Cr) -mordanted fibre (< 2 mm) as a particle and acid detergent lignin (ADL) as an internal digestibility marker. Four of the animals additionally received cerium (Ce) -mordanted fibres (2 - 10 mm) as particle markers. Total MRTs for fluids and particles ranged between 20 - 35 and 48 - 106 h in the common and between 13 - 39 and 32 - 107 h in the pygmy hippos. The difference between fluid and particle retention was greater than usually reported in ruminants. Excretion patterns of the markers differed from those usually observed in ruminants but resembled those reported for macropods (kangaroos), indicating a plug-flow reactor-like physiology in the hippo forestomach (FRST). This finding complements other described similarities between the macropod and the hippo forestomach. The measurements of larger particle retention profiles suggest that in the hippo, larger particles might be excreted either faster or {{at the same rate}} as smaller particles, indicating a general difference between ruminants and hippos with respect to differential particle retention. The digestive physiology of hippos is characterised by a generally low food intake, long ingesta retention times and dry matter digestibilities lower than reported in ruminants. Moderate digestibilities in spite of long retention times might be the result of the generally high average ingesta particle size in hippos. The comparatively easy management of pygmy hippos, together with the significant correlations between food intake, MRT and digestibility in the pygmy hippos of this study, recommends this species for further studies on the interplay of these parameters in herbivore digestive physiology...|$|E
