50|$|Limit {{analysis}} is a structural analysis field which {{is dedicated to}} the development of efficient methods to directly determine estimates of the <b>collapse</b> <b>load</b> of a given structural model without resorting to iterative or incremental analysis. For this purpose, the field of limit {{analysis is}} based on a set of theorems, referred to as limit theorems, which are a set of theorems based on the law of conservation of energy that state properties regarding stresses and strains, lower and upper-bound limits for the <b>collapse</b> <b>load</b> and the exact <b>collapse</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractFinite-element {{analysis}} {{based on}} elastic–perfectly plastic material {{was conducted to}} examine the influence of structural deformations on <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> of circumferential through-wall critically cracked 90 ° pipe bends undergoing in-plane closing bending and internal pressure. The critical crack is defined for a through-wall circumferential crack at the extrados with a subtended angle below {{which there is no}} weakening effect on collapse moment of elbows subjected to in-plane closing bending. Elliptical and semioval cross sections were postulated at the bend regions and compared. Twice-elastic-slope method was utilized to obtain the <b>collapse</b> <b>loads.</b> Structural deformations, namely, ovality and thinning, were each varied from 0 % to 20 % in steps of 5 % and the normalized internal pressure was varied from 0. 2 to 0. 6. Results indicate that elliptic cross sections were suitable for pipe ratios 5 and 10, whereas for pipe ratio 20, semioval cross sections gave satisfactory solutions. The effect of ovality on <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> is significant, although it cancelled out at a certain value of applied internal pressure. Thinning had a negligible effect on <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> of bends with crack geometries considered...|$|R

Postbuckling failure {{behaviors}} and strength were investigated in compression {{tests of the}} hat stiffened composite panels manufactured with different bonding methods and different stiffener section shapes. The skin-stiffener separation loads, separation failure {{behaviors and}} final <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> were different with respect to bonding methods and stiffener shapes.

40|$|Combustion {{characteristics}} of a single CWM (Coal-Water-Mixture) droplet placed on a hot surface in a test furnace were investigated. The <b>collapsing</b> <b>load</b> of an ash grain which is formed by the combustion of the CWM droplet was also measured to clarify {{the relationship between the}} burning temperature and burn-out state of the droplet. Two stage combustion which is usually observed in pulverized coal combustion was observed in the burning sequence of the CWM droplet on the hot surface. The first stage of combustion was due to the burning of flammable gas from the volatile matter in the coal. The second stage was the char combustion of the coal. As the temperature on the hot surface increased, the <b>collapsing</b> <b>load</b> of the ash grain decreased. It reached a minimum load and then increased with an increase of the temperature of the hot surface. It was considered that the combination of the unburned coal at low temperatures and melted ash at high temperatures resulted in the hard grain of ash which had a high <b>collapsing</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R

Finite element analysis is often therefore used to solve more complicated cases.

50|$|If, {{for a given}} {{external}} load, it {{is possible}} to find a distribution of moments that satisfies equilibrium requirements, with the moment not exceeding the yield moment at any location, and if the boundary conditions are satisfied, then the given load is a lower bound on the <b>collapse</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

50|$|Elasticity theory {{depends on}} {{guessing}} {{the way in}} which a structure works, and the loads it will be subjected to, and designing it to carry those loads in the assumed manner.

Therefore, it gives an upper bound on the <b>collapse</b> <b>load</b> (the load at which it collapses will not be higher than that calculated).

Upon recovering, he became a Technical Officer with the Structural Steel Research Committee, which was investigating why measured stresses in structural steel bore little resemblance to theoretical ones.

50|$|If {{a column}} is {{circular}} (or nearly so) {{an increase in}} axial capacity is also achieved by wrapping. In this application, the confinement of the CFRP wrap enhances the compressive strength of the concrete.

Specialist ultra-high modulus CFRP (with tensile modulus of 420 GPa or more) {{is one of the}} few practical methods of strengthening cast-iron beams. In typical use, it is bonded to the tensile flange of the section, both increasing the stiffness of the section and lowering the neutral axis, thus greatly reducing the maximum tensile stress in the cast iron.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Numerical {{simulations}} using {{continuum mechanics}} and elasto-plasticity {{are often used}} in geotechnical design. Determination of <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> {{may be part of}} such simulations. However, non-associated flow rules applied to frictional materials normally provide lower <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> than stated by classical methods. Should we stick to the classical solutions for design or should we rather trust the numerically obtained solutions? Non-associated plasticity is attractive when observed soil behaviour in conventional laboratory tests shall be reproduced. In this paper example simulations are made by the computer program PLAXIS showing lower failure loads for non-associated plasticity than the classical solutions. Well accepted theories for material instability using non-associated plasticity may explain the discrepancy, Rudnicki and Rice (1975). The instability implies bifurcations, zero stiffness modes and localized deformation in shear bands. The illustrations in this paper are focusing more on the physical collapse mechanisms than the mathematical singularities. The paper encourages a discussion on the practical consequences of using non-associated flow rules. The problem is of growing relevance since failure margins increasingly often are estimated using commercial finite element codes. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a bipotential approach for estimating the plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>loads</b> of a half-space made with a non-associated Mohr–Coulomb material and indented by a rigid punch. In geotechnics, this problem is called the bearing capacity of shallow strip footing for which the analytical solution is derived by Prandtl (1920) [46] and Hill (1950) [35] {{in the context of}} associated plasticity. However, when the plastic model is not associated, no analytical methods have yet been developed. Here we explore this issue in a rigorous mathematical framework coupling the bipotential concept and limit analysis. First, the method proposed makes use of the method of characteristics to build a statically and plastically admissible stress field that enables a lower estimate of the plastic limit loads. Next, the extended kinematic theorem of limit analysis to non-standard plasticity is applied to derive an upper quasi-bound of the <b>collapse</b> <b>loads.</b> For this aim, the internal rate of plastic dissipation is obtained thanks to the bipotential functional depending on both a trial stress field and a Prandtl-like collapse mechanism.
