40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} how gender {{plays a role in}} the framing of US-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today. Through an analysis of a selection of articles from the week of Clinton’s announcement of her candidacy in 2007 and 2015, the aim of this paper is, with an inductive approach, to discover whether a gender stereotypical framing of Clinton is apparent and how it is displayed. By combining Robert Entman’s (1993) theory on framing with gender theory by Karen Ross (2004), Sandra Bem (1974), and Susan Golombok and Robyn Fivush (1993), this project further seeks to explore the consequences of gendered framing for Clinton herself and for the general view of women in society. The analysis shows that the chosen articles consistently frame Clinton by how she fits in or deviates from stereotypical expectations of women and women behaviour. Our finding is that Clinton is framed significantly more positive when described by traditional womanly characteristics, than when described by traditional male characteristics. The consequences of this gendered framing of Clinton are firstly, that it acts as a hindrance towards her run for the presidency, as it limits her own performance to two options: to act upon the stereotypical framing of her as a woman or to try to live up to stereotypical expectations of a president acting masculine. Ultimately, the gendered framing of <b>Clinton</b> <b>can</b> act to reproduce and uphold gender stereotypical views on women in society...|$|E

40|$|As our {{legion of}} {{obviously}} highly observant and dedicated readers will immediately note, {{this issue of}} the Policy Studies Review is marked by the introduction of a new feature which we have chosen to characterize as policy advocacy essays. Specifically, the two essays featured in this issue-"Strategic Treasury Debt Management in Public Policy" by Campbell R. Harvey and "How the <b>Clinton</b> Administration <b>Can</b> Make Foreign Aid Work" by Neil S. Zank-are significantly different from our typical articles. They go a good way beyond the usually rather cautious recommendations for policy change that are upon occasion put forward at the conclusion of our typically quite analytical and often empirically based articles. In contrast, neither of the two essays that follow intend to be objective. Rather, both authors, as individuals with long-time expertise in the areas about which they are writing, have quite decided opinions about significant reforms in major areas of national policy which {{they would like to see}} implemented.

50|$|The term liberal hawk {{refers to}} a {{politically}} liberal person (in the American sense of the term)who supports a hawkish, interventionist foreign policy. Past U.S. presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson {{have been described as}} liberal hawks for their roles in bringing about the US' status as the world's premier military power. The <b>Clinton</b> Doctrine <b>can</b> also be considered as consistent with this vision. Today the term is most frequently used to describe liberals and leftists who supported or still support the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorized by the United States Congress and ordered by president George W. Bush. The war has stirred heated controversy among all political sides of the debate. The American left was divided over the issue of whether going to war in Iraq was the right decision, as some liberals felt that they should support the war, in accordance with the philosophy of liberal internationalism, which had caused them to support military intervention in the past.|$|R

Specifically, while Lichtman's model says (accurately) that any candidate with eight or more positive keys and five or fewer negative keys will win the popular vote, any candidate with [...] eight positive keys and five negative ones runs a serious risk of winning the popular vote but losing the electoral college. In these specific cases, campaign factors may actually matter. Candidates with exactly 5 negative keys who run stellar or at least highly competent campaigns, even when faced with the very real possibility of losing the electoral college (Truman in 1948, Bill <b>Clinton</b> in 1996) <b>can</b> seal an electoral college victory on top of their popular vote win. Candidates with exactly five negative keys who don't campaign, run a poor campaign, or take their win in certain states for granted (Grover Cleveland in 1888, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016) typically lose the electoral college, even if they do win the popular vote.|$|R
40|$|Female {{labor force}} {{participation}} and labor {{supply in the}} United States, {{as in many other}} devel-oped countries, has changed dramatically over the last 30 years. If one contrasts the labor supply behavior of the cohorts of women born in the 1930 s (such as Elizabeth Dole), 1940 s (Hillary Clinton), and 1950 s (Oprah Winfrey) in its various dimensions, two main features emerge. First, comparing the Elizabeth Dole cohort to the Hillary <b>Clinton</b> one, we <b>can</b> see a substantial shift of the age profile of labor supply: the Clinton cohort worked more than the Dole cohort. However, the shape of the age profile does not change much. In particular, in both profiles we observe low participation (relative to other ages) corresponding to child rearing years. When comparing the Hillary Clinton cohort with the Oprah Winfrey one, we see that the low participation rates associated with the “fertility years ” are no longer present. The aim {{of this paper is to}} construct a life-cycle model of labor supply and saving that could explain these dramatic changes and, in particular, the difference between the Clinton and Winfrey cohorts. We explore the extent to which realistic changes to some specific parameters and exogenous variables of this model can generate the patterns observed in the data. Or, to use a different perspective, we want to quantify the size of changes in these variables that would be needed to explain the observed patterns. We build a model of the participation and savings decisions of households across the life cycle and calibrate this model by matching simulated participation and wage profiles to observed participation and wage profiles. The main change in female labor supply behavior in the data is on the extensive margin. For this reason, we focus on participation choices. Households ar...|$|R
