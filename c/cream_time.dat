In this work, these results were applied to the field of emulsion polymerization, to create meta-stable, mono-disperse monomer solutions, which were then polymerized to produce stable dispersions of polymer spheres.

Recently, a trial panel fabricated before actual large-scale production of panels contained blow holes.

40|$|AbstractFlexible PU foam was {{synthesized}} {{by using}} recycled PU foam polyol (Infrigreen) which contain 4 functionality obtained from glycolysis wasted PU foam, as a polyol. PU foam is prepared by incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wt% in petrochemical polyol (CARADOL. SA 34 - 05) which contain 2 functionality. Triethlylenediamine (TEGOAMIN 33) {{was used as}} the gelling catalyst. Polyether modified polysiloxane (TPGAOSTAB B 8715 LF 2) was the surfactant. Distilled water was used as a blowing agent to generate foam. Polymeric methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) which contain 2. 7 isocyanate groups/molecule was used for generate urethane linkage and carbon dioxide. The parameters investigated are characteristic time, i. e. <b>cream</b> <b>time,</b> gel time, rise time and tack free time, cell structure and cell morphology, tensile properties, compressive properties and compression set were compared with petrochemical based PU foam. It was found from the research that, <b>cream</b> <b>time,</b> gel time, rise time and tack free time, decrease with the recycled PU foam polyol content. It was also found that the incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol led to the increase in smaller cell size and large distribution of cell size. Tensile properties and compressive properties of PU foam increase with polyol functionality, including crosslink density and urea formation in PU foam. Decreasing of shape recover properties of PU foam obtained at high recycled PU foam polyol contents. This was caused by the deformation of hydrogen bonding between hard segments of PU chains. These results indicate that tensile properties and compressive properties of PU foam enhance by incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol...|$|E

ABSTRACT: One of the important applications of polyurethanes is polyurethane foam. Flexible type of polyurethane foam is divided into many types {{and one of them}} is visco-elastic foam. Visco-elastic foam is unique foam showing both viscous and elastic behavior at same time. Visco-elastic foam covers major applications of flexible polyurethane foam. Visco-elastic foam samples were synthesized on lab scale by cup foaming. All samples were characterized by finding density of each sample. <b>Cream</b> <b>time,</b> gel time and rise time were also estimated for each sample.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{physical}} stability and aerosol characteristics of suspensions of hollow porous microspheres (PulmoSpheres) in HFA- 134 a. METHODS: Cromolyn sodium, albuterol sulfate, and formoterol fumarate microspheres were prepared by a spray-drying method. Particle size and morphology were determined via electron microscopy. Particle aggregation and suspension <b>creaming</b> <b>times</b> were assessed visually, and aerosol performance was determined via Andersen cascade impaction and dose uniformity studies. RESULTS: The hollow porous particle morphology allows the propellant to permeate freely within the particles creating a novel form of suspension termed a homodispersion, wherein the dispersed and continuous phases are identical, separated by an insoluble interfacial layer of drug and excipient. Homodispersion formation improves suspension stability by minimizing {{the difference in}} density between the particles and the medium, and by reducing attractive forces between particles. The improved physical stability leads to excellent dose uniformity. Excellent aerosolization efficiencies are also observed with PulmoSpheres formulations, with fine particle fractions of about 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of hollow porous particles provides a new formulation technology for stabilizing suspensions of drugs in hydrofluoroalkane propellants with improved physical stability, content uniformity, and aerosolization efficiency...|$|R

The structures and physical properties of rigid polyurethane foams blown by water were measured with FT-IR, {{universal testing machine}} (Instron 3365), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The results show that polyurea and polybiuret were the typical characteristics, and the <b>cream</b> <b>time</b> and gel time were shorter for the fully water blown rigid foams than that for the fully cyclopentane blown foams. The density of foam samples decreased from 45. 0 kg/m(3) to 27. 4 kg/m(3) {{with the increase of}} water level from 3 pph to 7 pph. Compressive strength exhibited the similar behavior with density. The average cell size of foam samples ranged from 241 mu m to 356 mu m with the increase of water level from 3 pph to 7 pph, respectively. At the same time, poorer dimensional stability was encountered with the increase of average cell size due to fast diffusion rate of CO 2 out of the foam. The results of thermal analysis show that the glass transition temperature (T-g) shifted to a higher temperature with the increase of isocyanate level when more water was used as chemical blowing agent.

40|$|Research on the {{development}} of lightweight concrete (LWC) utilizing wastes and natural resources as lightweight aggregates (LWA) is increasingly gaining attention worldwide due to sustainable and environmental concerns. A new alternative is using palm kernel oil polyol (PKO-p) -based polyurethane (PU) as filler. Rigid PU is a block copolymer comprised of a monomeric PKO-p and 2, 4 -methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (crude MDI). The property of PKO-p, its ratio with crude MDI and reaction time were determined. The reaction time showed the average of 60 s for <b>cream</b> <b>time</b> and 95 s for rise time with maximum hardening time of 8 min. The reaction between PKO-p to MDI at 1 : 1 ratio resulted in a very short hardening time (within 2 min). The compressive strength of the rigid PU was at 7. 0 MPa at a density of 206 kg/m 3. Further increase in the amount of PKO-p increased the density and compressive strength of the PU. PU aggregate in the concrete mixture was added at 1 to 5 % (w/w) to obtain concrete with density of less than 1800 kg/m 3. The resulting concrete has excellent compressive strength (17. 5 MPa) and thermal conductivity (0. 24 W/m⋅K). The results showed that physical properties of PU played the most significant effect on the physical and mechanical properties of the lightweight concrete...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenerally, the {{flexible}} polyurethane foams were synthesized by mainly petroleum-based polyols. In this present study, Caradol SA 34 - 05 (petroleum-based polyol) {{was replaced by}} Emerox® 14001 (natural oil-based polyol) with 0 - 50 wt% replacement to prepare flexible polyurethane foam by one shot method. The NCO index (NCO equivalent/OH equivalent) was fixed at 1. 00. The characteristic times such as <b>cream</b> <b>time,</b> gel time, rise time and tack free time were followed during cup test. The physical properties were characterized and studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and foam density. The tensile and compression properties were investigated by UTM machine. The {{results show that the}} foam density decreased with increasing Emerox® 14001 contents up to 20 wt% replacement and then decreased. This trandency was similar to tensile modulus, compressive modulus and compressive strength results. The cell size of foams was important parameter to control their properties. However, tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by the addition of Emerox® 14001 at 20 wt% contents replacement and then decreased at higher content. Both parameters rely on balance between urethane linkages and urea microdomain and/or polyurea ball contents(urea aggregate), which were rapidly generated by isocyanate group and water. The increased Emerox® 14001 contents required more isocyanate. As a result, more urea microdomain were produced leading to the decreasing of tensile strength and elongation at break. Moreover, the compression set of the foams was dependent upon amount of urea linkages which was generated from the reaction of isocyanate group and water...|$|E
