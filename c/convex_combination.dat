5|$|By {{mathematical}} induction, a setQ is convex if and onlyif every <b>convex</b> <b>combination</b> {{of members}} ofQ also belongs toQ. By definition, a <b>convex</b> <b>combination</b> of an indexedsubset{v0,v1,...,vD} of a vector space is any weighted average for some indexedset of non-negative real numbers{λd} satisfying the equation=1.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly <b>convex</b> <b>combination</b> of both.|$|E
25|$|Probability {{distributions}} {{are not a}} vector space—they are not closed under linear combinations, {{as these}} do not preserve non-negativity or total integral 1—but they are closed under <b>convex</b> <b>combination,</b> thus forming a convex subset of the space of functions (or measures).|$|E

25|$|If a kernel is non-negative, such {{as for a}} Gaussian kernel, {{then the}} value of the {{filtered}} signal will be a <b>convex</b> <b>combination</b> of the input values (the coefficients (the kernel) integrate to 1, and are non-negative), and will thus fall between the minimum and maximum of the input signal – it will not undershoot or overshoot. If, on the other hand, the kernel assumes negative values, such as the sinc function, then {{the value of the}} filtered signal will instead be an affine combination of the input values, and may fall outside of the minimum and maximum of the input signal, resulting in undershoot and overshoot, as in the Gibbs phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, if a {{feasible}} solution {{exists and}} if the (linear) objective function is bounded, then the optimum value is always attained on the boundary of optimal level-set, by the maximum principle for convex functions (alternatively, by the minimum principle for concave functions): Recall that linear functions are both convex and concave. However, some problems have distinct optimal solutions: For example, the problem of finding a feasible solution {{to a system of}} linear inequalities is a linear programming problem in which the objective function is the zero function (that is, the constant function taking the value zero everywhere): For this feasibility problem with the zero-function for its objective-function, if there are two distinct solutions, then every <b>convex</b> <b>combination</b> of the solutions is a solution.|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of {{probability}} theory, it is natural to impose the additional condition that the initial η1 in an approximation to the identity should be positive, as such a function then represents a probability distribution. [...] Convolution with a probability distribution is sometimes favorable {{because it does not}} result in overshoot or undershoot, as the output is a <b>convex</b> <b>combination</b> of the input values, and thus falls between the maximum and minimum of the input function. [...] Taking η1 to be any probability distribution at all, and letting [...] as above will give rise to an approximation to the identity.
