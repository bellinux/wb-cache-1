500|$|In {{addition}} to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, {{other aspects of}} his personality have been explored. In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced {{to spend a week}} working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the [...] "softer side" [...] of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, [...] "I feel like that it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome." [...] In [...] "Furt" [...] and [...] "Born This Way", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an [...] "A" [...] student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in [...] "Born This Way" [...] is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in [...] "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next <b>class</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

[...] Illinois sued Trudeau and Jules Leib, his partner, accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. [...] They settled with Illinois and seven other states for $185,000 after agreeing to change their tactics. [...] Michigan forbade him from operating in the state. A class action lawsuit was filed by stockholders of Nutrition for Life for violations of Texas law, including misrepresenting and/or omitting material information about Nutrition for Life International, Inc.'s business.
