40|$|Saul Alinsky is {{a pioneer}} of <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> methods and techniques. He has laid a {{foundation}} {{of one of the}} most popular and applicable method in social work. The core dimension of <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> is local control on development process in a democratic way. The power is based on participation of people where leadership development is at centre of relationship building, and political education. Various strategies related to development, resource mobilization and community action, etc., are the other dimensions where the social worker has to practice community work. In this paper various principles such as people's motivation, dynamism in organizing processes, dealing with conflicting situations are explained and the activities which cannot be considered as <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> are also discussed. Among them the social activism, social advocacy, social movement, legal action, direct service etc., cannot be considered as a <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> though it is based on organizing the people. Various models such as locality development model action model and community planning model, is elaborated in depth. Various steps involved in <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> are discussed in detail. The ten basic rules of <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> provide insight for scientific approach for <b>community</b> <b>organization.</b> The distinction between <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> and <b>community</b> development provides the relationship between each other which ultimately concerned with social change and social development...|$|R

For achieving total development <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> is used. In community development the aspects like Democratic procedures, Voluntary cooperation, Self-help, Development of leadership, Awareness and sensitisation aspects are considered as important.

40|$|Many {{evolving}} {{complex systems}} can be modeled via dynamic networks. An important problem in dynamic network research is community detection, which identifies groups of topologically related nodes. Typically, this problem is approached by assuming either that each time point has a distinct <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> or that all time points share one <b>community</b> <b>organization.</b> In reality, the truth likely lies between these two extremes, since some time periods can have <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> that evolves while others can have <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> that stays the same. To find the compromise, we consider community detection {{in the context of}} the problem of segment detection, which identifies contiguous time periods with consistent network structure. Consequently, we formulate a combined problem of segment community detection (SCD), which simultaneously partitions the network into contiguous time segments with consistent <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> and finds this <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> for each segment. To solve SCD, we introduce SCOUT, an optimization framework that explicitly considers both segmentation quality and partition quality. SCOUT addresses limitations of existing methods that can be adapted to solve SCD, which typically consider only one of segmentation quality or partition quality. In a thorough evaluation, SCOUT outperforms the existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas.

This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

Results showed that perception of <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> regarding <b>community</b> participation concept were the effort to move society to be caring and involved in handling problem of health. To accelerate the decrease of MMR and IMR, participation of <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> manifested with caring, involvement, cooperation, and partnership with governmental institutions.
