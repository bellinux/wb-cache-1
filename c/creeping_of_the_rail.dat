30|$|<b>The</b> {{interaction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and {{wheel and}} the resulting phenomena such as wear and noise are considered as very important issues in railway transportation which allocates considerable research activities in advanced railways in the world yearly since <b>the</b> inappropriate interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel has always brought about costly items such as extreme structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments and fractures of pavement and road bed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines and also automotive transportation and most importantly causes irreparable accidents. By analyzing the repair and maintenance railway costs worldwide, we found that a huge expedition is done in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> purchase, change and installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel in the railway industry every year [5, 6]. The wheel has a special geometric form, and <b>the</b> geometric incompatibility <b>of</b> a wheel’s profile with <b>the</b> geometric characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line could have negative circumstances such as extreme wear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel and dynamic instability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway transportation appliance, since <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway appliance and the passengers comfort is dependent on <b>the</b> wear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel [7]. Thus, it could be inferred that <b>the</b> compatibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel’s profile is the most vital factor in controlling the wear. <b>The</b> rolling contact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel will cause wearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel profile and in return there will be phenomena such as negative effects in dynamic function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train and comfort in traveling, <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> emersion from <b>the</b> line, permanent misshapes, reduction in the wheel longevity, reduction in security, reduction in <b>the</b> repairing period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line and, as a result, a reduction in efficiency {{and an increase in}} costs [8]. Recognition and reduction in the mentioned phenomena require sufficient knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel and <b>rail</b> wear. Due to <b>the</b> solidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel, small contact area and the heavy weight applied in railway cars, there is high stress that would lead to phenomena such as wear and fatigue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel.|$|R

40|$|High {{values of}} {{residual}} stresses is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common reason of breaking lots of metal constructions, including rails. These stresses can reach values of flow limit, especially in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> faults. Estimation of residual stresses values allows {{to get information}} about technical condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and also allow to avoid abnormal situations So, <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research is creating <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> stress-strain state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> which was hardened in its top and bottom, and to compare modeling results with experimental measurements of stresses and discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing. For creating the model and making evaluations by finite element method we used a program COMSOL. Forces {{on the top and}} bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> cause tension stresses, forces on <b>the</b> web <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> cause tensile stresses. We compared calculated values of stresses with discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing. <b>The</b> discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing is informative characteristic for estimating the residual stresses according to standards. For experimental measurements we used an acoustic structuroscope SEMA. This structuroscope uses the acoustoelastic phenomenon for measurements. We made measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>rails.</b> According to <b>the</b> calculation results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model, critical discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing in 2 mm corresponded to <b>the</b> following values <b>of</b> maximum stresses: – 54 MPa in <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> 86 MPa in the web and – 62 MPa in <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> Experimental measurements are the following: from – 48 MPa to – 64 MPa in <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> 54 MPa to 93 MPa in <b>the</b> web <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> and – 59 MPA to – 74 MPa in <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> Absolute error was ± 5 MPa.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Instrumentation {{was used}} to measure soil {{temperature}} and, indepen-dently, the force and strain in a steep geogrid-reinforced soil slope. The monitoring period extends to 10 years after construction. A nonlinear increase of force occurs with time that is described by a hyperbolic representation. The elapsed time to achieve force equilibrium was approximately 2. 5 × 104 hours (approximately three years). <b>The</b> time-dependent increase <b>of</b> reinforcement force is attributed to deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure resulting from <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backfill sand. Strain in the reinforcement exhibits a com-plex variation with time. <b>The</b> long-term variation <b>of</b> strain is attributed primarily to: (i) <b>the</b> nonlinear increase <b>of</b> force; and (ii) <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geogrid reinforcement.

40|$|Creep and {{shrinkage}} behaviour of an ultra lightweight cement composite (ULCC) up to 450 days was evaluated {{in comparison with}} those of a normal weight aggregate concrete (NWAC) and a lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) with similar 28 -day compressive strength. The ULCC is characterized by low density < 1500 kg/m 3 and high compressive strength about 60 MPa. Autogenous shrinkage increased rapidly in the ULCC at early-age and almost 95 % occurred prior to <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>creep</b> test at 28 days. Hence, majority <b>of</b> shrinkage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ULCC during <b>creep</b> test was drying shrinkage. Total shrinkage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ULCC during the 450 -day creep test was the lowest compared to the NWAC and LWAC. However, corresponding total creep in the ULCC was the highest with high proportion attributed to basic creep (≥ ~ 90 %) and limited drying <b>creep.</b> <b>The</b> high <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ULCC is likely due to its low elastic modulus. Specific <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ULCC {{was similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NWAC, but more than 80 % higher than <b>the</b> LWAC. <b>Creep</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ULCC was about 47 % lower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NWAC but about 18 % higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LWAC. Among five creep models evaluated which tend to over-estimate <b>the</b> <b>creep</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ULCC, EC 2 model gives acceptable prediction within + 25 % deviations.
