5|$|Although Maya cities shared many <b>common</b> <b>features,</b> {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in architectural style. Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|Robert Adam's {{houses in}} this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, {{but it is}} most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. <b>Common</b> <b>features</b> {{borrowed}} from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations.|$|E
5|$|Additional <b>common</b> <b>features</b> {{are shared}} by the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns; a large court with colonnades lies {{directly}} in front of the central megaron, while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures. The staircases in the palace of Pylos indicate that the palaces had two stories. The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the second floor.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most <b>common</b> <b>features</b> found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. <b>Common</b> <b>features</b> uniting this group include the {{vertical}} arms of the receptacle (fruit body) that are not joined together at the base, and the spongy structure of the receptacle. According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison in 2011 {{argued that}} Opisthocoelicaudia {{was able to}} angle the {{anterior}} part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part {{would have been more}} straight during rearing than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. <b>Common</b> <b>features</b> of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to rearing.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, two new phylogeny-aware tools appeared. One {{is called}} PAGAN that was {{developed}} by the same team as PRANK. The other is ProGraphMSA developed by Szalkowski. Both software packages were developed independently but share <b>common</b> <b>features,</b> notably the use of graph algorithms to improve the recognition of non-homologous regions, and an improvement in code making these software faster than PRANK.|$|E
5|$|Krishna is {{represented}} in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some <b>common</b> <b>features.</b> His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out {{of which he is}} formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a purple-colored fruit).|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean armies shared several <b>common</b> <b>features</b> {{with other}} {{significant}} Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore spears, large shields and, in some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry. Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until {{the collapse of}} the Bronze Age, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.|$|E

5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are <b>common</b> <b>features</b> in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and {{geometrical}} designs. Nature is frequently {{used as the basis}} of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.|$|E
5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief {{in the power of}} the mind to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the movement. By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being <b>common</b> <b>features</b> of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E
5|$|The forts were {{positioned}} to defend harbours and anchorages, and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, {{and to protect}} the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be self-contained and able to defend themselves against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had <b>common</b> <b>features</b> and were often built in a consistent style.|$|E

5|$|The rocky cliffs, <b>common</b> <b>features</b> {{downstream}} of the Minho's estuary, {{disappear in}} Póvoa de Varzim, {{giving way to}} a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in a}} cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the Little Ice Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some <b>common</b> <b>features</b> in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The <b>common</b> <b>features</b> of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E

5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. <b>Common</b> <b>features</b> borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859–69). The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace and its adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–8 confirmed the popularity of the style.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were <b>common</b> <b>features.</b> They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>features</b> {{of passive}} solar {{architecture}} are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
