5000|$|Writing for the court, Judge Anderson said, “We granted en banc {{review in}} this case in part to review {{procedures}} in this circuit for asserting constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In this context we must decide whether an ineffectiveness claim supported by new grounds is procedurally barred in a petitioner's first <b>collateral</b> <b>proceeding</b> under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, when the issue of ineffectiveness has already been raised and adjudicated on direct appeal. The panel opinion {{in this case}} so held. United States v. Galloway,32 F.3d 499, 503 (10th Cir.1994) (Galloway III)... We conclude otherwise.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Early {{federal and}} state civil {{procedure}} in the United States was rather ad hoc and was based on traditional common law procedure but with much local variety. There were varying rules that governed different types of civil cases such as [...] "actions" [...] at law or [...] "suits" [...] in equity or in admiralty; these differences grew {{from the history of}} [...] "law" [...] and [...] "equity" [...] as separate court systems in English law. Even worse, discovery was generally unavailable in actions at law. In order to obtain discovery, a party to a legal action had to bring a <b>collateral</b> <b>proceeding,</b> a bill in equity in aid of discovery, just to obtain essential documents or testimony from the opposing party.|$|E
50|$|As double {{jeopardy}} {{applies only to}} charges that were {{the subject of an}} earlier final judgment, there are many situations in which it does not apply, despite the appearance of a retrial. For example, a second trial held after a mistrial does not violate the {{double jeopardy}} clause because a mistrial ends a trial prematurely without a judgment of guilty or not, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Josef Perez (1824). Cases dismissed because of insufficient evidence may constitute a final judgment for these purposes, though many state and federal laws allow for substantially limited prosecutorial appeals from these orders. Also, a retrial after a conviction that has been set aside following the grant of a motion for new trial, that has been reversed on appeal, or that has been vacated in a <b>collateral</b> <b>proceeding</b> (such as habeas corpus) would not violate double jeopardy because the judgment in the first trial had been invalidated. In all of these cases, however, the previous trials do not entirely vanish. Testimony from them may be used in later retrials, such as to impeach contradictory testimony given at any subsequent proceeding.|$|E
5000|$|While all justices {{agreed that}} the appeal should be dismissed, Lord Mance did not rely on the [...] "flawed asset" [...] theory, instead finding that, prior to an event of default under the swap, neither the Noteholders nor LBSF had {{priority}} over the <b>collateral</b> <b>proceeds.</b> Once the event occurred, the priority would be determined under the swap's terms, and the Flip did not contravene the rule.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{effects of}} {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting (CABG) on mortality have not been evaluated in patients with well-developed coronary collaterals. We investigated functional capacity, presence of angina, the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, survival and mortality in patients with well-developed coronary collaterals both undergoing and refusing CABG. Methods: The study {{was designed as a}} retrospective observational case-controlled study. Seventy-eight patients undergoing coronary angiography were included in this study. They had critical occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) with Rentrop- 3 collateral circulation towards LAD, and to proceed with CABG has been suggested. The patients were divided in two groups; first group proceeding with CABG (n= 40) and the second, rejecting the surgery (medical treatment group; n= 38). The rates of survival, the incidence of angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction as well as the functional capacities were evaluated in all patients. Survival rates were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the baseline characteristics of patients, the presence of angina pectoris, the severity of angina pectoris according to CCS, the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction or stroke, and the functional capacity according to NYHA (p> 0. 05). Death due to cardiovascular reasons was observed in eight patients of CABG group and in five patients of medical treatment group (p= 0. 710). The 5 -year survival rate was observed to be 80 % in CABG group while it was observed to be 84 % in the medical treatment group (p= 0. 730). Conclusion: There was no significant difference regarding the survival rates in patients with well-developed coronary <b>collaterals</b> <b>proceeding</b> with CABG or medical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A trade {{receivables}} securitization is {{away for a}} seller to raise capital by selling certain trade receivable assets into a special purpose vehicle (SPV), on a revolving basis. This permits the SPV to raise capital by issuing notes or taking out a loan, using the trade receivable assets as <b>collateral.</b> The <b>proceeds</b> from the loan or note then flow back to the seller as purchase proceeds for the trade receivable assets. Such a transaction can typically garner a rating higher than seller’s own corporate credit, thereby giving the seller access to greater liquidity {{at a lower cost}} of funds. Other advantages may include trade credit insurance and off-balance treatment. Structures, operations, and overhead can vary considerably, and there is room for optimization, customization, and fine-tuning; so, it is important for a seller to choose its securitization partners and arrangements carefully...|$|R
40|$|No one {{favors the}} {{execution}} of an innocent person. That event represents the ultimate failure of the justice system, both {{in the view of}} those who consider the risk of such a failure to be so intolerable as to constitute a reason for abolishing capital punishment altogether and in the view of those who consider it to be an acceptable cost of an otherwise desirable institution. Yet the danger of wrongful execution is chillingly real. Whether one gains insight from scholarly studies current judicial proceedings or by experiencing the intensity of community pressures to convict someone – anyone - of these atrocious crimes, it is difficult to deny that there is a special danger of factual error in capital cases. That danger is exacerbated both by the grisly consequence of such errors and by the general tendency of evidence of innocence to emerge only at a relatively late stage in capital proceedings. 2 ̆ 2 Yet the states 2 ̆ 7 corrective mechanisms are simply inadequate. Motions to reopen criminal convictions on the grounds of newly-discovered evidence must overcome understandably heavy policies in favor of finality and must meet burdens which require a finding, for example, that the profferred material 2 ̆ 2 would probably have changed the verdict. 2 ̆ 2 These standards, of course, are applied by a judge (normally the original trial judge), not by a jury. This practice deprives the defendant of a jury 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to possible weaknesses in the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s case on the issue of guilt - a sensitivity that is recognized to act as a safeguard against the return not only of a wrongful conviction but also of a death sentence against the possibly innocent. Moreover, once a conviction becomes final, many states will not permit such claims {{in the context of a}} state <b>collateral</b> <b>proceeding</b> - notwithstanding the fact that this is commonly the lengthiest element of the entire capital adjudicatory process, and hence a stage at which new evidence may well emerge...|$|E
40|$|Criminal {{defendants}} have {{a constitutional}} right to effective assistance of counsel. In Nebraska, defendants can enforce this right either on direct appeal or through a postconviction proceeding. In either forum, a defendant must show that his counsel’s performance was deficient. This Note argues that the Nebraska Supreme Court extended the scope of its review of ineffectiveness claims in State v. Rocha, and the test the court applied in Rocha needs reform. Part II explains the standard for ineffective assistance claims under Strickland v. Washington and examines the Nebraska Supreme Court’s analysis in Faust. Part III looks closely at the Rocha decision, and Part IV compares the analyses employed by the Nebraska Supreme Court in Faust and Rocha. It argues that although the court claimed its decision in Rocha was in line with Faust, the court’s reasoning in Rocha actually expanded the scope of the court’s review of ineffective assistance claims significantly. It asserts that, consistent with the court’s concern for conservation of judicial resources, the Nebraska Supreme Court should reform the test it applied in Rocha. Subsection IV. B argues that reforming the Rocha test is not enough to correct Nebraska’s approach; the Nebraska Supreme Court should also stop applying the postconviction procedural default rule to the claims. Nebraska’s use of the procedural default rule pressures defendants into raising ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal that could never be resolved there, a result inconsistent with the policies behind the rule. Nebraska’s appellate courts must then address the claims prematurely, potentially wasting judicial resources and harming defendants. Additionally, in a postconviction proceeding, more resources are wasted when the court must analyze whether the claim is defaulted before it can turn to the merits. The sounder policy, endorsed by the Supreme Court of the United States and the great majority of states, is to allow defendants to bring ineffectiveness claims in the first instance in a <b>collateral</b> <b>proceeding,</b> no matter the state of the record. This dual reform is necessary to conserve Nebraska’s judicial resources and protect Nebraska defendants...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 12/13 July, a {{combined}} Dutch and Australian force, became surrounded by a larger Taliban force during an engagement north-east of Tarin Kowt. Running low on ammunition, their situation became desperate and air support from a US Air Force AC-130 gunship was called in. Armed with a [...] "105-millimetre howitzer, 40-millimetre cannon and Gatling guns", the aircraft could deliver intense indirect fire support that could regain the initiative for the coalition troops and push the Taliban back from their position. By the time the gunship arrived over battle, the Taliban had advanced to within 30 m of the coalition position. Despite the risk of <b>collateral</b> damage, Kroon <b>proceeded</b> to call down the gunship's fire. The incident was later described in an official Dutch report. [...] "The air around the two platoons was thick with shrapnel but the 40-millimetre and 105-millimetre shells launched by the aircraft had a devastating effect on the Taliban".|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, {{other studies}} have also been able to prove the {{intuitive}} view that recovery rates are significantly higher if loans are collateralized (e.g., Thorburn 2000; Grunert and Weber 2009; Qi and Yang 2009; Bastos 2010; Gürtler and Hibbeln 2013). However, most recovery rate studies consider the collateral value as given (exceptions are, for example, Jokivuolle and Peura 2003; Somers and Whittaker 2007; Leow and Mues 2012). We {{take a closer look}} at the valuation of collateral itself and, in particular, at the valuation of collateral in real estate. A couple of studies for the German market analyze the <b>proceeds</b> ratio of <b>collateral</b> (realized <b>proceeds</b> divided by the fundamental value of the collateral assumed by the bank) (Franks et al. 2004; Schaaff 2009; Grunert 2010). These studies show that the realized proceeds are, on average, smaller than the original valuation of the collateral. Our results confirm these earlier findings. For the originating bank, the valuation (market value) of the collateral in real estate is based on the appraisal report, which is a proxy for the expected selling price. Since the appraisal report should consider all possible factors that have an influence on the property value, the realized selling price should not differ systematically from the expected value. For the first time in recovery rate research, our method uses an index based on postal codes to measure the attractiveness of a property’s location and to arrange for the finest possible discrimination between different locations and property types. We demonstrate that the condition as well as the location of the property, even on average, is not adequately considered in the appraisal reports. To correct for this systematic bias, we develop a model to predict the proceeds ratio to eliminate the bias in the valuation of properties.|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{coronary}} heart disease still belongs to the leading causes of death in Germany and other industrialized nations. Besides the drug and invasive therapy, the induction of a "natural bypass" by arteriogenesis could be a potential alternative therapy. Since the pig heart has a similar weak coronary collateralization as the human, the pig is an interesting model for investigation of coronary arteriogenesis. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is the following: 1. Establishment of methods for the post-mortem coronary angiography and the corrosion method. 2. Investigation, if pre-existing collaterals are detectable in native pig hearts and if their growth can be stimulated by the induction of arteriogenesis using a semi-acute occluding copper stent. Finally, the collateralization in the pig heart is analyzed. 3. Investigation of the origin, the time course of the development and the histo-morphology of bridging collaterals in pig hearts. 4. Evaluation if the animal model and the established methods are suitable to visualize the arteriogenesis process. Methods: In part I 34 pig hearts were investigated angiographically. After the establishment of three different experimental setups a pre-perfusion of the coronary arteries with saline was performed followed by a contrast media (CM) -perfusion with four different contrast agents; three on the basis of barium sulphate, one of bismuth oxychloride. Then, the hearts were examined using the mammography technique and stereoscopic image pairs were done using four different experimental setups. To establish the corrosion method coronary arteries of six pig hearts were injected with an acrylic resin and corroded in potash lye. In part II in 15 pigs a copper stent was minimally invasive implanted into the left coronary artery. After 56 days the animals were finalized, the heart examined using the established post-mortem angiography and stereoscopic technique and finally micro-CT images were done. In part III in 11 pigs a copper stent was minimally invasive implanted into the left coronary artery. The animals were grouped into five different finalization days: 0. 5 days after stent implantation (D 0. 5) (n = 2), D 3 (n = 2), D 5 (n = 1), D 7 (n = 3) and D 12 (n = 3). Subsequently, investigations using postmortem angiography, stereoscopy and micro-CT were performed. Finally, the stent region was examined using histology (HE staining) and immunohistochemistry (KI- 67, CD 163 and SMC marker). Results: I. part: With the post-mortem angiography using the experimental setup No. 3 and the barium sulphate-CM 3 arteries up to the 6 th order can be investigated. Using a table, with which the heart is moved in a plane, it is possible to produce stereoscopic images. With the acrylic resin, detailed corrosion preparations are made. II. part: Pre-existent collaterals are detectable in native pig heart using the corrosion method. These collaterals can be induced by arteriogenesis and form early after stent implantation long inter-and intracoronary collaterals, which run mainly over the moderator band. From day 7 on they are replaced by hemodynamic favorable short bridging collaterals and from D 12 on by short intracoronary collaterals. III. part: Bridging collaterals originate from longitudinally running type 1 vasa vasorum (VV). The development of VV to bridging <b>collaterals</b> <b>proceeds</b> within 7 days after stent implantation; the bridging collaterals have smooth muscle cells and are therefore functionally relevant. IV. part: The animal model is well qualified to induce coronary arteriogenesis. Every single used method reflects only one part of the whole arteriogenesis process. Only in the interplay of the instruments the entire scope of the arteriogenesis process can be investigated. Conclusion: In the present study the high resolution postmortem angiography in combination with the three dimensional and micro-CT technique and the corrosion method could be established. Arteriogenesis was induced in pre-existing collaterals by a non invasive, semi-acute vessel occlusion using a copper stent and the mainly superficial collaterals in the pig were analyzed. For the first time it was demonstrated that VV develop induced by arteriogenesis with a hitherto not described growth dynamic to bridging collaterals which are functionally relevant. The animal model and the sum of the methods are therefore well qualified to study arteriogenesis under conditions which are similar in humans. The present results could be important for further studies on the treatment of coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial occlusive disease by therapeutic stimulation of arteriogenesis for the induction of collateral growth...|$|R
40|$|By {{filing a}} {{petition}} {{for a federal}} writ of habeas corpus, a prisoner initiates a legal <b>proceeding</b> <b>collateral</b> to the direct appeals process. Federal statutes set forth the procedure and parameters of habeas corpus review. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) first {{signed into law by}} President Clinton in 1996, included significant cut-backs in the availability of federal writs of habeas corpus. This was by congressional design. Yet, despite the dire predictions, for most of the first decade of AEDPA’s reign, the door to habeas relief remained open. More recently, however, the Supreme Court reinterpreted a key portion of the statute. Pursuant to this new interpretation, habeas corpus relief could become virtually unattainable. During the Supreme Court’s 2011 – 2012 Term, the Court denied habeas corpus relief to petitioners who demonstrated significant deprivations of constitutional rights. At the root of recent obstacles to relief is the interpretation of a short, but key clause in AEDPA’s amendments to 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (d) (1). Pursuant to the statute, a federal court may only grant a writ if a state court’s adjudication on the merits “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. ” This article discusses the reasons why the interpretation or standard that defines the “unreasonable application” clause has proven to be most critical to the availability of habeas corpus relief...|$|R
