40|$|Differences between tax {{accounting}} rules and generally accepted accounting principles {{have been a}} source of irritation to accountants, lawyers, and business men generally. Although the regulations interpreting the Internal Revenue laws have long asserted that, “approved standard methods of accounting will generally be regarded as clearly reflecting the income,” court decisions and rulings have undermined the broad principles in the regulations. The principle area where the rules of tax accounting differed from generally accepted accounting principles was found in the rules applicable to the timing of transactions. They were confined principally to questions of when income should be recognized and when expenses should be deductible. Thus under tax rules income was often held to accrue at the time cash was received free of restrictions, although under accounting principles the time of receipt was not as relevant as the service period involved. Tax {{accounting rules}} did not allow deductions for <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> until all the events had occurred which were necessary to find the amount {{and the fact of the}} taxpayer’s liability for payment. Generally accepted accounting principles require that costs and expenses be matched against revenues of the period to which they relate in order to determine net income. If the precise amount of any <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> is not determinable, reasonable estimates must be used. A further major area of divergence occurred in the rules relative to accrual of property taxes. Accounting practice has been to accrue such taxes over the fiscal period of the taxing authority. Tax accounting has required accrual on certain critical dates which differ in various jurisdictions. Methods for eliminating these divergences have been provided by the 1954 Internal Revenue Code. For the most part the new provisions are elective in order to prevent inequities during the transition period...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "A number of well-publicized announcements about financial statement restatements by large, well-known public companies have erased {{billions of dollars of}} previously reported earnings and raised questions about the credibility of accounting practices and the quality of corporate financial disclosure and oversight in the United States. Industry officials and academics have speculated that several factors may have caused U. S. companies to use questionable accounting practices. Some officials have stated that increased focus and guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on accounting issues in the late 1990 s may have prompted more companies to restate previously reported financial statements. Although the number of restating companies continues to make up a small percentage of all publicly listed companies annually, the number of restatements due to accounting irregularities grew significantly [...] 145 percent [...] from January 1997 through June 2002. The 845 restating companies GAO identified had restated their financial statements for many reasons [...] for example, to adjust revenue, <b>costs</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses,</b> or to address securities-related issues. From January 1997 to June 2002, issues involving revenue recognition accounted for almost 38 percent of the 919 announced restatements. Finally, different parties can prompt a restatement, including the restating company, an external auditor, or SEC. The 689 publicly traded companies GAO identified that announced restatements between January 1997 and March 2002 lost billions of dollars in market capitalization in the days around the initial restatement announcement. However, these losses had potential ripple effects on overall investor confidence and market trends. The growing number of restatements and mounting questions about certain corporate accounting practices appear to have shaken investors' confidence in the nation's financial reporting system. Although determining the effect of the restatements and other accounting issues on overall investor confidence is difficult to measure, various attempts to measure investor confidence have been made. With {{the increase in the number}} of restatements due to accounting irregularities, 20 percent of SEC's enforcement cases since the late 1990 s were for violations resulting from financial reporting and accounting practices. To address these, SEC has sought a variety of penalties, including levying monetary sanctions, issuing cease-and-desist orders, and barring individuals from appearing before SEC or serving as officers or directors in public companies. The recent increase in the number and size of restatements and disclosures of accounting issues and irregularities underlying them have raised significant questions about the adequacy of the current system of corporate governance and financial disclosure oversight. In addition to public companies, their auditors, and SEC, investors rely on a variety of parties for oversight and financial information, including stock markets, securities analysts, and credit rating agencies, all of which have roles in the corporate governance system or provide information to the investing public. However, recent events have raised concerns about the roles played by each of these parties. On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted. The act addresses many of these concerns, including strengthening corporate governance and improving transparency and accountability to help ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial reporting system. The act authorizes additional funding for SEC, which has faced staffing and workload imbalances that have challenged its ability to fulfill its mission. ...|$|E

Materials and methods: From July 2013 to July 2014, through a survey in four different Italian Departments of Radiology, data on the costs of Cardiac-CT and Cardiac-MR examinations were collected. For {{the evaluation of the}} costs of examinations, it was used an analytical accounting system, considering only the direct costs (consumables, health personnel work time, equipment amortization/maintenance) and other costs (utilities, services, etc.). Indirect costs (general costs) were not assessed. It was made a simulation, assuming an exclusive use of the CT and MR equipments for Cardiac-CT and Cardiac-MR examinations, calculating the annual number necessary to arrive at the Break Even Point (BEP: the point at which <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> and revenue are equal). Results: On the basis of the CT costs, in order to reach the BEP, performing only Cardiac-CT examinations, an average of 2641 – 2752 examinations/year is needed. The annual time commitment of the Medical Professional to ensure the number of examinations to reach the BEP is 2625 – 2750  h/year, equivalent to two Medical Doctors in a Cardiology Department. The recent Cardiac-CT Italian Registry, in the period January–June 2011, reports a number of examinations of 3455 patients in 47 different Centers, distributed throughout the whole national territory. With regard to MR, in order to reach the BEP, performing only Cardiac-MR examinations, an average of 2435 – 3123 examinations/year is needed. The annual time commitment of the Medical Professional to ensure the number of examinations to reach the BEP is 2437 – 3125  h/year, equivalent to two Medical Doctors in a Cardiology Department. The recent Cardiac-MR Italian Registry reports a number of examinations of 3776 patients in 40 Centers, distributed throughout the whole national territory. Conclusion: This research has shown that, only on the basis of costs, currently in Italy is anti-economic an exclusive use of CT or MR equipment for cardiac exams, unless it’s not decided, regardless of the recent guidelines and clinical indications, to submit all patients with cardiac diseases (diseases of the coronary arteries and cardiomyopathies) to Cardiac-CT and Cardiac-MR examinations. This might likely to increase both the inappropriate examinations and either health spending {{and in the case of}} CT with important repercussions, in terms of radio-exposure, subject to forensic procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For software, {{the costs}} of {{failures}} are not clearly understood. Often, these costs disappear in {{the costs of}} testing, the general developments <b>costs,</b> <b>or</b> the operating <b>expenses.</b> In a general manufacturing context, the British Standard BS- 6143 - 2 : 1990 classifies quality-related costs into prevention costs, appraisal costs, and failure costs. It furthermore rec-ommends to identify the activities carried out within each of these categories, and to measure the costs connected with the activities. The standard thus presents a framework for recording and structuring costs once they have occurred. In this paper, we propose an approach for structuring the information on internal and external software failure costs such that their development over time can be represented by stochastic models. Based on these models, future failure costs can be predicted. In two case studies we show how the approach was applied in an industrial software development project.
