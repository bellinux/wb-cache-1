5|$|Generally, <b>companies</b> <b>want</b> {{to retain}} {{creative}} {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E

Cookies store unique identifiers on a person's computer that are used to predict what one wants. Many advertisement <b>companies</b> <b>want</b> to use this technology to track what their customers are looking at online.

Some companies are already using this technology but the ethics are still being widely debated.|$|E
25|$|Financial {{services}} such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling, because customer retention {{is an essential part}} of most financial services' business models. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including retailing, telecommunications and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some <b>companies</b> <b>want</b> to prevent their good customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn.|$|E

2500|$|Employee {{recognition}} {{is not only}} about gifts and points. It's about changing the corporate culture {{in order to meet}} goals and initiatives and most importantly to connect employees to the company's core values and beliefs. Strategic employee {{recognition is}} seen as the most important program not only to improve employee retention and motivation but also to positively influence the financial situation. The difference between the traditional approach (gifts and points) and strategic recognition is the ability to serve as a serious business influencer that can advance a company's strategic objectives in a measurable way.

6000|$|What {{would be}} an English merchant's {{character}} after a few such transactions? It is not improbable that the moralists of the Herald would call him a rascal. Why have the United States been paying seven, eight, ten per cent for money for years past, when the same commodity can be got elsewhere at half that rate of interest? Why, because though among the richest proprietors in the world, creditors were not sure of them. So the States have had to pay eighty millions yearly {{for the use of}} money which would cost other borrowers but thirty. Add up this item of extra interest alone for a dozen years, and see what a prodigious penalty the States have been paying for repudiation here and there, for sharp practice, for doubtful credit. Suppose the peace is kept between us, the remembrance of this last threat alone will cost the States millions and millions more. If they must have money, we must have a greater interest to insure our jeopardized capital. Do American <b>Companies</b> <b>want</b> to borrow money--as want to borrow they will? Mr. Brown, show the gentleman that extract from the New York Herald which declares that the United States will confiscate private property {{in the event of a}} war.

[...] And, gentlemen in America, when the honor of YOUR nation is called in question, please to remember that it is the American press which glories in announcing that you are prepared to be rogues.|$|E
