As manufacture of pistols was {{much more complicated than}} just finding a local supplier to knock out a few swords, guns involved much more craftsmanship and care in their creation. As such, many private ship owners purchased bulk orders of guns that were either of a rival nation and thus readily available or pistols that were not typically identified as a naval issue weapon. For example, a British ship-owner might decide to purchase a supply of French firearms or even use Belgian-made cavalry pistols with lanyard rings as a <b>close</b> <b>substitute</b> for a maritime pistol.|$|E

40|$|In {{textbook}} theory, demand curves {{for stocks}} are kept flat by riskless arbitrage between perfect substitutes. In reality, however, individual stocks {{do not have}} perfect substitutes. We develop a simple model of demand curves for stocks in which the risk inherent in arbitrage between imperfect substitutes deters risk-averse arbitrageurs from flattening demand curves. Consistent with the model, stocks without <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> experience higher price jumps upon inclusion into the S&P 500 Index. The results suggest that arbitrage is weaker and mispricing {{is likely to be}} more frequent and more severe among stocks without <b>close</b> <b>substitutes.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|A {{different}} color, {{also called}} Brunswick green, {{was the color}} for passenger locomotives of the grouping and then the nationalized British Railways. There were three shades of these colors and they are defined under British Standard BS381C - 225, BS381C - 226, and BS381C - 227 (ordered from lightest to darkest). The Brunswick green used by the Nationalised British Railways - Western Region for passenger locomotives was BS381C - 227 (rgb(30:62:46)). RAL6005 is a <b>close</b> <b>substitute</b> to BS381C - 227.

40|$|The {{effect of}} return {{policies}} on market outcomes is studied {{in a model}} where consumers differ in their valuations of time. Product reliability is identified with defect rates. Producers first choose reliability levels and then compete in prices. For given defect rates, allowing returns makes products <b>closer</b> <b>substitutes,</b> enhancing competition and reducing prices. Being <b>closer</b> <b>substitutes</b> makes higher reliability less worthwhile, which reduces reliability. While the decrease in reliability reduces consumer welfare, the decrease in prices raises it. The latter dominates, so that aggregate consumer welfare increases with return policy. ...|$|R

We use nearby sites as <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> and treat more distant sites as aggregate alternatives in our application to fishing in Maine. We find that the welfare estimates are rather sensitive to narrowing choice sets in this manner. The sensitivity largely tracts variation in the estimated travel cost coefficient across the different models considered. ...|$|R
50|$|For years, Brazilian Rosewood was the {{industry}} standard as the best wood for the backs and sides of guitars. Unfortunately, the export of Brazilian Rosewood has been restricted due to the endangerment of the species. Much of the Brazilian Rosewood used for guitars is of poor quality, and the inflated price of the wood has caused many luthiers to search for alternative tonewoods. There are many other good very dry woods for guitar construction. In fact, of the surviving Torres instruments, the most common back and side wood used was maple. Many guitars made today use East Indian Rosewood {{because it is a}} <b>close</b> <b>substitute</b> for Brazilian Rosewood, is readily available in high-quality, and has desirable characteristics as tonewood. There are many other woods with the characteristics to make excellent guitars and are excellent alternatives: cocobolo, maple, bubinga (African Rosewood), African Blackwood, Camatillo Rosewood, Spanish Cypress (used exclusively for flamenco guitars), granadillo, ebony, satinwood, ziricote, among others, are excellent choices for backs and sides.|$|E
50|$|As {{she tells}} the tale, {{downloading}} on a try-before-you-buy basis is good advertising for copyright proprietors, expanding {{the value of their}} inventory. The Supreme Court thought otherwise in Grokster, with considerable empirical support. As file sharing has increased over the last four years, the sales of recorded music have dropped by approximately 30%. Perhaps other economic factors contributed, but the events likely are related. Music downloaded for free from the Internet is a <b>close</b> <b>substitute</b> for purchased music; many people are bound to keep the downloaded files without buying originals. That is exactly what Gonzalez did for at least 30 songs. It is no surprise, therefore, that the only appellate decision on point has held that downloading copyrighted songs cannot be defended as fair use, whether or not the recipient plans to buy songs she likes well enough to spring for. See A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1014-19 (9th Cir. 2001). See also UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc., 92 F.

[...] However, in many cases, there exist products that are [...] "similar" [...] (such as butter and margarine) which are relatively easily interchangeable because they are close Substitutes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare implications of informative advertising in differentiated product oligopoly markets. The analysis reconciles the conflicting results {{in previous studies}} that find advertising to be undersupplied in homogeneous product markets, but oversupplied in differentiated product markets when the degree of differentiation is "small". In equilibrium, purely informative advertising is undersupplied when brands are sufficiently <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> and oversupplied when brands are more differentiated. Product differentiation also has welfare implications for the effect of technological change in the advertising sector. In response to an advertising cost innovation, equilibrium prices fall and the market converges to the socially optimal resource allocation for brands that are sufficiently <b>close</b> <b>substitutes,</b> whereas equilibrium prices rise and divergence occurs when brands are more differentiated.

40|$|To {{identify}} the relevant product markets for Swedish pharmaceuticals, a spatial econometrics approach is employed. First, we calculate Moran’s Is for different market definitions {{and then we}} use a spatial Durbin model {{to determine the effect}} of price changes on quantity sold off own and competing products. As expected, the results show that competition is strongest between close substitutes; however, the relevant product markets for Swedish pharmaceuticals extend beyond <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> down to products included in the same class on the four-digit level of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical system as defined by the World Health Organization. The spatial regression model further indicates that increases in the price of a product significantly lower the quantity sold of that product and in the same time increase the quantity sold of competing products. For <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> (products belonging to the same class on the seven-digit level of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical system), as well as for products that, without being <b>close</b> <b>substitutes,</b> belong to the same therapeutic/pharmacological/chemical subgroup (the same class on the five-digit level of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical system), a significant change towards increased competition is also visible after 1 July 2009 when the latest policy changes with regards to pharmaceuticals have been implemented in Sweden...|$|R

Domestic heterogeneous firms may not introduce any new products, {{introduce a new}} product line (innovate), or develop a variety that is a <b>close</b> <b>substitute</b> to an existing product line (imitate). The presence of foreign firms generates incentives for imitation because they introduce original products that are vertically differentiated from domestic products. Using firm-level panel data for China, we find that increased FDI presence in a given industry leads to more imitation, but not necessarily more innovation, by domestic firms.

40|$|In {{modelling}} retail meat {{demand and}} supply equations {{it is difficult}} to identify <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> or competing products. However, <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> can be identified through a comparison of meat attributes, especially cooking method and sensory attributes. The Meat Standards Australia (MSA) grading system can be used to identify primals (whole muscles) with similar attributes. The MSA system is based on carcase attributes, cooking methods and sensory properties and it allocates 3, 4 or 5 stars to beef primals. Prices for different star grades are affected by the quantity of meat allocated into each grade and this is determined by cooking method, which is dependent upon season. Estimating demand and supply by MSA grades and cooking methods requires fewer variables and therefore reduces multicollinearity and increases model efficiency.

5000|$|In economics, {{the idea}} of {{monopoly}} {{is important in the}} study of management structures, which directly concerns normative aspects of economic competition, and provides the basis for topics such as industrial organization and economics of regulation. There are four basic types of market structures in traditional economic analysis: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly and monopoly. A monopoly is a structure in which a single supplier produces and sells a given product. If there is a single seller in a certain market and there are no <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> for the product, then the market structure is that of a [...] "pure monopoly". Sometimes, there are many sellers in an industry and/or there exist many <b>close</b> <b>substitutes</b> for the goods being produced, but nevertheless companies retain some market power. This is termed monopolistic competition, whereas in oligopoly the companies interact strategically.|$|R
