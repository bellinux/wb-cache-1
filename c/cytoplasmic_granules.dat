40|$|The {{role for}} inosine-containing hyperedited dsRNA (IU-dsRNA) in cells is poorly understood. Previous {{studies have shown}} that IU-dsRNA binds {{specifically}} to various components of <b>cytoplasmic</b> stress <b>granules,</b> as well as to other proteins such as Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (Tudor-SN). Here the authors show that Tudor-SN localizes to <b>cytoplasmic</b> stress <b>granules</b> in HeLa cells undergoing arsenite-induced oxidative stress, or following transfection with long dsRNA (poly[IC]), which initiates an interferon cascade. They also demonstrate a novel interaction between Tudor-SN and ADAR 1 and show that ADAR 1 is also localized to stress granules in HeLa cells following various stresses...|$|R
40|$|T-lymphocytes {{contain a}} <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granule</b> {{associated}} homo-dimeric protease designated granzyme A. Upon T-cell target cell interaction, the granules undergo exocytosis and granzyme A, and other granule constituents, are released. Here {{we show that}} granzyme A secreted into plasma is immediately inactivated by antithrombin III. The rate of complex formation is enhanced 400 -fold {{in the presence of}} heparin. Two different complexes are generated: granzyme A-antithrombin III and granzyme A-(antithrombin III) 2, respectively, indicating that both active centers of granzyme A are functional. Thus, the proteolytic activity of lymphocyte protease granzyme A, whose physiologically relevant function is unknown, is well regulated in plasma...|$|R
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTLs) {{and natural}} killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes that share common cytotoxic pathways {{that are necessary}} for defence against virus-infected or transformed cells. Both types of cell kill their cellular targets by either of two mechanisms that require direct contact between the effector and target cells. In the first pathway, <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granule</b> toxins — predominantly a membrane-disrupting protein known as perforin — and a family of structurally related serine proteases (granzymes) with various substrate specifici-ties are secreted by exocytosis and together induce APOPTOSIS of the target cell 1.

50|$|Lymphoblasts can be {{distinguished}} microscopically from myeloblasts by having less distinct nucleoli, more condensed chromatin, and an absence of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granules.</b> However these morphologic distinctions are not absolute and a definitive diagnoses relies on antibody immunostaining {{for the presence of}} unique cluster of differentiation receptors.|$|E

40|$|Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (UBL) {{proteins}} regulate {{a diverse}} array of cellular pathways through covalent as well as non-covalent interactions with target proteins. Yeast protein Mdy 2 (Get 5) and its human homolog GdX (Ubl 4 a) belong to the class of UBL proteins which do not form conjugates with other proteins. Mdy 2 is required for cell survival under heat stress and for efficient mating. As part of a complex with Sgt 2 and Get 4 it has been implicated in the biogenesis of tail-anchored proteins. Interestingly, in response to heat stress, Mdy 2 protein that is predominantly localized in the nucleus co-localized with poly(A) -binding protein Pab 1 to <b>cytoplasmic</b> stress <b>granules</b> suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is of functional importance. Here we investigate the nuclear import of Mdy 2, {{a process that is}} independent of the Get 4 /Sgt 2 complex but required for stress response. Nuclear import is mediated by an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and this process is essential for the heat stress response. In contrast, cells expressing Mdy 2 lacking a nuclear export signal (NES) behave like wild type. Importantly, both Mdy 2 and Mdy 2 -DNES, but not Mdy 2 -DNLS, physically interact with Pab 1 and this interaction correlates with the accumulation in <b>cytoplasmic</b> stress <b>granules.</b> Thus, the nuclear history of the UBL Mdy 2 appears to be essential for its function in <b>cytoplasmic</b> stress <b>granules</b> during the rapid cellular response to heat stress...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} by Watson, Rothbard, and Vanamee (1) that antibody which will fix complement {{in the presence of}} homologous antigen can be induced in rabbits injected with a purified preparation of rat tail collagen; that this antibody can be removed by absorption with homologous but not heterologous collagen; and that the antibody is capable of interfering with normal collagen fiber reconstitution in vitro. Studies by Porter and Vanamee (2) on collagen fibrogenesis demonstrated that the combined methods of tissue culture and electron microscopy could be used to advantage in the study of this problem. In subsequent work it was shown (3) that early fibrils are formed at the surface of the fibroblast; that they may bear a dose relation to intracellular fibroglial fibers; and that they appear to reach their mature form extracellularly by accretion of further material from the ground-substance.

In the cell, RPTOR is present in cytoplasm, lysosomes, and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granules.</b> Amino acid availability determines RPTOR targeting to lysosomes. In stressed cells, RPTOR associates with SPAG5 and accumulates in stress granules, which significantly reduces its presence in lysosomes...|$|E
50|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{a type of}} white blood cells that {{function}} in the immune and neuro-immune system. Allergic reactions or responses to inflammation or invading microorganisms are coordinated by these cells in a process called degranulation. Antimicrobial cytotoxic and inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteoglycans, serotonin and serine proteases, are released from <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granules</b> in the mast cells once their high-affinity receptors FcεRI detect IgE antibodies and bind their Fc region. The released histamines cause irritations to the organism such as sneezing and an itchy sensation in the nose.|$|E
40|$|The human IMPs (insulin-like {{growth factor}} II mRNA-binding proteins) {{belong to a}} {{vertebrate}} zipcode-binding protein family consisting of two RNA recognition motifs and four K homology domains and have been implicated in cytoplasmic mRNA localization, turnover and translational control. In the present study, we show that IMP 1 is capable of translocating into nuclei of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and its immunoreactivity {{is present in the}} nuclei of human spermatogenic cells. IMP 1 does not contain a simple import signal, but nuclear entry was facilitated by disruption of RNA binding and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granule</b> formation. IMP 1 contains two NESs (nuclear export signals) within the RNA-binding K homology domains 2 and 4. The former is a leucine-rich leptomycin B-sensitive NES, whereas the latter is a leptomycin B-insensitive NES. Taken together, these results indicate that IMP 1 may attach to its target mRNAs in the nucleus and thereby define the cytoplasmic fate of the transcripts...|$|R

Both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they arise from different branches of hematopoiesis, and mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead are located in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils can be recruited out of the blood into a tissue when needed.|$|E
50|$|Immunohistochemistry {{can be used}} to {{identify}} the presence of CD68, which is found in the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granules</b> of a range of different blood cells and myocytes. It is particularly useful as a marker for the various cells of the macrophage lineage, including monocytes, histiocytes, giant cells, Kupffer cells, and osteoclasts. This allows it to be used to distinguish diseases of otherwise similar appearance, such as the monocyte/macrophage and lymphoid forms of leukaemia (the latter being CD68 negative). Its presence in macrophages also makes it useful in diagnosing conditions related to proliferation or abnormality of these cells, such as malignant histiocytosis, histiocytic lymphoma, and Gaucher's disease.|$|E
50|$|Occludin is an {{important}} protein in tight junction function. Studies have shown that rather than being important in tight junction assembly, occludin is important in tight junction stability and barrier function. Furthermore, studies in which mice were deprived of occludin expression showed morphological stability in several epithelial tissues but also found chronic inflammation and hyperplasia in the gastric epithelium, calcification in the brain, testicular atrophy, loss of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>granules</b> in straited duct cells of salivary gland, and thinning of the compact bone.
