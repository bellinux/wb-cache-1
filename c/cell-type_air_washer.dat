40|$|In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} a {{biological}} exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> on the emission of microorganisms and endotoxins was investigated. The exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> was originally developed to reduce ammonia- and odour emissions. It was a combination of a bioscrubber and a chemofilter. The washing water circulated within facility. In order to determine the effect of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> on the bioaerosol emission from the duck-fattening unit, the concentrations of dust, airborne aerobic bacteria, airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria, inspirable endotoxin and moulds were measured before and after the washing process. Furthermore, the concentrations of bacteria, endotoxins and moulds in the washing water and the composition of gram-negative bacterial and mould flora in the air and the washing water were determined. In all 22 cases the investigated exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> decreased the emission of dust, airborne aerobic bacteria and endotoxins. In some cases the concentrations of airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7 out of 22) and moulds (6 out of 22) were increased. In addition to this, the quality of the washing water had an influence on the air composition by forming a secondary aerosol. The predominant bacterial family in the air in front of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> were Enterobacteriaceae, whereas the <b>air</b> after the <b>washer</b> contained mainly Pseudomonadaceae. In order to express the quantitative effect of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> a reduction factor was applied. In average the dust concentration was reduced by a factor of 3. 0, the aerobic bacteria by a factor of 6. 1 and the endotoxin concentration by a factor of 12. 5. The airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria were reduced in average by a factor of 1. 9, however, in 7 out of 22 cases it was increased by a factor of 14. 8 maximum. The concentrations of airborne moulds were decreased in average by a factor of 2. 3. In 6 out of 22 cases it increased by a factor of 3. 8 maximum. Future investigation should show whether another filter stage or a treatment of the washing water to minimize the germs (disinfection) can increase the purification efficiency of the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer...</b>|$|R

40|$|In nylon {{finishing}} a final step is a thermal treatment to fix auxiliary chemicals to fibers, to remove volatile compounds and monomers and to relax the textile structure. For this purpose stenters with natural gas burners are applied. The hot exhaust air contains monomers, solvents, lubricants and specific textile auxiliary chemicals {{that have to}} be removed with large amounts of fresh or process water by exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washers.</b> To reduce water costs, process-integrated water treatment and recycling processes are demanded. Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure mercury arc lamps and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of epsilon-caprolactam (the main constituent of the <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis. Intermediates like epsilon-amino capronic acid, N-hydroxy-epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-nitroso capronic acid have been confirmed as initial intermediates also like acetate, oxalate and formiate as intermediates before complete mineralization. In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It could be demonstrated that the iron catalyst can be recycled with minor activity losses with middle-pressure mercury arc lamps. Photochemically enhanced Fenton reaction has proved to be most effective with respect to the consumption of time, energy and chemicals for the application in exhaust air treatment of nylon finishing. ...|$|R

40|$|To create {{comfortable}} conveniences {{for people}} in the room, we have to process the indoor air in the AC apparatus. Depending on given air parameters in the room, the air processing comprises the next steps: heating, cooling, wetting, drying. Except the compliance of the temperature and humidity parameters of air, we must control its ionic composition. Thereby, the experimental analysis of the air preparing in the AC apparatus is given in this article. Thank to that analysis, we can estimate the ionic and deionic impact on the air space in the specific processes of the air preparing. According to the results of experiments, we have identified, that the air temperature varying does not have significant effect on the ionic concentration. The ionic increasing after electric heater is not associated with air temperature. It is the consequence of the electron extrication {{from the surface of the}} heating element. Reducing ion moving the high air humidity decreases the concentration of the lightweight ions. The increasing of the ions in the spray-type <b>air</b> <b>washers</b> is explained by ballo-electric effect of spraying water drops, but not the air humidity rising...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare the suitability of chicken, pig, and cow manure as feed for larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens (L.); Diptera: Stratiomyidae). Newly hatched larvae were inoculated on moistened manure (33 % dry matter). Water and dried manure were added three times per week, until the first prepupae appeared. Survival was between 82 and 97 %, indicating that the tested substrates were suitable. However, development time was much longer than on the control diet (144 - 215 vs 20 days). Efficiency of conversion of ingested nitrogen (N-ECI) was higher on pig manure than on chicken and cow manure, while the ECI for phosphorus was highest on cow manure. Substrate nitrogen content decreased in the chicken manure, but were stable in pig and cow manure. Phosphorus concentration, and N:P-ratio decreased in all treatments. Since {{a large proportion of}} the nitrogen from the manure (23 – 78 %) was lost, the production system would require an <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> for instance, to make it ecologically sound. Shorter development times are required in order to improve economic viability.

40|$|The {{traditional}} etching {{methods to}} polish surfaces of cut glass have caused hereditary discharges into air (Fluorine), into waste water {{and due to}} sludge disposals {{as a result of}} the chemical sewage treatment process. The goal of this project was to find a new chemical polishing method (single bath method) for traditional glass cutting by reducing the environmental burdens. During the research work an etching method for crystal glass and for lead crystal glass was developed, tested and partially transferred into production. Furthermore the basis for a computer controlled process automation has been worked out. In addition to this a new process water treatment system has been conceived, which substantially reduces about 40 % burdens of the treated waste water (ready for discharge into the sewage systems). A pilot plant of 'crystal glass' is already working; the pilot plant for lead crystal glass is under construction and will be available in 6 months. For the exhaust air in the sludge disposal a four-chamber <b>air</b> <b>washer</b> has been developed and tested. During research work the high-speed glass grinding process has also been improved and a cooling medium circuit with a subsequent treatment step has been found and established. Compared to standard, the following improvements are realized: reduction of excavated glass by about 40 %, reduction of acid by about 40 %, reduction of fluorine discharges into air by about 40 %, reduction of company's fresh water consumption by about 60 % due to the installed process water circulation and treatment.

40|$|Real-time demand {{response}} {{is an essential}} tool for handling the uncertainties associated with the increasing penetration of renewable generation.

The electricity consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable loads, can be shifted over time, and can thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation. At every time step, the algorithm minimizes the expected aggregate load variance with updated predictions. We prove that the suboptimality of the algorithm vanishes quickly as time horizon expands. Further, we evaluate the algorithm via trace-based simulations...|$|R

40|$|Since the Early Eighties of {{the last}} Century, the Egyptian Government {{considered}} Energy Conservation {{as one of the}} main pillars of Energy Planning in Egypt, {{based on the fact that}} investing in Energy Efficiency is more cost effective than in constructing new Power Plants. Energy Efficiency (EE) Programs financed by International Financing Institutions focused at that time, on Energy Audits in Industrial Buildings, Power Plants, Electricity Transmission and in some other Governmental Buildings. Recommendations for Efficient Use of Energy and reducing energy consumption at those entities were implemented by the Use of Efficient Lamps, Improving Power Factor, Waste Heat Recovery, Thermal Insulation, Efficient Firing in Boilers…. Consequently, High Quality Energy Efficient Products were competing in the market with others not having the same advantage. Although the above mentioned EE Programs included Awareness Campaigns for all sectors but the consumption in Residential Sector remained high and increased more and more,exceeding even the consumption in Industrial Sector specially that the prices of electricity were highly subsidized. For that reason, more awareness campaigns (Lectures, Brochures, Audio and visual advertisement) and more incentives were offered by Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MoERE) to consumers in the Residential Sector. Meanwhile, a Program to reduce gradually subsidies on electricity prices started aiming to push consumers to follow energy efficiency instructions and buy efficient appliances especially while they were suffering from electricity cut for about two years. To prepare for Market Transformation to efficient appliances the Government, issued the Standard Specifications and Labeling for Energy Efficient Appliances (lamps, refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, <b>air</b> conditioners, dish <b>washers</b> and others). Meanwhile, these Standards are supported with Accredited Testing Labs in National Entities (NREA,EOS,…). In addition, Ministerial decisions and resolutions were issued to enforce the standards and labeling and to monitor the industry and the market as well. At the Regional Level the League of Arab States issued the “Arab Framework for Energy Efficiency for End-User” supported by the Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency(RCREEE) acting as technical arm. In 2012, MoERE applied this Framework to develop its National Plan which has been endorsed by the cabinet in the same year. This Plan included EE projects to be implemented by the Ministry as well as Measures for Energy Efficiency Improvement expected as a result of implementing these projects. Efficient Use of Energy is a Life Style and Culture that should be taught to children in Schools and at Home. </p...|$|R
