The analyses used the numerical calculation results of the inflow hydrographs performed in the SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) program on the basis of six-year-long rainfall measurement sequence.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on a 1 : 25 -scale model of the San Ramon Bypass Channel, Contra Costa County, California, to develop an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> to remove flows from the channel {{in excess of the}} 100 -year frequency discharge. The <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> would remove flows upstream of the covered channel reach to maintain open channel flow conditions through the covered reach and to not exceed channel capacity downstream of the covered reach. The model reproduced approximately 900 ft of the San Ramon Bypass Channel, 100 ft of the Sans Crainte Creek channel, and 400 ft of the catch channel. The model was constructed so that the slopes of the channels could be adjusted to reproduce various energy gradients equivalent to those resulting from different prototype Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n roughness factors. The slopes of the model were initially adjusted to produce an energy gradient resulting from a Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n roughness factor of 0. 012 in the prototype. Based on initial water-surface profiles measured in the model without the <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> installed, the weir height was set at 13. 25 ft above the center line invert elevation and the weir length was set at 200 ft. With the <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> installed in the model, water-surface profiles and discharges over the weir were recorded with various flow conditions. The weir length was shortened from the upstream end by 25, 50, and 75 ft. Test results indicated that a weir length of 125 ft set at 13. 25 ft above the center-line invert provided satisfactory results.

40|$|This {{technical}} note describes a spreadsheet calculatioml procedure (DILUTE) for estimating alternate releases from different outlet devices {{to meet a}} specific release dissolved oxygen target. Background When low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations occur in release from a Corps of Engineers reservoir, an option for increasing the level of DO leaving the tailrace is a supplemental release through an aerating outlet. For example, during nongeneration periods, a small discharge of poorquality water can pass through the hydroturbines because of wicket gate leakage. Without some improvement technique, the water leaving the tailrace area would be very low in DO. The DC) concentration of the water leaving the tailrace area can be improved by diluting this poorquality water with highly aerated water from another outlet at the project. Sluiceway, spillway, or <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> releases are most often used in this enhancement technique. Generally, the flow from a spillway, sluiceway, or an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> will have a much higher DO concentration than the poorquality discharge. A flow-weighted average {{can be used to}} estimate the required release from the aerating outlet to provide a desired average DO level exiting the tailrace area. To estimate the required release from the alternate source, the DO of the alternate release must be calculated. The spreadsheet DILUTE calculates the oxygen concentration in the releases through the aerating outlet and uses this concentration in the flow-weighted averaging process to estimate the required release discharge.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture launched an ambitious program for constructing small hillside reservoirs in the northern and-central region of the country. At present, more than 720 reservoirs have been created. They consist of small compacted earth dams supplied with a, horizontal <b>overflow</b> <b>weir.</b> Due to lack of hydrological data and the area's extreme floods, however, {{it is very difficult to}} design the <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs.</b> Also, catchments are very sensitive to erosion and the reservoirs are rapidly silted up. Consequently, prediction of flood volumes for important rainfall events becomes crucial. Few hydrological observations, however, exist for the catchment areas. For this purpose a geomorphological model methodology is presented to predict shape and volume of hydrographs for important floods. This model is built around a production function that defines the net storm rainfall (portion of rainfall during a storm which reaches a stream channel as direct runoff) from the total rainfall (observed rainfall in the catchment) and a transfer function based on the most complete possible definition of the surface drainage system. Observed rainfall during 5 -min time steps was used in the model. The model runoff generation is based on surface drainage characteristics which can be easily extracted from maps. The model was applied to two representative experimental catchments in central Tunisia. The conceptual rainfall-runoff model based on surface topography and drainage. network was seen to reproduce observed runoff satisfactory. The calibrated model was used to estimate runoff from 5, 10, 20, and 50 year rainfall return periods regarding runoff volume, maximum runoff, as well as the general shape of the runoff hydrograph. Practical conclusions to design hill reservoirs and to extrapolate results using this model methodology for ungauged small catchments in semiarid Tunisia are made. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Fry, subyearlings, and smolts of spring chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawyacha) were introduced into the test system, and their movement and injury rates were monitored. A total of 33 tests (100 fish per test) that lasted from 24 to 48 hr were completed from 1994 through 1995. Passage rate depended on both fish size and bypass configuration.

Smolts exited quickly and preferred the 6 -in. orifice, with over 90 % of the smolts exiting through the bypass in less than 2 hr. Passage was slightly slower when a weir was used, with 90 % of the smolts exiting in about 4 hr. When the 2 -in. orifice was used in the bypass, 90 % of the smolts did not exit until after 8 hr. In addition, about 7 % of the smolts failed to migrate from the forebay within 24 hr, indicating that smolts were significantly delayed when the 2 -in. orifice was used. Few significant injuries were detected for any of the life stages. However, light descaling occurred on about 15 % of chinook salmon smolts passing through the 2 -in. orifice.
