Colloidal evolution with time showed that a stable surfactant-free emulsion was generated before some coalescence occurs by decreasing the content of silanol groups suspected to stabilize the emulsion. The kinetics of reaction was followed by SEC, and revealed the generation of small cycles, along with linear oligomers, before converting them to poly(dimethylsiloxane) chains.

Biodegradable aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters/POSS nanocomposites were {{synthesized}} via in situ melt <b>copolycondensation</b> of {{terephthalic acid}} (TPA), poly(L-lactic acid) oligomer (OLLA), 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) reagents (POSS-NH 2 and POSS-PEG).

TEM and XRD characterizations confirmed that POSS-NH 2 formed crystalline microaggregates and took poor dispersions in the nanocomposite, while POSS-PEG had better dispersion in the matrix. Due to the good dispersion and interfacial adhesion of POSS-PEG with the copolyester PBTL matrix, the tensile strength and the Young’s modulus greatly increased for PBTL/POSS-PEG nanocomposite. Moreover, compared with POSS-NH 2 the existence of POSS-PEG imparted PBTL good flexibility and increased the mobility of the chains, so the glass-transition temperature and the heat of melting {{as well as the}} elongation at break were obviously influenced for PBTL/POSS-PEG nanocomposite...|$|E

Incorporation of 25 mol% imide in PBN causes the glass transition temperature (measured by DSC) to rise from 51 to 74 °C, a significant increase relative to PBN.

POSS-PEG took better dispersion in the PLABT, while POSS-NH 2 had poor dispersions and formed crystalline microaggregates.

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} novel {{multiblock}} poly(arylene ether sulfone) s were synthesized via block <b>copolycondensation</b> of telechelic oligomers {{as a starting}} material for the preparation of anion-exchange membranes (AEMs). The as-synthesized copolymers have extremely similar main chains. The {{difference is that the}} benzylmethyl groups for one are located on the fluorene-sulfone segments and they are located on the isopropylidene-sulfone segments for the other. The benzylmethyl moieties served as precursors to cationic sites and were brominated using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and then quaternized with N,N,N′,N′- tetramethyl- 1, 6 -diaminohexane (TMHDA). Controlled bromination and quaternization at specific positions of the benzylmethy-containing fluorene-sulfone segments and isopropylidene-sulfone segments can be achieved. 1 H NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography were used to characterize the as-synthesized copolymers. Distinct microphase separation in the as-prepared AEMs was observed using small-Angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The AEM containing fluorene-sulfone segments (IEC = 1. 89 meq·g- 1) showed higher ionic conductivity and methanol permeability than that containing isopropylidene-sulfone segments (IEC = 2. 03 meq·g- 1).

Although APPTA-x had a poor solubility in common organic solvents, the rearranged products with high co-unit contents, that is, CRPPTA- 60, 75, 90, and 100, were readily dissolved in m-cresol, DMF, DMAc, DMSO, and NMP. The effect of these four polymers, used as sizing agents, on the interfacial adhesion between Kevlar fiber and epoxy resin was investigated by the contact angle method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and microbond tests.

40|$|Molecular {{homogeneity}} frequently plays {{a decisive}} {{role in the}} effective application of organically modified silicate copolymers. However, methods of directly characterizing copolymerization extent in siloxanes generated from mixed alkoxysilanes are not always available or convenient. The authors present an alternative tool for determining kinetic parameters for models of alkoxysilane hydrolytic <b>copolycondensation.</b> Rather than restricting attention to single step batch reactors, they use a semibatch reactor with varying time of injection of one component.

Under conditions providing no direct {sup 29 }Si NMR signature of copolymerization, they find kinetic trends consistent with those previously reported. As further validation, the results of a new series of experiments (varying the ratio of mono-functional to difunctional monomer) are predicted by the semibatch copolymerization model and measured parameters. Based on these results, they are able to calculate the molecular homogeneity in the copolymer products investigated. Even for this relatively simple system, the optimal injection time is a complex function of residence time, but early injection of the faster-condensing monomer gives the best homogeneity at long residence times...|$|E

The syntheses were performed as precipitation-polycondensations, and the polymers were obtained in particulate form. Besides globular particles of polymer, small quantities of elongated, needlelike particles were observed when the mole ratio TAAC/TC was less than 1. Use of X-ray microdiffraction with synchrotron radiation has revealed that the needlelike material consists of a cyclic compound containing 10 phenylene units, i. e., the crystals are of a [2 + 2] macrocyclic dimer. The polymers obtained are soluble in strong acids and in mixtures of methanesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid with chlorinated hydrocarbons. The molecular structures of the polymers were confirmed by H- 1 and C- 13 NMR spectroscopy. Reaction of TAAC with 4, 4 '-diphenoxybenzophenone produced mainly meta-orientation of the resulting ketone linkages. The size of the polymer particles, their molecular weights, and the melting behavior of the products obtained depend on the TAAC/TC ratio used. Ortho-keto acid residues, formed during reaction of anhydride groups of TAAC with 4, 4 '-diphenoxybenzophenone, exhibit ring-chain tautomerism.

40|$|A {{series of}} novel highly {{fluorinated}} aromatic-aliphatic copolyethers {{have been prepared}} by <b>copolycondensation</b> reactions of decafluorodiphenyl-sulfone (DFPSO) with hexafluoro-bisphenol-A (6 F-BPA) and a highly fluorinated linear or branched diol (6 CF-diol or 7 bCF-diol) at different feed ratios of [diol]/[6 F-BPA]. The reactions can be completed in 2 - 5 h {{in the presence of}} CsF in DMAc at room temperature to produce polymers with number average molecular weight (Mn) up to 45 000 Da. 1 H and 19 F NMR studies show that the composition of the resultant polymers agrees well with the feed ratio of the monomers in the reaction. This feature leads to a feasible tune of glass transition temperatures (Tg) and refractive indexes of the produced polymers by a simple control of the feed ratio. As the [diol]/[6 F-BPA] ratio increases, the Tg of the copolymers decreases gradually from 185 to 87 0 C and 94 0 C, and the refractive index decreases from 1. 5120 (nTE) / 1. 5089 (nTM) to 1. 4643 (nTE) / 1. 4629 (nTM) and 1. 4487 (nTE) / 1. 4471 (nTM) for the copolymers from 6 CF-diol and 7 bCF-diol, respectively. Meanwhile, the increase of the [diol]/[6 F-BPA] ratio also effectively reduces the birefringence of the polymer films from 3. 1 x 10 - 3 to 1. 4 x 10 - 3 for the polymers from 6 CF-diol and to 1. 6 x 10 - 3 for the polymers from 7 bCF-diol. Well-developed waveguide structures with smooth ridge walls from these polymers have also been demonstrated using a cost-effective soft lithography technique.
