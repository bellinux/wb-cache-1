Ista finished second, alone, 8 seconds back of solo winner Dominic Klemme. Two weeks later, Keukeilere finished fourth in a sprint at Nokere Koerse. Gallopin finished on the podium at Cholet-Pays de Loire.

Gallopin was first from the peloton for second overall. Vogondy rode to fourth place at the Route Adélie de Vitré, just missing the podium after figuring into a winning breakaway.|$|E

5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're <b>Coming</b> <b>Home</b> Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E
5|$|Neither {{dropped below}} 11th place overall {{heading into the}} stage 10 {{individual}} time trial, where the squad had three riders finish in the top ten. Cancellara's fourth-place ride was perhaps a disappointment, in that he finished a minute and 27 seconds slower than the stage winner Tony Martin, the rider seen as his chief rival for the world championships time trial. Fuglsang took sixth on the day and Monfort tenth, putting Fuglsang 12 seconds off the race lead in second place overall and Monfort sixth 59 seconds back. Both of them lost time in stage 11, finishing in a group 27 seconds back of the group containing most of the race's top riders, but both remained in the top ten overall. Both again fell down the standings in stage 14 on La Farrapona, a day when {{out of the first}} 50 riders no more than four finished together. Their overall positions reversed the next day on the storied Alto del Angliru. Monfort finished with a group that lost time to only six riders, while Fuglsang was a further minute and eight seconds down the road from his teammate. This left Monfort fifth overall and Fuglsang seventh, after Fuglsang had been the higher-placed of the two for the entire race to that point. The next major mountain was Peña Cabarga in stage 17. Both riders were well off the pace, with Monfort finishing 19th and Fuglsang 31st. Monfort still held sixth overall with the result, but Fuglsang fell out of the top ten, down to 12th place. Fuglsang improved a place to 11th after stage 19, when Wouter Poels, who had been ahead of him, finished six minutes behind the main field. Those were their final overall positions, with both Monfort's sixth place and Fuglsang's 11th representing the best such finishes for either of them in a Grand Tour. The day before the race ended, Bennati gave the team a second stage win, <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> first in a large sprint finish in stage 20 at Vitoria.|$|E
