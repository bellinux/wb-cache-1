A brief description of the microfabrication process and chemical analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the vapor deposited alloy constituents for the TFT are reported in this study.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{junctions}} made of semiconductors {{have existed}} in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) for deep space missions, but {{are currently being}} adapted for terrestrial energy harvesting. Unfortunately, these devices are inefficient, operating at only 7 % efficiency. This low efficiency has driven efforts to make high-figure-of-merit thermoelectric devices, which require a high electrical conductivity but a low thermal conductivity, a combination {{that is difficult to}} achieve. Lowered thermal conductivity has increased efficiency, but at the cost of power output. An alternative setup is to use metallic junctions rather than semiconductors as thermoelectric devices. Metals have orders of magnitude more electrons and electronic conductivities higher than semiconductors, but thermal conductivity is higher as well. To evaluate the viability of metallic junction thermoelectrics, a two dimensional heat transfer MATLAB simulation was constructed to calculate efficiency and power output. High Seebeck coefficient alloys, <b>Chromel</b> (90 %Ni- 10 %Cr) and Constantan (55 %Cu- 45 %Ni), produced efficiencies of around 20 - 30 %.

40|$|The {{precision}} engineering research group at MIT {{is working on}} carbon nanotube growth experiments on silicon substrates and in microfabricated silicon devices, to try to produce improved bulk nanotube growth. For this thesis, a heating control system was designed and implemented for eventual use in CNT growth experiments. The computer program that controls the heater is user-adaptable, so that an experimenter can easily change the desired temperatures at various points of the process. Later, this heating system will {{become part of a}} much larger system that also incorporates a controlled flow rate. The goal of the system is to achieve high-bandwidth control of reaction conditions. In the heating control system designed, a computer controls a power supply attached to a wire-wrapped silicon chip, which is used to heat up the system, and the temperature is measured by a thermocouple. The control algorithm uses proportional gain, and the output is a PWM voltage. For accurate control of the system, a goal was set out to achieve an error of within 10 %. For gains above 5, the computer can accurately control the temperature to less than 5. 5 % of the desired values in steady state, and an error of 0. 75 % was achieved with a gain of 50. (cont.) Thus the system meets the desired specification of error. Also, while the error drops dramatically with increasing gain, the overshoot increases much more slowly, making a higher gain desirable. Also, the system still has only reached temperatures of 650 degrees Celsius, although temperatures of 1000 degrees Celsius are required for nanotube growth. In order to achieve this, further tests will be performed with thicker wire and more voltage. Also, contact resistances within the <b>chromel</b> decrease with increasing temperatures, which reduce the percentage of power dissipated in the <b>chromel</b> compared to the lead wires. If the system is modified to eliminate this effect, by wrapping the wire differently or by using doped silicon, higher temperatures can be achieved. This will also make the system more predictable, leading to a better model and better control. Finally, to improve overall performance, one can experiment with changes to the switching time, using a PI or PID controller, and active cooling. by David Held. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the cell}} {{temperature}} distribution of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks during normal operation has multifaceted advantages in performance and degradation studies. Present efforts on measuring temperature from operating SOFCs measure only the gas channel temperature {{and do not}} reveal the cell level temperature distribution, which is more important for understanding a cell's performance and its temperature-related degradation. The authors propose a cell-integrated, multi-junction thermocouple array for in-situ cell surface temperature monitoring of an operational SOFC. The proposed thermocouple array requires far fewer numbers of thermoelements than that required by sets of thermocouples for {{the same number of}} temperature sensing points. Hence, the proposed array causes lower disturbance to cell performance than thermocouples. The thermoelement array was sputter deposited on the cathode of a commercial SOFC using alumel (Ni:Al:Mn:Si – 95 : 2 : 2 : 1 by wt.) and <b>chromel</b> (Ni:Cr – 90 : 10 by wt.). The thermocouple array was tested in a furnace over the entire operating temperature range of a typical SOFC.

40|$|Novel multi-junction {{thermocouple}} architecture {{was developed}} and simulated to in-situ monitor the temperature distribution over a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). This thermocouple architecture requires only {N+ 1 } number of wires for N number of independent temperature measuring points. Therefore, N+ 1 architecture can independently measure temperature at multiple points simultaneously with much less number of wires than a set of thermocouples require for {{the same number of}} independent temperature measurements. Requiring less number of external wires is a distinct advantage, particularly, in constrained environments such as those within SOFC stacks. A thermocouple array having 4 independent temperature measuring points with 5 thermo-elements was simulated in MATLAB. Alumel (Ni:Al:Mn:Si – 95 : 2 : 2 : 1 wt) and <b>Chromel</b> (Ni:Cr – 90 : 10 wt) were chosen as thermo-element materials because of their wide applicability in the industry as K-type thermocouples. The junctions were considered to be spot welded. Three sets of simulations were performed to investigate two aspects: validation of the multi-junction thermocouple concept and investigation of the effect of the heat affected zone created in spot welding to the temperature measurement. Simulation code generates random temperature values for each junction within a pre-defined range. Temperatures at the boundaries of heat affected zones were also generated randomly according to a pre-defined criterion. The change of Seebeck coefficients within the heat affected zone was set as a percentage change of their corresponding materials Seebeck coefficient. The temperature gradient induced emf values for each sensing point were calculated from Seebeck coefficients. Th...|$|E
