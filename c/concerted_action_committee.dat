"As {{one of the most}} urbanised countries in the world, with water shortages, transport congestion and high energy demands, Australia must take action now to address how our cities might develop in the future. "This committee 2 ̆ 7 s vision is for Australian cities that are vibrant and healthy - environmentally, socially and economically. Working towards this goal is not the responsibility of governments alone. It is the responsibility of all Australians and must be a priority for all Australians. The committee was heartened to see the commitment and dedication displayed by many individuals and organisations. What is missing is coordinated and <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> "This <b>committee</b> believes that {{that there is a need}} for the Australian Government to assume a leadership role. Accordingly, the committee 2 ̆ 7 s most important recommendations concern what form such leadership might take. " Released 12 September 200...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{offer an}} {{approach}} to <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> that builds on traditional Chicago School analyses of the issue, but adds {{a focus on the}} role of communication. Chicago scholars uniformly identify cartels as the primary target of antitrust enforcement. They have also established much of the framework within which courts and economists analyze <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> George Stigler’s seminal theory of oligopoly, which sought to identify the determinants of effective collusion, has spawned an enormous literature in game theory that models the pricing behavior of oligopolists. Richard Posner’s early analysis of tacit collusion - rivals’ coordination of noncompetitive pricing without express communication - extended Stigler’s analysis to the domain of law and policy. His approach to oligopoly pricing drew on economic theory and evidence both to define tacit collusion as <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> and to identify structural and behavioral characteristics of markets that suggested its presence. I argue that Posner’s approach, refocused on the role of communication, provides the most promising way forward in the analysis of <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> After recounting the history of the Chicago School’s analysis of <b>concerted</b> <b>action,</b> I propose a modified definition of <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> and suggest how the change might affect the search for instances of <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> I argue that Section 1 does not reach tacit collusion, but neither does it require a verbal agreement; instead, <b>actions</b> are <b>concerted</b> if rivals coordinate them in part by communicating their intentions. I argue that this focus on communicative <b>concerted</b> <b>action,</b> despite its departure from Posner’s legal position, is consistent with the Chicago tradition, particularly error cost analysis. Its neo-Chicago character lies in its reliance on the most recent economic literature on the role of communication in collusion. In {{the last part of the}} article, I examine a small but important subset of that literature: studies of how real-world cartels use communication and facilitating practices to achieve their aims. Based on these studies, I suggest how plaintiffs and enforcement agencies might discover <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> by examining changing patterns in the use of facilitating practices...|$|R

40|$|An EC <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> on the {{assessment}} of AIDS/HIV prevention strategies was conducted between 1989 and 1992. The aim of this <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> (CA) was to bring together researchers who are active in this assessment field, make an initial appraisal {{of the results of}} AIDS prevention efforts, in various population groups in Europe and develop an assessment methodology. Five areas of study were selected for the CA: the population as a whole ("general population"), men who have sexual relations with other men, intravenous drug users, migrant populations, monitoring of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to determine changes in behaviour. For each of these areas, a working group composed of the leading researchers in the field in Europe was constituted and commissioned by the project administration and coordination team to collate and analyse data on prevention efforts and their assessment in different countries of Europe. This review presents the main results from the groups responsible in each area in the <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> A number of general conclusions from the results of this <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> are drawn...|$|R

40|$|Communication {{is useful}} and often {{necessary}} for rivals to coordinate price and output decisions. All {{would agree that}} evidence of communication on these issues is relevant {{to the issue of}} whether firms reached an illegal agreement or engaged in <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Most courts and commentators would go further and define agreement and <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> to require communication of one kind or another. I call this view the objective theory of <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> Louis Kaplow has recently challenged this approach in three important articles, all of which argue that the focus on communications is misguided. Although he does not propose a fully specified definition, he suggests that a standard of successful oligopolistic interdependence [...] in which rivals reach a meeting of the minds [...] would provide a superior basis for identifying unlawful agreements. In this essay, I describe this subjective theory of <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> and identify the equilibria that it includes and excludes. I then consider its likely costs and benefits relative to the current objective theory. I argue that it will deter few durable instances of oligopolistic interdependence that present law would not prohibit. On the other hand, it apparently immunizes some equilibria, even if reached through communication. If so, it would raise the possibility of new and problematic defenses to claims of illegal <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> Moreover, Kaplow excludes certain noncompetitive equilibria from the subjective standard on the ground that they do not involve the requisite meeting of minds. But these equilibria differ in only a few ways from other, strategic equilibria that arguably do involve the necessary meeting of minds. Reliance on the concept of a meeting of the minds to distinguish these equilibria would risk significant false positives...|$|R
