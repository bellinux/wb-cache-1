5|$|In late August {{and early}} September 1943, the {{division}} redeployed again, {{this time to}} Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast.

5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy <b>casualties</b> <b>and</b> prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull {{and into the}} sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt to}} break the siege failed, with around 290 {{casualties}} out of around 415 men. Shortly afterwards, a second relief effort consisting of 225 men and three artillery guns—carried out despite specific orders {{that it should not}} take place—dispersed the forces surrounding the building, suffering two <b>casualties,</b> <b>and</b> the besieged party escaped. Only one member of the besieged group was injured.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken <b>casualties,</b> <b>and</b> still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|British {{casualties}} in the battle were recorded with some accuracy {{in the immediate aftermath}} as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded, although the number of wounded who subsequently died is not known. The ships that suffered most were Bellerophon with 201 <b>casualties</b> <b>and</b> Majestic with 193. Other than Culloden the lightest loss was on Zealous, which had one man killed and seven wounded.|$|E

5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of <b>casualties</b> <b>and</b> the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent, howitzers can be fired directly, {{as was done}} by the 11th Marine Regiment at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, during the Korean War. Two field batteries fired directly upon a battalion of Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they had no time to dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy <b>casualties,</b> <b>and</b> were forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Government {{efforts to}} violently crush the strike, {{including}} a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into {{a crowd of}} protesters that resulted in multiple <b>casualties</b> <b>and</b> one death, had led {{to the arrest of}} the movement's leaders.
