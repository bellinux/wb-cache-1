40|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century American cotton-producing areas rapidly {{expanded}} beyond the 2 ̆ 2 Old South 2 ̆ 2 cotton belt, an area extending from Virginia to East Texas. By the 1920 s farmers had plowed fields and established new cotton centers in western Oklahoma, the High Plains of Texas, and among the large irrigated farms of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. By the 1940 s the dominant areas of American cotton production were California and West Texas.;While historians have examined many aspects of cotton production in the South, the same cannot be said of the western cotton belt. This study profiles the newer cotton farming areas from Central Texas to California and their evolutionary development into the 2 ̆ 2 Cotton West. 2 ̆ 2;Several conditions influenced the establishment and expansion of the Cotton West. Water and irrigation were key ingredients. New settlers in many areas produced relatively little until the federal government built a major irrigation system through the reclamation program; other farmers depended on underground water to sustain their crops.;Central players {{in the development of the}} western cotton industry were the researchers and scientists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and their partners in state land-grant colleges and agricultural experiment stations. The USDA was particularly eager to establish a new cotton industry in the West [...] -one that would supplement instead of duplicate that of the South. Researchers sought and improved varieties of long-staple and Acala cottons, which they bred to suit each region of the Cotton West.;With appropriate varieties of cotton available to farmers, the march toward mechanization became the next important area of study for farmers and researchers alike. Changes in technology and the available labor force were constant challenges for western cotton producers needing seasonal, sometimes migratory, labor at particular times of the year. Federal immigration policy affected which ethnic groups were available. The shift to mechanical harvesting after World War II marked a significant step toward <b>completing</b> <b>mechanization</b> and shifting the labor needs for cotton growing. Once the Cotton West became well established, the contrasts between the West and the South began to disappear...|$|R
50|$|The Strasbourg Cathedral has housed three {{different}} astronomical clocks since the 14th century.The first clock was built between 1352 and 1354 and stopped working sometime {{at the beginning}} of the 16th century. A second clock was then built by Herlin, Conrad Dasypodius, the Habrecht brothers, and others, between 1547 and 1574. This clock stopped working in 1788 or 1789 (as it apparently stopped working gradually, each component being disconnectedone after the other). After a lapse of 50 years, a new clock was built by Jean-Baptiste Schwilgué (1776-1856) and about 30 workers. This clock is housedin the case of the 2nd clock.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{mechanical}} verification of programs containing loops {{it is often}} necessary to provide loop invariants additionally to the specification {{in the form of}} pre and postconditions. In this paper we present a method for {{the mechanical}} inference of invariants for a practically relevant class of FOR-loops. The invariant is derived from the specification (pre, post) and the final bound of the loop only. The method is based on the technique “replacing a constant in post by a variable”, which has traditionally been used manually for the development of WHILE-loops. Our method is a <b>complete</b> <b>mechanization</b> of this heuristic for the verification of existing annotated FOR-loops. The range of applicability of the method is further extended by a technique called “bound transformation” and by taking common invariant conjuncts of pre and post into account. As a result, the method is applicable to the majority of FOR-loops occurring in practice. The incorporation of this method into an automatic program verifier would make the task of the SW engineer easier, because he has only to provide a pre–post-specification for a FOR-loop...|$|E

40|$|The Italian {{olive-growing}} {{sector has}} to face both the growing competition on the international olive oil market and the shift of the common agricultural policy (CAP) from market and price policies towards direct aids decoupled from production. In addition the olive growers, as other farmers, have to comply with stricter obligations to manage their farms in sustainable ways (cross compliance). In this scenario the sector needs new competitive strategies to address these new challenges. In this paper we assess if innovative olive-growing models, like the high trees density orchards, are able to reduce production costs without worsening environmental sustainability. Indeed the intensive olive systems produce higher yields {{within a few years}} of planting and allow a higher level of mechanization (pruning and harvesting) but they could generate higher environmental impacts. In this study we perform an environmental and economic assessment of two olive-growing systems: the “High Density” (HDO) and the “Super High Density” (SHDO). The analysis integrates the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods by using a common database. The environmental analysis carried out through LCA has shown a better performance of the HDO system for all the impact categories, due to a lower use of energy and chemical inputs and to higher olive yields. Also from an economic point of view the HDO could be considered more convenient than the SHDO: in fact, despite the lower operating costs of the latter due to the <b>complete</b> <b>mechanization</b> of pruning and harvesting operations, these costs are counterbalanced by higher initial investment costs that the company {{has to face}} which are three times those of the HDO system. The total result is that the Net Present Value is better for the HDO for each olive price level. This result is mainly driven by lower plantation costs, longer production cycle, higher production of olives and higher efficiency in the use of inputs which characterize the HDO model...|$|E
