500|$|The {{rectangular}} five bay barn is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide, {{although it was}} previously larger. The middle bay is slightly longer than the others because of the central porches. The barn is built of local Blue Lias stone with some better quality oolitic ashlar used for the quoins on the corners and the porches which provided cover for gfoods being loaded and unloaded at the doors. It is supported by two-stage buttresses reaching to {{three quarters of the}} height of the walls. Each of the side walls has ventilation slits, or breathers, with those in the end walls being {{in the shape of a}} cross pommee.

30|$|Of the 262 calves sampled {{across all}} households, 17.2  % had {{clinically}} apparent diarrhoea. <b>Calf</b> <b>shedding</b> prevalence for Cryptosporidium {{was estimated at}} 9.9  % (CI 0.063 to 0.135) while Giardia shedding prevalence was estimated at 22.9  % (CI 0.178 to 0.28). Calves ≤ 3  months old were two times (CI 1.09 to 4.76) {{more likely to have}} diarrhoea than older calves (> 3  months old). In addition, calves ≤ 3  months old {{were significantly more likely to}} be shedding Cryptosporidium (OR[*]=[*] 4.94, CI 1.61 to 20.34) and Giardia (OR[*]=[*] 2.68, CI 1.38 to 5.45) compared to older calves. Further, calf age and intensity of shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts rho[*]=[*]− 0.149 (P[*]=[*] 0.0158) and Giardia cysts rho[*]=[*]− 0.135 (P[*]=[*] 0.0281) were negatively correlated, providing evidence that younger calves also shed more oocysts and cysts. Faecal shedding intensity estimates for Cryptosporidium ranged from 100 to 106, 000 oocysts per gram of faeces (median[*]=[*] 450), while Giardia ranges were higher, from 200 to 194, 600 cysts per gram (median[*]=[*] 3, 150). Median environmental loading rates in excreted faeces were estimated at 1, 800, 000 oocysts and 156, 879, 350 cysts per calf per day for Cryptosporidium and Giardia, respectively, for acutely infected calves.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate calf and herd prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp., the herd prevalence clustering, spatial distribution according to soil type and shedding patterns in dairy calves from Cordoba, Argentina. Six hundred twenty calves younger than 7 weeks of age from 43 dairy herds were sampled. Samples were processed with the formol-ether and modified Ziehl-Neelsen techniques. Univariate analysis and Kruskall-Wallis tests were used. Factors associated were subjected to multivariate analysis with <b>calf</b> <b>shedding</b> intensity as the response variable. Clustering of herd prevalence was assessed by a scan method, and spatial analysis was applied to explore the overlapping of high prevalence herds and soil type. Overall calf prevalence for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts were 19. 35 % (95 % CI: 16. 14; 22. 54) and 34. 50 % (95 % CI: 30. 69; 38. 34), respectively. Calves younger than two weeks of age were almost four {{times more likely to be}} infected with Cryptosporidium, in comparison to older ones (RR: 3. 78, 95 % CI: 2. 27; 6. 26). Giardia spp. shedding showed a similar age pattern (RR: 1. 33, 95 % CI: 1. 02; 1. 75). A primary cluster of high Cryptosporidium prevalence was found, and high prevalence herds were located in areas with poor drained soil...|$|R
40|$|Ventilation {{breakdown}} {{and narrow}} escapes occur at regular intervals, and sometimes these result in lethal outcomes. A ventilation breakdown in animal houses {{can cause a}} very rapid increase in air temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentrations inside the barn. The most severe narrow escapes occur in <b>calf</b> <b>sheds</b> (calves / beef), and houses for pigs and poultry. The {{most common cause of}} ventilation breakdown is power failure. Other causes can be failing control equipment and damaged fans. Ventilation breakdowns are most severe during summer time. According to a Swedish standard (SIS, 1992), the air temperature inside an animal house shall not exceed the outside air temperature with more than 4 ºC when it is 21 ºC outside. A limited increase of the temperature within a barn can cause a decrease in production. When the temperature exceeds an upper critical temperature a severe increase of the body temperature of the animals occur resulting in a lethal outcome. Heat stress in cows result in decreased milk production and a decrease in fertility. Hyperthermia is a common cause of death for poultry. Power failures in broiler houses are meant to be especially fatal. Pigs are meant to be especially sensitive to high temperatures since they not sweat, and not pant especially good. In directions from the Swedish Animal welfare Agency (DFS 2007 : 5) demands are present concerning emergency ventilation, and <b>calf</b> <b>sheds</b> (calves / beef), pig and poultry houses must be equipped with alarm equipment for excess temperature, power failure and failure concerning the alarm equipment etc. For making a summary of different brands and different models of alarm equipment available, information and pamphlets were collected from different companies. A number of equipments on the Swedish market fulfil relevant demands on alarm equipment for animal houses. A questionnaire was sent to producers with poultry, pigs and cattle in order to map the present state of alarm and emergency ventilation at Swedish farms. Totally 180 questionnaires were sent to farmers with poultry, pigs and cattle and the response rate was 72 %. The study showed that at the present time some types of alarms were missing in a number of barns. Presence of alarm was most frequent in poultry houses. Alarm for excess temperature and power failure were present in most houses with poultry. About two thirds of the poultry producers noted that they had alarm warning for alarm equipment failure. Among the pig producers about 30 % noted that they had alarm warning for excess temperature in the barn and about 20 % noted that they had alarm warning for power failure and stopped fans. For producers with cattle only a small fraction noted that alarm equipments were installed in the barns. Different systems for making responsible personnel aware of an alarm exist. Combinations of different methods were frequently used. Many producers have combinations of sound / light signals, alarms to the dwellings, and alarms to mobile phones, and some producers also have alarm going further on to a central alarm station e. g. SOS Alarm or Falk. Most of the producers (more than 80 %) noted that they tested the alarm with regularity. On farms with milk production and cattle, the emergency ventilation was achieved in far most cases by the help of manually opened doors and windows, and by the help of manually 10 started electric works connected to a tractor. On farms with poultry production the emergency ventilation was managed by the help of automatic systems to a great extent. On farms with pig production, emergency ventilation was managed to a great extent by the help of windows, doors and manually started electric works connected to tractors. The study showed that power failures occurred 1 - 5 times per year or more frequent at more than 90 % of 120 producers answering to the question. At none of the farms animals had died {{as a consequence of the}} power failures. About 70 % of those who answered noted that they had a plan for how the emergency ventilation should be organised in case of power failure. A number of measures can be taken to improve the systems. Some producer pointed out the problem with false alarms and automatic opening of inlets / outlets leading to unwanted low temperatures in the barn during winter time. Another producer mentioned problems with the ordinary telephone net during thunderstorms and suggested switching over to mobile phones. At some farms a number of persons were meant to be able to handle problems coming up. Natural air exchange with closed and to some extent open inlets / outlets (ventilation openings) were measured in five buildings without animals by the use of trace gas technology. Measurements were made during summer time since the driving force for natural ventilation is low due to small temperature differences during that time of the year. The air exchange rate was measured by the help of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) spread inside the buildings. The air exchange rate was calculated from the rate of concentration change by time after stopping the supply of gas. Gas concentration was registered by the help of an infrared spectrophotometer. Measurements in conventional buildings showed ventilation rates far below minimum ventilation rates. In such buildings a considerable increase of the inside air temperature will take place if animals producing heat are present. Studies in a comparatively less airtight and not insulated building showed air exchange rates well above minimum ventilation rates. The ventilation rate increased by increased inlet area and increased wind velocity. In order to estimate the rate of change in temperature during a ventilation breakdown a simple calculation model was derived from building characteristics and animal heat production equations. Calculations were made for ventilation rates of 2 m 3 ·h- 1 ·m- 2 and 8 m 3 ·h- 1 ·m- 2 for barns housing different animals. Calculations show a considerable increase of temperature during the first 30 minutes after a ventilation breakdown. The increase in temperature is higher in a light building compared to a heavy building. The increase in temperature are also high in buildings with pigs weighing 90 kg and houses with almost finished broilers compared to barns with cows and houses with 15 laying hens per m 2 floor area. High temperatures during a ventilation breakdown can occur also at temperatures as low as 5 °C. In systems with much stored manure inside the buildings there is a risk for extremely high gas concentrations during a ventilation breakdown due to gases released from the manure. In <b>calf</b> <b>sheds</b> (beef barns) with tied animals an increase of temperature comparable to barns with dairy cows can be expected. When calves (beef) are housed on deep litter high gas concentrations may occur during a ventilation breakdown due to gases released from the litter. The studies point out that a very fast increase in temperature can occur at a ventilationbreakdown when openings between the barn and the outside air are small (inlet- /outlet openings). Calculations suggest that the temperature during unfavourable circumstances may increase up to 10 °C during less than 30 minutes. Thus, the time for arranging emergency ventilation may be very short...|$|R

30|$|Diarrhoeal {{diseases}} can be debilitating, {{especially for}} children and young animals. In many rural areas, particularly pastoral communities, livelihoods are characterized by close interaction between household members and their livestock herds, and children often care for young animals, creating opportunities for the transmission of multiple zoonotic pathogens. Using a One Health approach, we first evaluated whether diarrhoeal diseases were a problem for pastoral households in Tanzania and then investigated their calf herds to identify the prevalence and risk factors for diarrhoeal disease and the shedding of the zoonotic pathogens Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Sixty percent of households reporting cases of human diarrhoea also had diarrhoea detected later in their calf herds, and <b>calf</b> herds <b>shedding</b> Cryptosporidium oocysts were six {{times more likely to}} be diarrhoeic. Because Cryptosporidium shares a similar transmission mode with a wide range of diarrhoeagenic organisms and calf diarrhoea outbreaks can involve multiple pathogens with mixed infections, it is possible that calf diarrhoea may be indicative of shared risk of zoonotic pathogens from environmental contamination. To mitigate the risk of transmission of faecal-borne zoonotic pathogens from herds to households (boma-livestock pens to banda –household building), we describe a conceptual disease early-warning method proposing diarrhoeic calves as animal sentinels. Such a calf warning system, combined with appropriate interventions designed to minimize exposure, could serve as a practical solution for reducing risks of diarrhoeal diseases among animals and people.|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) is {{an economically}} important pathogen of cattle worldwide. Infection of a pregnant animal {{may lead to}} persistent infection of the foetus and birth of a persistently infected (PI) <b>calf</b> that <b>sheds</b> the virus throughout its life. However, BVD viruses are not strictly species specific. BVDV has been isolated from many domesticated and wild ruminants. This is of practical importance as virus reservoirs in non-bovine hosts may hamper BVDV control in cattle. A goat given as a social companion to a BVDV PI calf {{gave birth to a}} PI goat kid. In order to test if goat to goat infections were possible, seronegative pregnant goats were exposed to the PI goat. In parallel, seronegative pregnant goats were kept together with the PI calf. Only the goat to goat transmission resulted in the birth of a next generation of BVDV PI kids whereas all goats kept together with the PI calf aborted. To our knowledge, this is the first report which shows that a PI goat cannot only transmit BVD virus to other goats but that such transmission may indeed lead to the birth of a second generation of PI goats. Genetic analyses indicated that establishment in the new host species may be associated with step-wise adaptations in the viral genome. Thus, goats have {{the potential to be a}} reservoir for BVDV. However, the PI goats showed growth retardation and anaemia and their survival under natural conditions remains questionable...|$|R

40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} disease imposes major losses in EU cattle and dairy production. For the farmer the economic {{costs associated with}} this disease can be high due to veterinary visits, purchase of antibiotics, loss in production, and mortality. It is widely known that early treatment of the disease will reduce {{its impact on the}} health and welfare of the calf and also reduce the contamination rate within a <b>calf</b> <b>shed.</b> It is therefore important to recognize important signals of bovine {{respiratory disease}} in calves as early as possible. As coughing represents one of the clinical manifestations of bovine respiratory disease, automatically detecting the amount of cough in the shed can serve as an early warning for cattle producers. This study builds on previous work in the M 3 -BIORES research group and the company SoundTalks. The study aims to distinguish calf cough and a commonly encountered noise source: metallic sounds. Metallic sounds are common sound in calf houses due to metal fences and gates being frequently opened, closed, and rattling. The classification algorithm was developed using 2 hours of recordings where in at least 1 hour of data metallic sounds occurred frequently. The developed algorithm to distinguish cough from metallic sounds obtained a precision of 80. 2 % and a sensitivity of 98. 8 %. The results show that cough and metallic sounds can be separated based on their spectral content more specifically using the initial percentile frequency. Consequently, the feature can be used in the development of an automated calf cough monitor for commercial applications. status: accepte...|$|E
30|$|Diarrhoea prevalence, Cryptosporidium and Giardia {{shedding}} {{prevalence and}} the respective 95  % exact confidence intervals were estimated for calves at the herd level. Shedding prevalences were estimated for Cryptosporidium and Giardia based on microscopy-positive animals. To investigate how diarrhoea and pathogen shedding varied among individual calves, calf-level data {{were used to}} assess the correlation between age and Cryptosporidium or Giardia shedding intensities using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and to evaluate the associations between age groups and calf diarrhoea or Cryptosporidium or Giardia shedding using univariable logistic regression models. Variables hypothesized as risk factors were then evaluated for association with calf diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium and Giardia shedding at the herd level using univariable logistic regression models, including herd management practices (e.g. moving bomas and manure management); calf birthing and husbandry practices; veterinary and ethnoveterinary practices; water sources for herds and households; mixing of herds; and herd size and distance from water sources, villages, protected areas and road networks. Variables associated with calf diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium or Giardia shedding in univariable models (P[*]≤[*] 0.20), potentially confounding variables and biologically plausible interactions were then evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models. Final parsimonious models were selected by comparing Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) among competing nested and non-nested models. The final model fit was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests and graphical residual diagnostics (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). For multivariable models, adjusted odds ratios with 95  % confidence intervals were estimated to assess the strength of the association between each risk factor and <b>calf</b> diarrhoea or <b>shedding</b> status. All statistical tests were performed with R statistical software (R Core Development Team 2013, Vienna, Austria).|$|R
40|$|Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) is {{estimated}} to cost the UK cattle industry £ 40 million annually, the third most costly disease facing the agricultural industry. BVD produces a range of symptoms in cattle including scouring, pneumonia, poor fertility, reduced growth rates and lowered milk yields. The most common route of transmission is through persistently infected (PI) animals shedding the virus to other cattle. PI animals can only develop pre-partum when the BVD virus crosses the placenta from the dam to the foetus. If infection occurs during the first 110 to 150 days of gestation, the foetus is immune-incompetent and the lymphocytes are unable to identify foreign bodies, the virus becomes accepted {{as part of the}} foetus and is unable to produce antibodies against it; if born alive, the <b>calf</b> will continually <b>shed</b> the virus throughout its life. Animals infected post birth will become acutely infected and shed the virus for two to three weeks before producing antibodies and long-term immunity against the virus (Larska et al, 2013; Booth and Brownlie, 2011; Walz et al., 2010; Smirnova et al., 2008; Brock, 2003; Fray et al., 2000). BVD can be controlled and eradicated, as has been shown in a number of European countries. Currently there are no measures in place nationally in the UK to control this disease; however, a regional control programme was implemented in the South West between 2010 and 2013. This study aimed to establish the level of risk or entry and spread of BVD on farms participating in this programme and determine any common risk areas on these farms. Herds participating in this regional control programme were categorised as red, amber or green for the level of risk of BVD entry and for BVD spread following the completion of a risk assessment questionnaire. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify common risk areas for BVD entry and spread within both dairy and beef herds. These risk areas were then used to provide summarised advice suitable for farmers to improve their level of risk management on their farm for both BVD entry and spread and control BVD on their farm...|$|R
40|$|Rectal fecal {{samples were}} taken {{once a week}} from 49 calves on the same farm. In addition, the dams of the calves were sampled {{at the time of}} calf birth {{and at the end of}} the study. Strains of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) were {{isolated}} from these samples by using PCR and DNA probe hybridization tests and were characterized with respect to serotype, verocytotoxin gene (vtx) type, and the presence of the intimin (eae) and hemolysin (ehxA) genes. A total of 170 VTEC strains were isolated during 21 weeks from 130 (20 %) of 664 samples from calves and from 40 (47 %) of 86 samples from their dams. The characteristics of the calf strains differed from those strains isolated from the dams with respect to verocytotoxin 2 and the presence of the eae gene. In addition, no <b>calf</b> <b>shed</b> the same VTEC serogroup (excluding O?) as its dam at birth or at the end of the study. The most frequently detected serogroups in calves were serogroup O 26 and provisional serogroup E 40874 (VTEC O 26 was found in 25 calves), whereas in dams serogroup O 91 and provisional serogroup E 54071 were the most common serogroups. VTEC O 26 shedding appeared to be associated with very young calves and declined as the calves aged, whereas VTEC O 2 shedding was associated with housing of the animals. VTEC O 26 strains from calves were characterized by the presence of the vtx 1, eae, and ehxA genes, whereas vtx 2 was associated with VTEC O 2 and provisional serogroup E 40874. The high prevalence of VTEC O 26 and of VTEC strains harboring the eae gene in this calf cohort is notable because of the association of the O 26 serogroup and the presence of the eae gene with human disease. No association between calf diarrhea and any of the VTEC serogroups was identified...|$|E
