5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus of Oakland <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> <b>and</b> the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives that split from the main roadway in each direction to provide access through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives merge back in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a rail terminal in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between Oakland and Macomb counties.|$|E

The focus areas in this study included characteristics of collaboration, models of collaboration, and processes by which <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> LWIBs collaborate. The study examined what collaborative relationships exist <b>and</b> determined which <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> LWIBs perceive their collaborations as successful. Communication, process and structure, membership characteristics, and other key components in collaboration were analyzed. _x 000 D_Major findings included that overall LWIBs perceived their collaborations with <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> as slightly more successful than <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> perceived their collaborations with LWIBs. Between the <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> the LWIBs, <b>community</b> <b>college</b> upper administration perceived their collaboration highest. Of the six Wilder Collaboration Factors Inventory factor groups,Environment had the highest overall mean indicating that this factor group was perceived as being the most influential factor contributing to successful collaboration. There is both practical and theoretical significance in this research study. The practical significance is that the results will help California <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>and</b> Local Workforce Investment Boards understand their collaborative dynamics. The theoretical significance is that this study will add to the body of literature on how to improve collaboration between dissimilar organizations...|$|R

5|$|Sound Transit {{revisited}} the routing issue during community {{meetings in}} 1997 and 1998, proposing an alternate route through Eastlake, South Lake Union, and the Seattle Center if engineering of the Capitol Hill tunnel would jeopardize the project's budget. The project's draft environmental impact statement, released in December 1998, {{determined that the}} Capitol Hill tunnel would be feasible and recommended its inclusion in the plan. Sound Transit proposed that Capitol Hill's cut and cover station be located under Broadway south of East John Street, with several entrances to serve nearby Seattle Central <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> <b>and</b> the Broadway business district. From the station, trains would continue south to a station in First Hill before entering the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel; and north under Portage Bay to the western University District. An additional Capitol Hill station, near Broadway and East Roy Street, was proposed by Seattle representatives but {{left out of the}} preferred alternative due to cost concerns. In November 1999, Sound Transit finalized its preferred alternative, adding a crossover north of Capitol Hill station near East Thomas Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{takes on}} a more suburban residential character as the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area. There are separate interchanges for US12 (Michigan Avenue) and I-94 on the southeast side of the city. Between I-94 and Washtenaw Avenue, US23 carries the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) moniker as well. That secondary designation leaves the freeway and runs west on Washtenaw Avenue into downtown Ann Arbor and {{the campus of the}} University of Michigan. At the same interchange, a Business US 23 (Bus. US23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US23 crosses the Huron River near the campus of the local <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>and</b> continues north to a junction with the M-14 freeway. The two merge and run westward along {{the north side of the}} city before US23 turns north and M-14 curves south.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term.
