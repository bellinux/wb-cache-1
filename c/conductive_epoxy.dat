5000|$|Circuit Scribe {{allows users}} to create a paper Arduino (or a ‘paperduino’), which is {{demonstrated}} by the research team. The team first found the schematics on the Arduino website and modified {{them so that they}} would work on a pen plotter. With a few modifications, they arranged the components and traces so that the board could be printed in a single layer. The alignments are set to 0.6 millimeters to match the width of the pen traces with a minimum distance of 0.1 millimeters. The pen plotter only prints lines and does not fill the patterns, so they designed large pads out of concentric circles and built up the pads for the components with some extra line features. This allows for a stronger conductivity. It is important to put chips close together to minimize the line resistance between them, but not so close that it's difficult to place the components. They used components from the 1206 package which are a bit larger than the original components from the Arduino. Before exporting the layout, they deselected every layer of the file except the top layer of traces. After exporting the file in [...]dxf format, both the wire width and the fill area options were deselected and the files were saved. Finally, the team measured the size of the board layout and dragged it onto a new sheet on Silhouette Studio. From there, the vertical height was adjusted to 2.945 inches and the speed was set to 1 in order to lay down the most amount of ink when printed. The team went on to place components like resistors, capacitors, and LEDs on the printed silver ink. Components can be attached using tweezers and super glue, but can be reinforced using <b>conductive</b> <b>epoxy.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, nano silver paste {{was used}} as die attach {{material}} {{with the aim of}} increasing reliability of joints in power modules in automotive applications. Prior to joining, nano silver paste was spread on the interface between silver coated copper substrates and dummy chips by screen printing method. 5 groups of samples were produced using three different joining techniques based on different combinations of ultrasonic force and persistent pressure in air and vacuum atmospheres. The bonding quality of the interface region was evaluated by microstructural examination and quasi-static shear tests. On the other hand, electrical properties of sintered nano silver particles within the joints were characterized through resistivity measurements. Sintered nano silver regions in all samples exhibited two types of porosity, namely, macro and micro porosity. Macro pores formed during the evaporation and removal of organics present in the starting paste, while micro pores were left in the structure because of insufficient sintering of silver nano powders. Although the sintered silver interface in samples produced using 5 MPa persistent pressure in air displayed a minimum amount of porosity, pores as large as 5 m in diameter were observed in joints produced in air by a preload of 0. 01 MPa with or without ultrasonic force. In addition, vacuum sintering yielded relatively porous interfaces compared to samples manufactured in air even though the same compaction pressure was applied during sintering. Accordingly, in the samples produced either in air by the application of low preloads of 0. 01 MPa or in vacuum at 5 MPa, additional microcracks were formed, particularly in the interface region between silver coating and sintered nano silver particles. Stress-strain curves of the joints exhibited linear elastic, small strain hardening and fracture regions similar to wrought alloys. The strengths of the joints increased proportionally to the degree of sintering as expected. The shear strength reached to  32 MPa in samples sintered in air at 5 MPa constant pressure, whereas shear strength decreased to  4 MPa in highly porous joints produced by ultrasonic force and preloading with 0. 01 MPa. All samples revealed shear-type dimples in the direction of mechanical testing indicating ductile behavior of joints. The electrical resistivity of the sintered nano silver layer showed the same trend as the mechanical properties. The weakest or most porous joint had the highest electrical resistivity of approximately 125. 5 μΩ-cm). On the other hand, the least porous silver joint, manufactured at 5 MPa constant pressure in air exhibited the lowest electrical resistivity (7. 8 μΩ-cm); however, it was five times higher than that of bulk silver.
