5|$|The sterile diploid {{hybrid of}} A.montanum and A.platyneuron, which resembles A.bradleyi except for its {{abortive}} spores and smaller sori, was not collected until 1972, at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia. Even though the diploid hybrid is rarely collected, allozyme {{studies show that}} A.bradleyi has multiple origins; that is, different populations of A.bradleyi have originated from the <b>chromosome</b> <b>doubling</b> of independently formed diploids.

Herb Wagner, in 1953, suggested instead {{that it was the}} hybrid of A.montanum and A.platyneuron, noting that Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along those lines.

To {{gain a better understanding}} of physiology and morphology in these higher level polyploids (P. lusitanica, 2 n = 8 x; P. laurocerasus, 2 n = 22 x), a variety of breeding experiments were performed. The long-term goal of these experiments was to lay the ground-work for the creation of a sterile, shothole disease resistant cherrylaurel, while maintaining its desirable ornamental features. In attempt to narrow the gap in ploidy level between these two species, the chromosome number of P. lusitanica was doubled using colchicine and oryzalin, and differences in cytotypes were observed. This was performed with the hope of performing interspecific hybridization and introgression of shothole disease resistance in to P. laurocerasus. The most effective method was found to be oryzalin at a rate of 125 μM, and induced polyploids were shorter, had thicker leaves, and larger but fewer stomata. Preliminary research was performed to germinate immature P. lusitanica seed, in vitro, to develop a putative embryo rescue medium for use in this interspecific hybridization. The most significant factor in the media for successful germination was sucrose, with 30 g·L⁻¹ of sucrose media germinating significantly more seed than 60 g·L⁻¹. Also, germination only occurred at 12 weeks after pollination, with no germination at 6 and 9 weeks regardless of cold-stratification. Existing <b>chromosome</b> <b>doubled</b> cytotypes of P. laurocerasus were compared to the standard ploidy cytotype. Differences in vegetative propagation were observed and reported in the Schipkaensis cultivar. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>doubled</b> P. laurocerasus ‘Schipkaensis’ rooted at an equivalent percentage, had equivalently long roots, and had fewer roots per cutting. Deceased number of roots produced no apparent detrimental effects in propagation success. In cytotypes of the Otto Luyken cultivar, numerous morphological and physiological were made. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>double</b> forms were generally shorter, smaller in width and conical volume, and had larger but fewer stomata.

5|$|Asplenium bradleyi, {{commonly}} known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently {{throughout much of the}} Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A.bradleyi originated when that sterile diploid hybrid underwent <b>chromosome</b> <b>doubling</b> to become a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent doublings of sterile diploid hybrids. A.bradleyi can also form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, he {{reported}} preliminary cytological {{studies on the}} Aspleniums and suggested that A.montanum had crossed with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) to yield Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), noting that D.

5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (<b>chromosome</b> <b>doubling),</b> and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis.|$|E

5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, <b>chromosome</b> <b>doubling</b> within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by <b>chromosome</b> <b>doubling,</b> is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi.

In reviewing the characteristics of the species in 1982, Wagner and his collaborators noted that as a hybrid, the name of the species was more correctly written Asplenium×ebenoides, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. However, they preferred to use Wherry's combination of ×Asplenosorus ebenoides. (A change in the ICBN in 1972 rendered a Latin diagnosis for ×Asplenosorus unnecessary.)
