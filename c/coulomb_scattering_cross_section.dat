This {{was due to the}} <b>coulomb</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> being larger than the fusion cross section. [...] In response they built POPS, a machine with a wire cage, where ions are moving at steady-state, or oscillating around. Such plasma can be at local thermodynamic equilibrium. [...] The ion oscillation is predicted to maintain the equilibrium distribution of the ions at all times, which would eliminate any power loss due to Coulomb scattering, resulting in a net energy gain. Working off this design, researchers in Russia simulated the POPS design using Particle-in-cell code in 2009. This reactor concept becomes increasingly efficient as the size of the device shrinks. However, very high transparencies (>99.999%) are required for successful operation of the POPS concept. To this end S. Krupakar Murali et al., suggested that carbon nanotubes can be used to construct the cathode grids. This is also the first (suggested) application of carbon nanotubes directly in any fusion reactor.|$|E
40|$|Exciton-polaritons are quasiparticles {{consisting}} of a linear superposition of photonic and excitonic states, offering potential for nonlinear optical devices. The excitonic component of the polariton provides a finite <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> such that {{the different types of}} exciton found in organic materials (Frenkel) and inorganic materials (Wannier-Mott) produce polaritons with different interparticle interaction strength. A hybrid polariton state with distinct excitons provides a potential technological route towards in situ control of nonlinear behaviour. Here we demonstrate a device in which hybrid polaritons are displayed at ambient temperatures, the excitonic component of which is part Frenkel and part Wannier-Mott, and in which the dominant exciton type can be switched with an applied voltage. The device consists of an open microcavity containing both organic dye and a monolayer of the transition metal dichalcogenide WS 2.

40|$|Calculations of the {{stopping}} {{power of a}} medium lead to divergent integrals in gravitational theory {{as they do in}} the analogous electromagnetic problem. In the em case, one introduces (normally in an arbitrary manner) the Debye length as a cutoff at large distances to remove the divergence. We show here that in the Newtonian gravitational analogue the distant cutoff problem is solved by including the self-gravity of the medium. Then the Jeans length appears naturally as a cutoff. Despite the different sign of the coupling constant from the case of the electric plasma, the same sort of theory works in both cases and removes the need of introducing ad hoc cutoffs from both of them. 1 Gravitational Stopping Power In calculating the total <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> one is normally faced at the end with an integral over all scattering angles.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the FAIR project, the PAX collaboration has proposed a research program based on polarized antiprotons. Polarized antiprotons are to be produced by spin-dependent attenuation on a polarized hydrogen target.
