The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic <b>card</b> <b>catalog,</b> derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E

Besides this bequest, the library received $10,000 {{for the purchase}} of books from his son, John Jacob Astor III, in February 1876. Alexander Hamilton (1816–1889) became president of the board of trustees. In 1876, a beginning was made on a public <b>card</b> <b>catalog.</b> For books purchased since 1866, there was until this time no public index of subjects other than the knowledge possessed by the librarians as to the books on the shelves.

40|$|Purpose. Interaction {{of search}} {{capabilities}} of electronic and traditional (<b>card)</b> <b>catalogs.</b> Subject: search capabilities of electronic and traditional (<b>card)</b> <b>catalogs</b> and their interaction. Goal: Creating efficient search system for library information services, updating {{and improving the}} information retrieval system. To reach this goal, following tasks are set: – to determine the possibility of parallel functioning of electronic and traditional <b>card</b> <b>catalogs,</b> and to reveal the interaction of their search capabilities by conducting a survey via questionnaire titled «Interaction of search capabilities of electronic and traditional (card) catalogs»; – {{to find out which}} search systems are preferred by users; – to estimate the actual condition of search capabilities of electronic and traditional (<b>card)</b> <b>catalogs</b> in the library. Methodology. On various stages of the survey the following methods were used: analysis and synthesis, comparison, generalization, primary sources search; sociological method (survey). These methods allowed determining, processing and ana lyzing the whole complex of available sources, which became an important factor of research objectivity. Finding. Survey results allowed us to analyze the dynamics of changes, new needs of the readers, and to make a decision regarding the quality improvement of information search services. Practical value. Creating a theoretical foundation for implementation of set tasks is the practical value of the acquired findings. Conclusions and results of the research can be used in university students’, postgraduates’ and professors’ information search activities. Certain results of the research are used and implemented in practice of the library of Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University, namely at workshops on the basics of information culture (using bibliographic reference unit, information search by key words, authors and titles via electronic catalogue). Guides for users were created. Duty bibliographer’s work on providing information search services for the users was improved. Results. Consequently, the experience of the library of Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University’s shows that both electronic and <b>card</b> <b>catalogs</b> may coexist, they complement each other, and facilitate providing quality services for the users, that’s why today the discontinuation of using <b>card</b> <b>catalogs</b> is untimely. Traditional catalogs will be used for a long time. The advantage of using electronic catalogue is availability of quick and efficient information search by any element of bibliographic entry, as well as possibilities for completing various users’ requests. Experience confirms that only in their unity electronic and <b>card</b> <b>catalogs</b> mutually complement each other, facilitating quality bibliographic reference services for the library users. Results of survey via questionnaire allowed to analyze the dynamics of changes in information search activities, new readers’ needs, and to make a decision regarding the quality improvement of information search services...|$|R

500|$|After Rejewski {{had worked}} out the {{military}} Enigma's logical structure, the Polish Cipher Bureau commissioned the AVA Radio Company, co-owned by Antoni Palluth, to build replicas ("doubles") of the Enigma to Rejewski's specifications. His method of decrypting Enigma messages exploited two weaknesses of the German operating procedures. It used what Rejewski called [...] "characteristics" [...] that were independent of the plugboard connections. This involved compiling a <b>card</b> <b>catalog</b> of certain features of the set of indicator settings.|$|E
500|$|After 1 October 1936, German {{procedure}} changed, and {{the number}} of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a <b>card</b> <b>catalog</b> had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plug connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's [...] "cyclometer", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations. Once the catalog was complete, the permutation could be looked up in the catalog, yielding the Enigma rotor settings for that day.|$|E
500|$|Herzig-Yoshinaga and her husband, John [...] "Jack" [...] Herzig, {{pored over}} {{mountains}} of {{documents from the}} War Relocation Authority, a task that [...] "was roughly equivalent to indexing all the information in a library, working from a <b>card</b> <b>catalog</b> that only gave a subject description by shelf, without giving individual book titles or authors." [...] Their efforts resulted in the discovery of evidence that the US Government perjured itself before the United States Supreme Court in the 1944 cases Korematsu v. United States, Hirabayashi v. United States, and Yasui v. United States which challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} relocation and incarceration. The government had presented falsified evidence to the Court, destroyed evidence, and had withheld other vital information. [...] This evidence provided the legal basis Japanese Americans needed to seek redress and reparations for their wartime imprisonment. The Herzigs' research was also valuable in their work with the National Coalition for Japanese American Redress (NCJAR), which filed a class-action lawsuit against the US Government on behalf of the incarcerees. The US Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff.|$|E

500|$|The T206 Honus Wagner {{baseball}} card {{depicts the}} Pittsburgh Pirates' Honus Wagner, a dead-ball era baseball player who {{is widely considered}} {{to be one of}} the best players of all time. The card was designed and issued by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its T206 series. Wagner refused to allow production of his baseball card to continue, either because he did not want children to buy cigarette packs to get his card, or because he wanted more compensation from the ATC. The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 50 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public (exact number unknown), as compared to the [...] "tens or hundreds of thousands" [...] of T206 cards, over three years in sixteen brands of cigarettes, for any other player. In 1933, the card was first listed at a price value of US$50 in Jefferson Burdick's The American <b>Card</b> <b>Catalog,</b> making it the most expensive baseball card in the world at the time.|$|E
500|$|A {{public library}} {{was founded by}} Edward S. Arnold in 1914 within the Briarcliff Community Center (also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Club"). The Community Center's building had been built as a Briarcliff Manor public school in 1898. In the library's early years, {{it did not have}} a librarian or regular library hours. The library was significantly affected by World War I, as all volunteer efforts were refocused to aid the country's war effort. By 1921, the library was described as [...] "practically moribund" [...] though progress resumed in 1921 largely due to the efforts of Amy Bookwalter, who in that year became the first president of the library. Bookwalter was credited with reopening the library and officially establishing it as the Briarcliff Free Library on March 8, 1921. She was largely unassisted in these efforts. On September 1, 1922, the Club's library funds were transferred to the Library Committee of the Briarcliff Free Library. The library was registered with the New York state library system on September 22 of that year and an eight-member board of trustees was appointed. A paid part-time librarian alongside volunteers operated the circulation desk and created the library's <b>card</b> <b>catalog.</b> (Until 1955, there was only one paid librarian among a staff of volunteers.) ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa the Greek" [...] {{references}} {{both the}} Super Bowl and the National Football League (NFL). The episode aired {{only a few}} days before Super Bowl XXVI, and correctly predicted that the Washington Redskins would win the game. When a repeat of the episode re-aired the following year only days before Super Bowl XXVII, the staff redubbed the episode to mention the Dallas Cowboys instead of the Washington Redskins. The Cowboys won, making the episode accurate once again. It has continued to be accurate in later years when it has been redubbed (the last redubbing came on the week before Super Bowl XXIX to reflect an all-California Super Bowl, with the San Francisco 49ers in place of the Redskins and the San Diego Chargers in place of the Buffalo Bills), and Jean commented that he would always bet against Lisa's predictions, causing him to think [...] "Why didn't I take Lisa's advice?" [...] when he lost. As Lisa studies football at the Springfield library, she goes through the <b>card</b> <b>catalog</b> and finds an entry on Phyllis George, an American sportscaster.

2500|$|The card catalogs {{presented}} {{a problem of}} greater complexity. The 1876 <b>card</b> <b>catalog</b> begun by Brevoort recorded {{a part of the}} accessions received after 1866. There was one set of cards {{for the use of the}} public, and another duplicate set for official use. This was at first mainly a subject or rather a broadly grouped classed catalog. The cards were about 5 inches long by [...] high. For author entries reliance was made upon the interleaved copies of the Cogswell printed catalog and upon a set of author cards — by no means a complete record — for public use. In 1880 when work began upon the new printed catalog this <b>card</b> <b>catalog</b> was closed; its author cards were destroyed when the new catalog was issued, but revision of the subject group continued as occasion offered until after the 1895 consolidation. After 1880, three card catalogs continued until the 1895 consolidation: (1) an official “Bulletin,” on large cards, for works acquired after 1880, mainly an author arrangement; (2) the public “small card” catalog, a dictionary catalog of authors and subjects; (3) the official “small card” catalog, likewise a dictionary arrangement of authors and subjects, but written on thinner cards. [...] The public catalog was severely criticized in the public press for various idiosyncrasies, example articles being “A Library's Buried Treasures” in The New York Times of June 8, 1881, and in September 1881 a critical letter submitted to the Boston Transcript over the signature of “Delta.” The second article was reprinted in the Library Journal of September–October 1881 (pp.259–261, with editorial comment on pp.255–256).|$|E
