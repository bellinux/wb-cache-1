5000|$|<b>Chiropractors</b> {{historically}} {{were strongly}} opposed to vaccination {{based on their}} belief that all diseases were traceable to causes in the spine, and therefore could not be affected by vaccines. Some <b>chiropractors</b> continue to be opposed to vaccination. [...] Early opposition to water fluoridation included <b>chiropractors</b> in the U.S. Some <b>chiropractors</b> opposed water fluoridation as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct an {{international}} survey of the perceived optimal level of anatomy teaching from anatomy academics and practicing <b>chiropractors.</b> We hypothesized that the optimum level of anatomical understanding for chiropractic students does not differ between the anatomists teaching the students and practicing <b>chiropractors.</b> Methods The opinion of anatomists teaching in a chiropractic course (n = 16) was compared to practicing <b>chiropractors</b> (n = 589). The students' level of understanding was based on the revised Bloom's taxonomy for 16 different curriculum areas. Anatomists were recruited by contacting the accredited chiropractic courses worldwide. Snowball sampling was used for the practicing <b>chiropractors.</b> Independent-samples Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the results of anatomists and <b>chiropractors.</b> Results Opinions differed between anatomists and <b>chiropractors</b> on 9 out of the 16 questions. Where opinions differed, <b>chiropractors</b> recommended a higher standard of anatomical knowledge. The level suggested by <b>chiropractors</b> for these curriculum areas is equal to the “evaluating” level where chiropractic students can remember, understand, apply, and analyze anatomical knowledge to be able to justify a clinical decision. Conclusion Compared to anatomists working in chiropractic programs, <b>chiropractors</b> suggest a higher standard of anatomy be taught to undergraduates. Collaboration between <b>chiropractors</b> and anatomists would likely be beneficial in creating or modifying anatomy curricula for chiropractic students...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Chiropractors</b> {{claim to}} {{emphasize}} the conservative management of the neuromusculoskeletal system {{without the use of}} medicines or surgery, with special emphasis on the spine. <b>Chiropractors</b> focus on back and neck pain as specialties, but many <b>chiropractors</b> treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues. There is a range of opinions among chiropractors: some believed that treatment should be confined to the spine, or back and neck pain; others disagreed. One 2009 survey of American <b>chiropractors</b> found that 73% classified themselves as [...] "back pain/musculoskeletal specialists", but the label [...] "back and neck pain specialists" [...] was regarded by 47% of them as a least desirable description in a 2005 international survey. Among <b>chiropractors,</b> there is no agreement about how to define the profession: although some <b>chiropractors</b> consider themselves to have attributes of primary care providers, chiropractic is also viewed more of a medical specialty like dentistry or podiatry. It has been proposed that <b>chiropractors</b> specialize in nonsurgical spine care, instead of attempting to also treat other problems, but the more expansive view of chiropractic is still widespread.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In the United States (US) a {{shortage}} of primary care physicians has become evident. Other health care providers such as <b>chiropractors</b> might help {{address some of the}} nation’s primary care needs simply by being located in areas of lesser primary care resources. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the distribution of the chiropractic workforce across the country and compare it to that of primary care physicians. Methods We used nationally representative data to estimate the per 100, 000 capita supply of <b>chiropractors</b> and primary care physicians according to the 306 predefined Hospital Referral Regions. Multiple variable Poisson regression was used to examine the influence of population characteristics on the supply of both practitioner-types. Results According to these data, there are 74, 623 US <b>chiropractors</b> and the per capita supply of <b>chiropractors</b> varies more than 10 -fold across the nation. <b>Chiropractors</b> practice in areas with greater supply of primary care physicians (Pearson’s correlation 0. 17, p-value[*] Conclusion These findings suggest that <b>chiropractors</b> practice in areas of greater primary care physician supply. Therefore <b>chiropractors</b> may be functioning in more complementary roles to primary care as opposed to an alternative point of access. </p...|$|R

The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the perceptions of Mississippi Delta Region <b>chiropractors</b> regarding their role in obesity management as nonmedical practitioners that implement public health objectives in their practice. The research questions aimed at addressing possible barriers and limitations that influenced <b>chiropractors</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding their role in obesity prevention. The health promotion model which recognizes the vital role of the practitioner to the patient relationship in health outcomes, guided this study. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit 11 eligible board-certified <b>chiropractors</b> in the Mississippi Delta. The participants encountered a 1 -time session with open-ended interview questions influenced by the hermeneutic tradition. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicated that <b>chiropractors</b> could treat obese patients and provide some services that are mostly provided and billed by other health care practitioners. <b>Chiropractors,</b> however, encounter legislative and insurance challenges. Outreach programs and collaboration with other health care practitioners would improve <b>chiropractors</b> 2 ̆ 7 role in obesity management. The study can contribute to social change by increasing understanding of the chiropractic profession and how they may offer health promotion services to improve patient management of obesity and obesity-related illnesses...|$|R
