Thus, both processes are simultaneously found in many pathological conditions. Therefore, the failure of antioxidant trials might result from failure to select appropriate agents that specifically target both inflammation and oxidative stress or failure to use both antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents simultaneously or use of nonselective agents that block some of the oxidative and/or inflammatory pathways but exaggerate the others.

However, pharmacological standardization and clinical evaluation {{on the effect of}} honey are essential before using honey as a preventive and <b>curative</b> <b>measure</b> to common diseases related to the tested bacterial species. This bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity was different by sites of collection and colour of the honeys. Honey from Samre area showed relatively better bacteriostatic and antibacterial activity than Temben and Atsbi districts. This could be due to the variations in hydrogen peroxide, crops and vegetation’s in these districts available for honeybees to make honey. Both control and test K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were inhibited at relatively higher concentration of honey than the other bacteria in this study. This might be related to nature of the bacteria i.e. low permeability of cell wall, genetic capacity to express resistant mechanisms and mutation in chromosomal genes which regulate resistance genes. Red honeys in this study showed better anti bacterial activity against both control and test bacteria than the white honeys.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cancer is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} deadliest diseases in the medical field. Apart from the preventive therapies, it is important to find a <b>curative</b> <b>measure</b> which holds no loopholes and acts accurately and precisely to curb cancer. Over the past few decades, there have been advances in this field and there are many antitumor compounds available on the market, which are of natural as well as synthetic origin. Marine chemotherapy is well recognized nowadays and profound development has been achieved by researchers to deal with different molecular pathways of tumors. However, the marine environment has been less explored for the production of safe and novel antitumor compounds. The reason is a number of shortfalls in this field. Though ample reviews cover the importance and applications of various anticancerous compounds from marine natural products, in the present review, we have tried to bring the current status of antitumor research based on marine inhibitors of cancer signaling pathways. In addition, focus has been placed on the shortfalls and probable strategies in the arena of marine antitumor drug discovery...|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{summarize}} {{available evidence}} {{on the role of}} host genetics in the susceptibility to congenital and childhood cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections by conducting a systematic review of published studies. Methods We searched online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and HuGe Navigator) for relevant studies with well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessed the risk of bias using novel Confounding-Selection- Information bias score (CSI). Results 5105 studies were initially identified, but only 5 met all the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. Polymorphisms of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and mannose- binding lectin (MBL) genes were shown {{to have an impact on}} the CMV infection in infants. Polymorphisms of the TLR 2 (rs 3804100, rs 1898830), TLR 4 (rs 4986791), and TLR 9 (rs 352140) were shown to have a role in congenital CMV infection. Low MBL levels were associated with CMV infection in Chinese individuals, a finding that was not replicated in Caucasians. The overall credibility of evidence was weak. Conclusions Based on currently available very limited amount of evidence, it is uncertain whether congenital and childhood CMV infections are under host genetic control. Additional primary studies are needed with more specific research hypotheses that will enable gradual understanding of specific mechanisms of the CMV pathogenesis. More genetic studies in the future will facilitate better understanding of host susceptibility and likely enable novel preventative and <b>curative</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|E
40|$|Conflict {{management}} typically follows one {{of these}} two methods: prevention of conflicts and resolution of on-going conflicts. As a <b>curative</b> <b>measure</b> usually taken with some strategies in communication, the second method is often used in a cross-cultural project management setting where team members are susceptible to misunderstanding. To sustain conflict-free team leadership, however, communication remedies alone are not effective; considerations of socio-emotional and cultural contexts and flexibility of leadership style have to be made as part of the strategy. This paper outlines a proactive and eclectic approach to conflict prevention (rather than cure) in a predominantly high-context culture setting using a qualitative method that has been developed through a survey of three giant companies in China. From the present observational evidence, Project Managers (PMs) from low-context cultures need to build a geocentric mindset and adapt to the Chinese ‘guanxi ’ system, whereas those from high-context cultures should be flexible in their use of leadership styles as demanded by situations; they also need to clearly articulate communication norms before being engaged in strategic planning and execution. Besides meeting these requirements, PMs of both cultures ought to develop and use positive emotional intelligence (EI) and create a vibrant support system for team culture in order to promote team members ’ synergy and efforts in reaching project deadlines and producing fruitful deliverables...|$|E

We investigated the efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus 1 % cream in Zoon’s vulvitis and balanitis unresponsive to conservative topical therapy with a follow-up period of 18 months. Eleven patients (four woman and seven uncircumcised men) aged between 45 and 78 years with histologically proven Zoon’s vulvitis or balanitis, were treated for 16 weeks twice daily with pimecrolimus 1 % cream in an observational study. Clinical examination and recording of patients symptoms was performed before, after four and eight weeks, and after three and four months of therapy, respectively.

40|$|Eutrophication is {{considered}} the most important water quality problem in freshwaters and coastal waters worldwide promoting frequent occurrence of blooms of potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Removal of cyanobacteria from the water column {{using a combination of}} coagulant and ballast is a promising technique for mitigation and an alternative to the use of algaecides. In laboratory, we tested experimentally the efficiency of two coagulants, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and chitosan (made of shrimp shells), alone and combined with two ballasts: red soil (RS) and the own lagoon sediment, to remove natural populations of cyanobacteria, from an urban brackish coastal lagoon. PAC was a very effective coagulant when applied at low doses (≤ 8  mg Al L− 1) and settled the cyanobacteria, while at high doses (≥ 16  mg Al L− 1) large flocks aggregated in the top of test tubes. In contrast, chitosan was not able to form flocks, even in high doses (> 16  mg L− 1) and did not efficiently settle down cyanobacteria when combined with ballast. The RS itself removed 33 [...] 47  % of the cyanobacteria. This removal was strongly enhanced when combined with PAC in a dose-dependent matter; 8  mg Al L− 1 was considered the best dose to be applied. The lagoon sediment alone did not promote any settling of cyanobacteria but removal was high when combined with PAC. Combined coagulant and ballast seems a very efficient, cheap, fast and safe <b>curative</b> <b>measure</b> to lessen the harmful cyanobacteria bloom nuisance in periods when particularly needed, such as around the 2016 Olympics in Jacarepaguá Lagoon...|$|E

The absence or deficiency of the LAL enzyme gives rise to pathological accumulation of cholesterol esters in various tissues. A severe LAL-D phenotype manifesting in infancy is associated with adrenal calcification and liver and gastrointestinal involvement with characteristic early mortality. LAL-D presenting in childhood and adulthood is associated with hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and premature atherosclerosis. There are currently no curative pharmacological treatments for this life-threatening condition. Supportive management with lipid-modifying agents does not ameliorate disease progression. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a <b>curative</b> <b>measure</b> in infantile disease has mixed success and is associated with inherent risks and complications. Sebelipase alfa (Kanuma) is a recombinant human LAL protein and the first enzyme replacement therapy {{for the treatment of}} LAL-D.

40|$|The peachtree borer, Synanthedon exitiosa (Say 1823), {{is a major}} pest {{of stone}} fruit trees in North America. Current {{management}} relies upon preventative control using broad-spectrum chemical insecticides, primarily chlorpyrifos, applied {{in the late summer}} or early fall. However, due to missed applications, poor application timing, or other factors, high levels of S. exitiosa infestation may still occur and persist through the following spring. Curative treatments applied in the spring to established infestations would limit damage to the tree and prevent the next generation of S. exitiosa from emerging within the orchard. However, such curative measures for control of S. exitiosa do not exist. Our objective was to measure the efficacy of the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae, as a curative control for existing infestations of S. exitiosa. In peach orchards, spring applications of S. carpocapsae (obtained from a commercial source) were made to infested trees and compared with chlorpyrifos and a water-only control in 2014 and 2015. Additionally, types of spray equipment were compared: nematodes were applied via boom sprayer, handgun, or trunk sprayer. To control for effects of application method or nematode source, in vivo laboratory-grown S. carpocapsae, applied using a watering can, was also included. Treatment effects were assessed 39 d (2014) or 19 d (2015) later by measuring percentage of trees still infested, and also number of surviving S. exitiosa larvae per tree. Results indicated that S. carpocapsae provided significant curative control (e. g.,. 80 % corrected control for the handgun application). In contrast, chlorpyrifos failed to reduce S. exitiosa infestations or number of surviving larvae. In most comparisons, no effect of nematode application method was detected; in one assessment, only the handgun and watering can methods reduced infestation. In conclusion, our study indicates that S. carpocapsae may be used as an effective <b>curative</b> <b>measure</b> for S. exitiosa infestations...|$|E
