5000|$|Prussian blue {{is widely}} used by tool makers when the core and <b>cavity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> is matched during final assembly. It is also used in other tooling applications—especially during assembly—such as {{stamping}} tools and pressure die casting tools. A thin coating of Prussian blue is applied (usually with a paint brush) on the [...] "insert"—regardless of the shape or contour—of the mould or tool before the matching is done with the mating part. If the Prussian blue (generally called as just [...] "blue") appears evenly on the mating area, it is considered—by the tool makers—as [...] "good matching" [...] and thus expecting a good final product from the tool. Usually no tool would be transferred to testing or production without [...] "blue matching", a term generally used by the tool makers in Asia. In other words, Prussian blue is considered {{as an integral part}} of precision tool making.|$|E
500|$|The {{amount of}} resin {{required}} {{to fill the}} sprue, runner and <b>cavities</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> comprises <b>a</b> [...] "shot". Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that are ground into the parting line of the mould, or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped air {{is not allowed to}} escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming material and squeezed into the corners <b>of</b> the <b>cavity,</b> where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects. The air can even become so compressed that it ignites and burns the surrounding plastic material.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{discusses}} the experimental work {{carried out to}} investigate the performance of coated carbidetool in ultra-precision machining of stainless steel and evaluates whether this tool {{can be used to}} fabricate a cavitywith high form accuracy and surface finish on <b>a</b> stainless steel <b>mould</b> insert. Design/methodology/approach: The results obtained in the turning process and the machining <b>of</b> <b>cavity</b> ona mould insert under various conditions and parameters are examined. Findings: The experimental results obtained in the turning tests gave <b>an</b> important insight <b>of</b> the appropriateparameters and the condition {{to be used in the}} machining <b>of</b> <b>cavity</b> on <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> insert. The cavity machined on thestainless steel mould insert with the coated carbide tool in the presence of natural oil has superior form accuracyand surface finish. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed to investigate the performance of the coatedcarbide tools in machining profiles of other shape and diameter. Practical implications: Profile with a superior form accuracy and surface finish can be machined on <b>a</b> stainlesssteel <b>mould</b> insert using <b>a</b> coated carbide tool instead <b>of</b> using <b>a</b> PCBN tool, a much more expensive tool. Originality/value: The paper presents original information on the ultra-precision machining of tool steels at lowspeeds. The paper is of interest to manufacturing engineers...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{procedure}} of conventional cost {{calculation of the}} plastic injection moulds are programmed via Delphi programming modules. In the calculation, the mass properties of the designed part are directly obtained from AutoCAD program and, the machining periods of the mould parts are interactively estimated by using MasterCAM package. Both the data from MasterCAM and the mass properties from AutoCAD are transferred to the Delphi programming domain to calculate the mould cost. Consequently, the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plastic injection <b>mould,</b> the manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> and the cost calculation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> are evaluated in one programming procedure.
