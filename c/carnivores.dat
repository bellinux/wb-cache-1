5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene <b>carnivores</b> compared with living <b>carnivores</b> was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between <b>carnivores</b> increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large <b>carnivores</b> from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth {{breakage}} rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern <b>carnivores.</b> The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene <b>carnivores</b> compared with living <b>carnivores</b> was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between <b>carnivores</b> increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene <b>carnivores,</b> except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E

30|$|The {{preceding}} {{outline of}} the Norwegian <b>carnivore</b> governance comprises the backdrop for the <b>Carnivore</b> Agreement (2011), which supports the “two-fold objective” consisting of ensuring sustainable <b>carnivore</b> populations while simultaneously sustaining active and viable pastoral communities. This two-fold objective has been the basic principle {{in each of the}} three White papers regarding <b>carnivore</b> governance (St.meld.nr. 27 (1991 – 92), St.meld.nr. 35 (1996 – 97) and St.meld.nr. 15 (2003 – 2004)) and is also the main principle of Norway’s <b>carnivore</b> governance (Fangel and Gundersen 2012).|$|R

25|$|In 1979, Steele {{formed the}} heavy metal band Fallout. In 1982, after the split of Fallout, Steele formed the thrash metal band <b>Carnivore.</b> With <b>Carnivore,</b> Steele's lyrics were often harsh, dealing with religion, war, race and misogyny. <b>Carnivore</b> {{released}} their debut self-titled album in 1985. In 1986, Steele wrote lyrics for several songs on hardcore punk band Agnostic Front's second album Cause for Alarm. In 1987, <b>Carnivore</b> released Retaliation, before splitting up later that year.|$|R

5|$|Some {{physiological}} <b>carnivores</b> consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as <b>carnivores</b> and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate <b>carnivores,</b> occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E

A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric <b>carnivores</b> did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E

40|$|On July 11, 2000, the FBI intorduced <b>Carnivore,</b> an Internet {{monitoring}} system. It was designed, {{and is used}} exclusively, {{to carry}} out court-ordered surveillance of electronic communications. It is a tangible, portable device, tantamount to a phone tap, that allows the FBI to intercept and collect criminal suspects 2 ̆ 7 e-mail without their knowledge or consent. This Note addresses competing and parallel interests {{between the government and}} society to determine the legitimacy and necessity of <b>Carnivore.</b> The purpose of this Note is twofold: first, to demonstrate the need for <b>Carnivore</b> to enable law enforcement to keep up with criminals who utilize cyberspace to communicate criminal plans; and second, to dispel privacy concerns associated with the system by allaying misconceptions and fears related to its implementation and usage. Part II of this Note addresses the catalyzing reasons for <b>Carnivore</b> 2 ̆ 7 s design and use.

5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large <b>carnivores</b> who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier <b>carnivores</b> such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other <b>carnivores,</b> such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} a study of dental microwear on tooth enamel for {{specimens}} of the carnivore species from LaBrea pits, including dire wolves, suggest that these <b>carnivores</b> were not food-stressed just before their extinction. The evidence also indicated that the extent of carcass utilization (i.e., amount consumed relative to the maximum amount possible to consume, including breakup and consumption of bones) was less than among large <b>carnivores</b> today. These finding indicates that tooth breakage was related to hunting behavior {{and the size of}} prey.|$|E

5000|$|Dmitri Garnitsky {{is on the}} hitlist of a {{professional}} assassin, the <b>Carnivore,</b> who {{has a reputation for}} never failing. After being tipped off, Dmitri leaves his home, but he is met by the <b>Carnivore,</b> and later Oleg Olenkov, the man who hired the <b>Carnivore.</b> The <b>Carnivore</b> is angered by Olenkov's demands and shoots him in the chest, leaving Dmitri unharmed. Many years later, Olenkov catches up with the <b>Carnivore's</b> daughter, Liz Sansborough, a psychologist. Masquerading as [...] "Arkady Albam", Olenkov befriends Sansborough, lures her to his apartment, and tells her a false story of how he got shot. He ultimately reveals himself to be Olenkov, and moments later Dmitri enters the apartment, shocked that his attempted killer is there. The three of them engage in a violent struggle, resulting in one of their being rendered unconscious and harmless.|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} landscape-scale taphonomic signal of <b>carnivore</b> {{modification}} to the surficial bone assemblage in Amboseli Park, Kenya {{as it was}} in 1975 and 2002 - 2004. Change in predator abundances over time provides a means of assessing the taphonomic signal of carnivore-mediated bone consumption and destruction under differing ecological conditions and varying levels of conspecific competition for resources. The landscape assemblage indicates taxonomic variation in the patterning of <b>carnivore</b> modification to ungulates of different size classes as well as within equivalent size classes. Analyses of long bone elements indicate that the differential destruction of limb ends and the strength of the correlation between limb end abundance and bone mineral density provide an indication of the intensity of <b>carnivore</b> modification to a faunal assemblage. The ability to infer levels of <b>carnivore</b> modification based on limb elements can provide faunal analysts with the tools to determine whether the taphonomic signals in the fossil record relate to <b>carnivore</b> modification, hominin transport of appendicular elements, or both...|$|R
