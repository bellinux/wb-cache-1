2500|$|When he left OEO in December 1970, Nixon named Rumsfeld Counselor to the President, {{a general}} {{advisory}} position; in this role, he retained Cabinet status. He {{was given an}} office in the West Wing in 1969 and regularly interacted with the Nixon administration hierarchy. He was named Director of the Economic Stabilization Program in 1970 as well, and later headed up the Cost of Living Council. In March 1971 Nixon was recorded saying about Rumsfeld [...] "at least Rummy is tough enough" [...] and [...] "He's a ruthless little bastard. You <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Art vs. Reality: [...] The players help {{demonstrate}} {{the conflict between}} art and reality. The world in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern live lacks order. However, art allows people that live in this world. As the Player says, [...] "There's a design at work in all art." [...] Art and the real world are in conflict. In order {{to reach out to}} the only reality he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of,</b> Guildenstern exclaims, [...] "No one gets up after death-there is no applause-there is only silence and some second-hand clothes, and that's death." [...] Stoppard also uses his characters to comment on the believability of theatre. While Guildenstern criticises the Player for his portrayal of death, he believes the Player's performance when Guildenstern thinks he has stabbed him with a knife. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern believe exactly what the actors want them to believe.|$|E
5000|$|Epistemological solipsism is {{the view}} that one <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> the {{existence}} of ones mind. The existence of other minds and the external world is not necessarily rejected but one <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> its existence ...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "joke" [...] {{was evidently}} {{already in the}} {{mainstream}} by the very early 1970s; in the October 1972 edition of MAD magazine (issue no. 154), an article entitled [...] "When Watching Television, You <b>Can</b> <b>be</b> <b>Sure</b> <b>of</b> Seeing...", gossip columnist 'Rona Boring' states: [...] "And there isn't a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! I repeat, they are not married! They are not even going steady!" [...] Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor and as a result, Hudson and Nabors never spoke to each other again. Three years later, Nabors would begin a long-term (and, until 2013, secret) relationship with Stan Cadwallader, a retired firefighter from Honolulu and the man he would eventually marry once same-sex marriage was legalized.|$|E

[...] she added, suddenly, seeing with a woman's instinctive quickness of {{penetration}} the danger of totally renouncing her personal influence over him. [...] "Wait till we meet, and tell me with your own lips what you think." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "How <b>can</b> I <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> this?" [...] Zechariah {{asked the}} angel. [...] "For I am {{an old man}} and my wife is {{advanced}} in years." ...|$|R
