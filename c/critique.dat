5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to <b>critique</b> the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The <b>critique</b> began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} <b>critique</b> of {{capitalism}} and discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit <b>critique</b> of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal).

5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the <b>Critique</b> of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conversational {{recommender}} systems allow {{users to}} learn and adapt their preferences according to concrete examples. <b>Critiquing</b> systems support such a conversational interaction style. Especially unit <b>critiques</b> offer a low cost feedback strategy for users {{in terms of the}} needed cognitive effort. In this paper we present an extension of the experience-based unit <b>critiquing</b> algorithm. The development of our new approach, which we call nearest neighbor compatibility <b>critiquing,</b> was aimed at increasing the efficiency of unit <b>critiquing.</b> We combine our new approach with existing <b>critiquing</b> strategies to ensemble-based variations and present the results of an empirical study that aimed at comparing the recommendation efficiency (in {{terms of the number of}} <b>critiquing</b> cycles) of ensemble-based solutions with individual <b>critiquing</b> algorithms...|$|R

5|$|Immanuel Kant's <b>Critique</b> of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind.

40|$|Abstract: Critics {{have raised}} {{concerns}} about health behaviour change programs in the global South. However, there has been very little reflection about what those <b>critiques</b> are critical of and, in particular, what psychology has come to mean within those <b>critiques.</b> The aim {{of this paper was}} threefold: to describe existing <b>critiques</b> of behaviour change programs, to reflect on how psychology has been written into those <b>critiques,</b> and to determine what theoretical resources <b>critiques</b> overlook. The paper identifies four types of <b>critiques</b> (efficacy, sociological, ethical and governance), argues that <b>critiques</b> tend be psychologized and miss important insights from resources related to discourse, gender, knowledge production and resistance. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate further debate about the role of psychology in behaviour change interventions in the global South...|$|R

40|$|<b>Critiquing</b> is an {{important}} form of feedback in conver-sational recommender systems. However, in these sys-tems the user is usually limited to <b>critiquing</b> a single product feature at a time.

In this paper we bring together the main flavors of dynamic <b>critiquing</b> and per-form a large-scale comparative evaluation as part of an extensive real-user trial.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} to critiquing-based conversational recommendation, which we call History-Aware <b>Critiquing</b> (HAC).

It selects relevant recommendation sessions from a case base that contains the successful recommendation sessions of past users. A past recommendation session can be selected if it contains similar recommended items to the ones in the current session and its <b>critiques</b> sufficiently overlap with the <b>critiques</b> so far in the current session. HAC extends experiencebased <b>critiquing</b> (EBC).

40|$|Abstract. Conversational {{recommender}} systems help {{to guide}} users through a product-space towards a particular product that meets their specific requirements. During {{the course of}} a ‚Äúconversation ‚Äù with the user the recommender system will suggest certain products and use feedback from the user to refine future suggestions. <b>Critiquing</b> {{has proven to be a}} powerful and popular form of feedback. <b>Critiques</b> allow the user to express a preference over part of the feature-space; for example, in a va-cation/travel recommender a user might indicate that they are looking for a ‚Äúless expensive ‚Äù vacation than the one suggested, thereby <b>critiquing</b> the price feature. Usually the set of <b>critiques</b> that the user can chose from is fixed as part of the basic recommender interface. In this paper we will propose a more dynamic <b>critiquing</b> approach where high-quality <b>critiques</b> are automatically generated during each recommendation cycle from the remaining product-cases. We show that these dynamic <b>critiques</b> can lead to more efficient recommendation performance by helping the user to more rapidly focus in on the right region of the product-space. ...|$|R
