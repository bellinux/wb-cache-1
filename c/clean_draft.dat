Based on the <b>clean</b> <b>draft</b> of the song, Heylin {{believes}} that Dylan {{did not need to}} struggle as much writing this song as he did with [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "Chimes of Freedom", which were written a short time earlier. In the draft, eight of the song's nine verses are complete and only two lines were revised for the final version. The final verse in the draft is incomplete, consisting of just two lines: ...|$|E

Phase 6 of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP 6) will be organised through a collection of endorsed model inter-comparison projects (MIPs) with focussed scientific objectives. Co-ordinating teams submit proposals for experiments and data analysis to the CMIP panel. Final proposals from 23 “Model Inter-comparison Projects” proposing analysis, 19 of them proposing a total of 195 different experiments, {{in addition to a}} core set of “DECK” experiments and the CMIP 6 Historical Simulation defined by the CMIP panel, have been distributed to modelling groups. Endorsement of proposals will depend on the level of support, in the form of commitments to participate; ● As part of the MIP proposals, data request templates have been filled out by each group; this information will be consolidated and circulated to modelling groups April 15 th; ● Modelling groups asked to provide commitments to the CMIP panel by April 22 nd; ● A <b>clean</b> <b>draft</b> of the CMIP 6 Data Request will be published at the end of July 2015; ● Version 1 CMIP 6 Data Request approved at WGCM meeting (31 October 2015) ...|$|E

On June 9, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejects Patrick Morrisey's {{challenge to}} <b>draft</b> <b>Clean</b> Power Plan rule as being premature, because the rule was a draft rule, not a final rule, {{and not yet}} published in the Federal register.

The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are <b>clean,</b> and <b>draft</b> angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. The downside is that this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|R

Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and support system to compose War and Peace and Anna Karenina with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and handwriting his epic works time after time. Tolstoy would continue editing War & Peace and had to have <b>clean</b> final <b>drafts</b> to be delivered to the publisher ...|$|R

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{hot forging}} process involves feeding mill-length steel bars (typically 7 m or 24 ft long) into {{one end of}} the machine at room temperature and hot forged products emerge from the other end. This all occurs very quickly; small parts can be made at a rate of 180 parts per minute (ppm) and larger can be made at a rate of 90 ppm. The parts can be solid or hollow, round or symmetrical, up to 6 kg (12 lbs), and up to 18 cm (7 in.) in diameter. The main advantages to this process are its high output rate and ability to accept low cost materials. Little labor is required to operate the machinery. There is no flash produced so material savings are between 20 - 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent 1050 °C (1900 °F) so air cooling will result in a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±0.3 mm (±0.012 in.), surfaces are <b>clean,</b> and <b>draft</b> angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 6/100 of a second.|$|R
50|$|World of Speed offers both a solo-player based and a team-based gameplay, {{in which}} two teams vie for control of real world {{circuits}} and street locations in London, Moscow and Monaco to start. The game features a free for all format with destructible open environments and no rules. Players create or join clubs with others and compete in two versus two or four versus four battles to accomplish the maximum point value and conquer the area. In World of Speed, players earn rewards for successfully completing challenges including <b>clean</b> turns and <b>drafting</b> other cars, in addition to finishing first. These rewards can later be used to upgrade cars and become more competitive in the next event. The game requires offensive and defensive tactics, as each player can track the challenges of rival vehicles and may slam into them to prevent their success.|$|R
