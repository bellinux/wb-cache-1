40|$|The {{legitimacy}} of the judiciary hinges on the presumption that truth can be found through the judicial process. Even though a distinction can be made between "truth" in a legal sense and "real truth", the legal truth can only be justified by its anchorage in "real truth".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore what objects that can be seized and how the {{management}} of a seizure should be conducted. Ability to take enforcement against an individual should be carefully weighed against the rights and freedoms that exist. Seizure is one of the various restraints that exist, and the regulation on which they appear is mainly in the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judicial</b> <b>Procedure,</b> Chapter 27 th. To be able to apply coercive measures, it is fundamental prerequisite that a criminal investigation is initiated, but there exist some significant exceptions to this. There are also rules about who has the right to provide for the seizure, the decision can be taken by a prosecutor, an investigator, a police officer or, in special cases, the court. The purpose of a seizure is mainly to secure the subject of a criminal investigation, to secure objects that have been arrogated or to secure future forfeiture. Therefore it is only possible to seize objects that are relevant to a criminal investigation, and it is only movable property such as written documents or electronic objects that can be seized. Items that have been seized should be handled in accordance with the laws that exist. A protocol shall be established and supervision shall be exercised over the seizure and a seizure should end when it is no longer relevant to the criminal investigation. The regulation has recently changed and that created new improved opportunities, but despite that, the area is complex and constantly evolving technology makes it difficult...|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court’s most {{important}} task today is probably to, through their precedent, lead the legislative development forward {{and to ensure}} that the legislature and the standards that the legislature subsequently creates are compatible with the constitutional and EU law. In that sense, the Supreme Court also creates its own standards. Now and then the district courts, with the parties, in an action amenable to out-of-court settlement, identifies a point of law that has not been answered neither in the legislative history nor by court practice. In those cases, it could be favourable for the legal process if the parties had the option to ask the Supreme Court to answer the question, instead of going through the court hierarchy to get the matter resolved. This would favour all parties since both costs and time can be saved. Since July 1, 1989, this is a possibility. According to chapter 56 article 13 of the Swedish <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judicial</b> <b>Procedure,</b> a district court can, with the consent of the parties, submit a particular issue in the case for decision by the Supreme Court. The provision is discretionary, which means that it is the district court that determines if the rule should be applied. The issue in question must however be a precedent issue. In the end, it is the Supreme Court that has the final say and decides whether leave to appeal should be permitted or not. The purpose of the provisions origin was to strengthen the Supreme Court’s precedent-forming role without largely burdening the court’s workload. After the advent in 1989, only 37 cases have taken the leap to the Supreme Court which is probably far fewer than it was hoped for. The reason for this may be that the institute, {{despite the fact that the}} possibility soon has existed for 30 years, is still relatively unknown. Another reason may be that district courts are, and have been, reluctant to propose to use it, even when the possibility has arisen. Therefore, I believe that a first step to tackle the precedent drought that still exists could be to make the parties and their legal representatives more aware of the possibility, and also to encourage the district courts to, to a greater extent than today, take the initiative and propose the submitting to the Supreme Court. If this does not result in more” leap-cases”, another resort could be to also include arbitration in the regulation...|$|E

40|$|In Sweden an oral hearing, the trial, is held as {{the ideal}} model for the {{criminal}} procedure {{and according to the}} legality principle reported crimes ought to be investigated and prosecuted. Over time high levels of reported crimes have led to an increase in pressure on the courts and other actors in the criminal process. This pressure has created new ways of dealing with reported crimes in summary procedures and to exceptions from the legality principle. Such changes have given the prosecutor a key role in deciding how cases are dealt with in the criminal process.   The purpose of this thesis is to examine the Swedish public prosecutor’s influence on the choice of cases that are investigated, prosecuted and tried in court during a trial. The study examines the prosecutors’ legal authority and how that authority has changed from the time that the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judicial</b> <b>Procedure</b> came into force in 1948 to the beginning of 2011. A starting point for the examination is that investigating, prosecuting and trying cases in the criminal process should be carried out {{in a way that is}} considered to be fair according to societal values, which are embedded in the legal system. Both decisions about which cases will be tried and the procedure involved in how to try them has to be performed in a way that seems to be fair. In the study the values that underlie the criminal process is examined through a model. This model assumes that the criminal process has been created and developed to satisfy different requirements, which can be separated into three main groups: the functions of the criminal process, legal principles and the main objectives of a good administration of justice. The model is used to analyze and discuss the development of the legal rules. The prosecutor’s authority and influence over the process has broadened and the use of summary procedures has served to place the focus on the police investigation instead of the trial. Among the objectives of a good administration of justice Speed and Cost effectiveness are considered to be more important than Security. As long as the Trust in the system is sufficient this development can continue. A conclusion from the study is that there is a need for some actor to prioritize and to do that openly. In the study the issue is raised whether it is time to question the legality principle as the main principle for the Swedish legal system.   Förlagsutgiven med 3 månaders embargo. </p...|$|E
40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{is a study}} {{about setting}} aside arbitral awards on grounds that arise from the arbitral tribunal’s {{decision}} {{on the merits of}} the dispute. The topic is researched under Finnish law and the Finnish Arbitration Act. In Finland, arbitral awards cannot be appealed for alleged material errors in the decision on the merits of the case, but they can be challenged on the ground that there have been procedural defects in the arbitral proceedings. This study aims to identify situations where the arbitral tribunal’s decision on the merits of the dispute can create such procedural defects, or at least bring them to light. The study will also discuss the proper annulment threshold in such situations. The study can be classified as a study in legal dogmatics, as it is largely about determining the content of existing legal rules. International comparisons are made throughout, mostly to Sweden, but the focus is on domestic and international arbitrations seated in Finland and thus governed by the Finnish Arbitration Act. Alongside the Act itself, its travaux préparatoires (preparatory works) and the Supreme Court precedent KKO 2008 : 77 are major sources in this study. This study assumes arbitrations are conducted under the 2013 Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce (FAI), so the FAI arbitration rules and their commentary provide additional sources. The study commences with an introduction. In the second chapter, it looks at the special characteristics of arbitration and at the limited judicial review of arbitral awards. It is discovered that from the four annulment grounds provided in Section 41 of the Finnish Arbitration Act, two can be triggered by the decision on the merits of the dispute. These two annulment grounds are excess of authority by the arbitral tribunal and the arbitral tribunal failing to provide a party with a sufficient opportunity to present its case. The third chapter investigates the conduct of arbitral proceedings from the viewpoint of the annulment ground assessed in the previous chapter. It is found that the procedural rules that can trigger those annulment grounds relate to the parties’ pleadings, to the arbitral tribunal’s actions, and to the possible interplay between these. Related rules regarding e. g. prayers for relief, factual allegations and legal arguments are discussed. The third chapter concludes {{with a look at the}} fact-invoking rules in Finnish civil procedure, and a discussion on whether they could be relevant for arbitration. The fourth chapter presents in detail KKO 2008 : 77, which is the only Supreme Court precedent to date that deals with the topic of this study. First, the attention is on the decision itself, from the arbitral award all the way to the Supreme Court. There is also a brief look at the expert opinions that some of Finland’s leading procedural law experts provided for the parties. Next, the study assesses how the precedent has been interpreted in legal literature and in Court of Appeal practice. At the end of chapter four, the author provides his own assessment of the meaning of the Supreme Court’s reasoning in KKO 2008 : 77. Chapter five reverts to the research questions posed in the introduction, and attempts to list situations where the arbitral tribunal’s decision on the merits of the dispute could trigger the annulment grounds in Section 41 of the Finnish Arbitration Act. Issues related to factual allegations and fact-finding are a major theme, as is the related question of whether the “burden of allegation” stipulated in Chapter 24 : 3 of the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judicial</b> <b>Procedure</b> is applicable to arbitration, and whether doctrine developed in connection with the said provision can be used in the context of arbitration. Other issues discussed include the question of whether founding an arbitral award on a legal consideration that comes as a surprise to the parties can constitute a ground for setting the award aside. The sixth and final chapter summarises some of the central findings and questions of the study. It also makes arguments and suggestions on the proper treatment of challenges that have close ties to the arbitrators’ decision on the merits of the dispute...|$|E
