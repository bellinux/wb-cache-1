40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to provide a {{literature}} review of occupational neurological disorders and related research in Korea, focusing on chemical hazards. We reviewed occupational neurological disorders investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute of Korean Occupational Safety and Health Agency between 1992 and 2009, categorizing them as neurological disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or as neurodegenerative disorders. We also examined peer-reviewed journal articles related to neurotoxicology, published from 1984 to 2009. Outbreaks of occupational neurological disorder of the CNS due to inorganic mercury and <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> <b>poisoning</b> had helped prompt the development of {{the occupational safety and health}} system of Korea. Other major neurological disorders of the CNS included methyl bromide intoxication and chronic toxic encephalopathy. Most of the PNS disorders were n-hexane-induced peripheral neuritis, reported from the electronics industry. Reports of manganese-induced Parkinsonism resulted in the introduction of neuroimaging techniques to occupational medicine. Since the late 1990 s, the direction of research has been moving toward degenerative disorder and early effect of neurotoxicity. To understand the early effects of neurotoxic chemicals in the preclinical stage, more follow-up studies of a longer duration are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Korea has a {{short history}} in {{research}} on occupational health like as short history of industrialization. During last four decades, however, Korea has experienced what developed countries have experienced {{for more than a}} hundred year. Research on occupational health in Korea has also drastically developed. Since industrialization in 1970 s, many workers were exposed to hazardous working environment and suffered from occupational accidents and diseases. The main research topics were pneumoconiosis, noise-induced hearing loss and some chemical poisoning. However, improving working condition was not the top priority until the late 1980 s. <b>Carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> <b>poisoning</b> gave a big impact to the society. It made the government take many actions to improve working condition through regulation, enforcement, supporting academia, raising research fund, and establishing a research institute. Recently, classical occupational diseases have decreased and the interest from researchers has also reduced. Many claims for stress-related cardio-cerebro vascular diseases brought much concern and research on job stress. Work-related musculoskeletal disease became a major issue. Many workers are interested in quality of life, such as health promotion. Therefore, research on health promotion, job stress, and psychological problem from work organization would be the main research topics in the future, although research on occupational diseases, such as asthma, cancer and various diseases caused by chemicals are still attractive to researchers...|$|E
40|$|Palladium(0) {{nanoclusters}} {{having an}} {{average particle size}} of 3. 2 nm were generated in situ from the reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate {{in the presence of}} oleylamine (OAm) during the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB) in THF under inert gas atmosphere at room temperature. OAm-stabilized palladium(0) nanoclusters were stable enough to be isolated as solid materials and characterized by TEM, HRTEM, XRD, UV-vis, and FT-IR techniques. They were found to be highly active catalysts in the hydrogen generation from the dehydrogenation of AB; in total, 2 equiv of hydrogen gas per AB was generated even at low catalyst concentration and room temperature. The first and second equivalent of H(2) generation from AB were completed in similar to 20 and 100 mm, respectively, from the dehydrogenation of AB in the presence of palladium (0) nanoclusters corresponding to an initial turnover frequency of 240 h(- 1). (11) B NMR study of the reaction shows that hydrogen evolution likely takes place in one or both of two parallel routes: (i) through formation of cyclopolyborazane followed by its polymerization to polyborazylene and (ii) through formation of long-chain B-N linear polymers. <b>Carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> <b>poisoning</b> experiments indicate that the dehydrogenation of AB catalyzed by OAm-stabilized palladium(0) nanoclusters is heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, the work reported here includes a wealthy collection of kinetic data to determine the rate law and apparent activation energy for the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB. TUBITAK 	 221...|$|E

40|$|Six human {{volunteers were}} exposed to 10 and 20 ppm <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> at rest and to 3 and 10 ppm <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> under a 50 W level of {{physical}} exercise during four consecutive periods of 50 min. Every 5 min a sample {{was taken from the}} mixed exhaled air in which the concentration of <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> was determined. It was established that only an apparent steady state was reached during this exposure period. The retention values were established as 0. 374 (SD = 0. 106; n = 239) for exposure to 10 ppm <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> at rest and as 0. 410 (SD = 0. 103; n = 239) for exposure to 20 ppm <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> at rest. During exposure to 10 ppm and 3 ppm <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide,</b> combined with a 50 W level of physical exercise, the retention values decreased to 0. 286 (SD = 0. 083; n = 239) and 0. 277 (SD = 0. 049; n = 239) respectively. Thereby, the measured individual retention values of <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> show considerable interindividual differences.

40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} relatively useful {{diagnostic procedures}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> (CS 2) <b>poisoning</b> {{in terms of}} validity and cost-effectiveness, several diagnostic tests are evaluated on 1, 552 people by prevalence ratio (exposed/nonexposed), dose-response relationship, sensitivity and specificity, {{and the cost of}} the tests. Several symptoms with high kappa indices are found to be useful in various combinations, showing a consistent dose-response relationship and high exposed-nonexposed ratio. In clinicopathologic tests on functions of the kidney, liver and hematopoietic systems, eight items out of 22 have been shown to have significant dose-response relationship, mostly in liver function tests. A thorough dental examination failed to identify any useful indicator peculiar to the CS 2 poisoning. Unlike Western people, the prevalence of coronary heart disease among Koreans was too low to be useful in the diagnosis of CS 2 poisoning. Among four elective tests, i. e., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and fluorescent angiography (FAG), the NCV appeared to be a more sensitive and specific test than the others are. Combinations of the tests imporved the probability of diagnosing CS 2 poisoning cases when any one test out of four was positive. Addition of other valid tests increased the probability of excluding non-cases. It was concluded that diagnosis of CS 2 poisoning could be made validly and inexpensively if the diagnostic tests were carefully chosen step by step...|$|R
40|$|Three {{distinct}} strains (KL 1, KS 1, and KS 2) of facultatively chemolitho-autotrophic bacteria {{able to use}} <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> or carbonyl sulfide as sole energy substrates {{were identified}} as novel strains of Paracoccus denitrificans. Evidence for their identity as biovars of P. denitrificans and as close relatives of Paracoccus versutus is based on their DNA composition, total sequencing of the genes for their 16 S rRNA, muropeptide profiles, amino acid composition of peptidoglycan, kinetics of murein degradation by lysozyme, possession of large plasmids (91 - 98 kb) and megaplasmids (> 450 kb), and plasmid transfer between the strains and with P. denitrificans and P. versutus. No functions have been identified for the 91 - to 98 -kb plasmids of strains KL 1 and KS 2, but curing strain KL 1 of its plasmid did not affect growth on <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide,</b> thiosulfate or succinate. Emendation of the formal description of Paracoccus denitrificans is presented. Autotrophic growth on <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> and thiosulfate was confined by (CO 2) -C- 14 fixation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{the development and implementation of}} 11 C <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> as a method of radiolabelling molecules to form radiotracers for application in positron emission tomography (PET). The development of the synthetic route to [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> is described. The preferred synthesis method for the main body of this work was to pass [11 C] methyl iodide over sulfur at high temperature. Other methods of [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> production were also explored including synthesis from [11 C] methane and also direct synthesis in the cyclotron target. Following the improved and robust synthesis of [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> a series of radiolabelled thiourea compounds were synthesised from the reaction of [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> and amines. This thiourea production method was further developed into the synthesis of 2 potential radiotracers. The progestin inhibitor tanaproget, and the CXCR 4 inhibitors IT 1 a and IT 1 t which are still undergoing synthetic development. As well as [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide,</b> [11 C] ammonium thiocyanate was also explored as a potential [11 C] radiolabelling reagent, with interest paid to its nucleophilic properties. Ammonium thiocyanate formed from the reaction of <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> with ammonia in solution. A series of [11 C] phenacyl thiocyanate compounds were synthesised from the reaction of [11 C] ammonium thiocyanate and acetophenone precursors. These [11 C] radiolabelled phenacyl thiocyanates were reacted on to form a series of analogous radiolabelled thiazole compounds. Once a more comprehensive understanding of the chemistry surrounding [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> had been established, a series of experiments were carried out in order to trap [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> on a cooled microfluidic device (MFD) before passing a droplet of precursor along the reaction channel of the MFD to react with the trapped [11 C] <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide,</b> forming the desired product, in this case monocyclohexyldithiocarbamate cyclohexylammonium salt. The final chapter, while not directly related to PET applications investigates the use of microfluidic and ow systems for the homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogenation of a range of alkanes. The hydrogenation of styrene to ethylbenzene was used as a model reaction of the testing of various experimental set-ups including stopped ow, and continuous flow in a range of flow systems. During annular ow experiments in a microfluidic device the deposition of a rhodium deposit was also collected and analysed for its catalytic properties. Open Acces...|$|R
