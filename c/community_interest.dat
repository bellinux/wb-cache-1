25|$|Parks and Recreation {{focuses on}} Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of the Parks and Recreation Department in the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee. Local nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) demands that a construction pit in the abandoned lot beside her house be filled in after her boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), fell in and broke his legs. Leslie promises to turn the pit into a park, despite resistance from the parks director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), an anti-government libertarian. City planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) – for whom Leslie harbors romantic feelings – pragmatically insists the project is unrealistic due to government red tape, but nevertheless secretly convinces Ron to approve the project. Leslie and her staff, including the sarcastic underachieving materialist Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) and the uninterested intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), try encouraging <b>community</b> <b>interest</b> in the pit project, but meet resistance. Later, Ann becomes furious to learn Andy had his cast removal postponed for two weeks so Ann would pamper him longer. Meanwhile, after a blind date for Leslie set up by her mother that ended horribly, a drunken Leslie and Mark share a kiss at the pit. Mark falls into the pit, and is quickly rescued by Leslie, Ann, and Andy.|$|E

25|$|Through {{various groups}} and {{organizations}} {{that the women}} of Willow Bunch belong to, they often spend their time volunteering and raising money for charities and community causes. The Legion Ladies Auxiliary #287 was formed June 8, 1974 in Willow Bunch. Its curling team won first in the Legion auxiliary zone district curling bonspiel in 1982. The Catholic Women’s League started in October 29, 1963 in Willow Bunch. The League says it is, “dedicated to serving {{the needs of the}} community and increasing the spiritual growth of its members as they work and share together”. Its members raise money doing raffles, teas, bake sales, etc. and then donate to various organizations and charities. The Federation des Femmes Canadiennes Françaises was originally formed in 1914 in Canada to help soldiers of World War I. It came to Willow Bunch in 1967. Since the war their goal has been to help French Canadian women reach their full potential and to be proud of their heritage {{as a member of the}} minority in the community. They have carried out substantial work for different charities including distributing meals for, “Meals on Wheels”. The Happy Hobby Club originated at the house of Elizabeth “Beth” Marie Louise Viala in October 1955. They enjoyed themselves meeting on a weekly basis and often worked on projects, which they sold to raise money for charities (such as quilts). They also put on social events in the Community Centre (formerly the Sharon School building). They had annual picnic for members and their families; one year, 100 people were in attendance. The Kinettes Club of Willow Bunch was formed on January 27, 1978 with Mary Eger as the formation president.

One week later, Agar.io entered Steam Greenlight with Valadares announcing a future free-to-play version of the game for download.
