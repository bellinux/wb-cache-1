5|$|With Tiberius's departure, {{succession}} rested {{solely on}} Augustus' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD2 {{with the death}} of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen and nothing more. In AD4, Gaius was killed in Armenia, and Augustus had no other <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to turn to Tiberius.|$|E

Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} that he has decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending have come and gone, due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal footing. When Zuko tells the group that Ozai {{plans to use the}} comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him that he has no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to kill Ozai.|$|E

5|$|Frankel {{generally}} {{approved of}} his editor's <b>choices,</b> <b>but</b> differed on one scene, showing more of Andrea on her errand to the Calvin Klein showroom. He felt that scene showed Andrea's job was {{about more than}} running personal errands for Miranda.|$|R
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; he had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he had little <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no <b>choice,</b> <b>but</b> Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E

30|$|The sample {{answers were}} {{prepared}} by the independent security expert A. Each answer was classified as, Correct, Correct but broad, Incomplete, Incomplete and broad, Wrong, and Blank. A correct answer contained and only contained all the acceptable choices (e.g. a, b); Correct but broad contained all the acceptable <b>choices,</b> <b>but</b> also incorrect <b>choices</b> (e.g. a, b, c); Incomplete answers contained {{only some of the}} acceptable <b>choices</b> <b>but</b> not all (e.g. a). Incomplete and broad answers contained some of the acceptable choices and also other choices. (e.g. a, c); Wrong answers contained none of the acceptable choices (e.g. c). There was only one blank answer out of 144 responses; therefore we ignore this in the subsequent analysis.|$|R
5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} had no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to make another}} attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at {{a meeting at the}} Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E
5|$|George was {{succeeded by}} his son, George Augustus, {{who took the}} throne as George II. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was {{prevented}} from doing so by his queen, Caroline of Ansbach. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had little <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to retain him or risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns {{the power of the}} prime minister increased further {{at the expense of the}} power of the sovereign.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{payments}} are {{not based on}} producers’ current production <b>choices,</b> <b>but</b> are tied to acreage bases and yields.
