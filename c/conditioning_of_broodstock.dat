40|$|Closing {{the cycle}} of {{commercial}} species of fish in a recirculating aquaculture system is gaining importance {{for a number of}} practical advantages. Founder broodstock originating from the wild population is conditioned to live in hatchery tanks under suitable environmental and feeding conditions and is induced to breed. The juveniles are grown to maturity and facilitated to spawn in captivity to close the life cycle in the hatchery. This experiment was carried out on tiger grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus). After preliminary observations, it was possible to identify appropriate environmental conditions in terms of water quality parameters, volume <b>of</b> <b>broodstock</b> tanks and ration. Growth was nearly isometric (growth exponent =  2. 9185) and the condition factor =  1. 86. This reflected good management conditions. Cues that trigger sex reversal in this protogynous fish in the hatchery were different from those that operate in nature. It appears that the differentiation of some individuals of a cohort into male sex is linked to socio-demographic cues as well as internal condition of the fish because it related to age and physiological condition. This view was reinforced by a lack of response in young fish to similar cues. The information generated through this study defines what is required for optimum <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> tiger grouper <b>broodstock</b> and explains the cues involved in sex differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Chaetoceros calcitrans is {{a marine}} diatom {{widely used in}} {{aquaculture}} industries, as it is comprised of nutritional value suitable for most marine filter feeders. Large amounts of the diatom cells are routinely discharged from shrimp hatcheries as uneaten food. The effluent, rich in algal cells, can potentially be re-used to feed oyster broodstock, as the oysters are an effective filter feeder. This study attempted to investigate viability of C. calcitrans as a monospecies diet for <b>conditioning</b> <b>broodstock</b> <b>of</b> Crassostrea belcheri. It was found that gametes of both sexes developed to spawning condition when rearing in captivity using C. calcitrans. Gametes were found in all four stages i. e. active, ripe, spawned and spent - at 15. 4, 30. 8, 30. 8 and 23. 1 %, respectively when reared for 20 days. When the conditioning period was extended for 40 days, the development stages were found at 15. 4, 15. 4, 30. 8 and 38. 5 %, respectively. The whole body weight decreased 2. 01 - 2. 65 % after 20 days and 7. 72 % after 40 days. The condition indices were obtained between 6. 31 - 7. 78 % and showed no relation to gametogenic stages of gonad.

40|$|The Portuguese oyster Crassostrea angulata shows great {{potential}} in oyster farming. In Europe, pure populations {{of this species}} were observed only in the southern coasts of Portugal and Spain, namely in Rio Sado, Rio Mira and Guadalquivir. The conservation of C. angulata populations {{is important in the}} context of production diversification and biodiversity preservation. In this way the zootechnological development for seed hatchery production is extremely important. Broodstock conditioning is a key step in the process of rearing bivalve in hatchery. Many factors regulate the reproductive cycle, being food the most important. However the influence of the nutritional quality of different phytoplankton on sexual maturation has been poorly explored. To evaluate the effects of different diets on C. angulata sexual maturity, broodstock were conditioned with different food regimes: Diet 1 : bi-specific combination of Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis galbana clone T-ISO (1 : 1); Diet 2 : tri-specific combination of P. lutheri, I galbana clone T-ISO and Skeletonema constatum (1 : 1 : 1); Diet 3 : bi-specific combination of S. constatum and Chaetoceros calcitrans (1 : 1) and Diet 4 : tri-specific combination of P. lutheri, S. constatum and C. calcitrans (1 : 1 : 1). During conditioning, condition index and gonad histological analysis were performed. Results showed heterogeneity between diets. At the beginning <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> 60 % <b>of</b> individuals were in resting (stage 0), 30 % were males in early gametogenesis (stage I) and 10 % were females in mature stage (stage III). At the end <b>of</b> the <b>conditioning,</b> the most effective diet was the Diet 3 (60 % of mature oysters with a mean condition index value of 2. 83 ± 0. 95). Whereas those fed with Diet 1 have an unsuccessfully gonadic development, with 80 % of individuals in resting stage. Indeed, the condition index, in Diet 1 decreased during the conditioning period.

Filtration rates when fed the diatom Chaetoceros muelleri were the lowest of the tested species, with a relatively low weight and volume of the algae filtered. Maximum filtration rates of the tested species were estimated to vary between 2. 25 x 109 and 7. 68 x 109 cells scallop- 1 day- 1. Filtration of algal species by M. asperrima varied in accordance with both scallop size and water temperature.

Since 2011 a R&D program started under the supervision of IFREMER in New Caledonia and French Polynesia in order to study and develop biofloc technology for rearing shrimp L. stylirostris broodstock. In a first step we showed that biofloc (BFT) improved significantly the reproductive performances of shrimps and the quality of their larvae compared to Clear Water (CW) or Earthen Pond (EP), with: • A better final survival rate <b>of</b> <b>broodstock</b> from BFT compare to CW. • Females from BFT produced more eggs per spawn and spawned more frequently compared to females from CW or EP. • The larvae from BFT females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to larvae from CW females, respectively 70 % (n= 4) and 45 % (n= 4). In a second step we studied the underlying biological mechanisms explaining the better reproductive performance and health status <b>of</b> the <b>broodstock</b> from BFT rearing system, and the better quality of their larvae.

This paper reviewed the studies on the maturation diets for mud crab broodstock, genus Scylla and compared independently to identify their effect on reproductive performance and larval quality. The broodstock is usually caught from the wild and held in the spawning or maturation tank for further use of hatchery seed production. Mud crab broodstock was fed either natural diet, artificial diet or mixed diet. Trash fishes were commonly used as a natural feed for mud crab broodstock; meanwhile artificial diets are from formulated fish meal and various kinds of feed. The results indicated that mud crab broodstock has a high dietary requirement for lipids, fatty acids and protein which are to be used during the maturation and breeding processes. However, the natural diet produce better larval quality compared to the artificial diet. The mixed diet is the better diet which resulted in better reproductive performances such as growth, survival, fecundity and maturation processes. This review also discusses the problems in the previous studies for the potential future research to develop very high quality and cost-effective formulated diet for the enhancement <b>of</b> <b>broodstock</b> and seed production technology. Information from this review can be useful in developing a better quality <b>of</b> crustacean <b>broodstock’s</b> diet for commercial hatchery production...|$|R
40|$|Blue {{swimming}} crab (Portunus pelagicus) {{is the important}} world fishery resource, but the crab larval rearing faces high mortality problem. The {{aim of the research}} was to compare survival and growth rate of larvae resulted from wild and domesticated broodstock blue {{swimming crab}}. Domesticated and wild broodstock were used to produce larvae. Domesticated broodstock was selected from repeated reared crab until third generation. Selection <b>of</b> the <b>broodstock</b> mainly based on the survival and growth rate. The wild broodstock was collected from Makassar Strait Sea. Larvae from the two sources <b>of</b> <b>broodstock</b> were reared in the conical tanks with density of 50 zoeas per liter. After reaching megalopa phase, then, the larvae were transfered into concrete tank completed with shelter and it were reared until crab phase. Crab phase was reared for 18 days, then these seed were released into the brackishwater pond for further domestication step. Larva from zoea to crab were fed with rotifer, artemia, fresh small shrimp and diet. The result showed that domesticated broodstock produced higher survival rate (P< 0. 05) larvae, faster larval stage changes (P< 0. 01) and uniform larval growth compared to the larvae from wild broodstock. It is clearly shown, the use <b>of</b> domesticated <b>broodstock</b> <b>of</b> blue swimming crab produced better larva quality and quantity than the wild broodstock crab...|$|R
