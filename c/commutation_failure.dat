Experimental results, mainly of frequency characteristic which is the most important of a self-controlled inverter, are discussed. Output voltage V 2 and frequency f in this inverter are proportional to DC source voltage, i. e., V 2 ／f is always kept constant for DC source voltage. Therefore, this characteristic is suitable for speed control of an illduction motor. Besides, when the saturable reactor in Morgan circuit is saturated, the inductance of it becomes very small, but not zero. One of the factors of <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> is the existence of this small inductance.

30|$|Although most LCC-HVDC schemes {{in service}} today are {{point to point}} schemes, there are two multi-terminal schemes in service at present, and in these only three {{converters}} i.e. terminals are connected together but not forming a mesh. The main reason for {{limiting the number of}} LCC-HVDC terminals connected together has traditionally been a result of risk of <b>commutation</b> <b>failures.</b> Another disadvantage with LCC-HVDC for multi-terminal operation is some complexity of power direction changes from import to export or vice versa. In order to achieve power reversal in a LCC-HVDC system, a DC voltage reversal is required resulting in the need of additional switchgear and HV insulation rated at full DC voltage {{at both ends of the}} converter.|$|R

30|$|New {{developments}} in HVDC technologies are as follows. In [69, 70], {{a new approach}} was proposed to eliminate the <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> and provide fast dynamic reactive power/voltage control. In order to eliminate the <b>commutation</b> <b>failure,</b> a novel hybrid converter configuration for conventional LCC HVDC technology is proposed in [69]. Additionally, the control of AC voltage and reactive power in LCC HVDC system is investigated in [70] and a new control scheme is proposed, which makes the application of LCC HVDC system more flexible. LCC HVDC is preferred for power transmission over long distance transmission, the VSC HVDC system in [66, 67] shows {{that it may be}} the preferred option for multi-terminal DC grid or offshore wind farm integration.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a new Modular Multi-Level Converter (MMC) on a Line Commutated Converter (LCC) in the same AC-grid, {{representing}} the future system of NordLink and NorNed is investigated. This multi-infeed HVDC system is compared against today's LCC stand alone system. A method for detecting <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> is proposed. The <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> immunity index is 36 % and 28 % respectively. The result indicate that the MMC-link hence mitigates {{the weakness of the}} LCC-link, and makes the LCC inverter less prone to <b>commutation</b> <b>failure.</b> The multi-infeed HVDC system is analysed in both steady and transient state. The MMC is able to control the active and reactive power, and enhances AC voltage regulation. Existing voltage supporting equipment can thus be utilized for a more continuous voltage regulation when the new MMC-link is connected, and to minimize losses. Single and three phase to ground faults are applied. The results indicate that a LCC inverter in weak AC grids may suffer from <b>commutation</b> <b>failure.</b> The MMC is able to ride through relatively severe AC faults. The results indicates that the multi-infeed system improves the performance when AC faults are applied as compared the existing LCC stand alone system. The MMC-link is able to mitigate the impact of AC faults, thus helping the LCC-link recover faster. The coupling effect between AC and DC overhead lines sharing the same Rights-of-Way is investigated, and a single pole to ground fault is applied. Induced DC currents into AC lines are detected. The peak rms neutral current in the AC lines is found to be 1000 A for fault location close to MMC inverter. Two mitigation methods are proposed. First, an optimal displacement of the middle AC tower is found to be 45 meters apart from the DC tower, and leads to a reduction of 22. 3 % (777 A). Second, transposition of the AC-lines efficiently reduced the coupling effect, as it averages the unbalance between the three phases. </p...|$|E

40|$|High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) {{transmission}} systems traditionally use PI controllers with fixed gains. These controllers operate satisfactorily {{within a}} small operating range {{because of the}} non-linearity and uncertainty of the plant. However, when AC systems are weak, the HVDC systems are prone to repetitive <b>commutation</b> <b>failures</b> under disturbances, which {{may lead to the}} instability and collapse of the DC link. This thesis is a contribution to the study of these problems. In order to make the HVDC systems have optimal control over a wider operating range, an Incremental Fuzzy Gain Scheduling Proportional and Integral Controller (IFGSPIC) is proposed for the current control of the rectifier. For this study using the EMTP RV simulation package, a typical HVDC system connected to a weak AC system is modeled with the detailed representation of the converter, converter transformer and AC/DC filters etc. The DC current error and its derivative are taken as two parameters necessary to adapt the proportional (P) and integral (I) gains of the current controller based on fuzzy reasoning...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of HVDC systems using conventional Line Commutated Converters (LCCs) operating with weak AC systems becomes unreliable due to frequent <b>commutation</b> <b>failures</b> which can occur for any small disturbance in the AC networks. The thesis {{starts with a}} brief survey of {{the present state of}} the art in HVDC systems. This is followed by the descriptions of different subsystems of the CIGRE benchmark model. The basic control characteristics of HVDC systems are discussed and their implementations are described using block diagrams. Finally, different tests are carried out by applying varying faults and step changes in the control parameters. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation package is used to model the CIGRE benchmark and its various control circuits. The performance of the CCC is compared with conventional LCC using the same benchmark model. Finally, a modified version of CCC configuration, namely Hybrid Converter Combination (HCC) configuration is presented. This configuration uses a combination of both a traditional LCC and a CCC.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work is to define the strategy of tuning current controller amplifier and voltage dependent current order limiter parameters to achieve good dynamic performance {{with a wide range}} of a. c. systems in PSS/E. The defined control parameter could be adapting independent of different power levels and configurations. Basically, three different HVDC transmission types are used such as overhead lines, cables and back to back. The dynamic control performances are varied with respect to transmission types. Hence, the control parameters could be different. The control parameters could be intended for stability improvement of HVDC system connected with wide range of AC system parameters. As a part of a HVDC project design, large efforts are made in tuning control system parameters for the specific project conditions. However, for customer support, in planning studies it is necessary to provide a set of robust control parameters giving a representative performance for “any” configuration. This thesis work mainly deals with dynamic response of HVDC system. The dynamic instabilities occur mostly at d. c. system connected to weak receiving a. c. network. It causes high ac voltage fluctuations as a consequence very difficult to recover the dc system after the fault clearing instant due to repetitive <b>commutation</b> <b>failures.</b> Therefore, good dynamic dc control strategy has to define by tuning the current control amplifier and voltage dependent current order limiter. This will be done by analyzing the responses of the HVDC model for different transmission types, network strengths and control parameters. Results will be evaluated, and presented so that it is possible to define performance and what needs to be improved. Evaluation will be made of the responses obtained using the existing parameters and those obtained using the set of rules proposed in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Line commutated HVDC {{systems are}} widely used due to their high power ratings. However, one of the {{disadvantages}} of such HVDC systems is the high risk of commutation failures when AC disturbances arise. These failures normally develop in the inverter station. When failed commutation occurs, the LCC HVDC system is greatly disturbed resulting in loss of power transmission. Moreover, the rapid increase in the direct current during unsuccessful commutation results in additional stresses on the thyristor valves. In an attempt to reduce the probability of unsuccessful commutation, a <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> prevention function {{is added to the}} HVDC system controls. When an AC system disturbance is detected, this function is activated with the aim of altering the firing order at the inverter station. Since the angle contribution from the function is independent of the minimum inverter extinction angle, this approach possesses limitations under certain AC faults. In this thesis, a <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> prevention function based on voltage-time area contribution was designed and implemented. Simulation results show that both the proposed and existing functions are equally ineffective in mitigating the first commutation failures when three phase faults are applied. However, the proposed function is more effective in mitigating the first <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> when single phase faults are applied compared to the existing function. In 17 % of the investigated cases, improvements were registered when the proposed function was utilised. Moreover, in 25 % of the cases when three phase faults were applied, the proposed function reduced the occurrence of multi-valve commutation failures...|$|E
40|$|It is {{cost-effective}} {{to construct}} a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) grid via interconnecting existing HVDCs. The grid protection and the interconnection between HVDCs are studied in the thesis. The future HVDC grid will be protected via the hybrid HVDC circuit breakers due to their high interrupting speed and low conduction losses. The hybrid DC circuit breakers have to be installed at each line end to fulfil the requirement of the grid protection. The overall cost of the breakers used in a HVDC grid will be extremely high as each breaker contains {{a large number of}} semiconductor switches. The research question in this part is how to reduce the cost of the hybrid DC circuit breakers. The novel interlink hybrid HVDC circuit breakers based on the concept of sharing main breaker branch will be proposed {{to reduce the size of}} the main breaker branch. An alternative method through coordination of converters and hybrid HVDC circuits breakers will be proposed to reduce the current rating of the breaker. Most of the commissioned HVDC projects are point-to-point Line Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDCs. The interconnection of LCC-HVDCs will achieve the benefits of the grid operation, such as highly efficient and flexible power transportation, and high security of power transportation. However, benefits of the interconnection are hindered by the disadvantages of the LCC-HVDC. The first one is that a LCC-HVDC has to reverse its voltage polarity in order to reverse its power. The second one is that a LCC-HVDC is at risk of the <b>commutation</b> <b>failure,</b> which will cause a DC fault when a <b>commutation</b> <b>failure</b> occurs. The research question in this part is how to achieve the interconnection of LCC-HVDCs with the benefits of the grid operation.
