5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and <b>consumption</b> is key for high self <b>consumption,</b> {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity <b>consumption.</b> However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self <b>consumption</b> increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self <b>consumption</b> of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable <b>consumption</b> with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self <b>consumption</b> of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of <b>consumption</b> (i.e. whether agricultural, {{industrial}} and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of <b>consumption</b> (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the <b>consumption</b> demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E

A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that <b>consumption</b> of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E

5|$|As of October 2011, <b>consumption</b> of {{liquefied}} petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, {{and diesel}} has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products <b>consumption</b> had not been managed, <b>consumption</b> of gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming <b>consumption</b> pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E

30|$|Motivated by {{aforementioned}} facts, in this paper, a new method, {{which is}} suitable for clustering and identifying the unusual electricity <b>consumptions</b> and their quantification according {{to the nature of}} irregularity, is proposed.

Clustering results are compared with k-means and fuzzy c-means with clustering validation using Davies Bouldin index and Silhouette coefficient.|$|R

5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their <b>consumption</b> over time and only alter their <b>consumption</b> patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in <b>consumption.</b> Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in <b>consumption</b> due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
