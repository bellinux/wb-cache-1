5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal <b>chapter</b> <b>house,</b> built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may {{be found}} in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the <b>chapter</b> <b>house,</b> the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include {{numerous}} small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> has {{stained glass}} in its east window by Heaton, Butler and Bayne and {{grisaille}} {{windows in the}} north and south walls, dated 1882–83, by Blomfield. It contains an oak cope cupboard from the late 13thcentury. The front of the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> was rebuilt to a design by Hussey.|$|E

5|$|Between 1275 and 1310 the undercroft and <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> {{were built}} by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> in the Geometric style of Decorated Gothic architecture. In about 1310 work {{commenced}} on the Lady Chapel, {{to the design}} of Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the Flowing Decorated style.|$|E

5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais died on 2 January 1096 {{after falling}} gravely ill on the {{previous}} Christmas Day. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was blessed by his former opponent. He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> at Durham. The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, {{and it is possible}} that the stress of this threat caused his death. In 1796 St-Calais' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> at Durham Cathedral. Found in the grave were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.|$|E
5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its stones in the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden. To support the <b>chapter</b> <b>house</b> project, a line of Belgian-style beers was produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand.|$|E
