5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the <b>cheeks</b> and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white <b>cheeks</b> and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E

5000|$|The left <b>cheek</b> bias {{occurs when}} viewers prefer portraits {{with the subject}} {{displaying}} their left <b>cheek,</b> while those that hold a right <b>cheek</b> bias prefer portraits displaying the right <b>cheek.</b> Studies have found mixed results concerning the left <b>cheek</b> bias and the right <b>cheek</b> bias. Male and female participants were shown male and female portraits, each displaying {{an equal number of}} left or right <b>cheek</b> positions. Participants were shown each portrait in its original orientation and in its reversed orientation and asked which portrait they preferred more. Results indicated that the majority of participants chose portraits displaying the subject’s right <b>cheek</b> over the left. [...] Another study explored which posing orientations conveyed certain messages. Scientists in the 18th century more commonly displayed a right <b>cheek</b> bias, and were rated as “more scientific.” According to the researchers, showing one’s right <b>cheek</b> hides emotion, while the left <b>cheek</b> expresses it. The shift from right to left <b>cheek</b> bias post 18th century may represent more personal or open facial characteristics.|$|R

5000|$|In 2014, Gaga {{collaborated with}} Tony Bennett on the jazz album <b>Cheek</b> to <b>Cheek.</b> The {{inspiration}} behind the album {{came from her}} longtime friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood. The album received generally favorable reviews, with Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian praising Gaga's vocals in it, and Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich writing that [...] "Cheek to <b>Cheek</b> serves up the real thing, start to finish". <b>Cheek</b> to <b>Cheek</b> was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on Billboard 200, and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. The duo recorded the concert special Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: <b>Cheek</b> to <b>Cheek</b> Live!, and embarked on the <b>Cheek</b> to <b>Cheek</b> Tour from December 2014 to August 2015.

5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey <b>cheeks,</b> while P. d. indicus group birds have white <b>cheeks,</b> as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey <b>cheeks</b> of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E

5|$|The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, {{in their}} plumage, {{and have a}} similar pattern {{to that in the}} {{corresponding}} sex of house sparrow. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their <b>cheeks</b> and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and <b>cheeks,</b> as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had <b>cheeks.</b> This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The <b>cheeks</b> would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E

5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue <b>cheeks</b> and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, <b>cheeks,</b> chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and <b>cheeks</b> have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

5|$|The {{long and}} narrow skull was small in {{proportion}} to the body. It had a small antorbital fenestra, the hole between the nose and eye common to most archosaurs, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that Stegosaurus may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca. The lower jaw of Stegosaurus jaws of Stegosaurus had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life. The presence of a beak extended along much of the jaws may have precluded the presence of <b>cheeks</b> in these species. Such an extensive beak was probably unique to Stegosaurus and some other advanced stegosaurids among ornithischians, which usually had beaks restricted to the jaw tips. Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy <b>cheeks,</b> rather than beaks. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular, and flat; wear facets show that they did grind their food.|$|E
