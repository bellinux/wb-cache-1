40|$|When {{applying}} discrete multiwavelets, prefiltering {{is necessary}} because the initial multiscaling coefficients cannot be trivially {{derived from the}} samples of scalar signals. There have been many studies {{on the design of}} prefilters, and one main approach is to use a superfunction. The idea is to construct a low-pass function from the multiscaling functions that inherits their approximation power for scalar signals. However, none of the existing prefilters give linear phase <b>combined</b> <b>filters,</b> which is important for many practical applications. The authors analyse the conditions on which the prefilters and the <b>combined</b> <b>filters</b> are symmetric. A method is proposed for the design of good multiwavelet prefilters that allow the superfunction to be symmetric, satisfying the Strang-Fix conditions and the resulting <b>combined</b> <b>filters</b> are linear phase.

40|$|Abstract—The carrier-frequency offset {{effect on}} the perfor-mance of {{asynchronous}} multicarrier direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (MC-DS-CDMA) systems with aperiodic random spreading and correlated Rayleigh fading is studied in this paper. We obtain the optimum <b>combining</b> <b>filter</b> that maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the combined statistics and exploits correlated information among subchannels. A closed-form expression for the unconditional covariance matrix of the interference-plus-noise vector, which forms {{the basis of our}} theoretical analysis of the maximum SINR and the average bit error probability formula, is derived by averaging several random parameters including asynchronous delays, correlated Rayleigh fading, and signature sequences. The analytic results obtained are applicable to MC-CDMA with appropriate modifications. Fur-thermore, we show that the MC-CDMA system with a common random signature sequence over all subcarriers for a given user outperforms that with distinct sequences over different subcar-riers. Finally, the performance of MC-CDMA systems using the optimum combining technique is compared with that of different <b>combining</b> <b>filters</b> in the simulation.
