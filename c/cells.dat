5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when <b>cells</b> grow old or get damaged, they die, and new <b>cells</b> take their place.

40|$|Abstract Background Glypican 3 (GPC 3) is {{a member}} of the family of glypican heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs). The GPC 3 gene may play a role in controlling <b>cell</b> migration, negatively regulating <b>cell</b> growth and inducing apoptosis. GPC 3 is downregulated in several cancers, which can result in uncontrolled <b>cell</b> growth and can also contribute to the malignant phenotype of some tumors. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mechanism of action of the GPC 3 gene in clear <b>cell</b> renal <b>cell</b> carcinoma. Methods Five clear <b>cell</b> renal <b>cell</b> carcinoma <b>cell</b> lines and carcinoma samples were used to analyze GPC 3 mRNA expression (qRT-PCR). Then, representative <b>cell</b> lines, one primary renal carcinoma (786 -O) and one metastatic renal carcinoma (ACHN), were chosen to carry out functional studies. We constructed a GPC 3 expression vector and transfected the renal carcinoma <b>cell</b> lines, 786 -O and ACHN. GPC 3 overexpression was analyzed using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. We evaluated <b>cell</b> proliferation using MTT and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate apoptosis and perform <b>cell</b> cycle analyses. Results We observed that GPC 3 is downregulated in clear <b>cell</b> renal <b>cell</b> carcinoma samples and <b>cell</b> lines compared with normal renal samples. GPC 3 mRNA expression and protein levels in 786 -O and ACHN <b>cell</b> lines increased after transfection with the GPC 3 expression construct, and the <b>cell</b> proliferation rate decreased in both <b>cell</b> lines following overexpression of GPC 3. Further, apoptosis was not induced in the renal <b>cell</b> carcinoma <b>cell</b> lines overexpressing GPC 3, and there was an increase in the <b>cell</b> population during the G 1 phase in the <b>cell</b> cycle. Conclusion We suggest that the GPC 3 gene reduces the rate of <b>cell</b> proliferation through <b>cell</b> cycle arrest during the G 1 phase in renal <b>cell</b> carcinoma...|$|R
