50|$|The {{semiconductor}} diode is not ideal.

Above this voltage {{the slope of the}} current-voltage curve is not infinite (on-resistance is not zero). In the reverse direction the diode conducts a nonzero leakage current (exaggerated by a smaller scale in the figure) and at a sufficiently large reverse voltage below the breakdown voltage the current increases very rapidly with more negative reverse voltages.|$|E

The current-voltage characteristics of undoped SIPOS/p-Si heterojunctions exhibit a strong {{dependence on the}} oxygen content of the SIPOS film and depart from a hyperbolic sine behavior as the refractive index of the SIPOS increases [...] The addition of nitrogen trifluoride decreases the current density of these undoped SIPOS/p-Si heterojunctions due presumably to the oxidation/hydrolysis of SiF species intoSiO 2. The n+-SIPOS formed a rectifying isotype junction o n-Si. The forward current voltage characteristics exhibit two distinct activation energies separated by a 2 ̆ 2 kink 2 ̆ 2 in the forward semi-logarithmic characteristics; one below the <b>cut-in</b> <b>voltage</b> and one above the <b>cut-in</b> <b>voltage.</b> The two activation energies result from the presence of interface states in the structures. However, the forward current-voltage characteristics of the fluorinated SIPOS isotype junctions exhibit no 2 ̆ 2 kink 2 ̆ 2 and only a single activation energy due, presumably, to hydrogen passivating the interfacial traps during the hydrolysis process...|$|E
40|$|ESD {{robustness}} of Low Temperature Poly-Si (LTPS) diodes and TFT devices {{has been}} investigated in this paper. By using the Transmission Line Pulsing (TLP) techniques, the It 2 (secondary breakdown current) of LTPS diodes and TFT devices were measured. To evaluate the ESD robustness of components for ESD protection, the shifts of breakdown voltage and <b>cut-in</b> <b>voltage</b> of LTPS diode and TFT devices after TLP stress are considered into failure threshold judgment. From the experimental results, It 2 of LTPS diodes under forward-biased stress is better than that of LTPS TFT devices. Furthermore, the It 2 of LTPS TFT devices under reverse-biased stress is more robust than it under forward-biased stress. Such investigation results can help us to design a successful ESD protection for the circuits on glass...|$|E
40|$|Although {{graphene}} has fascinating electronic properties, {{lack of a}} band-gap reduces its utility {{for conventional}} electronic device applications. A tunable bandgap can be induced in bilayer graphene by application of a potential {{difference between the two}} layers. The simplest geometry for creating such a potential difference consists of two overlapping single layer graphene nanoribbons. Numerical simulations, based on π-band nearest neighbor tight binding model and the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism, show that transmission through such a structure has a strong dependence on applied bias. The simulated current voltage characteristics mimic the characteristics of resonant tunneling diode featuring negative differential resistance. It is found that the bandgap of the nanoribbons and length of the bilayer region have significant effects on the current voltage characteristics. In particular, the peak to valley ratio decreases with increasing length of the bilayer region. And the <b>cut-in</b> <b>voltage</b> is strongly modulated by the bandgap of the GNRs...|$|E
40|$|A low cost, highly rectifying, nano {{heterojunction}} (p-ZnO/n-Si) diode was fabricated using solution-processed, p-type, ZnO nanoparticles and an n-type Si substrate. p-type ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using {{a chemical}} synthesis route and characterized by XRD and a Hall effect measurement system. The device was fabricated by forming thin film of synthesized p-ZnO nanoparticles on an n-Si substrate using a dip coating technique. The device was then characterized by current–voltage (I – V) and capacitance–voltage (C – V) measurements. The effect of UV illumination on the I – V characteristics was also explored and indicated {{the formation of}} a highly rectifying, nano heterojunction with a rectification ratio of 101 at 3 V, which increased nearly 2. 5 times (232 at 3 V) under UV illumination. However, the <b>cut-in</b> <b>voltage</b> decreases from 1. 5 V to 0. 9 V under UV illumination. The fabricated device could be used in switches, rectifiers, clipper and clamper circuits, BJTs, MOSFETs and other electronic circuitry...|$|E
