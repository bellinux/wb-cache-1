The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

As part of a {{reorganization}} of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00p.m. on Fridays. [...] This timeslot, commonly considered the [...] "Friday night death slot" [...] for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate. [...] While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and {{would continue to be}} a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance. [...] In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers. Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringes viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that [...] "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> win for us". Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would [...] "re-animate" [...] the show. The network also created a music video, set to [...] "Echoes" [...] by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast. Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership {{may not be enough to}} save the show: [...] "It's not that not enough people are watching Fringe, it's that not enough people are watching Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network." ...|$|E
