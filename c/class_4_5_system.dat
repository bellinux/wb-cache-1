In our previous research, an attempt to optimize the ABCD formula using the LEM 2 rule induction algorithm was successful. This time we decided to replace LEM 2 by C <b>4.</b> <b>5,</b> a tree generating data mining system. The final conclusion is that, most likely, for C <b>4.</b> <b>5</b> the original ABCD formula is already optimal and no further improvement is possible.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to analyse the effect of landscape structure (habitat size and exposure to farmland) on the occurrence and abundance of Lobaria pulmonaria, a foliose cyanolichen. Since the agrarian revolution during the 19 th century the agricultural landscape has become increasingly fragmented resulting in isolated meadows and wood-pastures surrounded by farmland. Lobaria pulmonaria is one of the species being affected by this habitat change, much due to their dispersal limitations, specific habitat demands and susceptibility to air pollution. 36 localities of two different size <b>classes</b> ( <b>4.</b> <b>5</b> ha) and two different exposure classes (exposed or unexposed to farmland) were studied. The occurrence, size of lichen thallus and height of lichen patches on tree trunks were significantly positively affected by habitat size and negatively affected by habitat exposure. The implications of these findings for strategies to manage and conserve L. pulmonaria in a fragmented landscape are discussed...|$|R
