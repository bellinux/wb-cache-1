5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, lengthened it.

5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (even {{though he did not}} ask how many were for <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> how many were for acquittal).

5|$|The {{case was}} {{automatically}} {{appealed to the}} Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor's <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> sentence in October 1991. Taylor's execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was rescheduled to June 24 when Taylor's attorney Martin Gravis requested {{to withdraw from the}} case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a stay of execution after Taylor's new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more time to prepare an appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.|$|E
5|$|The trial, <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> {{sentencing}} of the Bahrain Thirteen drew {{expressions of}} concern from European Union, Denmark, France, Ireland, United Kingdom and United States, {{and international organizations}} including the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists and Human Rights First.

5|$|Before Massino became boss, John Gotti {{was one of}} {{his closest}} allies. Massino had backed Gotti in his plot to take over the Gambino family, and as Gambino boss, Gotti tried to get Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos' acting boss. Gotti was {{reportedly}} infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted, and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him. Gotti, however, was marginalized by his 1992 racketeering and murder <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> consequent life imprisonment. Massino, for his own part, was angered at Gotti's high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing his predecessor Paul Castellano. Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante, who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti's attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the first}} title {{developed}} by Ubisoft Toronto, a studio founded by Ubisoft in 2009. The game was directed by Maxime Béland, who had worked on <b>Conviction,</b> <b>and</b> produced by Jade Raymond. To prepare for this game, Béland studied reviews and feature lists of the latter. Blacklist {{is the first}} Splinter Cell game starring Eric Johnson as Sam Fisher, since series veteran Michael Ironside was unable to perform motion capture for the game. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and its later-announced Wii U version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|Kinne went {{to trial}} {{for the murder of}} Patricia Jones in June 1961 and was acquitted. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> a {{sentence}} of life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E

5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum.

5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> won a mixed {{victory in}} 1918 in a {{unanimous}} {{decision by the}} New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101–103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E
5|$|The State of California charged Alvarado and {{his friend}} with first-degree murder and {{attempted}} robbery. Alvarado attempted to suppress his statements given during the Comstock interview {{on the basis that}} he was not read his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time he gave his statement. Alvarado was subsequently convicted, primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation. Alvarado's conviction was reduced by the trial judge to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> agreed that Alvarado was not in custody. The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review.|$|E
