40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{an examination}} of choice of law rules in property. The study is principally concerned with the Scottish rules of international private law, but these, in turn, rely heavily upon, and in many respects are indistinguishable from, the equivalent English rules. Indeed, they seem in places to be mutually dependent. An examination is conducted of choice of law methodology, including in particular, {{an analysis of the}} configuration of choice of law rules. Consideration is given {{to the role of the}} connecting factor, and to the definition thereof, in its spatial, temporal and dimensional contexts. Throughout the thesis, a contrast is drawn between the jurisdiction-selecting approach of Scottish and English international private law, and the rule-selecting techniques which are employed in the United States of America. Central to the thesis is {{an examination of}} the role and definition of the connecting factor in the particular context of choice of law rules in property. The study traces the development of the lex situs rule, and its application to dealings with immovable <b>property,</b> <b>corporeal</b> moveable <b>property</b> and incorporeal moveable property, as well as the special case of dealings with 'cultural property'. Arguments in favour of, and against, the lex situs rule, in these various contexts, are considered, and special attention is paid to instances of latent and patent avoidance of the lex situs rule. In order to integrate the methodology analysis with the detailed study of choice of law in property, two alternative Models of suggested choice of law rules in property are presented for consideration; Model 1 is intended to be a draft international instrument, whereas Model 2, the more moderate proposal, is intended only as a draft national measure. The Models seek to embody the author's desire to inject a greater degree of flexibility into choice of law rules in property, and to attempt to formulate even-handed solutions to the complex problems (of space, time and policy) which arise in this area of the conflict of laws...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Rational {{individuals}} and organizations constantly seek {{ways to make the}} world a better place to live and do business. No area is this made more manifest than the environment where various types of <b>corporeal</b> <b>property</b> such as land and house constitute a critical factor of shelter and socio-economic growth. Governments, for instance, collate data on buildings for proper street-naming, house numbering and to determine the prospects of internally generated revenue (IGR) from that direction. The property owner also ensures that the house, bought or built with hard earned money, is well maintained in order to enhance its rent and lease value. Similarly, marketers develop clever strategies regularly to sell their products and services, using the most appropriate medium that gives the best mileage in terms of sales and goodwill. The House Sign 1 is an advertising design medium through which the marketer can showcase a brand in an attractive and a favorable way on a site provided by the property owner. The House Sign has a design concept that features three basic elements - house number, street name and a message. Street names and house numbers provide the easiest way of identifying or describing a building in a civilized society where no street should exist without a name and a house without a number. Street naming and house numbering are key issues in urban development. Postal services and police rely on the proper identification of buildings for distributing mails and securing lives and property. The House Sign provides yet another innovative dimension to house numbering in the area of advertising. ...|$|R
5000|$|Hypothec ( [...] or 16th century, from Fr. hypothèque, from Lat. hypotheca, from Gk. : hypothēkē), {{sometimes}} tacit hypothec, is a {{term used}} in mixed legal systems (e.g. Scots law, South African law, Ukrainian law (Іпотека)) to refer to an express or implied non-possessory real security over <b>corporeal</b> movable <b>property.</b> This real right in security operates by way of hypothecation, often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. At common law it is equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge.|$|R
40|$|Possession is a {{legal concept}} {{applying}} {{in a variety of}} legal contexts. In Scottish legal literature, however, there is little in-depth writing on the law of possession, and much of the law is uncertain. This thesis is intended to be a contribution to remedying this deficiency as far as one aspect of the law of possession is concerned, the physical element of possession of <b>corporeal</b> moveable <b>property.</b> As part of this, in the hope that this comparative and historical consideration would shed some light on the issues raised, the law of Rome is considered, along with the law of France, Germany and South Africa, as examples of the Civil Law tradition of legal systems drawing on Roman law. English law is also considered. The thesis is thus able to draw on both of the major traditions influencing the development of Scots law, namely the Civil Law and the Common Law. In this way, the thesis is able to consider {{the extent to which the}} Scots law on possession has been influenced by these two traditions. The thesis begins giving an outline of the law of possession and the place of the physical element within it. The remainder of the thesis considers in detail the physical element and its role in both the acquisition and the loss of possession of <b>corporeal</b> moveable <b>property.</b> One of the difficulties with this is that many different areas of law use a concept called 'possession', and views differ as to the extent to which it is appropriate to talk of a general concept of possession. It is argued in the thesis that a general test can be developed for the physical element of possession, based on control of the property in a manner consistent with the assertion of a right to the property. This test is then developed through consideration of how it applies in a number of specific factual contexts...|$|R
40|$|Spaces of the Ear {{examines}} the concomitant {{emergence of new}} forms of acoustical embodiment across the diverse fields of literature and science in the historical period beginning with the Franco-Prussian War and ending {{with the introduction of}} early information theory in the late 1920 s. In opposition to popular accounts of changes in listening practices around 1900, which typically take the disembodied voices of new media such as the phonograph and radio as true markers of acoustical modernity, the dissertation emphasizes the proliferation of new modes of embodied listening made possible by the explosion of urban and industrial noise, contemporary media technologies, the threat of auditory surveillance, and the imposition of self-observational and self-disciplinary practices as constitutive of artistic, scientific, and everyday life. In doing so, I show how distinct elements of modern soundscapes and corresponding techniques of listening informed both the key thematic and formal elements of literary modernism. In particular, I argue that modernism's often-cited narrative self-reflexivity drew on conceptions of a uniquely embodied listener and the newfound audibility of the body, and overlapped with contemporaneous scientific knowledge surrounding the physiology of the ear {{and the role of the}} body in the perception of sound. Chapter 1 focuses on the role of non-literary discourse on urban noise and the cacophony of the modern battlefield in formal developments central to late nineteenth-century literary aesthetics, taking the largely forgotten Austrian impressionist Peter Altenberg as my primary case study. In Chapter 2 I analyze the ways in which Franz Kafka appropriated elements of the modern soundscape and, in particular, ontological disorders common to the factory worker, in conceptualizing the mechanisms of the modern legal system and its epistemological and perceptual effects on its subjects. Chapter 3 again focuses on works by Kafka, this time juxtaposing scientific practices of self-observation within acoustical research with Kafka's literal and metaphorical figurations of self-auscultation and its function as a narrative strategy in "The Burrow" (1923 / 24). Chapters 4 and 5 sketch out a competing conception of hearing within Gestalt psychology, early stereophonic sound experiments, and literary texts by Robert Musil, which portray the modern listener as surprisingly active and confident in deciphering and navigating an increasingly complex auditory environment. In the process, the site of acoustical embodiment is displaced from the side of the subject to that of the object, engendering notions of "auditory things (Hördinge) " with physical, <b>corporeal</b> <b>properties,</b> which can be traced through space as three-dimensional entities. In the final chapter, I situate the effacement of the listener's body and simultaneous foregrounding of `auditory things' in Musil's novella, "The Blackbird (1928), against the backdrop of early information theory and non-corporeal notions of Rauschen (noise, rustling, static) ...|$|R

A análise e compreensão dos dados foram construídas a partir dos pressupostos teóricos e metodológicos da Produção dos Sentidos dentro do paradigma construcionista que situa o estudo a partir da análise das práticas discursivas. Os resultados obtidos revelam que os relacionamentos se formalizam pela presença do traficante e minimamente mais duas mulheres: a Fiel + A Outra e tantas outras qualificadas como O Lanchinho da Madrugada. As motivações para a efetivação dos citados relacionamentos passam por várias determinações: sedução, fama, status, aquisição de bens materiais entre outros elementos marcam os mesmos.

The Commission is seeking views and suggestions {{from the general}} public about areas {{of the law that}} need reform. An online consultation is available on the Commission's website at www. scotlawcom. gov. uk and people are encouraged to submit their suggestions in this way. Most of the Commission's work is carried out under programmes approved by Scottish Ministers.

40|$|Legal systems tend {{to reflect}} a {{preference}} between mobilia non habent sequelam (moveables cannot be pursued) and nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse habet (no one can transfer to another a greater right than he himself has) in <b>corporeal</b> moveable <b>property</b> title issues in general. Cultural objects merit special treatment, but comparatively few systems have specific rules or exceptions for cultural moveables. General commercial law rules are readily given extended application. A value judgment is involved in denoting an object as 'cultural'. When stolen art moves across jurisdictional lines, courts may use the property transaction {{as a basis for}} classification without checking whether theft attaches thereto. Choice of law method can elevate legal rules above fact and context {{on the basis of the}} broad lex situs rule (the law of the place in which property is situated) of private international law. The lex situs rulestrengthens the commercial imperative as applied to transactions involving cultural objects. This article argues that result-selection is desirable. The applicable law must be selected on the basis of a policy choice in favour of the party who lost possession on account of the vice of theft, and time ought not to affect the deprived owner's rights. This article demonstrates how the acknowledgement of vitium reale (inherent taint or defect in a title to property) in conflicts method eases tensions between private law and criminal law in the art markets in New York and England...|$|R

50|$|As {{noted above}} one cannot steal items “affixed to the earth” because such {{things are not}} {{personal}} property. However, one of the remarkable qualities of property is its shiftiness; its ability to change its character often and quickly, from real to personal and from personal to real. The principal methods of achieving this transformation are attachment and severance. If personal property is attached to land, it becomes real property. And if real property is severed from the land (rendered unattached) it becomes personal property. Examples abound. A person buys a furnace. The furnace company dispatches a technician to deliver and install the heating system. Before installation the heating system is personal <b>property.</b> It has <b>corporeal</b> presence {{and it can be}} moved around as witnessed {{by the fact that the}} technician picked it up at the warehouse, loaded it into his truck, drove it to the house, unloaded it, placed it in the basement and hooked it up to the house. The “hooking up” is the act that transformed what was personal property to real property. Once it is installed it has become “attached to the land” (the house) and is now considered real property. The attachment to the house has to be more than casual for personal property to become real property. For example, a table lamp that is plugged into a wall socket is not real property. A window air conditioning unit is not real property.|$|R
