5000|$|Among Radner's various contributions, the {{one that}} bears his name, Radner {{equilibrium}} (1968), {{is a model of}} financial markets. In the traditional approach if the value of an asset or a <b>contingent</b> <b>claim</b> is affordable then it can be achieved. Not so with incomplete market as the payoff has to be replicable by trading of available assets that are now part of the definition of the economy. The first consequence of such a requirement is that budget sets do not fill the available space and are typically smaller than hyperplanes. Because the dimension of vectors orthogonal to the budget set is larger than one {{there is no reason for}} the price systems supporting an equilibrium to be unique up to scaling, likewise the first order conditions no longer implies that gradient of agents are collinear at equilibrium. Both happen to fail to hold generically: the first theorem of welfare economics is hence the first victim of incompleteness. Pareto-optimality of equilibria generally does not hold. In traditional complete markets any policy would be undone through trading of rational expectation agents. This is no longer the case with incomplete markets as such policy-neutralising trading is no longer necessarily possible. Various policies (tax-related, monetary, etc. [...] ) have an effect when introduced when markets are incomplete. Additionally incompleteness opens the door for a theory of financial innovation with real impact. This was not possible in the traditional complete market general equilibrium model as any <b>contingent</b> <b>claim</b> could be replicated by trading and financial innovation would have no real effect.|$|E

Derivatives, especially derivatives of forward contracts, are likly {{to be important}} for risk management and hedging.

To date, geographical (no-) arbitrage has not {{been included in the}} pricing of <b>contingent</b> <b>claims</b> on forwards. We present a method for pricing European-style <b>contingent</b> <b>claims</b> on forwards using both the usual no-arbitrage conditions and geographical no-arbitrage.

For this example, a call option on a 10 month forward, we find the option price to be relatively insensitive to the network topology (less than 10 %) for a range of strike prices. We speculate that {{this is due to the}} long date leading to geographical arbitrage effects being reduced to log-Normality by the Central Limit Theorem.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} theorems of arbitrage/finance provide {{necessary and}} sufficient {{conditions for a}} market to be arbitrage free and for a market to be complete. An arbitrage opportunity {{is a way of}} making money with no initial investment without any possibility of loss. Though arbitrage opportunities do exist briefly in real life, {{it has been said that}} any sensible market model must avoid this type of profit. The first theorem is important in that it ensures a fundamental property of market models. Completeness is a common property of market models (for instance the Black-Scholes model).

5000|$|The bet on a coin toss is {{a simplistic}} example but {{illustrates}} widely applicable concepts, especially in finance. If markets are complete, {{it is possible}} to arrange a portfolio with any conceivable payoff vector. That is, the state claims available for purchase, represented as payoff vectors, span the payoff space. A pure security or simple <b>contingent</b> <b>claim</b> is a state claim that pays off in only one state. Any state-contingent claim can be regarded as a collection of pure securities. A system of markets is complete if and only if the number of attainable pure securities equals the number of possible states. Formally, a market is complete with respect to a trading strategy, , if there exists a self-financing trading strategy, [...] such that at any time , the returns of the two strategies, [...] and [...] are equal. This is equivalent to stating that for a complete market, all cash flows for a trading strategy can be replicated using a similar synthetic trading strategy.

40|$|In a {{discrete}} setting, we develop {{a model for}} pricing a <b>contingent</b> <b>claim.</b> Since the presence of hedging opportunities influences {{the price of a}} <b>contingent</b> <b>claim,</b> first we introduce the optimal hedging strategy assuming a <b>contingent</b> <b>claim</b> has been issued: a strategy implemented by investing the budget plus the selling price is optimal if it maximizes the expected utility of the agent's revenue, which is the difference between the outcome of the hedging portfolio and the payoff of the claim. Next, we introduce the `reservation price' as a subjective valuation of a <b>contingent</b> <b>claim.</b> This is defined as the minimum price {{to be added to the}} initial budget that makes the issue of the claim more preferable than optimally investing in the available securities.
