40|$|Introduction : This {{research}} study {{was carried out}} for a comparative evaluation of the new acidic primer system (Clearfil Liner Bond 2 V) with conventional phosphoric acid etchant (Rely-a-Bond and Right-On) with regard to shear bond strength and the bracket/adhesive failure mode. The recent advances in materials and appliances have kindled old philosophies. A unique characteristic of some new etching systems is that, they combine the conditioning and priming agents into a single acidic primer solution, for simultaneous use on both enamel and dentin. Materials and methods : Sixty (60) healthy, maxillary and mandibular premolars, freshly extracted {{as a part of}} orthodontic treatment and metal brackets with <b>curved</b> <b>bracket</b> flanges on minimesh-curved bonding base (256 - 650 TP orthodontics, Inc. La Porte, IN 46350) were used for the study. Shear bond strength was tested using a Hounsfield tensometer and the residual adhesive was graded as per Artun and Bergland 1 index. Results and conclusion: The results of the study indicated that acidic primer containing both the enamel etchant and primer have adequate bond strength with decreased residual adhesive left on the enamel surface after debonding, thereby maintaining a sound unblemished enamel surface after debonding orthodontic brackets and less chances of iatrogenic enamel fracture and crazing along with decreased chairside time...|$|E
