50|$|The {{island is}} a birdwatcher's paradise. It {{is home to}} around 91 local species of birds and 50 migratory birds. One can see pintail ducks, common teal, night heron, cormorant, darter, Indian shag, purple heron, gulls, terns, large egrets, {{intermediate}} egret, cattle egret, Indian pond heron, little egret, pheasant-tailed and bronze-winged jacanas, stork-billed kingfisher, watercock, whistling duck, <b>cotton</b> <b>pygmy-goose,</b> little cormorant and whiskered tern. Some people have even reported seeing the monarch flycatcher.|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{output of the}} waterfowl depends on the nutrients present in the eggs. The average clutch of each species of waterfowl has been evolved {{in relation to the}} average availability of food for the female around the time of laying, modified by the relative size of the egg. It has been also suggested that the species laying eggs that were small, relative to their body size, would be able to lay many eggs, whereas species laying large eggs would lay fewer eggs. The <b>Cotton</b> <b>Pygmy-goose</b> eggs were light creamy white or light ivory white in colour on the day of laying with the mean size of 13. 94 + 0. 4 SD. The overall clutch size found was 14. 2. The mean size of the eggs ranges between 13. 50 to 14. 76 cm 2 (mean= 13. 94 + 0. 4 SD). The overall mean length of the egg was found to be 42. 8 mm + 0. 7 SD (range 42. 0 – 44. 6 mm, n= 21), whereas the mean egg width was 32. 4 mm + 0. 5 SD (range = 31. 5 – 33. 1 mm, n= 21). A strong positive and significant relationship exists between egg length and width (r= 0. 8 & p= 0. 0001). The mean weight of the eggs was found to be 25. 006 + 0. 2 SD (range: 24. 5 to 25. 75 gm). Standard methodology was followed to execute the study. The present paper deals with the study of clutch size and various characteristics of eggs of the species in concern and their relation with the female...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} wetland-associated birds was {{conducted}} in 100 ha of wet saltmarsh and its associated ecotonal areas at Twelve Mile Creek from September 2004 to April 2006. The hydrological changes from the seasonal flow of tides and fresh water across the saltmarsh and its surrounds are described. The resulting dynamic mosaic of complex wetland habitats supported many aquatic species {{and one of the}} three known small regional subpopulations of the Endangered Capricorn subspecies of the Yellow Chat Epthianura crocea macgregori (Houston et. al. 2004 a). The survey yielded 64 bird species, including 31 migratory species, mainly present during the wet season (December to March). They included specialised terrestrial and wetland-associated species and some that use both fresh or saline habitats. Five rare or threatened species (Radjah Shelduck, <b>Cotton</b> <b>Pygmy-goose,</b> Black-necked Stork, Capricorn Yellow Chat, Glossy Black Cockatoo) used the wetlands, or the adjacent woodlands, some raising their young. Fifteen species of migratory waders used the area and, on one occasion, the numbers of Sharp-tailed Sandpipers present during their northward migration reached the criterion for significant flyway staging habitat. Terrestrial species records included the Bar-breasted Honeyeater which extended its breeding range south. The diversity of rare or threatened species and migratory species within the study area confirms Twelve Mile Creek wetland as important habitat for birds and of high conservation significance. This result enhances the intrinsically high conservation value of the unique structural complexity of its saltmarsh vegetation within the Fitzroy Delta. Potential threats include industrial expansion, over-grazing and loss of creek surface water in-flows. The latter may be particularly significant based on observations of the saltmarsh habitat and associated dependent fauna (i. e. Yellow Chat) suggesting a link between productivity of the system and freshwater in-flows. Current and future uses and tenures of the land are discussed because they affect future conservation management...|$|E
