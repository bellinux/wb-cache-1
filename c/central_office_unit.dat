May not extend past the expiration date of the license; and 3. May be issued to any licensee if: a. The noncompliance is safety related but does not present an immediate threat to the safety, health or well-being of the child, b. The licensing agency files a Corrective Action Plan (SF 53171) with the <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> Licensing <b>Unit</b> using the Management Gateway for Indiana’s Kids (MaGIK) to correct the areas of noncompliance within the probationary period, and c.

40|$|Abstract—For the single-pair HDSL (HDSL 2), {{the concept}} of having {{different}} upstream and downstream power spectral densi-ties is highlighted. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the input of the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> HDSL terminal <b>unit</b> (HTU-C) can be enhanced by boosting the power output of the remote user HDSL terminal unit (HTU-R). Further improvement in performance {{can be achieved by}} reducing the HTU-C NEXT interference. Two techniques are proposed to reach this goal. The first approach is to reduce the HTU-C transmitter power in the downstream direction for shorter reach cables. The second approach is borrowed from the analog frequency-modulation preemphasis/deemphasis frequency tilting in the upstream direction. Combining the three techniques leads to at least 6 -dB SNR margin improvement for the full reach car-rier serving area loops.

An application for relicensure should be {{signed and dated}} before the date of expiration of the license. If the application for relicensure is not received timely, and the home intends to apply for relicense, the license will remain in effect until renewed. If the requirements for relicensure have not been met but the licensed foster family and DCS has determined that relicensure will proceed, {{it will be necessary}} for the licensing worker to request a license with a Corrective Action Plan. See separate policy, 12. 17 Probationary Status. If the non-compliance of a licensing requirement constitutes a safety concern the licensing worker must submit a request to the <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> Licensing <b>Unit</b> to place the home on probation in addition to implementing a Corrective Action Plan.

40|$|Instructional {{leadership}} for school leaders is a complex, multifaceted task. <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> leaders {{can and must}} support the instructional leadership of school leaders. Yet the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> can sometimes present roadblocks that make it challenging for principals to be effective instructional leaders. Complicating matters {{is the impact of}} context, which can influence the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supports or hinders the instructional leadership of school administrators. ^ This exploratory study examined the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported or hindered the instructional leadership of school administrators. It also examined the way that school district size, type and access to resources may have impacted those interactions. Participants included <b>central</b> <b>office</b> staff involved in teaching and learning as well as school principals and assistant principals in six public school districts in Pennsylvania. A qualitative design was employed. Fifty-one participants were interviewed and asked to provide documents related to curriculum, instruction, professional development, and/or assessment. ^ <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> administrators played a role in managing curriculum, assessment, professional development, and expectations in school districts. Supportive practices included fostering connections between and among school administrators, skill-building/mentoring, and shielding school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Practices that created roadblocks included lack of expertise and quality work products, failure to bring school administrators together around collaborative work, lack of trusting relationships, and failure to shield school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Tension around the balance between school autonomy and coherence to district mandates/needs, the process of change, feedback and accountability, and philosophical differences created additional roadblocks. Context was a relevant factor in the areas of trust and relationships, the amount of autonomy granted to school administrators, and the role of resources. ^ Four main conclusions were drawn. In the districts studied, there was little work on the part of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> around instructional strategies. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> played a more direct role as instructional leaders in schools housed in smaller districts. When the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> engaged in supportive practices, fewer tensions were reported by participants within districts.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on {{the ways in which the}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how the school district's <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and the principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators create and establish effective support for school principals.
