50|$|As {{currently}} defined, Cassytha has a {{wide distribution}} for a genus of so few species. Most are native to Australia, but a few are indigenous to Africa, southern Asia, various islands, and regions in the Americas. Some species {{seem to have been}} <b>spread</b> <b>inadvertently</b> by human agency and probably by birds as well, and now occur on several continents; C. filiformis, for example, grows in Hawaii (where it is said to be indigenous), the Australasian ecozone, northern South America, Central America, southern Florida, Japan, and South Africa. It also appears to have been transported to many major islands, and now is effectively pantropical.|$|R
50|$|Many {{invasive}} species are <b>spread</b> <b>inadvertently</b> by human activities, such as seeds stuck to clothing or mud transporting firewood, or through ballast water. The government has instituted several different policies related to different pathways the {{invasive species}} may be spread. For example, quarantines on a {{federal and state}} level exist for firewood across the Eastern United States {{in an attempt to}} halt the spread of the emerald ash borer, gypsy moth, oak wilt, and others. Transporting firewood out of quarantine zones can result in a fine of up to $1,000,000 and 25 years in jail, but punishments are usually much lower.|$|R

5000|$|Field herpers {{encompass}} a wide ethical spectrum, {{ranging from}} behavioural observation without approaching the animal to [...] "feeder" [...] animal collection for existing herpetoculture. The majority of herpers practice careful capture and release {{in the same}} spot, as many herps have their own territories and replacing them somewhere else would be a disturbance. As wilderness areas shrink, herpers are concentrated into smaller areas, and commercial collectors often encounter field biologists which may have quite different approaches to their study animals. Many species are also threatened or endangered and thus {{it is illegal to}} take them from the wild. Another consideration is spreading of diseases, such as the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis responsible for a worldwide decline in amphibian populations, which may be <b>spread</b> <b>inadvertently</b> by humans.|$|R

40|$|Four {{species of}} Diuris {{temperate}} terrestrial orchids from wild and captive populations were {{tested for the}} presence of polyadenylated RNA viruses. The genomes of three exotic viruses were determined: two potyviruses, Bean yellow mosaic virus and Ornithogalum mosaic virus, and the polerovirus Turnip yellows virus. The genomes of five indigenous viruses were detected, including four novel species. They were the potyvirus Blue squill virus A, another potyvirus, two proposed capilloviruses, and a partitivirus. Partitivirus infection is of interest as this group of viruses is also associated with endophytic fungi (mycorrhizae) that are necessary for the germination, growth, development of many terrestrial orchids. Sequence divergence data indicate post-European, pre-European, and endemic origins for these viruses via inoculum from introduced and native plants. The implications of {{the findings of this study}} for orchid conservation, and particularly reintroduction programs where viruses may be <b>spread</b> <b>inadvertently</b> to wild populations from infected propagation sources, are discussed...|$|R

In {{the first two weeks}} of November, the epidemic rapidly spread across Zimbabwe, appearing in a total of 9 provinces and 54 districts. The disease spread to reach all of Zimbabwe's ten provinces. The attack rate was highest in Beitbridge, Chegutu, Mudzi and Zvimba Districts (above 1,000 cases per 100,000 people or 1.0%).|$|R

5000|$|PTA usually arises as a {{complication}} of an untreated or partially treated episode of acute tonsillitis. The infection, in these <b>cases,</b> <b>spreads</b> to the peritonsillar area (peritonsillitis). This region comprises loose connective tissue and is hence susceptible to {{formation of an}} abscess. PTA can also occur [...] Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be causative. Commonly involved aerobic pathogens include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Haemophilus. The most common anaerobic species include Fusobacterium necrophorum, [...] Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella species, and Bacteroides.|$|R

On April 11, 2012, amid widespread, intense, {{and in some cases}} misleading media coverage, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder by a special prosecutor appointed by Governor Rick Scott. Zimmerman's trial began on June 10, 2013, in Sanford. Opening statements took place on June 24, 2013. Jury deliberations began on July 12. On July 13, 2013, the jury found him not guilty.|$|R

McCullough, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Georgetown University Hospital used ACTA—without Ledley’s knowledge—to examine {{a child who}} hit {{his head in a}} bicycle accident. McCullough used the machine to detect brain bleeding in the boy and the precise information about the location of the bleeding to quickly plan and perform life-saving surgery. News of this and other similar <b>cases</b> <b>spread</b> quickly and Ledley soon faced worldwide demand for machines like ACTA.|$|R
