40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{potential}} market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from different research streams have failed to converge on a single, robust estimate. What these previous research streams share are untested or implausible assumptions about consumer response to new transportation technology. We frame the BEV purchase decision {{in terms of a}} household's entire stock of vehicles, car purchase behavior and travel behavior. Within this framework, households which own both electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles are called 'hybrid households'. Because nearly all consumers are unfamiliar with the characteristics of BEVs, we designed an interactive interview based on week-long travel diaries, which we <b>call</b> <b>Purchase</b> Intentions and Range Estimation Games (PIREG) to explore hypothetical hybrid household vehicle use. Our primary finding is that consumers' perceived driving range needs are substantially lower than previous hypothetical stated preference studies conclude. We find evidence of a viable market for BEVs with 60 to 100 miles driving range. ...|$|E

They {{have been widely used}} to judge countries' performance in cost-containment, and in the United Kingdom have been widely quoted in debates about the funding of the National Health Service. This paper challenges conclusions drawn from simple analyses of this topic, which have used dubious and inappropriate data, questionable methods and assumptions, and simplistic ad-hoc reasoning. It looks particularly at price differences between countries, which have usually been hidden by using exchange rates to standardize national figures. When more appropriate conversion factors <b>called</b> <b>purchasing</b> power parities are used, many of the simple and conventionally-accepted conclusions no longer appear so obvious. The attempt to create apparent scientific facts for policy debates has been based on a misuse of international comparisons...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAnalysts are frequently confronted with time-series data. A simple form is magnitude (or count) and time frame, whether {{the data is}} number of e-mails sent, number of cell phones <b>called,</b> <b>purchases</b> made by volume or cost, or {{a variety of other}} time-derived data. Studying the temporal dimension of data allows analysts more opportunities to find relational ties and trends in data, classify or group like activity, and even help narrow the search space of massively complex and large datasets. This thesis presents a new approach called the Rule Based Intuition (RBI) system that can evaluate time-series data by finding the best fitting rule, from a repository of known rules, to quickly infer information about the data. This approach is most applicable for analysts viewing large sets of data who wish to classify or correlate data from users' temporal activity. Outstanding ThesisUS Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
