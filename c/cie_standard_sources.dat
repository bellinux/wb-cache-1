40|$|As {{a part of}} this paper, the {{influence}} of various parameters within the target process of graphic reproduction on the color appearance of the neon color spreading effect was investigated. The shift in a color appearance qualitatively is determined through the calculation of changes in perceptual attributes of color, i. e. differences in lightness, chroma and hue. The influence of different media (printed images, and LCD display) in the “cross-media” system was examined, as well as the role of the inserted segment color choice and background of the primary stimulus as an element of design solutions. These parameters were evaluated in a variety of ambient conditions and under the observation of three <b>CIE</b> <b>standard</b> light <b>sources</b> and illuminants. It was found that it was mostly the changes of the chroma and lightness. The change in the color hue is the lowest...|$|R

This {{standard}} defines the spectral power distribution of the two fundamental colorimetric illuminants, Illuminant A and D 65 at 1 nm intervals to six significant digits. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of <b>CIE</b> <b>Standard</b> Illuminat A is based on Planck's law, the relative spectral power distribution has been calculated using Plank's formula at every nanometer between 300 nm and 830 nm. Although the SPD could be calculated also at intermediate wavelength directly from Planck's formula, the standard states that for such wavelengths linear interpolation should be used. The difference between the linearly interpolated value and the exact SPD calculated from Planck's formula is at 300 nm of the order of 10 - 4, at longer wavelength it becomes even less significant. Thus one can state tha...|$|R
