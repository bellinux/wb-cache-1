5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view.</b> She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E
25|$|Instruments used in {{the show}} include keyboards, bass, drums, percussion, violin, and various wind instruments. There are {{numerous}} instrumental solos, with the violin, flute, and accordion among the instruments heard.

25|$|Uranus {{exhibits}} a considerable seasonal variation over its 84-year orbit. It is generally brighter near solstices and dimmer at equinoxes. The variations are largely caused {{by changes in}} the viewing geometry: a bright polar region <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> near solstices, while the dark equator is visible near equinoxes. Still there exist some intrinsic variations of the reflectivity of the atmosphere: periodically fading and brightening polar caps as well as appearing and disappearing polar collars.|$|E
25|$|The top of Burnbank Fell is {{a rounded}} grassy dome, the summit marked {{by an old}} fence post and small cairn. The Lakeland view is greatly {{restricted}} by Blake Fell {{although there is a}} vista of the Northern and North Western Fells. Loweswater is hidden by the slope although Crummock Water <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> a few paces to the north east. The view of the coast, Isle of Man, Solway Firth and Criffel is uninterrupted.|$|E
25|$|The scenery of the Sa Pa {{region in}} large part {{reflects}} {{the relationship between the}} minority people and nature. This is seen especially in the paddy fields carpeting the rolling lower slopes of the Hoàng Liên Mountains. The impressive physical landscape which underlies this has resulted from the work of the elements over thousands of years, wearing away the underlying rock. On a clear day, the imposing peak of Fan Si Pan <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view.</b> The last major peak in the Himalayan chain, Fan Si Pan offers a real challenge to even the keenest walker, the opportunity of staggering views, and a rare glimpse of some of the last remaining primary rain forest in Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|As {{the roadway}} heads westward, it meets the western (southern for state purposes) {{terminus}} of US4 {{across from a}} Hannaford supermarket along the busy commercial strip in East Greenbush. Shortly afterwards {{the first sign of}} the state capital, the Erastus Corning Tower, starts becoming visible. At a bluff east of the river, the entire Albany skyline <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> as the road descends, passing the northern terminus of NY9J south of Rensselaer. Routes 9 and 20 then cross the Hudson River via the Dunn Memorial Bridge into Albany as Corning Tower and the other buildings of Empire State Plaza loom ahead, and the two routes separate, with 20 heading west across the city.|$|E
25|$|Plings {{are also}} used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an {{application}} directory: a folder that when double clicked executes a program file inside called !Run. Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the application needs to run. The appfolder {{can be viewed as}} a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> of the filer), !Sprites (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if !Boot cannot be found) and !Help (a text, HTML or other executable file listed in the filer menu for the application) also start with a pling.|$|E

500|$|Night Trap was {{developed}} over {{six months and}} was part movie shoot, and part programming. The film was shot on 35 mm film in Culver City, CA across 16 days in 1987, with editing taking another few months. The film was directed by James Riley. The director of photography was Don Burgess, who later went on to shoot the award-winning Forrest Gump (1994). Originally the set {{was going to be}} darker, but it was made brighter for fear the footage would pixelate in-game. The script was unusual because it was built around the multi-linear gameplay. Riley was focused on timing the shoots correctly to sync the movement of actors among the rooms. There were four scenes occurring simultaneously at any given time, although there were eight rooms (the other four being still images). Dana Plato was the most famous actor involved, known for her work on the American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes (1978–86). Plato's career was spiraling downward at the time, partially due to her personal problems with drugs and alcohol. At first, she was eager to work on Night Trap, but later she became more problematic. She reportedly made little effort {{to hide the fact that}} doing this project was a huge step down from her previous popularity. The Augers were played by stuntmen. They developed a hobbling walk so that they would always be prepared to fall when the traps dropped under their feet. The software {{was developed}} concurrently with the filming and editing. Through developing Night Trap, Fulop and his team came to realize their old-fashioned development methods did not always work with interactive movies. The team could not go back and [...] "tweak" [...] on-screen elements and other assets, such as inserting new scenes or changing the time an actor <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view.</b> They had to work with the video footage they were handed over.|$|E
2500|$|As {{it enters}} the Ridge-and-Valley {{province}} (of which the Tennessee Valley is a part), I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. At mile 351, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the Kingston Fossil Plant and its [...] twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. The road widens to four lanes at mile 368 as I-40 merges with I-75. Knoxville's skyline <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> at mile 387 before the road passes through downtown Knoxville.|$|E

2500|$|In the novel's climax, {{youngest}} daughter Denver {{reaches out and}} searches for help from the black community, {{and some of the}} village women arrive at the house to exorcise Beloved. At the same time, a white man <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view,</b> the same man that helped Halle's mother, Baby Suggs, by offering her the house as a place to stay after Halle bought her from their owner. He has come for Denver, who asked him for a job, but Denver has not shared this information with Sethe. Unaware of the situation, Sethe attacks the white man with an ice pick and is brought down by the village women. While Sethe is confused and has a [...] "re-memory" [...] of her master coming again, Beloved disappears. The novel resolves with Denver becoming a working member of the community and Paul D returning to Sethe and pledging his love.|$|E
2500|$|Inside the park, NY23A {{deviates}} {{from the}} creek at various points, occasionally {{losing sight of}} the waterway, but it consistently follows the creek valley of the upper Schoharie to within {{a few miles of}} its source. At the first bend taking the stream away from the road, NY42 comes up from the hamlet of Lexington to the immediate south, the first of four state routes to terminate at NY23A. The road, previously level, begins to climb gently and steadily as it heads away from NY42 and into the center of Greene County. Around the crossing of the East Kill [...] east of Lexington, Rusk Mountain, the first major peak, <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view</b> to the south. The route continues to wind its way through the town of Jewett to the western fringe of the village of Hunter, where it connects to the south end of NY296, a connector route that leads to NY23 north of Hensonville.|$|E
2500|$|Carrie oversees a {{prisoner}} exchange: Saul for five Taliban members. When Saul <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view,</b> however, Carrie sees {{a young boy}} behind him wearing a suicide vest. Carrie goes herself to retrieve Saul, and persuades him to let the exchange go forward and come with her. As {{they go back to}} the U.S. Embassy, their car is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Marines pull Carrie and Saul from the wreckage, and take them back the embassy, which has been invaded by Haqqani's forces. The White House orders U.S. forces out of Pakistan and relieves Carrie of her command. [...] When Quinn kidnaps Farhad Ghazi (Tamer Burjaq), the ISI agent who kidnapped Saul, Carrie asks Lockhart to let her stay in Islamabad so she can bring him in. She finds Quinn and pleads with him to leave the country, but he refuses and escapes. She later stops him from assassinating Haqqani, and sees that Haqqani has Adal in his entourage. Meanwhile, she receives a phone call from Maggie, who tells her that their father has died. Carrie finds some solace in talking to Frannie, and decides to be a better mother to her.|$|E

2500|$|Out of Valemount, the {{eastbound}} train {{uses the}} Albreda Subdivision, which continues climbing along and often {{clings to the}} side of mountains from which there are views of the mountains and valleys below and beyond. Eventually and finally, the train rounds a sweeping curve (near Jackman, at Milepost 65.5) and heads in a more easterly direction though still high up on the mountainside. Mount Robson <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>view.</b> At , it is the tallest mountain in the Canadian Rockies. The mountain often makes its own weather and can be seen in its entirety fewer than 20 days a years. Even with the clouds, it can still be a scenic highlight for train passengers. The train has also been passing through Mount Robson Provincial Park. [...] The train passes through a [...] tunnel, where in 1905 an avalanche buried railroad workers, and continues its descent to Redpass, where it joins with the Robson Subdivision. It is lower in elevation and has more favourable grades for westbound trains than the Albreda Subdivision. The Robson Subdivision is used by westbound freights, the westbound Canadian and the westbound Jasper – Prince Rupert train. The eastbound Jasper – Prince Rupert train and eastbound freights off the Tête Jaune Subdivision from Prince George and Prince Rupert use the Albreda Subdivision. Incidentally, Tête Jaune ("Yellowhead" [...] in French) and Yellowhead (Highway, Pass, Mountain, etc.) get their names from Pierre Bostonais, an Iroquois-Métis man who had blond hair.|$|E
