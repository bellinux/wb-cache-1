5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} of neural development characterized by {{impaired social interaction}} and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive <b>communication</b> <b>skills.</b> People with autism {{have been found to}} have strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.|$|E

5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help {{children with autism}} gain self-care, social, and <b>communication</b> <b>skills.</b> Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Clinical {{competence}} has four essential components: knowledge, physical exam, {{problem solving and}} <b>communication</b> <b>skill.</b> The <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> isn’t an optional extra in medical training {{but it is a}} core clinical skill. This study is performed in order to determine whether <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> training for Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease residents improves their clinical competence. Methods : This study was performed in 2004 - 2005 in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Thirteen internal Medicine and Infectious Disease residents were involved in this study. We had 8 residents in group one and 5 residents in group two. Group one first participated in <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> workshop and then their clinical skill was evaluated with objective structured clinical examination (OSCE 1). Group two’s clinical skill was first evaluated with OSCE 1 and then after participating in <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> workshop again their clinical skill was evaluated by OSCE 2. The scores of group one in OSCE 1 after participation in <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> workshop were compared to group two in OSCE 1 before the workshop. The scores of group two before the <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> workshop (OSCE 1) and after the workshop (OSCE 2) were compared.

It also reports the relationship between students' demographic and students' <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> development. A total of 1, 227 students completed the pre survey and 485 usable surveys were collected in the post survey. Survey consists of 13 communication items developed based on previous studies. Factor analysis conducted has identified underlying two underlying constructs, namely Adjustment and Message. Using paired test, findings reveal that students' <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> has developed significantly. The findings show that students significantly developed in both constructs however, they performed better in the Message construct. The findings also show that {{both male and female}} students developed significantly in this skill. Malay students were found to develop greater <b>communication</b> <b>skill</b> compared to their non-Malay counterparts. It also appeared that Science and Engineering students developed a highly significant in <b>communication</b> <b>skill.</b> Meanwhile, Social Science students showed no development.

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> develop as they grow older. <b>Communication</b> <b>skills</b> aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly {{because there is}} a danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully.

5|$|There is {{no single}} treatment, and the {{effectiveness}} of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

Methods: This study used a non-equivalent control pre-test-posttest design. The simulation-based education in maternity nursing practicum consisted of two clinical sit-uation scenarios pertaining to patients with normal and high-risk deliveries. The control group consisted of 35 stu-dents in 2010 and the experimental group consisted of 35 students in 2009. The experimental group was given the simulation-based education using a high-fidelity patient simulator over 3 sessions, whereas the control group was given a conventional pre-clinical practice orientation before maternity nursing clinical practicum.
