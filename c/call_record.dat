[...] He also says the fixation on the <b>call</b> <b>record</b> program in public debate is unfortunate, because NSA Internet surveillance is far broader and more invasive. [...] "It's a shiny, shiny bright spot, but there's a whole lot more being collected," [...] he says, including a [...] "staggering" [...] amount of American communications. Drake believes support from the Obama administration for the Freedom Act is motivated in part by a desire to hobble lawsuits against the <b>call</b> <b>record</b> program, three of which are pending with appeals courts and may lay the groundwork for a major Supreme Court privacy ruling.|$|E

50|$|Stock loan quasi-mortgages are {{callable}} if {{the value}} of the portfolio drops below a prescribed point, typically 130% of {{the value of}} whatever has been drawn. Unlike margin loans, however, most securities-based credit lines - of which a stock loan quasi-mortgage is an example - allow liberal call cure periods and multiple means to resolve the collateral issue, including the restructuring of some of the portfolio into less volatile securities. The best programs typically have a very good <b>call</b> <b>record,</b> with few or none, making the risk of a call relatively negligible.|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{have become}} {{increasingly}} interested in better understanding the survey data collection process in interviewer-administered surveys. However, tools for analysing paradata capturing information about field processes, also called <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data, are still not yet fully explored. This paper introduces sequence analysis as a simple tool for investigating such data {{with the aim of}} better understand ing and improving survey processes. A novel approach is to use sequence analysis within interviewers, which allows the identification of unusual interviewer calling behaviours, and may provide guidance on interviewer performance. Combining the technique with clustering, optimal matching and multidimensional scaling, the method offers a way of visualising, displaying and summarising complex <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data. The method is introduced to inform survey management and survey monitoring. Sequence analysis is applied to <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data from the UK Understanding Society survey.

40|$|In recent years, survey {{agencies}} {{have started to}} collect detailed <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data, including information on the timing and outcome of each interviewer call to a household. In interview-based household surveys, such information {{may be used to}} inform effective interviewer calling behaviours, which are critical in achieving co-operation and reducing the likelihood of refusal. However, <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data can be complex and it is not always clear how best to model such data. We present a general framework for the analysis of <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data by using multilevel event history modelling. A multilevel multinomial logistic regression approach is proposed in which the different possible outcomes at each call are modelled jointly, accounting for the clustering of calls within households and interviewers. Of particular interest are the influences of time varying characteristics on the outcome of a call. The analysis of interviewer <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data is illustrated by using paradata from several face-to-face household surveys with the aim of modelling non-response...|$|E

40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} in life course research and more recently has been applied by survey methodologists to summarize complex <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data.

The results illustrate the complex relationship between these costs and the output variables which summarize the <b>call</b> <b>record</b> data. Regardless of the choice of costs, there was a low correlation between the summary variables and the key survey variables, limiting the scope for bias reduction.
