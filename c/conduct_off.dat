Despite starting all 11 games in 2003 as a sophomore, Croyle suffered a separated shoulder before half time of the fifth game.

Nails and rivets were with difficulty got to hold in {{the sides of the}} old Indianian. On August 14th John Paul Jones again set sail for English waters, with the following vessels: Alliance, thirty-six; Pallas, thirty; Cerf, eighteen; Vengeance, twelve; and two French privateers. Owing to the humiliating conditions imposed upon him by the French Minister of Marine, Commodore Jones did not have absolute command. In a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the Cerf parted company, never to return.

50|$|Although the Pakistan Coast Guard was {{established}} by the Government of Pakistan {{under the command of}} Pakistan Army and operated by the Ministry of Interior, the Coast Guard was unable to <b>conduct</b> <b>off</b> shore operations and execute law enforcement missions, this was instead done by the Pakistan Navy. The Government of Pakistan adopted the genesis of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982 and acquired an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 240000 sq mi. In order to provide protection to this vast area, the Pakistan Government decided to raise the Agency under the Ministry of Defence consisting the members of Navy. The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) was formally inaugurated on 1 January 1987 and gained its constitutional status in 1997 after ratification of the UNCLOS. The agency implements the local and international laws in the EEZ, and provides surveillance against poaching by illegal vessels and unauthorized survey by foreign craft. It also conducts Search and Rescue missions, and implements measures for control of pollution and fishery protection.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his conviction, Bell was placed in Stage 2 of the NHL/NHLPA Substance Abuse Program and was suspended for 15 games without pay by the NHL on September 12, 2007. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman justified the suspension, saying [...] "Playing in the National Hockey League is a privilege, and with that privilege comes a corresponding responsibility for exemplary <b>conduct</b> <b>off</b> the ice {{as well as on}} it". The NHLPA disagreed, saying [...] "there is no legitimate purpose served by adding a substantial league disciplinary suspension to the severe sanctions that have already been imposed". Leafs manager John Ferguson, Jr., who drew criticism for the trade, had anticipated that Bell would face some sort of suspension, however based upon past precedent they did not expect it to be so lengthy. This had been suggested as a sign that the NHL was imposing stricter discipline for off-ice antics of players, after Michael Vick was expelled from the NFL {{as a result of his}} conviction for running a dog-fighting ring.|$|E

40|$|There {{are strong}} grounds upon {{which it can}} be argued that the English Premier League (EPL) holds global appeal. This article carries out a {{semiotic}} analysis on the role that Liverpool F. C. ’s Bootle-born defender, Jamie Carragher holds amongst two spatially disparate supporter communities, one principally based in Liverpool and the other in Texas. Despite the historical influence and connection with locally born players, evolving European migration patterns and continental football philosophies have limited the progression of ‘Scouse’ players at Liverpool. Jamie Carragher is a contemporary exception, who has become a focal point for the ‘local’ supporters’ affections. His status has been propelled by his interpretation and implementation of the core working class values of the city and the club, displayed through his <b>conduct</b> <b>off</b> the pitch and his performances on it. Drawing from the perspectives of ‘local’ and Texas-based fans, this paper expands upon these issues, and examines Liverpool supporters’ evolving heroism of Jamie Carragher.
