5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{publicize}} the N-3PB operations, the British Air Ministry circulated a report that two Norwegian-flown aircraft {{had been involved in}} the attack on the German battleship Bismarck on 21–22 May 1941, but it was merely an example of wartime propaganda. Despite many aviation historians disputing the <b>claim,</b> <b>it</b> still appears in current accounts of the sinking of the Bismarck.|$|E

5|$|Long term {{proposals}} by {{the province}} call for Highway 404 {{to be extended}} to Highway12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway48. It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> will only serve to accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, {{but then}} {{handed it over}} to a Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000. In 2002 the company claimed that an American woman {{underwent}} a standard cloning procedure {{that led to the}} birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). Although few believe the <b>claim,</b> <b>it</b> nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status.|$|E
5|$|The Gators later {{drove to}} the 4-yard line before they were held on downs. After Dodd's punt to midfield, the Gators' {{engineered}} their final scoring drive. A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh to Van Sickel got the Gators out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was wide and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> was blocked.|$|E

5|$|A later {{record of}} Eastern Chalukyas {{mentions}} the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of Ayodhya came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess. She {{had a child}} called Vijayaditya who is {{claimed to be the}} PulakeshinI's father. However, according to the historians K. V. Ramesh, Chopra and Sastri, there are Badami Chalukya inscriptions that confirm Jayasimha was Pulakeshin I's grandfather and Ranaranga, his father. Kamath and Moraes <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin.|$|E

The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E

5|$|Despite Queen's Park {{entering}} the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers {{who won the}} game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during play, and the referee later {{said that they had}} scored once more but as the players did not attempt to <b>claim</b> <b>it,</b> he had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885.|$|E

He attempts to <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan).|$|E
5|$|June was {{considered}} to be a fast linebacker and a specialized talent with a better likelihood of success in a defensive scheme that was built around speed rather than size. On March 17, 2007, he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who used the defensive scheme designed by Dungy. The New York Giants and Colts were also interested in signing June. The contract was believed to be a three-year, $12million agreement, but some later reports <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> was a four-year, $17million contract.|$|E

5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} sighting of Lord Howe Island {{took place on}} 17 February 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, commander of the Armed Tender HMS Supply, was en route from Botany Bay to found a penal settlement on Norfolk Island. On the return journey Ball sent a party ashore on Lord Howe Island to <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> as a British possession. It subsequently became a provisioning port for the whaling industry, and was permanently settled in June 1834. When whaling declined, the 1880s saw {{the beginning of the}} worldwide export of the endemic kentia palms, which remains a key component of the Island's economy. The other continuing industry, tourism, began after World War II ended in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Castleshaw Roman fort was a castellum in the Roman {{province}} of Britannia. Although {{there is no}} evidence to substantiate the <b>claim,</b> <b>it</b> has been suggested that Castleshaw Roman fort is the site of Rigodunum, a Brigantian settlement. The remains of the fort are located on Castle Hill on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley at the foot of Standedge but overlooking the valley. The hill is on the edge of Castleshaw in Greater Manchester. The fort was constructed in c.AD79, but fell out of use at some time during the 90s. It was replaced by a smaller fortlet, built in c.105, around which a civilian settlement grew. It may have served as a logistical and administrative centre, although it was abandoned in the 120s.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian {{had been given the}} title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, or at least the senate, was {{aware of the fact that}} it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the linchpin of existence—so he can <b>claim</b> <b>it</b> for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand.|$|E
