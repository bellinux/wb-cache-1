A small survey had been done with fans of the show by the show's producers, Fireworks Entertainment, where fans had voted for a VHS release at the then official Queen of Swords website (Fireworks noted they would not be making DVD collections of the series during the survey). The set was manufactured in Canada by Fireworks themselves and was sold by CanWest Global. It was made available only through online ordering to customers in the United States and Canada (NTSC region 1 format) through the official Queen of Swords website linked through Fireworks' official website at the time. It was an 8 volume VHS set (limited to under 1,000 sets made). The first tape contained episode 1 while the remaining 7 tapes contained 3 episodes each. The set cost $99.99 US/$149.99 Canada, plus shipping costs. A certificate of authenticity card sheet was also released with the set, inside the box of the first tape volume. The VHS set sold out within months. A promised special addition to the first episode's tape was not included with initial earlier pressed tapes delivered to customers, a ninth tape (which was a re-issue of the first episode volume, this time with the bonus content added at the end; the bonus material included was a lengthy set of clips and promo scenes from the series with the theme song [...] "Behind the Mask" [...] being played) was later sent to all who purchased the sets from CanWest.

These defects can be studied by activation energy (Ea). Therefore, this paper presents a method for calculating activation energy of silicon p-n junctions from volume generation current. It combines temperature-dependent current–voltage (I – V) and capacitance–voltage (C-V) measurements of diodes. The Ig can be found from the volume leakage current by subtraction of the volume diffusion current, which is calculated while the depletion width is zero. The activation energy (Ea) is derived from slope of an Arrhenius plot of Ig. To derive the correct slope the temperature dependence of the depletion width, which is obtained from the <b>corrected</b> <b>volume</b> capacitance has been applied.

40|$|A {{new model}} of the {{observed}} universe, using solutions to the full Einstein equations, is developed from the hypothesis that our observable universe is an underdense bubble, with an internally inhomogeneous fractal bubble distribution of bound matter systems, in a spatially flat bulk universe. It is argued {{on the basis of}} primordial inflation and resulting structure formation, that the clocks of the isotropic observers in average galaxies coincide with clocks defined by the true surfaces of matter homogeneity of the bulk universe, rather than the comoving clocks at average spatial positions in the underdense bubble geometry, which are in voids. This understanding requires a systematic reanalysis of all observed quantities in cosmology. I begin such a reanalysis by giving a model of the average geometry of the universe, which depends on two measured parameters: the present matter density parameter, Omega_m, and the Hubble constant, H_ 0. The observable universe is not accelerating. Nonetheless, inferred luminosity distances are larger than naively expected, in accord with the evidence of distant type Ia supernovae. The predicted age of the universe is 15. 3 +/- 0. 7 Gyr. The expansion age is larger than in competing models, and may account for observed structure formation at large redshifts.

40|$|The {{unexpected}} dimness of Type Ia supernovae at redshifts z >~ 1 {{has over}} the past 7 years been seen as {{an indication that the}} expansion of the universe is accelerating. A new model cosmology, the "fractal bubble model", has been proposed by one of us [gr-qc/ 0503099], based on the idea that our observed universe resides in an underdense bubble remnant from a primordial epoch of cosmic inflation, together with a new solution for averaging in an inhomogeneous universe. Although there is no cosmic acceleration, it is claimed that the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae data will nonetheless fit the new model, since it mimics a Milne universe at low redshifts. In this paper the hypothesis is tested statistically against the available type Ia supernovae data by both chi-square and Bayesian methods. While the standard model with cosmological constant Omega_Lambda = 1 -Omega_m is favoured by a Bayesian analysis with wide priors, the comparison depends strongly on the priors chosen for the density parameter, Omega_m. The fractal bubble model gives better agreement generally for Omega_m< 0. 2. It also gives reasonably good fits for all the range, Omega_m= 0. 01 - 0. 55, allowing the possibility of a viable cosmology with just baryonic matter, or alternatively with both baryonic matter and additional cold dark matter.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Barostat {{methodology}} {{is widely}} used for assessing visceral perception. Different barostat protocols are described {{with respect to the}} measurement of rectal compliance and visceral perception. The choice of protocols affects the duration, which is normally 60 - 90 min, and accuracy of the procedure. This study aimed to shorten the procedure by using the semi-random distension protocol for both compliance and visceral perception measurement and a correction based on rectal capacity (RC) instead of minimal distension pressure (MDP). METHODS: Twelve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (7 females) and 11 healthy controls (8 females) underwent a barostat procedure. Compliance was determined during both a staircase distension and a semi-random protocol. Visceral perception data were compared as a function of pressure or relative volume, corrected for MDP or RC, respectively. RESULTS: Compliance measurement using the semi-random protocol instead of the staircase distension protocol resulted in an overestimation in healthy volunteers, but not in IBS patients. The overall conclusion that IBS patients had a lower compliance compared to controls was not different between protocols. Data presentation of the visceral perception scores as a function of <b>corrected</b> <b>volume</b> instead of pressures corrected for MDP did not alter the conclusion that sensation scores in IBS patients were higher as compared to healthy controls.

Adolescence is thought to be {{a critical}} period in both the maturation of the olfactocentric paralimbic cortex and in the emergence of bipolar disorder pathology. Together, these factors implicate a central role for the olfactocentric paralimbic cortex in the development of bipolar disorder and suggest that abnormalities in this cortex may be expressed by adolescence in the disorder. We tested the hypothesis that differences in olfactocentric paralimbic cortex structure are a morphological feature in adolescents with bipolar disorder. Subjects included 118 adolescents (41 with bipolar disorder and 77 healthy controls). Cortical grey matter volume differences between adolescents with and without bipolar disorder were assessed with voxel-based morphometry analyses of high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Compared with healthy comparison adolescents, adolescents with bipolar disorder demonstrated significant volume decreases in olfactocentric paralimbic regions, including orbitofrontal, insular and temporopolar cortices. Findings in these regions survived small volume correction (P[*]<[*] 0. 05, <b>corrected).</b> <b>Volume</b> decreases in adolescents with bipolar disorder were also noted in inferior prefrontal and superior temporal gyri and cerebellum.

The importance of these cortices in emotional and social development, and support for a central role for these cortices in the development of bipolar disorder, suggest that study of the development of these cortices in health and in bipolar disorder is critically needed...|$|E

METHODS: From August 1998 to February 2003, 37 patients (28 men and 9 women; 20 - 89 years old, mean 40 years) underwent PSAE for blunt injuries. One patient required secondary splenectomy after PSAE. Early complications were investigated during the hospital stay. Delayed follow-up included {{review of the}} outpatient records, telephone interview, consultation, US-Doppler splenic study, Howell-Jolly body search, and serum antibody titer determinations (pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae B). RESULTS: No early postprocedural complications were depicted. Ten patients were lost on follow-up. Two patients had a telephone interview that revealed no complication. Twenty-four patients were examined 6 to 63 (mean 26) months after the embolization. No late complication was reported. Splenic measurements were in the normal range: length (53 - 110 mm; mean, 73), width (49 - 110 mm; 76), thickness (26 - 56 mm; 38), volume (61 - 508 mL; 226), standard ellipsoid formula volume (32 - 265 mL; 118), <b>corrected</b> <b>volume</b> (29 - 238 mL; 106), and splenic volumetric index (2. 3 - 18. 8; 8. 4).
