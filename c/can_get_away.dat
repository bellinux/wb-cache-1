5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E

Jadis appears, having herself eaten an apple to become immortal; she tempts Digory either to eat an apple himself and join her in immortality, or steal one to take back to Earth to heal his dying mother. Digory resists, knowing his mother would never condone theft, but hesitates. He sees through the Witch's ploy when she {{suggests}} he leave Polly behind—not knowing Polly <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> by her own ring. Foiled, the Witch departs for the North. Digory returns to Narnia and plants the apple, which grows into a mature tree behind them whilst the coronation proceeds. Aslan tells Digory how the tree works: anyone who steals the apples gets their heart's desire, but {{in a form that}} makes it unlikeable. In the Witch's case, she has achieved immortality, but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart. Moreover, the magic apples are now a horror to her, such that the apple tree will repel her for centuries to come. With Aslan's permission, Digory then takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother. Aslan returns Digory, Polly, and Uncle Andrew to England; Frank and his wife, Helen (transported from England by Aslan) stay to rule Narnia as its first King and Queen.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} {{draft of the}} episode, Peter being asked easy questions during Trivial Pursuit {{was meant to be}} by chance, but executive producer David A.

Prior to the episode broadcast, several sequences were shown after Peter discovers he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with anything on the basis that he is mentally challenged including a [...] "how loud can I yell" [...] experiment, as well as tackling down an opponent going for a touchdown while attending a New England Patriots game, but they were not deemed funny enough and scrapped.|$|E
500|$|The film did not {{initially}} receive a big {{response from the}} public, and was not a box office success upon its release. However, after the directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen wrote positive comments on it, people began to watch the film and appreciate it, leading Aval Appadithan to develop a cult following. In November 2014, Haasan defended the financial failure of the film, [...] "Aval Appadithan was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. It slipped through their fingers, so to speak. With all the attention that films get these days, I doubt we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with such a film any more." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{language}} in the episode, Parker has said that they [...] "felt the pressure {{to live up to}} Spirit of Christmas", which contains a lot of obscenities, and as a result, they [...] "tried to push things... maybe further than we should". In particular, Parker said that they felt the need [...] "to put in dildo and every word we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with." [...] In contrast, they allowed subsequent episodes to [...] "be more natural", saying that those episodes are [...] "more about bizarre happenings and making fun of things that are taboo", [...] "without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there." ...|$|E

500|$|The Griffins invite {{their neighbors}} over for game night. While playing Trivial Pursuit, Lois uses {{questions}} from the preschool edition for Peter in order to let him win. When Peter wins, he brags to everyone, believing himself to be smarter than everyone else. Irritated at Peter's arrogance, Brian challenges Peter to take the MacArthur Fellows Program test to prove he is a genius. The results of the test show that Peter is not a genius; in fact, the results show that, technically speaking, Peter is [...] "mentally retarded." [...] Peter sinks into depression after being publicly labeled as retarded. While driving home with Lois, Peter accidentally knocks down Tom Tucker. Tucker, recognizing Peter as [...] "the retarded fellow," [...] does not press charges, and Peter realizes his condition means he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with anything.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} some mixed reviews, however. Louis Pattison, reviewing for NME, {{said that the}} album would {{not be considered a}} classic, but complimented the material for a reduced emphasis on shock value. A reviewer for Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "A lack of 'oomph' prevents the album from landing a gut punch that would cover all of its flaws. Like an aging boxer, Manson lands jabs and the occasional uppercut, but he never topples his opponent." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph compared the record to the early work of English gothic rock band Bauhaus, and said that while it was [...] "undeniably effective [...] in small bursts," [...] he found the whole [...] "wearingly abrasive". Daniel Sylvester of Exclaim!, although he admired the ambition of the album, complained it was [...] "lazy when it <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it".|$|E
500|$|Not {{all agree}} with McCaw's playing style and {{many believe that}} he pushes the {{boundaries}} of legality.

Shortly after the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final, veteran France back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy criticised McCaw saying that [...] "he played the whole match in our [...] camp." [...] Former Australian coach Eddie Jones and flanker Phil Waugh say he does no {{more than any other}} good openside, but his skill at judging how the referee will interpret the breakdown is the main reason for his success. McCaw admits that he tests the referee early [...] "to know what you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with" [...] and that only an [...] "idiot" [...] would not adapt to their rulings.|$|E

500|$|While {{testing the}} limits of what he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with, such as {{interrupting}} church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying [...] "testicles" [...] through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a [...] "Fryolator" [...] and wants to take it home. [...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks {{that the best way to}} do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN said, [...] "If Britney Spears' Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{illuminates}} anything it's that Spears is {{a fairly}} proficient sonic chameleon, able to mimic and adopt the stylings {{of those who have}} come before her with enough panache and verve to convince younger generations that she's a bona fide pop revelation. [...] This is the kind of kitschy album that you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great a listen as a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, maybe, if we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E
