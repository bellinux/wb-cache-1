2500|$|While {{we could}} not take back what {{happened}} to the Scottsboro Boys 80 years ago, we found a way to make it right moving forward.

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Keating, and {{renaming}} COP Keating after him, a “Night Letter” appeared {{on the door of}} the Upper Kamdesh mosque on April 29 of 2007. Part of the letter stated: [...] “At the present time for those who work and obey the American devils by taking contracts for building schools, road, and power plants: also those who work as police, district administrators, and commanders as well as sold-out mullahs who deny Allah’s orders and holy war and deny the holy Quran: [...] We are telling you that we are <b>continuing</b> <b>our</b> holy war in Allah’s will…Soon we will start our operations.” This letter was written in Pashto and signed “Mujahideen”. The following day insurgents kidnapped and murdered Fazal Ahad, an elder from the village of Badmuk who was attempting to end the Kom/Kata tribal disagreements by arranging a meeting in Kamdesh. In response to this, the local Afghan officials sent more government troops into the area to increase security. These troops were ambushed on the Naray/Kamdesh road and shot up badly enough to prevent their arrival in Kamdesh.|$|E

60|$|<b>Continuing</b> <b>our</b> {{way from}} Tacoronte we reached Sauzal, beyond which the coach did not then run; the old road {{was out of}} condition, and the new not in working order. We offered a dollar each for {{carrying}} our light gear to sturdy men who were loitering and lying about the premises. They shook their heads, wrapped their old blanket-cloaks around them, and stretched themselves in the sun like dogs after a cold walk. I could hardly wonder. What wants have they? A covering for warmth, porridge for food, and, above all, the bright sun and pure air, higher luxuries and better eudaemonics than purple and fine linen. At last some passing muleteers relieved us of the difficulty.|$|E

Our commander, thinking it much better to set upon them in their quarters, than to wait for them in the field, resolves to attack them early in the morning before they were aware of it. We refreshed ourselves in the field for that day, and, getting into a great wood near the enemy, we stayed there all night, till almost break of day, without being discovered.|$|E
