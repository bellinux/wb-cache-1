The inclusion of a small upper-storey front balcony is indicative of the physical and functional relationship of the building to the wharves opposite.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in St. John's, the son of James Murray and Elizabeth Stacey. Murray married Jennie Ritchie. He formed a <b>commission</b> <b>agency</b> and {{importing}} company in partnership with his brother. Murray became sole owner after his brother died in 1874. He later expanded into the fishery supply business. Murray ran unsuccessfully for {{a seat in the}} Newfoundland assembly in 1882. His election and the election of several Liberal members were overturned in 1894 after they were appealed by the Tories under the Corrupt Practices Act. The political instability that resulted from the Tory appeals caused a financial crisis and bank failures, which in turn, together with the effects of the Great Fire of 1892 led to the failure of Murray's business in 1894. Murray was the publisher of the periodicals Anti-Confederate and Centenary Magazine. He died at home in St. John's in 1900.|$|E
50|$|He {{joined the}} British Army {{at an early}} age, and served with the 58th {{regiment}} during the Great Siege of Gibraltar from 1779 to 1783. In 1784, while in Liverpool, Ancell published ‘A Circumstantial Journal of the long and tedious Blockade and Siege of Gibraltar from the 12 September 1779 (the day the garrison opened their batteries against the Spaniards) to the 23rd day of February 1783.’ The book, {{which is in the}} form of a series of letters to the author's brother, went through five editions. Ancell apparently retired from active service soon after his return home, and opened a military <b>commission</b> <b>agency</b> in Dublin. In October 1801 he produced there the first part of a monthly military magazine, called the ‘Monthly Military Companion.’ The periodical continued publishing until Ancell's death on 19 October 1802. To the magazine he contributed not only articles on fortifications, military history, and tactics, but also songs set to music of his own composition.|$|E
50|$|The Heyworth {{manufacturing}} business, called Peter Heyworth & Sons, {{produced goods}} {{intended mainly for}} export to Spain and Portugal. Lawrence persuaded his brothers {{that it would be}} beneficial to deal directly with customers in Lisbon and Oporto rather than through agents based in London and elsewhere in Britain. He further persuaded them, with some reluctance, to allow him to do that trading and thus in 1805 he left Bacup for Portugal. There he proved to be a surprising success, making and exploiting contacts to further the business. In 1807, he and his brothers, now trading as Heyworth Brothers & Co., then decided to exploit his apparent flair for foreign dealings by establishing a business as commission agents in Rio de Janeiro. By 1809, with his brother James partnering him, this business had attracted so many consignments from manufacturers in Lancashire and Yorkshire that the brothers set up a shipping and <b>commission</b> <b>agency</b> in Liverpool to handle the trade. This new enterprise was operated by and named after Ormerod Heyworth, leaving one brother to run the Bacup manufactory.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the consequences, {{for states}} and citizens, of making {{policy on the}} EU level {{is central to the}} {{reception}} of the European project and questions of democracy in the EU. This analysis places EU policy-making, trade policy in particular, in the context of bureaucratic power literature and theory. The focus is on modelling this delegation in order to draw conclusions about the role of institutional structures and <b>Commission</b> <b>agency</b> in making trade policy. The underlying question is: what effects do the institutions of this delegation and the external effects of World Trade Organization (WTO) membership have on the Commission’s ability to shape policy, and what effect does that have on policy content? It is suggested that the institutions of trade policy delegation, and the collective principal in particular, both empower the Commission and bias policy against parochial interests. Furthermore, external pressure (in the form of the WTO), serves to increase possibilities for Commission influence. agency theory; common commercial policy; GATT; interest intermediation; international trade; multilevel governance; non-majoritarian institutions; trade policy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} agency losses (agency shirking and agency slippage) {{in the process of}} power delegation in EU trade policy. The central question is whether a conflictual situation exists between the interests of the member states and those of the European <b>Commission</b> (<b>agency</b> shirking), or whether the structure of delegation in itself stimulates the agent to adopt a different position from the principals (agency slippage). Drawing on the principal-agent approach, I argue that agency losses are due to the structure of delegation and that the existence of multiple principals with diverging preferences facilitates agency. I find empirical evidence that the Council-Commission relationship on trade politics has different dynamics depending on the negotiating stage. In the initial negotiating stage, when defining the negotiating mandate of the Commission, the relationship is cooperative. Conflict between the Commission and the Council only breaks out in a latter stage of negotiations, when the Commission makes concessions at the international level.

40|$|Research {{capacity}} strengthening (RCS) {{is a key}} {{strategy to}} address the problem of health inequity and development. In spite of policy statements on “capacity development” and “North–South partnerships” among <b>commissioning</b> and donor <b>agencies,</b> most RCS initiatives operate on the conventional supply-driven, expatriate-led, short-term project, technical cooperation model which has proved ineffective in building institutional capacity and sustaining research environments. This paper analyzes the political economy of health research commissioning among bilateral, multilateral, non-governmental and philanthropic organizations, using East Africa as a case study. Instead of conventionally focusing on recipient countries and institutions, we look at the policies and practices of donor and <b>commissioning</b> <b>agencies</b> and the relationship they have with key stakeholders like Southern research institutions. While conventional approaches to development assistance predominate, we argue that the literature on RCS over-generalizes and presents it in monolithic terms. In contrast, this study provides a typology of research commissioning practices and identifies several different modes of engagement. The key findings are that the structure of the relationship between donors and recipients, as well as the governance structures of the <b>commissioning</b> <b>agencies,</b> have a critical influence on RCS. The paper concludes with some recommendations for enhancing the role of donors and commissionin...|$|R
