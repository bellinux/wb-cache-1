5000|$|A {{fault in}} the {{appliance}} which causes a live conductor {{to contact the}} casing will cause a current to flow in the earth conductor. If large enough, this current will trip an over-current device (fuse or circuit breaker (CB)) and disconnect the supply [...] The disconnection time has to be fast enough not to allow fibrillation to start {{if a person is}} in contact with the casing at the time. This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum earth resistance permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high-impedance faults it is common to recommend a residual-current device (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual <b>current</b> <b>operated</b> circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite.|$|E

A Bayesian network was developed to model open press electric shock accident as a result of charged press enclosure.

The results show that Residual <b>Current</b> <b>Operated</b> Circuit-Breaker with Integral Overcurrent Protection (RCBO) installation can reduce accidents probability of phase-voltage and under-phase-voltage electric shock sharply for open press working in T - T system of low voltage power supply system.

Seven different types of single-phase RCBOs being present on the domestic market were investigated according to KS C IEC 61009 - 1 standard. As a result, all kinds of specimens were satisfied the requirements for 0. 5]/ 100 [kHz] ring wave impulse currents. Most of specimens stressed by the 8 / 20 [] impulse current tripped at least one or more, and some of them were broken down during consecutive tests.

40|$|The {{supply of}} {{uninterruptible}} {{power can be}} applied to many areas where continuous operation is highly prioritized. The application of uninterruptible power for motor operation is facilitated using a frequency converter. Direct <b>current</b> <b>operated</b> frequency converters can be applied directly to the power reserve which removes the need for additional power-converting. Batteries have long constituted the power reserve but advancements in the development of ultracapacitors have created a viable substitution. Ultra-capacitors have high energy storing capabilities and {{can be applied to}} high power applications. Maxwell is a leading manufacturing company of ultracapacitors and pro-vide different modules with built-in solutions for voltage balancing. Uneven voltages between series-connected capacitors is a phenomenon caused by vary-ing capacitance. A configuration containing Maxwell’s 56 V module is created and constitutes the power reserve in the simulations. The discharge simulation shows a significant current that could damage the system. A current limiting transistor is introduced in the circuit to provide a safer course of discharge. The result of the simulations confirms that the application of ultracapacitors in uninterruptible power for motor operation is viable...|$|E

40|$|The {{middle to}} late Oligocene Polonez Cove Formation, exposed on {{south-eastern}} King George Island, South Shetland Islands, provides rare evidence of mid-Cenozoic West Antarctic cryosphere evolution. A revised lithostratigraphy and facies analysis and {{a review of}} the palaeoenvironmental significance of the formation are presented here. The diamictite-dominated basal member of the formation (Krakowiak Glacier Member) records the presence and retreat of marine-based ice on a shallow continental shelf. Five overlying members are recognized. These consist of basaltic-sourced sedimentary rocks and lavas and represent a variety of shoreface and shallow continental shelf environments in an active volcanic setting. These units contain diverse reworked and ice-rafted exotic clasts that become sparse towards the top of the formation, suggesting a continuing but waning glacial influence. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates from interbedded lava flows indicate a late Oligocene age (25 · 6 – 27 · 2 Ma) for the Polonez Cove Formation, but are slightly younger than skeletal carbonate Sr-isotope ages obtained previously (28 · 5 – 29 · 8 Ma). There is evidence for wet-based subice conditions {{at the base of the}} Polonez Cove Formation, but no sedimentary facies to suggest substantial meltwater. This may reflect a subpolar setting or may result from lack of preservation or a high-energy depositional environment. A northern Antarctic Peninsula/South Shetland Islands provenance is probable for most non-basaltic clasts, but certain lithologies with possible origins in the Transantarctic and Ellsworth Mountains also occur sparsely throughout the formation. There is evidence to suggest that the presence of such far-travelled clasts within subglacially deposited facies at the base of the formation reflects the advance of a local ice cap across marine sediments containing the clasts as ice-rafted material. The presence of these clasts suggests that extensive marine-based ice drained into the southern Weddell Sea region and that a strong Weddell Sea surface <b>current</b> <b>operated</b> both before and during deposition of the Polonez Cove Formation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sharp rise in}} {{non-linear}} loads in {{the form}} of electronic devices (and direct <b>current</b> <b>operated</b> electrical appliances), especially in the residential and office sectors, has now led to a situation in which 'distortive reactive currents' (or harmonic currents) arise to a great extent due to pulse-shaped power consumption. In the course of the investigation the relevance of distortive reactive currents was estimated and the effects of the EN 61000 - 3 - 2 standard examined, according to which the harmonic currents in TV sets and PCs must be limited since February 1, 2001 by means of PF Controller (power factor controller). The model calculations show that harmonics in the mains caused by non-linear loads can have significant effects on the power supply. The effects caused by these are clearly apparent in large monostructured consumers - such as office buildings, supermarkets, computer centres equipped more than the average with EDP systems, fluorescent lamps with electronic ballasts, etc. The additional resistive losses in the low-voltage mains caused by harmonic distortion can in the extreme case add up to 20 - 25 %, related to the total power, if a phase conductor is loaded with one device class (e. g. compact fluorescent lamps). The model calculations permit the conclusion that above a certain proportion - first rough estimates indicate a share of approx. 40 % of non-linear loads - the distortive losses in the mains rise more than proportionately above a critical threshold, so that overloading the neutral wire (even causing cable fires) cannot be ruled out. For the selected examples of the residential and office sectors, distortive reactive currents occurring when the mains are loaded by a mixture of linear loads and non-linear loads were estimated. Here the additional losses due to harmonic currents are in the range of 1. 0 - 1. 5 % of the total power consumption. The distortive losses in these cases were relatively small, since the share of the linear loads in the load examples considered was still relatively high and certain compensation effects took place. Oeko-Institut - Institute for Applied Ecology - recommends that the overall economic relevance of the losses due to harmonic currents is examined more thoroughly. (orig.)
