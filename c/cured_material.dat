Two application methods, single and double layer applications, were employed.

The investigation indicated that properties of the concrete in the near-surface-area of a pavement without any curing compound were considerably {{different from those of the}} internal concrete. Proper curing can significantly increase the moisture content and reduce the sorptivity of the concrete in the near-surfacearea, thus providing the pavement with uniform concrete properties throughout depth.
