40|$|This chapter {{documents}} the conceptual {{model of the}} ELMCIP Electronic Literature Knowledge Base, the development process that led to its development, and its technical implementation. It should {{be of interest to}} digital humanities researchers interested {{in the process of developing}} research infrastructure for the documentation of a field of research. Developed as part of an international, digital-humanities project, Developing a Networked-Based Creative Community: Electronic Literature as a Model of Creativity and Innovation in Practice (ELMCIP), the ELMCIP Electronic Literature Knowledge Base is an open-access, online database tracing activity in and around the field of electronic literature and the digital literary arts. Inspired by Ted Nelson’s (1981) vision of literature, broadly understood as “an ongoing system of interconnecting documents,” the Knowledge Base is collecting and connecting bibliographic information and archival materials about the literary production in this field. As this information is linked and <b>cross-referenced</b> in various <b>records</b> in the Knowledge Base, the relations between objects and actors in the field of electronic literature become explicit, perceptible, recognizable, and communicable. Together these relations comprise the field. In the Knowledge Base, they are defined through content types that include authors, creative works, critical writing, events, organizations, publishers, teaching resources, and databases and archives. The Knowledge Base now includes more than 9, 000 <b>cross-referenced</b> <b>records</b> in these primary content types...|$|R

5000|$|On March 4 Bret Easton Ellis tweeted: [...] "With [...] "Taipei" [...] Tao Lin {{becomes the}} most {{interesting}} prose stylist of his generation, which doesnt mean that [...] "Taipei" [...] isnt a boring novel..." [...] In an unprecedentedly long blurb, Frederick Barthelme stated: [...] "Tao Lin has made a distinctive career out of sticking to his guns, his guns being the ultra-high-res self-consciousness that characterizes our lives but which we routinely ignore in our lives and in our art. In Taipei he is a constant microscope, examining a world of miniature gestures, tiny facial movements, hands in motion, shrugs, nods, twists, ticks, flicks and snaps, {{a world in which}} the barrage of information we take in moment by moment is simultaneously cataloged, interpreted, <b>cross-referenced,</b> <b>recorded,</b> and filed. Taipei is a paean to the minutely examined life, where what is examined is every twitch, flinch, jerk, spasm, tremor, and tic, every high-speed half-formed thought, everything that we routinely consider meaningless and inessential. Here all that is turned on its head and becomes central and predominate, fundamental to being. There is no mistaking that we live a new, ultra self-conscious life, skating on the surface of things while overlaying that surface with a facsimile of the [...] "old life" [...] in which traditional values retain their power and majesty. What is fascinating about Tao Lin’s fiction is his willingness, nay, insistence, on sticking to the true life of the new century, as raw, flat, fatigued as it may be. In Taipei he follows an utterly modern creature through a semi-robotic life in America and Taiwan, limiting himself and his characters to reasonably accurate renderings of normal responses without the literary humanist overlay, that is to say, a world almost binary and without much in the way of conventional [...] "emotion", the stuff of which storytelling has forever been made. Lin is a 21st century literary adventurer, willing to work with what he actually has rather than a simulacrum of what once was, or might have been. The result is a fascinating book, bone dry, repellant, painful, but relentlessly true to life. Stripped of any version of the pretty Hallmark Card world that occupies so much fiction today, and which seems vulgar and pathetic by comparison, Taipei lays open the present and likely future of ordinary life in a way that few writers would acknowledge, let alone champion. You owe it to yourself to read Taipei, and to contemplate the world it predicts." ...|$|R

This article examines the effect of the wikis' functionality on the students' use of the tool, and the consequences of their engagement with one another and with the activities, and the learning opportunities offered by the use of wiki. This is a relatively large-scale study involving 56 wikis produced by over 250 students. The data were drawn from the two courses using a variety of research methods. A qualitative inductive analysis of the interview data was conducted to look for emergent themes in the data. The emergent themes were validated by <b>cross-referencing</b> the <b>recorded</b> comments in the wikis and course forums.

STUDY DESIGN: Our analysis followed approximately 194, 000 patients who were initiated on hemodialysis during a 2 -year period (2008 & 2009) with CMS- 2728 forms submitted to CMS by dialysis facilities, <b>cross-referenced</b> with patient <b>record</b> updates through the end of 2010, and tracked through December 2010 in the CMS SIMS registry. RESULTS: We report a sustained renal recovery (i. e no return to ESRD during the available follow up period) rate among Medicare ESRD patients of > 5 % - much higher than previously reported. Recovery occurred primarily in the first 2 months post incident dialysis, and was more likely in cases with renal failure secondary to etiologies associated with acute kidney injury. Patients experiencing sustained recovery were markedly less likely than true long-term ESRD patients to have permanent vascular accesses in place at incident hemodialysis, while non-White patients, and patients with any prior nephrology care appeared to have significantly lower rates of renal recovery. We also found widespread geographic variation in the rates of renal recovery across the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Renal recovery rates in the US Medicare ESRD program are higher than previously reported and appear to have significant geographic variation. Patients with diagnoses associated with acute kidney injury who are initiated on long-term hemodialysis have significantly higher rates of renal recovery than the general ESRD population and lower rates of permanent access placement...|$|R

Supported by a Canadian Heritage New Media Research Network Fund grant, [...] the digitization process began with the documentation gathered before the demolition of the Convent. Architectural drawings were used as the base asset for the modeling process and were <b>cross-referenced</b> with dimensions <b>recorded</b> at the chapel itself. Students used the 3D modeling software, Maya, to construct the interior space of the chapel. Since the Convent exterior was not saved, archival photographs of its exterior were used to photogrametrically re-build the geometry of the building. Photogrammetry is a digitization process that is able to generate highly accurate 3D geometry from measurements made in two or more photographs of the same object taken from different angles. Laser scanning was done on the intricate woodwork of the chapel’s altarpieces and carvings and produced a level of highly accurate and detailed documentation of the chapel never before gathered. Concurrent to the digitization process, historical assets were gathered and assessed and used {{in the development of}} the narrative in which the final digital artifacts were given life. Since it was determined that there was no single point of view that could tell the story, the theme of intertwining threads was used to weave together the various perspectives and issues that were important in re-presenting the story of the chapel. The various digital artifacts produced by each process and method were integrated and used in the crafting of high-resolution animations, interactive environments, rich media DVD and the web.|$|R

This scale has been validated and widely used in BD research (Michalak et al. 2005). The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was employed to measure depressive symptom severity (Montgomery and Asberg 1979). Degree of biological rhythm disruption {{was measured}} with the Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). The BRIAN consists of 18 -items measuring sleep, overall activities, social rhythm, and eating behavior scored from 1 (no difficulties) to 4 (serious difficulties), with greater scores indicating more biological rhythm disruption. This scale has been validated in BD patients {{in its ability to}} discriminate euthymic BD and controls (Giglio et al. 2009). The BRIAN scale has previously been used in conjunction with measures of cognitive functioning in euthymic BD patients and showed that biological rhythm disruption was a predictor of poorer functioning (Giglio et al. 2010). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure subjective sleep quality (Buysse et al. 1989). The PSQI is a standardized self-rating questionnaire which evaluates seven components of sleep quality, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. To more closely examine the use of sleep medications on QOL, a separate factor was included based on the answer to “use of sleep medication” (component 6). Sleep medication status was categorized as ‘yes’ if participants reported using sleep medications either ‘once or twice a week’ or ‘more than three times per week’ on component 6 of the PSQI. This response was <b>cross-referenced</b> with medications <b>recorded</b> for each participant during the clinical assessments (including bedtime use of benzodiazepines, zopiclone, quetiapine, or over-the-counter compounds such as melatonin).|$|R
40|$|Finding {{information}} about a biological entity is a step tightly bound to molecular biology research. Despite ongoing efforts, this task is both tedious and time consuming, and tends to become Sisyphean {{as the number of}} entities increases. Our aim is to assist researchers by providing them with summary {{information about}} biological entities while they are browsing the web, as well as with simplified programmatic access to biological data. To materialise this aim we employ emerging web technologies offering novel web-browsing experiences and new ways of software communication Reflect is a tool that couples biological named entity recognition with informative summaries, and can be applied to any web page, during web browsing. Invoked either via its browser extensions or via its web page, Reflect highlights gene, protein and chemical molecule names in a web page, and, dynamically, attaches to them summary information. The latter provides an overview of what is known about the entity, such as a description, the domain composition, the 3 D structure and links to more detailed resources. The annotation process occurs via easy-to-use interfaces. The fast performance allows for Reflect to be an interactive companion for scientific readers/researchers, while they are surfing the internet. OnTheFly is a web-based application that not only extends Reflect functionality to Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, PDF and plain text format files, but also supports the extraction of networks of known and predicted interactions about the entities recognised in a document. A combination of Reflect and OnTheFly offers a data annotation solution for documents used by life science researchers throughout their work. EasySRS is a set of remote methods that expose the functionality of the Sequence Retrieval System (SRS), a data integration platform used in providing access to life science information including genetic, protein, expression and pathway data.

With this new information in hand, Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s views on colonial emigration and imperialism, international affairs, religion, medievalism, Ireland, the East, and English middle-class identity are clarified. Further, Thackeray wrote a series {{of social and political}} 2 ̆ 2 London 2 ̆ 2 letters for an Indian newspaper, the Calcutta Star. This dissertation establishes that Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s letters were answered in print by 2 ̆ 2 colonial 2 ̆ 2 letters written by James Hume, editor of the Calcutta Star; their mutual correspondence thus constitutes a revealing cosmopolitan - colonial discourse. The particulars of Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s Calcutta Star writings are established, insights into the personalities and viewpoints of both men provided, and societal aspects of their correspondence analyzed. In his many newspaper art exhibition reviews Thackeray popularized serious painting and shaped middle-class taste. The nature and timing of Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s art essays are assessed, espoused values characterized and earlier analyses critiqued, and Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s role introducing middle-class readers to contemporary Victorian art explored.

40|$|Background The {{need for}} {{surveillance}} systems generating targeted, data-driven, responsive control efforts to accelerate and sustain malaria transmission reduction has been emphasized by programme managers, {{policy makers and}} scientists. Surveillance using easy-to-access population subgroups (EAGs) may result in considerable cost saving compared to household surveys as the identification and selection of individuals to be surveyed is simplified, fewer personnel are needed, and logistics are simpler. We reviewed available literature on the validation of estimates of key indicators of malaria control progress derived from EAGs, and describe the options {{to deal with the}} context specific bias that may occur. Methods A literature search was conducted of all documents reporting validation of estimates of malaria control indicators from EAG surveys before the 31 st of December 2016. Additional records were identified through <b>cross-reference</b> from selected <b>records,</b> other applicable policy documents and grey literature. After removal of duplicates, 13, 180 abstracts were evaluated and 2, 653 eligible abstracts were identified mentioning surveillance in EAGs, of which 29 full text articles were selected for detailed review. The nine articles selected for systematic review compared estimates from health facility and school surveys with those of a contemporaneous sample of the same population in the same geographic area. Results Review of the available literature on EAGs suitable for surveillance of malaria control progress revealed that little effort has been made to explore the potential approach and settings for use of EAGs; and that there was wide variation in the precision of estimates of control progress between and within studies, particularly for estimates of control intervention coverage. Only one of the studies evaluated the geospatial representativeness of EAG samples, or carried out geospatial analyses to assess or control for lack of geospatial representativeness. Two studies attempted to measure the degree of bias or improve the precision of estimates by controlling for bias in a multivariate analysis; and this was only successful in one study. The observed variability in accuracy of estimates is likely to be caused by selection and/or information bias due to the inherent nature of EAGs. The reviewed studies provided insight into the design and analytical approaches {{that could be used to}} limit bias. Conclusion The utility EAGs for routine surveillance of progress in malaria control at the district or sub-district programmatic level will be driven by several factors including whether serial point estimates to measure transmission reduction or more precise geospatial distribution to track ‘hot-spots’ is required, the acceptable degree of precision, the target population, and the resources available for surveillance. The opportunities offered by novel geostatistical analyses and hybrid sampling frames to overcome bias justify a renewed exploration of use of EAGs for malaria monitoring and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Medicaid {{will expand}} in 2014 to extend {{eligibility}} for health care coverage to millions more Americans. Included among these will be those prison inmates and ex-offenders who are currently ineligible for Medicaid coverage. Corrections systems are constitutionally mandated to provide adequate health care to all prison and jail inmates {{for the duration of}} their incarceration. The expenses associated with providing this care are a leading cost driver for most state correctional systems. As states continue to battle large budget deficits, elected officials and agency leadership are increasingly motivated to reduce high prison costs. North Carolina is no exception, and in 2010 the General Assembly issued a directive compelling the state Department of Correction (DOC) to identify and implement new cost-saving measures. The result was the implementation of a new Inmate Medicaid Enrollment (IME) program that became operational in February 2011. According to internal estimations, this new program was projected to save DOC $ 14 million {{by the end of the}} 2011 - 2012 fiscal year. IME also represents a uniquely successful cross-collaboration between two large state agencies with no prior working relationship- DOC and the State Department of Medical Assistance (DMA). As more states consider similar inmate Medicaid utilization programs, North Carolina has established itself as a leader that is well poised to take advantage of Medicaid expansion and its increased federal reimbursements scheduled for 2014. In this project I analyze the process by which these North Carolina state agencies created and implemented IME, while also examining the implications of Medicaid expansion for DOC’s costs, inmate populations and reentering prisoners. The following paper offers background information on prisoner health care and medical costs; Medicaid as it currently relates to inmates and as its projected change in 2014; and the public health dynamics of prisoner health and reentry. The second section offers an analysis of IME in North Carolina, from its conception to its current operation. The third section offers projections for IME once Medicaid expansion is implemented and the possible implications for the future. Finally, I offer conclusions based on my analysis and five specific recommendations for how North Carolina can best maximize the potential benefits of IME, whether or not Medicaid expansion progresses. North Carolina’s Inmate Medical Enrollment Program is a model other states may wish to emulate in their own pursuit of cost-savings and innovative solutions to rising incarceration and medical costs. In particular, the cooperation between DOC and DMA on an administrative and personnel level indicate that complicated inter-agency programs can be successfully implemented quickly and efficiently. To build on the success of the IME program’s implementation and expand its positive impacts, I recommend DOC take the following actions: 1) 	DOC and DMA should educate and train county managers in the process of Medicaid utilization for enrolled inmates. While it may not be feasible to expect all 100 of North Carolina’s counties to implement their own IME program for jail inmates, even a handful of densely populated or high incarceration counties stand to reap financial and public health benefits if they follow the state model. 2) 	DOC should work with county social service agencies to create and implement their own IME program, whereby arrested individuals are immediately <b>cross-referenced</b> against Medicaid <b>records</b> for possible matches. In particular, NC DOC should model the Colorado Department of Correction’s jail enrollment program. DOC may consider working first with the most populated counties and those with the highest incarceration rates, as they will likely be most motivated and have the greatest staff and infrastructural resources to enact their own successful IME programs. 3) 	To protect the state from any legal repercussions, DOC should add an additional information search related to inmates’ family participation or ability to pay for medical care. At the very least, DOC should ensure access to contact information for inmates’ families so that those requiring hospital care are screened for any other possible payers of last resort. 4) 	Finally, in the event Medicaid expansion does move forward, DOC should implement a health care training process for all probation and post-release supervision officers as well as other reentry programs to maximize the potential for improved public health and reduced recidivism. With public confidence in government historically low it is all the more important and valid to analyze and credit IME for its smooth implementation as well as its outcomes. As the country faces a slow and halting economic recovery, state governments may look to the North Carolina Inmate Medicaid Enrollment Program as an example for how government can quickly respond to economic crises and create new programs that may reduce spending and result in long term community benefits...|$|R
40|$|Data-driven {{research}} {{approaches are}} becoming increasingly popular in {{a growing number of}} scientific disciplines. While a data-driven research approach can yield superior results, generating the required data can be very costly. This frequently leads to small and complex data sets, in which it is impossible to rely on volume alone to compensate for all shortcomings of the data. To counter this problem, other reliable sources of information must be incorporated. In this work, domain knowledge, as a particularly reliable type of additional information, is used to inform data-driven analysis methods. This domain knowledge is represented as constraints on the possible solutions, which the presented methods can use to inform their analysis. It focusses on spatial constraints as a particularly common type of constraint, but the proposed techniques are general enough to be applied to other types of constraints. In this thesis, new methods using domain constraints for data-driven science applications are discussed. These methods have applications in feature evaluation, route database repair, and Gaussian Mixture modeling of spatial data. The first application focuses on feature evaluation. The presented method receives two representations of the same data: one as the intended target and the other for investigation. It calculates a score indicating how much the two representations agree. A presented application uses this technique to compare a reference attribute set with different subsets to determine the importance and relevance of individual attributes. A second technique analyzes route data for constraint compliance. The presented framework allows the user to specify constraints and possible actions to modify the data. The presented method then uses these inputs to generate a version of the data, which agrees with the constraints, while otherwise reducing the impact of the modifications as much as possible. Two extensions of this schema are presented: an extension to continuously valued costs, which are minimized, and an extension to constraints involving more than one moving object. Another addressed application area is modeling of multivariate measurement data, which was measured at spatially distributed locations. The spatial information recorded with the data can be used as the basis for constraints. This thesis presents multiple approaches to building a model of this kind of data while complying with spatial constraints. The first approach is an interactive tool, which allows domain scientists to generate a model of the data, which complies with their knowledge about the data. The second is a Monte Carlo approach, which generates a large number of possible models, tests them for compliance with the constraints, and returns the best one. The final two approaches are based on the EM algorithm and use different ways of incorporating the information into their models. At the end of the thesis, two applications of the models, which have been generated in the previous chapter, are presented. The first is prediction of the origin of samples and the other is the visual representation of the extracted models on a map. These tools can be used by domain scientists to augment their tried and tested tools. The developed techniques are applied to a real-world data set collected in the archaeobiological research project FOR 1670 (Transalpine mobility and cultural transfer) of the German Science Foundation. The data set contains isotope ratio measurements of samples, which were discovered at archaeological sites in the Alps region of central Europe. Using the presented data analysis methods, the data is analyzed to answer relevant domain questions. In a first application, the attributes of the measurements are analyzed for their relative importance and their ability to predict the spatial location of samples. Another presented application is the reconstruction of potential migration routes between the investigated sites. Then spatial models are built using the presented modeling approaches. Univariate outliers are determined and used to predict locations based on the generated models. These are <b>cross-referenced</b> with the <b>recorded</b> origins. Finally, maps of the isotope distribution in the investigated regions are presented. The described methods and demonstrated analyses show that domain knowledge can be used to formulate constraints that inform the data analysis process to yield valid models from relatively small data sets and support domain scientists in their analyses. Datengetriebene Forschungsansätze werden für eine wachsende Anzahl von wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen immer wichtiger. Obwohl ein datengetriebener Forschungsansatz bessere Ergebnisse erzielen kann, kann es sehr teuer sein die notwendigen Daten zu gewinnen. Dies hat häufig zur Folge, dass kleine und komplexe Datensätze entstehen, bei denen es nicht möglich ist sich auf die Menge der Datenpunkte zu verlassen um Probleme bei der Analyse auszugleichen. Um diesem Problem zu begegnen müssen andere Informationsquellen verwendet werden. Fachwissen als eine besonders zuverlässige Quelle solcher Informationen kann herangezogen werden, um die datengetriebenen Analysemethoden zu unterstützen. Dieses Fachwissen wird ausgedrückt als Constraints (Nebenbedingungen) der möglichen Lösungen, die die vorgestellten Methoden benutzen können um ihre Analyse zu steuern. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf räumlichen Constraints als eine besonders häufige Art von Constraints, aber die vorgeschlagenen Methoden sind allgemein genug um auf andere Arte von Constraints angewendet zu werden. Es werden neue Methoden diskutiert, die Fachwissen für datengetriebene wissenschaftliche Anwendungen verwenden. Diese Methoden haben Anwendungen auf Feature-Evaluation, die Reparatur von Bewegungsdatenbanken und auf Gaussian-Mixture-Modelle von räumlichen Daten. Die erste Anwendung betrifft Feature-Evaluation. Die vorgestellte Methode erhält zwei Repräsentationen der selben Daten: eine als Zielrepräsentation und eine zur Untersuchung. Sie berechnet einen Wert, der aussagt, wie einig sich die beiden Repräsentationen sind. Eine vorgestellte Anwendung benutzt diese Technik um eine Referenzmenge von Attributen mit verschiedenen Untermengen zu vergleichen, um die Wichtigkeit und Relevanz einzelner Attribute zu bestimmen. Eine zweite Technik analysiert die Einhaltung von Constraints in Bewegungsdaten. Das präsentierte Framework erlaubt dem Benutzer Constraints zu definieren und mögliche Aktionen zur Veränderung der Daten anzuwenden. Die präsentierte Methode benutzt diese Eingaben dann um eine neue Variante der Daten zu erstellen, die die Constraints erfüllt ohne die Datenbank mehr als notwendig zu verändern. Zwei Erweiterungen dieser Grundidee werden vorgestellt: eine Erweiterung auf stetige Kostenfunktionen, die minimiert werden, und eine Erweiterung auf Bedingungen, die mehr als ein bewegliches Objekt betreffen. Ein weiteres behandeltes Anwendungsgebiet ist die Modellierung von multivariaten Messungen, die an räumlich verteilten Orten gemessen wurden. Die räumliche Information, die zusammen mit diesen Daten erhoben wurde, kann als Grundlage genutzt werden um Constraints zu formulieren. Mehrere Ansätze zum Erstellen von Modellen auf dieser Art von Daten werden vorgestellt, die räumliche Constraints einhalten. Der erste dieser Ansätze ist ein interaktives Werkzeug, das Fachwissenschaftlern dabei hilft, Modelle der Daten zu erstellen, die mit ihrem Wissen über die Daten übereinstimmen. Der zweite ist eine Monte-Carlo-Simulation, die eine große Menge möglicher Modelle erstellt, testet ob sie mit den Constraints übereinstimmen und das beste Modell zurückgeben. Zwei letzte Ansätze basieren auf dem EM-Algorithmus und benutzen verschiedene Arten diese Information in das Modell zu integrieren. Am Ende werden zwei Anwendungen der gerade vorgestellten Modelle vorgestellt. Die erste ist die Vorhersage der Herkunft von Proben und die andere ist die grafische Darstellung der erstellten Modelle auf einer Karte. Diese Werkzeuge können von Fachwissenschaftlern benutzt werden um ihre bewährten Methoden zu unterstützen. Die entwickelten Methoden werden auf einen realen Datensatz angewendet, der von dem archäo-biologischen Forschungsprojekt FOR 1670 (Transalpine Mobilität und Kulturtransfer der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft erhoben worden ist. Der Datensatz enthält Messungen von Isotopenverhältnissen von Proben, die in archäologischen Fundstellen in den zentraleuropäischen Alpen gefunden wurden. Die präsentierten Datenanalyse-Methoden werden verwendet um diese Daten zu analysieren und relevante Forschungsfragen zu klären. In einer ersten Anwendung werden die Attribute der Messungen analysiert um ihre relative Wichtigkeit und ihre Fähigkeit zu bewerten, die räumliche Herkunft der Proben vorherzusagen. Eine weitere vorgestellte Anwendung ist die Wiederherstellung von möglichen Migrationsrouten zwischen den untersuchten Fundstellen. Danach werden räumliche Modelle der Daten unter Verwendung der vorgestellten Methoden erstellt. Univariate Outlier werden bestimmt und ihre möglich Herkunft basierend auf der erstellten Karte wird bestimmt. Die vorhergesagte Herkunft wird mit der tatsächlichen Fundstelle verglichen. Zuletzt werden Karten der Isotopenverteilung der untersuchten Region vorgestellt. Die beschriebenen Methoden und vorgestellten Analysen zeigen, dass Fachwissen verwendet werden kann um Constraints zu formulieren, die den Datenanalyseprozess unterstützen, um gültige Modelle aus relativ kleinen Datensätzen zu erstellen und Fachwissenschaftler bei ihren Analysen zu unterstützen...|$|R
