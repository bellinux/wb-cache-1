40|$|Understanding photon {{transport}} {{losses in}} fluorescence solar collectors {{is very important}} for increasing optical efficiencies. We present an analytical expression to characterize photon reabsorption in fluorescent solar collectors, which represent a major source of photon loss. A particularly useful universal form of this expression is found in the limit of high reabsorption, which gives the photon reabsorption probability in a simple form {{as a function of the}} absorption coefficient and the optical étendue of the emitted photon beam. Our mathematical model predicts fluorescence spectra emitted from the <b>collector</b> <b>edge,</b> which are in excellent agreement with experiment and provide an effective characterization tool for photon transport in light absorbing media...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of base profile design on the Si/SiGe HBT characteristics is investigated. It is determined that for uniform base HBT, {{with the increase}} of base doping concentration and the base Ge mole fraction, the cutoff frequency of the HBT decreases. But the current gain decreases {{with the increase of}} base doping concentration and increases with the increase of Ge mole fraction. For graded base HBT, when the base width is 700 A, the Ge mole fraction grading of (0. 2 - 0. 1) / 700 A from <b>collector</b> <b>edge</b> to the emitter edge in the base region is enough for raising the cutoff frequency. For the same Ge dose in the base region, uniform base HBT provides higher current gain but lower cutoff frequency than graded base HBT. Finally, we have designed and fabricated uniform base Si/SiGe HBT for power application, the current gain is 50 - 320 and the cutoff frequency is 7. 5 GHz at collector-emitter voltage of 4 V and collector current of 300 mA...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescent solar {{collectors}} are cheap plates made generally of glass or plastic that is doped with fluorescent molecules. Fluorescence {{can be used}} to trap incident solar radiation in order to concentrate light and also to shift the radiation to wavelengths converted at higher efficiencies. This project investigates both these aspects. Solar concentration using fluorescent {{solar collectors}} is examined for different combinations of solar cells and mirrors coupled to different surfaces of fluorescent solar collectors. The effects of the fabrication method i. e. spin coating or moulding is also studied. Modelling of the fluorescence re-absorption is the key to obtain the efficiency of such systems and these models will be shown to be useful in the optimisation of certain configurations of fluorescent collectors that behave like ideal models. On comparison with experimental results these models {{can also be used to}} quantify and identify losses in configurations that suffer additional losses. Devices tested in the lab are estimated to have the potential to achieve power conversion efficiencies close to 4 % while results of optimisation results indicate possible further improvements. Angular resolved measurements of the fluorescence exiting the fluorescent solar <b>collector</b> <b>edge</b> is also used to study the photon transport of light within these devices. The combination of solar concentration and wavelength shifting (to wavelengths with superior solar cell performance) has been exploited for application to cadmium telluride solar cells for the first time. The theory of operation of these devices is used to model the current output measured experimentally. Novel photonic-based structures that incorporate fluorescent molecules within one-dimensional photonic crystals has also been fabricated and characterised. It will be shown that these devices have the potential to reduce fundamental loss mechanisms found in conventional fluorescent solar collectors by suppressing and reducing emission within loss cones and tuning emission reaching the solar cells to certain wavelengths. The theory of operation of these devices will used to describe the propagation of light within the structure and explain the experimentally measured emission characteristics. The maximum theoretical efficiencies of photonic-based fluorescent solar collectors have also been derived and adapted from previous work to show the potential of such devices...|$|E

40|$|The {{boundary}} {{region of the}} ETA BETA II RFP experiment has been investigated by movable instrumented limiters equipped with Langmuir probes, heat flux probes, and surface <b>collectors.</b> <b>Edge</b> plasma temperature and density are {{of the order of}} 10 eV and 0. 5 − 1 × 1019 m− 3. The heat deposition on the movable limiter is asymmetric between the electron and the ion drift side, and a power flux of the order of 300 MW/m 2 is measured on the electron drift side. This high value has been explained by the presence of current carrying electrons coming from the hotter region of the plasma, through a stochastic region extending into the plasma. Surface collectors have been inserted in the plasma and analyzed by RBS and ERD techniques. The implanted impurities are mainly oxygen and metallic elements of the liner, both showing a quite linear build up {{as a function of the}} exposure time, whereas the amount of trapped deuterium tends to a stationary value after a few discharges. The deuterium flux incident on the wall has been inferred, the impurity yield estimated, and the generation mechanisms discussed. The deposition radial profiles give information on the screening capability of the {{boundary region}}. The estimate of the transmitted impurity flux appears in agreement with what is expected in terms of the known impurity content in the discharge. The stochastic behaviour of the magnetic field in a wide portion of the plasma near the wall is suggested to improve an uniform thermal load, and a more effective screening of heavy impurities...|$|R

40|$|A Solar Enhanced Natural Draft Dry Cooling Tower (SENDDCT) is an {{air-cooled}} hybrid {{cooling system}} that uses solar energy {{to enhance the}} cooling efficiency of natural draft dry cooling. In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical analysis was carried out using commercial software ANSYS FLUENT to investigate {{the effects of the}} introduction of a partial blockage on the cooling performance of the SENDDCT and to determine the upper limitation of increasing the solar collector size in the SENDDCT design with a fixed area of heat exchangers. In the simulations, the cooling capacities of SENDDCTs with the same geometric and operating parameters, such as the heat-exchanger areas and tower heights, except for different collector sizes and blockage ratios (the ratio of the blocked area to the area offered at the <b>collector</b> outer <b>edge),</b> were evaluated and a comparative analysis was performed. The results showed that for an SENDDCT with fixed heat-exchanger area, the upper limitation of increasing the solar collector size is that corresponding to a blockage ratio reaching 50 %, above which the heat dump capacity of the SENDDCT decreases with a further increase in the solar collector size owing to vortices generated {{at the back of the}} heat exchangers reducing the effective heat transfer area. In addition, with a distribution of small-unit heat exchangers, this effect can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Tubular {{structures}} can {{be obtained}} in various elegant ways. Electrospinning is the electrostatic formation of thin fibers from viscous polymer solutions. Employing self-assembling monomers such as phospholipids and proteins is a novel route, which we extended to short peptides. [1] Aromatic residues in the peptides cause pi-stacking of the molecules, and together with the electrostatic interactions (peptides are zwitterions) fiber and tube formation is induced. On the macroscale, electrospun tubes usually coil up in an irregular mesh-like structure (Fig 1). We show that a <b>collector</b> with sharp <b>edges</b> can lead to alignment and suspended structures (Fig 2). Based on the chemical variability of peptide tubes, we plan {{to develop a new}} setup for experiments on nanofluidics. Nature, too, has developed some very efficient tube formation strategies. One of the uses of protein tubes is to protect and transport RNA, which in turn codes for the same protein: The resulting structure is a virus. One of the simplest, and certainly the best characterised, is the Tobacco mosaic virus, which is pathogenic only for a number of plants. The helically arranged coat proteins and the RNA form a 300 nm long tube with an inner channel of only 4 nm diameter.

40|$|A {{fluorescent}} {{solar collector}} (FSC) is an optoelectronic waveguide device that can concentrate both diffuse and direct sunlight onto a solar cell {{which is then}} converted to electricity. Fluorescent collectors offer the potential {{to reduce the cost}} of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, but so far their effectiveness has been demonstrated only theoretically. The major problems in the device obtaining high practical efficiency are photon transport losses and material instability. This aim of this research is to increase the fundamental understanding of photon transport losses in fluorescent collectors, and to explore the method in overcoming the losses in fluorescent solar collectors. This thesis presents the theoretical and experimental results obtained during the development and characterisation of fluorescent collectors, a thin film c-Si solar cell used to detect photons from the fluorescent solar collector. A method for preparing fluorescent collector plates was by spin-coating dye-doped PMMA (Polymethylmethacrylate) on glass slides (BK 7 glass). An optical characterisation technique for determining reabsorption loss of the fluorescent collectors was developed and used to evaluate the performance of the fluorescent collector base on laser dyes. The validity of this approach was verified by comparing the results with theoretical solutions, derived using a model adapted from the Weber and Lambe, and the modified Weber and Lambe, theories. Different losses in the FSC are studied in this work and we investigate the effect of surface scattering in a realistic FSC. To characterise the photon transport inside the collector, we monitor the angular distribution of a collimated light beam, which enters the <b>collector</b> from the <b>edge,</b> after propagation and total internal reflection. We find that the surface scattering process is described well by Fraunhofer diffraction at surface inhomogeneities of a size, roughly 11 ?m. The major losses in FSC are found to be caused by the surface roughness, which increases the probability of the escape cone losses in FSC from the top surface. This loss can be suppressed to less than 2 % using an index matching planarisation layer. The influence of the bulk and surface scattering on the performance of the FSC are presented in this work, which were compared with the experiment and theory. The angular dependence of the edge fluorescence was studied in this work, and it showed the edge fluorescence decreases by increasing the detection angle, and the value of reabsorption also decreases by increasing the detection angle, up to 20 °, before increasing again. It was shown, also, that that the quasi blackbody function agrees well with angular dependence of the edge fluorescence spectral, divided by the cos(detection angle) region where the absorption and fluorescence band of the dye overlap. Also, the modified Weber and Lambe theory for the angular dependence of the fluorescence agreed well with the experimental results...|$|R
