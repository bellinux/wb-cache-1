In this case the applied media are buffered by a system consisting of a relatively high amount of NaHCO 3 and a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a CO 2 incubator, the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low content of CO 2 (0, 3 %) in atmospheric air.|$|R

As studying TCP/IP, conceptually protocol layering is easy to understand, but TCP/IP stack usually is implemented in the kernel of Linux operating system, thus how layering protocol works is hard to know.

The arrangement package of Cgal can construct and maintain arrangements of various families of curves, when {{provided with the}} representation of the curves and some basic geometric functionality on them. It employs the exact computation paradigm in order to handle all degenerate cases in a robust manner. We present the representations and algorithms that are needed for implementing arrangements of Bézier curves using exact arithmetic. Our framework is efficient and <b>complete,</b> <b>handling</b> all degenerate cases. In order to avoid the prohibitive running times incurred by an indiscriminate usage of exact arithmetic, we make extensive use of the geometric properties of Bézier curves for filtering. As a result, most operations are carried out using fast approximate methods, and only in degenerate (or near-degenerate) cases do we resort to the exact, and more computationally demanding, procedures...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose two novel {{software}} implementations of the ray-casting volume rendering algorithm for irregular grids, called ME-Raycast (Memory Efficient Ray-casting) and EME-Raycast (Enhanced Memory Efficient Ray-Casting). Our algorithms improve previous work by Bunyk et al [1] in terms of <b>complete</b> <b>handling</b> of degenerate cases, memory consumption, and type of cell allowed in the grid (tetrahedral and/or hexahedral). The use of a more compact and non-redundant data structure, allowed us to achieve higher memory efficiency. Our results show consistent and significant gains in the memory usage of ME-Raycast and EME-Raycast when compared to Bunyk et al implementation. Furthermore, our results also show that handling of degenerate cases generates accurate images, correctly rendering all the pixels in the image, while Bunyk et al implementation fails in rendering up to 38 pixels in the final image. When we compare our algorithms to other robust rendering algorithm, like ZSweep [2], we have considerable performance gains and competitive memory consumption. We conclude that ME-Raycast and EME-Raycast are efficient methods for ray-casting that allow in-core rendering of large datasets with no image errors...|$|R

40|$|Handling qualities {{analysis}} and control law design {{would seem to}} be naturally complimenting components of aircraft flight control system design, however these two closely coupled disciplines are often not well integrated in practice. Handling qualities engineers and control system engineers may work in separate groups within an aircraft company. Flight control system engineers and handling quality specialists may come from different backgrounds and schooling and are often not aware of the other group's research. Thus while the handling qualities specifications represent desired aircraft response characteristics, these are rarely incorporated directly in the control system design process. Instead modem control system design techniques are based on servo-loop robustness specifications, and simple representations of the desired control response. Comprehensive handling qualities analysis is often left {{until the end of the}} design cycle and performed as a check of the completed design for satisfactory performance. This can lead to costly redesign or less than satisfactory aircraft handling qualities when the flight testing phase is reached. The desire to integrate the fields of handling qualities and flight,control systems led to the development of the CONDUIT system. This tool facilitates control system designs that achieve desired handling quality requirements and servo-loop specifications in a single design process. With CONDUIT, the control system engineer is now able to directly design and control systems to meet the <b>complete</b> <b>handling</b> specifications. CONDUIT allows the designer to retain a preferred control law structure, but then tunes the system parameters to meet the handling quality requirements...|$|R
50|$|Normally {{cell culture}} {{experiments}} are {{performed in a}} CO2 incubator. Also perfusion culture experiments can be performed in such an atmosphere. However, a much better solution is the performance of perfusion culture experiments under atmospheric air on a laboratory table, since it facilitates the <b>complete</b> <b>handling.</b> However, {{in this case the}} culture medium has to be adjusted to atmospheric air.Keeping media in a 5% CO2 atmosphere within an incubator always a relatively high amount of NaHCO3 is contained to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a CO2 incubator, the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low content of CO2 (0.3%) in atmospheric air.For that reason any medium used for perfusion culture outside a CO2 incubator has to be stabilized by reducing the NaHCO3 concentration and/or by adding biological buffers such as HEPES (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) or BUFFER ALL (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie, München, Germany). The necessary amount can be easily determined by admixing increasing amounts of biological buffer solution to an aliquot of medium. Then the medium must equilibrate over night on a thermo plate at 37 °C under atmospheric air. For example, application of 50 mmol/l HEPES or an equivalent of BUFFER ALL (ca. 1%) to IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen) will maintain a constant pH of 7.4 throughout long term perfusion culture under atmospheric air on a laboratory table.|$|R
