25|$|As an analgesic, codeine compares weakly {{to other}} opiates. Related to codeine {{in other ways}} are <b>codoxime,</b> thebacon, codeine-N-oxide (genocodeine), related to the {{nitrogen}} morphine derivatives as is codeine methobromide, and heterocodeine, which is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than codeine due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz. moving the methyl group from the 3 to the 6 position on the morphine carbon skeleton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Codoxime</b> (Codossima) is an opiate {{analogue}} that is {{a derivative}} of hydrocodone, where the 6-ketone group {{has been replaced by}} carboxymethyloxime. It has primarily antitussive effects and was found to have moderate potential to cause dependence in animal studies.|$|E
