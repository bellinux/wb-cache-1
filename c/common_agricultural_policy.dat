5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy,</b> which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E

40|$|The reforms {{proposed}} by the authors intend to ensure the economic, social and environmental sustainability of rural regions and place <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> on a fundamentally different basis.

At the same time, measures aimed at enhancing the viability of the rural economy and society will become more significant.

Based on an empirical analysis of the consequences of the CAP reform in eight German regions, a number of key aspects for a future environmentally friendly development of the agrarian policy are suggested. The results indicate that the CAP reform currently does not increase the proportion of environmentally friendly production systems significantly. Cross Compliance is shown to have certain positive effects; it improves the control of environmentally damaging farm activities, in particular in the field of nitrate control. However, positive effects are limited and CC is often negatively associated with nature conservation. The results furthermore show that farms are affected varyingly by the CAP reform.

Our scenarios are based on our previous research on trends and developments in reindeer herding and nature conservation in Finland and are informed by two key uncertainties. The first uncertainty encompasses how and with what effects reindeer herding could be modified from being seen as a user of ecosystem services to being viewed and accepted as a producer of certain ecosystem services, an idea that resonates with the traditional biotope and landscape conservation schemes of the <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policies</b> (CAP) of the European Union (CAP 2010). The second uncertainty is related to whether policies and practises influencing reindeer herding are aiming to transform free grazing reindeer herding or whether they are actually policies intended to support and compensate existing herding practises.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{sustainability}} of livestock production in Sardinia, considering some externalities, Landscape, Ecosystem services and Water Footprint. The use of environmental resources as farm externalities, under the <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policies</b> (CAP) framework, was reviewed. Two specific indexes were developed (Livestock Index and Grazing Impact Index), and georeferenced maps were made to determine {{the environmental impact of}} stocking rate and identify overgrazed areas. Livestock is important to utilize and valorize large areas in Sardinia, especially those at risk of abandonment, thus livestock agroforestry was studied as a mean to improve the ecosystem services of Sardinian farms, by quantifying the surface utilized and evaluating sustainability based on the livestock and grazing impact indexes. Results showed that livestock agroforestry is an important environmental resource for animal production in Mediterranean areas, but it would be fundamental to reduce stocking rates to avoid the potential harmful effects of overgrazing on landscape productivity and value. A new approach to calculate the water footprint of meat and milk, the Net Water Footprint (WFPnet), was developed and compared with the Water Footprint (WFP) in different production scenarios.

The transition from the status-quo of an agricultural structure dominated by subsistence and semi-subsistence farms in the view of restructuring, resulting in a more efficient sector - is a must. Present study proposes to evaluate the application of specific measures of the Romanian National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) that sought to support semi-subsistence farms between 2007 and 2013. Three NRDP measures have been identified under which semi-subsistence farms were eligible: Measure 112 "Setting up of young farmers", Measure 121 "Modernization of agricultural holdings", and Measure 141 "Supporting semi-subsistence agricultural holdings". The above measures belong to the 1 st Axis of the <b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy's</b> second pillar, thus having a common general goal the improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, while aiming at restructuring and developing the physical potential and management of generation change - trying to keep the rural population in place.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{size and}} scope of {{simulation}} models is constantly growing in order {{to keep up with the}} requirements imposed by increasingly complex scenario analyses. Moreover, advances in the performance of simulation hardware, of communication software, and development frameworks, also offer unprecedented opportunities. As a consequence, the complexity of the design, implementation and deployment of simulation models is also increasing, up to a point that it might soon become unmanageable. We describe an approach aimed at taming such complexity based on the use of ontologies to structure modelling and simulation knowledge, which can be manipulated through a knowledge manager to facilitate the development of models and tools for simulation. We present two case studies and demonstrations of this approach. The first targets the integrated assessment of the <b>common</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> of the EU where models pertaining different domains (environmental, social, economic) and different scales (local, regional, continental) must be integrated. The second focuses on the integrated design of energy supply systems, where alternative models for energy supply systems must be integrated in order to select the best combination to produce energy minimizing costs and environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{the result}} of the {{research}} under CAP-IRE (<b>Common</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policies</b> on Rural Economies) project where the effects of post 2013 CAP scenarios are investigated. The broad objective is the understanding of farmer’s reactions under CAP scenarios taking into account a long-term perspective by 2020. The analysis is based on 1, 328 observations of household farmers across 11 case study regions in nine EU countries. The stated responses are analyzed in order to stress the influence of the next CAP reform on the farmer’s decision process of using more or less water resources on-farm. For this purpose the farmer’s responses to the CAP reforms are analyzed by a logistic model regression. According to the results, farmer’s behaviour would be slightly influenced by the CAP reform. However, significant regional differences are found according to the model regressions. Indeed, in the case of new member states, farmers would have a greater intention to decrease water use if the current CAP support was abolished. Yet factors such as the amount of CAP supports, farmland size, crop specialization, farmer’s age and altitude, are significant determinants of reaction to the CAP reforms. Taking into account the depicted influence on water use opportunities for re-addressing next policy design emerge...|$|R
