Nano-size TiO 2 is an excellent capturing and flocculating agent for DCS due to its large surface area and positive charge. The composition of dissolved and <b>colloidal</b> <b>substances</b> in a system {{and the removal of}} these substances by flocculation with nano-size TiO 2 colloids were determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The samples were obtained from non-deinked pulp (non-DIP), deinked pulp (DIP), and whitewater. The research results indicated that the removal efficiencies of the DCS, which are associated with the molecular structures, were sequenced from large to small as follows: resin acids and sterols, benzene derivatives containing carboxyl, fatty acids, and the phthalic acid esters. Then, the mechanism of flocculation removal of DCS was considered. With hydrogen bonding between the surface hydroxyl (Ti 4 +-OH) and the functional groups containing oxygen, the nano-size TiO 2 particles can capture dissolved substances (DS), and bridge <b>colloidal</b> <b>substances</b> (CS) and complexes to induce agglomerate flocculation. The flocculating removal efficiencies were influenced by the functional groups and alkyls of the DCS. Greater numbers and polarities of functional groups produced higher removal efficiencies.

Then Paul Vieille went one step further in 1882-84 and, after many trials and errors, succeeded in transforming guncotton into a <b>colloidal</b> <b>substance</b> by gelatinizing it in an alcohol-ether mixture following which he stabilized it with amyl alcohol. He then used roller presses to transform this gelatinized <b>colloidal</b> <b>substance</b> into extremely thin sheets which, after drying, were cut up into small flakes.

40|$|Calcium(II) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common metal ions in {{papermaking}} systems. However, the effect of Ca 2 + on papermaking processes has not drawn much attention. The adsorption of Ca 2 + from aqueous solutions onto bleached Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp fibers was investigated. Thermodynamic results indicate that the adsorption of Ca 2 + onto bleached E. globulus kraft pulp fibers was exothermic, reversible, and spontaneous. The equilibrium data followed Langmuir isotherms. The adsorption basically agrees with the ionic reaction model between carboxyl groups of fibers and Ca 2 + in which the molar ratio of carboxyl to Ca 2 + is close to 2 : 1. The binding capacity with carboxyl groups is so strong that the anionic charge of the adsorption sites in fibers can be screened, leading to decreased performance of cationic polyacrylamide for retention and drainage, Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) for sizing, and cationic starch for dry strength. The precipitation effect of Ca 2 + with three kinds of dissolved and <b>colloidal</b> <b>substances</b> (sodium rosinate, sodium stearate, sodium oxalate) also was investigated.

50|$|Black tea {{contains}} {{compounds that}} have low solubilities, {{which tend to}} bind together. The solution becomes cloudy and changes color to pale brown. This phenomenon is known as tea creaming. Research {{has shown that the}} cream is a <b>colloidal</b> <b>substance</b> that contains many of the compounds that contribute to color and flavor of black tea, and can contain up to 30% of the total solids. The driving force behind cream formation is the insolubility of theaflavin and polyphenols, which associate together through galloyl group interactions. The theaflavins have acidic properties which cause them to have a negative charge at the pH of black tea, which is roughly 4.9. Normally this would lead to electrostatic repulsions between the molecules, stabilizing the colloid. However, the presence of calcium ions (Ca2+) can neutralize these charges, promoting aggregation. Other charged metal ions, such as magnesium and aluminum, are also present in high concentrations in tea, but neither ions partition as well into tea as those of calcium. Glycosylation of the solution is also found to increase solubility of polyphenols while weakening self association. The proposed explanation is that the sheer size of the sugar makes it hard for other molecules to interact with each other. In the American market, instant tea is expected by the consumer to be clear when reconstituted, which makes the cream an unacceptable part of the solution. Industrially, a variety of methods have been patented to deal with the issue, such as the utilization of tannase to solubilize the cream. Another method developed was based on the identification of two classes in cream: low molecular weight compounds such as the polyphenols that contribute to flavor, and higher molecular weight compounds such as polysaccharides, polypeptides, and proteins. This process removes the high molecular weight compounds through ultrafiltration, absorption chromatography or oil filtration. The flavor compounds remain and do not cream.|$|E

50|$|Electrofiltration is a {{technique}} for separation and concentration of <b>colloidal</b> <b>substances</b> - for instance biopolymers. The principle of electrofiltration is based on overlaying electric field on a standard dead-end filtration.

This provides extreme decrease in the film formation on the micro- or ultra-filtration membranes and the reduction of filtration time from several hours by standard filtration to a few minutes by electrofiltration. In comparison to cross-flow filtration electrofiltration exhibits not only increased permeate flow but also guarantees reduced shear force stress which qualifies it as particularly mild technique for separation of biopolymers that are usually unstable.|$|R

40|$|M ANY {{attempts}} have been made to discover the causes of the various colours displayed b' 7 minerals. I f we except fluorescence and allied phenomena, the diiteren ~ theories advanced may in general be grouped under one or other of the following classes: (1) Colour may be due to an intrinsic property of atoms, ions, or molecules. Examples are copper atoms, chromate ions, and ferric oxide molecules. (2) Colour is sometimes attributed to structural causes. The blue tints of certain halites have been explained in this way; but a fresh suggestion is made in this communication. (3) A pigmentary impurity may cause the observed colour. The colour of the ruby is believed to be caused by the presence of a red chromic oxide. 1 The blue tint of a Yorkshire aragonite is shown later to be due to a copper salt. (4) Some minerals how plays of colours due to interference and/or grating effects. Labradorite and opal are cases in point. Into this group also fall minerals like bomite which become iridescent from tarnish. (5) Finally, some minerals owe their colour to the presence of foreign substances in colloid form. This differs from ordinary pigmentation i that the colour of the impurity itself bears no relation whatever to that of the mineral, because the colour is due to scattered light, not reflected light. The impurity may, when by itself, be actually colourless. Particles of colloid dimensions are too small to reflect incident light; they can only scatter it; hence for any one particular <b>colloidal</b> <b>substance</b> its own degree of dispersion will determine the wave-length or colour of the scattered light, whilst its concentration will fix the actual depth or intensity of that colour...|$|E
40|$|Watershed {{water quality}} {{concerns}} in theNortheast {{have focused on}} surface water,particularly the transport of contaminants insurface runoff. In watersheds with significant agricultural production, particularly dairy farms, nutrient and pathogen transport in runoff has been highlighted (Sharpley et al., 1994; EPA, 1990; Porter, 1975). For example, in the Catskills region which is the principal watershed supplying drinking water in reservoirs for New York City, the primary pollutants of concern are phosphorus and pathogens (particularly Cryptosporidium) in surface water. Given the strong adsorption characteristics of phosphorus in soils with high clay content, and aluminum and iron oxides, {{it is assumed that}} the vertical drainage of phosphorus is insignificant compared to its transport in surface runoff. Further, although the hydrologic transport characteristics of Cryptosporidium are not well understood, there is limited evidence to suggest that Cryptosporidium behaves like a <b>colloidal</b> <b>substance</b> (Brush, 1997); as a result, it is assumed that this too represents primarily a surface water contamination problem. The objectives of this research were to determine whether these contaminants can also be transported via subsurface tile drains. The identification of surface water as the primary contaminant transport delivery mechanism has provoked a set of management responses aimed at decreasing both the volume of surface runoff generated in contaminant loading areas and the concentration of contaminant in runoff. Since the passage of the Clean Water Act, the favored practices have been called best management practices (BMPs) which are implemented specifically to mitigate non-point source pollution (Loehr et al., 1979). One set of BMPs, which are essentially hydrologic control practices, attempt to improve water quality by altering farm hydrology so as to reduce surface runoff through contaminant loading areas. Such BMPs are distinct from pollutant source control practices which seek to manage the handling and disposal of the pollutant in the course of routine farm operations. Hydrologic control BMPs are designed to be installed in or adjacent to the manure-applied field to reduce surface runoff and off-field contaminant transport. Among the hydrologic control BMPs are subsurface âtile â drains, which form the focus of this article...|$|E

Therefore, the efficiency of cationic polymers improved, and subsequently they were able to fix the destabilized sticky particles on the fibers, which led to the decrease of stickies deposition.
