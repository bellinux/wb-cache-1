5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins <b>concisely</b> argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must be aesthetically pleasing. Generally, {{characters that}} are written correctly, legibly, <b>concisely,</b> {{and in the}} correct context are also aesthetically pleasing to some degree. Characters that violate the above rules are often less aesthetically pleasing.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{variables}} to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and <b>concisely</b> expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. Many quantitative relationships {{in science and}} mathematics are expressed as algebraic equations.|$|E

25|$|In June 2007, the British Nutrition Foundation {{issued a}} {{statement}} to define dietary fiber more <b>concisely</b> and list the potential health benefits established to date. Statement: 'Dietary fibre' {{has been used as}} a collective term for a complex mixture of substances with different chemical and physical properties which exert different types of physiological effects.|$|E
25|$|Stanley {{introduced}} a generalization of the h-vector, the toric h-vector, which is defined for an arbitrary ranked poset, and proved {{that for the}} class of Eulerian posets, the Dehn–Sommerville equations continue to hold. A different, more combinatorial, generalization of the h-vector that has been extensively studied is the flag h-vector of a ranked poset. For Eulerian posets, it can be more <b>concisely</b> expressed {{by means of a}} noncommutative polynomial in two variables called the cd-index.|$|E
25|$|A {{pathologist}} {{examines the}} tissue under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist can usually determine {{the type of}} cancer and its grade. Here, 'grade' refers to a scale used to represent <b>concisely</b> the predicted growth rate of the tumour and its tendency to spread, and this {{is determined by the}} degree to which the cancer cells appear abnormal when examined under a microscope. Low-grade sarcomas, although cancerous, are defined as those that are less likely to metastasise. High-grade sarcomas are defined as those more likely to spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
25|$|Usury {{was still}} {{banned by the}} Church in this period, with an {{interpretation}} <b>concisely</b> expressed as Quidquid sorti accedit, usura est ("Whatever exceeds the principal is usury"). So the Medici Bank could not openly adopt the modern formula of promising to pay interest on demand deposits and loaning out {{a fraction of the}} deposits at greater interest to pay for the interest on the deposit, since a depositor would gain revenue on the principal without any risk to the principal, which would have made both parties usurers and sinners; nor could they charge fees or other such devices.|$|E
25|$|Rabbenu Asher’s {{best known}} work is his {{abstract}} of Talmudic law. This work specifies the final, practical halakha, leaving out the intermediate discussion and <b>concisely</b> stating the final decision. It omits areas of law limited to Eretz Yisrael (such as agricultural and sacrificial laws) {{as well as}} the aggadic portions of the Talmud. Asher’s son Jacob compiled a list of the decisions found in the work, under the title Piskei Ha-ROSH (decisions of the ROSH). Commentaries on his Halachot were written by a number of later Talmudists. In yeshivot, this work is studied as a regular part of the daily Talmud study.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{important}} to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and <b>concisely,</b> especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.|$|E
25|$|Mondino's major work, Anathomia corporis humani, {{written in}} 1316, is {{considered}} the first example of a modern dissection manual and the first true anatomical text. The earliest edition of the work was printed in Padua in 1478, and more than 40 editions exist in total. By the 14th century, the practice of anatomy had come {{to refer to the}} dissection of a cadaver according to prescribed rules; Anathomia was intended as a handbook to guide this process. Anathomia remained the most widely-used anatomical text for 250 years (through the 16th century) because it clearly and <b>concisely</b> provided the important technical indications involved in the dissection process, including the steps involved and the reasoning behind the organization of these procedures. Unlike his predecessors, Mondino focuses specifically on anatomical descriptions rather than engaging in a larger discourse on pathology and surgery in general.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{permutation}} π {{contains the}} pattern 213 whenever π has three digits x, y, and z that appear within π {{in the order}} x...y...z but whose values are ordered as y<nbsp&xnbsp&<nbsp&z, {{the same as the}} ordering of the values in the permutation 213. The permutation 32415 on five elements contains 213 as a pattern in several different ways: 3··15, 32··5, 324··, and ·2·15 all form triples of digits with the same ordering as 213. Each of the subsequences 315, 325, 324, and 215 is called a copy, instance, or occurrence of the pattern. The fact that π contains σ is written more <b>concisely</b> as σ le& π. If a permutation π does not contain a pattern σ, then π is said to avoid σ. The permutation 51342 avoids 213; it has 10 subsequences of three digits, but none of these 10 subsequences has the same ordering as 213.|$|E
25|$|After his {{personal}} tragedies while he remaining locked in his room, Blackford {{began working on}} a book to report the important decisions of the Supreme Court and provide a legal source to the state lawyers and judges. He was meticulous and precise in his writing. His biographer attributed his ability to write <b>concisely</b> {{to the fact that he}} never practiced law extensively, and never developed the habit of writing lengthy arguments, but instead kept his thoughts clear and precise. Each volume he authored covered a decade of court decisions and were published four years after the decade was complete. So careful was Blackford in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the work, he regularly held up printing to make corrections found after a few volumes were printed, and after they were printed, if an error was reported, he would destroy the existing copies and have new ones made. He used his own savings to have the books published with the intention of selling them to lawyers in Indiana. The sale of the books brought Blackford a substantial income, and he earned between $1,500 and $2,000 annually on royalties.|$|E
25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, {{qualitative research}} {{is used to}} address questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon. The central to good qualitative research is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. Qualitative logic are for examining patterns across people. It is widely used in educational psychology. Educational psychologists only infrequently drew on qualitative literatures in the past 11 years to design their research studies. It does appear, however, that there has been {{an increase in the number}} of educational psychologists publishing studies using qualitative design frameworks in the past 5 years. On the other hand, it has its weakness as well. Qualitative formats for representing knowledge, such as text, afford insights into a learner’s understanding but are difficult to assemble into summary formats that <b>concisely</b> show a learner’s progress or allow comparisons among learners or across groups. The most fundamental and significant distinction between quantitative research method and qualitative research method is about the data, how the data collected and analyzed. Therefore, this article would be focus on the research methods and how the data collected and analyzed by researchers in qualitative research.|$|E
500|$|An aria is, {{according}} to Johann Mattheson in Der vollkommene Capellmeister (Part II, chapter 13, paragraph 10), [...] "correctly {{described as a}} well-composed song, {{which has its own}} particular key and meter, is usually divided into two parts, and <b>concisely</b> expresses a great affection.

500|$|COBOL has an English-like syntax, {{which is}} used to {{describe}} nearly everything in a program. For example, a condition can be expressed as [...] or more <b>concisely</b> as [...] or [...] More complex conditions can be [...] "abbreviated" [...] by removing repeated conditions and variables. For example, [...] can be shortened to [...] As a consequence of this English-like syntax, COBOL has over 300 keywords. Some of the keywords are simple alternative or pluralized spellings of the same word, which provides for more English-like statements and clauses; e.g., the [...] and [...] keywords can be used interchangeably, as can [...] and , and [...] and [...]|$|E
500|$|Sigmatropic rearrangements are <b>concisely</b> {{described}} by an order term , which {{is defined as}} the [...] of a σ-bond adjacent to one or more π systems to a new position (i−1) and (j−1) atoms removed from the original location of the σ-bond. When the sum of i and j is an even number, this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral, all C atom chain. An odd number is an indication of the involvement of a charged C atom or of a heteroatom lone pair replacing a CC double bond. Thus, [...] and [...] shifts become [...] and [...] shifts with heteroatoms, while preserving symmetry considerations. Hydrogens are omitted in the third example for clarity.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} an overall system for English was controversial: the {{analysis}} in [...] was popular amongst American linguists for a time (in the face of criticism, particularly from Hans Kurath); James Sledd put forth his own diaphonemic system that accommodated Southern American English; both [...] and [...] modified the scheme of The Sound Pattern of English {{by focusing on the}} diaphoneme, believing that it could address neutralizations better than structuralist approaches; and The Pronunciation of English in the Atlantic States [...] (PEAS) by Kurath and McDavid combined several dialects into one system transcribed in the IPA. [...] More recently, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language makes use of a diaphonemic transcription of Standard English so that examples can be expressed <b>concisely</b> without favoring any particular accent.|$|E
500|$|Of Stearn's {{writings}} on Linnaeus, the most well known is his {{edition of the}} 1753 Species plantarum, published in facsimile by the Ray Society in 1957, for which he wrote both a 176-page introduction and an appendix. Concerned that Linnaeus' methods were imperfectly understood by his contemporaries, Stearn wrote that his introduction [...] "provided <b>concisely</b> all the information about his [...] life, herbaria, publications, methodology etc. which a botanical taxonomist needs to know". The Times stated that no other botanist possessed the historical knowledge and linguistic skills to write, what {{is considered one of}} the classic studies of the Swedish naturalist and a highpoint of 20th century botanical scholarship. Subsequently Stearn became a recognised authority on Linnaeus. Stearn produced similar introductions to a number of other editions of Linnaeus' works, including Genera Plantarum, Mantissa plantarum and [...] Later, he would produce a bicentenary guide to Linnaeus (1978) for the Linnean Society.|$|E
500|$|While filming, Steve Carell and Tim Meadows improvised a lot {{of their}} dinner scene, but most of it never made the final cut. One improvised scene that did make the final cut was the [...] "Baby Back Ribs" [...] song. In an interview, Jenna Fischer said that the rooftop scene was her {{favorite}} to shoot. Fischer recalled that [...] "there was a very small crew up on the roof and they had the cameras really far away." [...] After the main shooting ended, producers decided to do a re-shoot to explain the [...] "Dwigt" [...] situation clearly and <b>concisely.</b> The kiss between Michael and Jan was rehearsed and filmed [...] "many, many, many times", according to B.

From street performers to homeless youth {{to some of the most}} famous celebrities in the world, Thirty Seconds to Mars compiled a panel that <b>concisely</b> and visually demonstrate the extreme highs and lows of Los Angeles in eleven minutes." [...] Luke O'Neil from MTV noted that [...] "interspersed with the real celebrities are a series of celebrity impersonators, which only heightens the underlying conceit about the fuzzy intersection of dreams and reality. That's the idea of Los Angeles". Emily Wright from The Boston Globe noticed the [...] "raw, personal side to some of today's most popular celebrities" [...] featured. Scott Sterling of CBS News called it a [...] "compelling examination on life in Los Angeles".|$|E
500|$|In October 1772, {{he arrived}} on the {{mainland}} and began learning fundamental subjects missing from his education. He attended the Elizabethtown Academy, a grammar school in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. In 1773, he studied with Francis Barber at Elizabethtown in preparation for college work. He came {{under the influence of}} William Livingston, a leading intellectual and revolutionary, with whom he lived for a time at his Liberty Hall. Hamilton entered The King's College in New York City (now Columbia University) in the autumn of 1773 [...] "as a private student", and officially matriculated in May 1774. His friend Robert Troup spoke glowingly of Hamilton's ability to clearly and <b>concisely</b> explain the rights and reasons that the patriots had in their case against the British, in what is credited as his first public appearance on July 6, 1774 at the liberty pole at King's College. Hamilton, Troup, and four other undergraduates formed an unnamed literary society that is regarded as a precursor of the Philolexian Society.|$|E

Its teachings center on [...] "Slack" [...] (always capitalized), which is never <b>concisely</b> defined, except in the claim that Dobbs embodies the quality. Church members seek to acquire [...] "Slack" [...] and believe that it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) which they claim as an entitlement. Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain [...] "Slack". Davidoff believes that [...] "Slack" [...] is [...] "the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals".

500|$|... "Something There" [...] has {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} film and music critics. Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "where {{the genius of}} music as storytelling kicks in." [...] In Brew's opinion, the [...] "utterly convincing and un-mawkish" [...] song works [...] "because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other." [...] Brew concluded, [...] "Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this." [...] Filmtracks.com described [...] "Something There" [...] as an [...] "affable" [...] song.

500|$|A [...] (or [...] ) clause is {{a string}} of characters, each of which {{represents}} {{a portion of the}} data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a [...] indicates a decimal digit, and an [...] indicates that the item is signed. Other picture characters (called [...] and [...] characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of [...] characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a [...] to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more <b>concisely</b> by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, [...] is equivalent to [...] Picture specifications containing only digit (...) and sign (...) characters define purely [...] data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic (...) or alphanumeric (...) characters define [...] data items. The presence of other formatting characters define [...] or [...] data items.|$|E
500|$|The {{right to}} trace {{may be lost}} if the {{property}} cannot be found, or no longer exists. Defences to tracing are possible. The [...] "change of position" [...] defence is where the defendant has received property and giving it back would change his personal circumstances. This was <b>concisely</b> defined by Lord Goff in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale as [...] "Where an innocent defendant's position is so changed that he will suffer an injustice if called upon to repay or to repay in full, the injustice of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustice of denying the plaintiff restitution". Such a defence is closely linked with unjust enrichment, and has limitations. Any bad faith {{on the part of}} the defendant will invalidate the defence, such as if the recipient of the property has encouraged the payer to transfer it or has received it by mistake and then used it without making enquiries. The defence is also not available to people who act illegally, as in Barros Mattos v MacDaniels Ltd. Activity which constitutes a [...] "change of position" [...] can be broadly defined as taking steps which would not otherwise have been taken, or not taking steps which otherwise would have been taken, as a result of receiving the property.|$|E
