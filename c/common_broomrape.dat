50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>broomrape</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} species, and is native to Southern Europe, but has been widely introduced elsewhere, for example in the United States. In New Zealand it is the only species of the genus present where it is regarded as an agricultural pest. In the United Kingdom it is widely recorded in southern England, less common in Wales, rarely recorded in lowland Scotland and absent from the Highlands and outer islands.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have placed}} this {{species in the}} taxonomically difficult Minores species complex. Four infraspecific taxa of <b>Common</b> <b>broomrape</b> are currently recognised in the United Kingdom: O. minor var. minor, O. minor var. flava, O. minor var. compositarum and O. minor subsp. maritima. Chromosome No.: 2n = 38. The genetic structure of populations of O. minor are under investigation using molecular markers and DNA sequencing to help resolve the taxonomic and nomenclatural problems that have historically been linked with this species.|$|E
50|$|Orobanche ramosa is {{a species}} of {{broomrape}} known by the <b>common</b> names hemp <b>broomrape</b> and branched broomrape. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is known in many other places as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed.|$|R
50|$|Orobanche pinorum is {{a species}} of {{broomrape}} known by the <b>common</b> name conifer <b>broomrape.</b> It is native to the forests of western North America, where it is a parasite growing attached {{to the roots of}} other plants, usually Holodiscus species. This plant has an erect stem with a wide, thickened base and slender top growing 10 - 30 cm tall. As a parasite taking its nutrients from a host plant, it lacks leaves and chlorophyll and is brownish or yellowish in color. The inflorescence is a dense, spreading array of purple-tinged yellowish flowers 1 - 2 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Orobanche corymbosa is {{a species}} of {{broomrape}} known by the <b>common</b> name flat-top <b>broomrape.</b> It is native to western North America where it is a parasite growing attached {{to the roots of}} other plants, usually sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata). It produces a cluster of thick, glandular stems with enlarged bases and stout roots, the hairy stems pale whitish or yellowish, often purple-tinged, and up to 17 cm tall. As a parasite taking its nutrients from a host plant, it lacks leaves and chlorophyll. The inflorescence is a wide array of a few tubular flowers. Each is 2 cm or 3 cm long, coated in glandular hairs, and dark-veined pink or purple in color.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>broomrape</b> {{is highly}} generalist in its host range, and can infect {{hundreds}} of species in families from the Ranunculaceae to the Poaceae (=Gramineae) {{but with a}} clear preference for the Fabaceae (=Leguminosae) and Asteraceae (=Compositae). However races occurring on different species of host are genetically divergent and physiologically adapted to their local hosts, and may therefore be {{in a state of}} incipient speciation. [...] Urgent conservation efforts are required as the survival of some intraspecific taxa is very uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Nob End was {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) (file designation SD70/2) in 1988, under Section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. and as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) in 2000. The contamination of the land from the old chemical works with waste from the Leblanc process has resulted in an alkaline soil that now supports a variety of plants not found elsewhere in Greater Manchester, including many types of orchid, most notable amongst these are Fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, the Northern Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza purpurella, the Early Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza incarnata and other species such as <b>Common</b> <b>Broomrape,</b> Twayblade, Blue fleabane and Carline thistle. The reserve covers 8.8 hectares (21 acres).|$|E
50|$|The Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) have {{surveyed}} the grounds and recorded 19 {{species of birds}} and 136 species of plants. The grounds have a rich fungal flora, {{partly due to the}} quantity of fallen timber. This is exemplified by the presence of parrot waxcap (Hygrocybe psittacina), an uncommon species. The biodiversity and other considerations have resulted in the grounds qualifying as an official SWT Wildlife Site, code NS353532. This ensures a greater degree of protection against any possibly insensitive developments that might be proposed at any future date. In 2010 a specimen of the Arran whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) a rare species unique to Scotland, was found at Spier's. In 2011 the exceptionally rare <b>common</b> <b>broomrape</b> (Orobanche minor) was discovered growing at Spier's and {{has been the subject of}} a conservation project since that date.|$|E
5000|$|Orobanche parishii is {{a species}} of {{broomrape}} known by the <b>common</b> names Parish's <b>broomrape</b> and short-lobed broomrape. It is native to the coast and mountains of California and Baja California, where it is a parasite growing attached {{to the roots of}} other plants, usually shrubs of the Asteraceae, such as Menzies' goldenbush (Isocoma menziesii). This plant produces usually one thick, hairy, glandular, pale yellowish stem up to about 26 cm tall. As a parasite taking its nutrients from a host plant, it lacks leaves and chlorophyll. The inflorescence is a dense cluster of flowers accompanied by dark-veined oval bracts. Each flower has a calyx of triangular sepals and a tubular corolla roughly 2 cm long, pale brownish or pinkish in color with red veining.|$|R

50|$|Orobanche cooperi is {{a species}} of {{broomrape}} known by the <b>common</b> name Cooper's <b>broomrape</b> desert broomrape, spike broomrape, and burroweed strangler. It is native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it is a parasite growing attached {{to the roots of}} other plants, usually members of the Asteraceae, such as Artemisia, Hymenoclea, Ambrosia and Encelia. Although not usually weedy, it has been found infesting agricultural cropland, including tomato fields in inland California. This plant arises from a thick root and a scaly, twisted stem base, and produces a thick, clumpy stem up to 40 centimeters tall. As a parasite taking its nutrients from a host plant, it lacks leaves and chlorophyll. It is dark purple in color and coated with glandular hairs. The inflorescence is an elongated array of several flowers. Each flower is tubular, purple and hairy, and up to about 3 centimeters long.|$|R
40|$|Broomrapes are holoparasitic plants {{spreading}} through seeds. Each plant produces {{hundreds of}} thousands of seeds which remain viable in the soils for decades. To limit their spread, drastic measures are being taken and the contamination of a commercial seed lot by a single broomrape seed can lead to its rejection. Considering that broomrapes species identification from a single seed is extremely difficult even for trained botanists and that among all the described species, only a few are really noxious for the crops, numerous seed lots are rejected because of the contamination by seeds of non-noxious broomrape species. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and evaluate a High Resolution Melting assay identifying the eight most noxious and <b>common</b> <b>broomrape</b> species (P. aegyptiaca, O. cernua, O. crenata, O. cumana, O. foetida, O. hederae, O. minor, and P. ramosa) from a single seed. Based on trnL and rbcL plastidial genes amplification, the designed assay successfully identifies O. cumana, O. cernua, O. crenata, O. minor, O. hederae, and O. foetida; P. ramosa and P. aegyptiaca can be differentiated from other species but not from each other. Tested on 50 seed lots, obtained results perfectly matched identifications performed by sequencing. Through the analysis of common seed lots by different analysts, the reproducibility of the assay was evaluated at 90 %. Despite an original sample preparation process it was not possible to extract enough DNA from some seeds (10 % of the samples). The described assay fulfils its objectives and allows an accurate identification of the targeted broomrape species. It can be used to identify contaminants in commercial seed lots or for any other purpose. The assay might be extended to vegetative material...|$|E
50|$|Orobanche fasciculata is {{a species}} of {{broomrape}} known by the <b>common</b> name clustered <b>broomrape.</b> It is native to much of western and central North America from Alaska to northern Mexico to the Great Lakes region, where it grows in many types of habitat. It is a parasite growing attached {{to the roots of}} other plants, usually members of the Asteraceae, such as Artemisia, Eriodictyon, and Eriogonum. This plant produces one or more stems from a thick root, growing erect to about 20 centimeters in maximum height.
