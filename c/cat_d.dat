40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of dementia, leading to memory loss {{progressive}} cognitive decline over the course of what can be many years. Mutations in the catalytically active component of the γ-secretase complex, presenilin 1 (PS 1), are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD), a less-prevalent but earlier-onset form of AD. PS 1 mutation is associated with more severe lysosomal and autophagic pathologies than are found in sporadic AD; these pathologies may be a result of lysosomal pH dysregulation. The goal of this dissertation was to confirm a role for elevated lysosomal pH in cells from PS 1 -fAD patients, to investigate the repercussions of this lysosomal dysfunction, and to identify a therapeutic approach by which to restore both pH and lysosomal pathology to normal. Using human skin fibroblasts containing the PS 1 -fAD mutation A 246 E, the present work identified a small but significant increase in lysosomal pH in PS 1 -fAD mutant cells when compared to control fibroblasts. The pH data were supported by a reduction in mature cathepsin D (<b>Cat</b> <b>D)</b> and <b>Cat</b> <b>D</b> active site availability in PS 1 -fAD cells, as well as by substantial accumulation of autophagic substrates and up-regulation of components of the lysosomal and autophagic degradative systems, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Treatment with cAMP proved restorative, bringing lysosomal pH in PS 1 -fAD cells back to baseline while having minimal effect on control cells. cAMP increased <b>Cat</b> <b>D</b> active site availability, reduced autophagic backlog, and led both to mTOR phosphorylation and to down-regulation of genes involved in lysosomal function. Interestingly, cAMP-induced pH restoration, as well as <b>Cat</b> <b>D</b> increase and mTOR phosphorylation, was found to be PKA-dependent, suggesting a signaling pathway that may serve as a useful target for future treatment, and implicating PKA in the immediate, upstream response to cAMP treatment, and mTOR and gene expression modulation in the downstream response. This treatment proved effective in compromised lysosomes from primary neuronal cultures, as well, supporting the general utility of a cAMP-based approach. Together, these results identify lysosomal pH elevation as an important factor in AD pathology, and suggest several possible targets for future therapeutic investigation. ...|$|E

The mice of I group {{received}} peritoneally 100 μg/g b. w. of reduced glutathione (GSH) in 250 μl 0. 9 % NaCl, II group 200 μg/ g of GSH in 250 μl 0. 9 % NaCl and mice of III control group received 250 μl of 0. 9 % NaCl. In the lysosomal {{fraction of the}} liver, kidney and the skeletal muscle the activity of nine lysosomal enzymes were estimated. GSH injections caused in the liver a statistically confirmed increase of activity of estimated hydrolases, only the activity LL decreased significantly and NAGL did not change.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the isometric and force-velocity properties of the fast-twitch flexor digitorum longus (f. d. l.) and the slow-twitch soleus muscles of the developing kitten were determined at post-natal ages of 2 days and 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. The contractile properties of the isometric twitch and tetanus {{were similar to those}} previously reported by other authors. The minimum stimulation frequency required for isotonic contractions to achieve the maximum speed of shortening at any given load was 200 Hz for f. d. l. and 150 Hz for soleus at all ages. The extrapolated maximum speed of sarcomere (sarc.) shortening (Vmax) was significantly different between the f. d. l. (22. 3 microns s- 1 sarc. - 1) and soleus (13. 1 microns s- 1 sarc. - 1) at 2 days of age. The f. d. l. Vmax achieved adult values by 4 weeks of age, while there was little or no change in the soleus Vmax.
