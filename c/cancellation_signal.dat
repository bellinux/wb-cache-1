40|$|Abstract – One of {{the major}} {{drawbacks}} of OFDM is high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) which can result in poor power efficiency and serious distortion in the transmitter amplifier. Tone Reservation (TR) is a technique designed to combat this problem by reserving a number of carriers (tones) in the frequency domain to generate a <b>cancellation</b> <b>signal</b> in the time domain to remove high peaks. However TR can have a high associated computational cost due to the difficulties in finding an effective <b>cancellation</b> <b>signal</b> in the time domain by using only a few tones in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcoming this problem by creating a Gaussian pulse as the <b>cancellation</b> <b>signal</b> from {{only a small number}} of reserved tones. This facilitates a simple and effective algorithm for reducing peak values while minimizing the occurrence of secondary peaks, the latter being a key factor in contributing to the high computational complexity of tone reservation algorithms...|$|E

30|$|The Stanford {{architecture}} [4, 32] proposes {{measuring the}} transmitted RF signal (e.g., {{with a low}} insertion loss coupler) immediately before it {{is applied to the}} antenna.

A practical implementation of this approach using tapped delay lines achieved 45 dB active suppression, over a 40 MHz bandwidth at 2.45 GHz [4]. An advantage of the Stanford architecture is that hardware imperfections introduced by the transmitter circuit are inherently included in the <b>cancellation</b> <b>signal.</b> However, system-specific RF cancellation circuits are required to model the effect of the channel and the architecture does not scale well to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as each transmitter-receiver pair requires a dedicated circuit [32].|$|E

Several implementations of the Rice architecture have been reported [5, 34]. The initial prototype achieved between 20 and 34 dB analog suppression for transmit powers ranging from 0 and 15 dBm (generally suppression decreases with increasing transmit power), over a 40 MHz bandwidth on a WARP platform [5]. Similar results were reported using a National Instruments (NI) FlexRIO platform, with an average 48 dB active suppression over a 20 MHz bandwidth for 4 dBm transmit power [34]. For both implementations, further suppression was achieved in the digital domain; however, both groups observed the suppression introduced by digital cancellation depended on the analog stage and that the total suppression achieved was approximately constant [5, 18, 34].
