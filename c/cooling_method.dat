25|$|This <b>cooling</b> <b>method</b> {{worked well}} for smaller dairies, however was fairly inefficient {{and was unable to}} meet the {{increasingly}} higher cooling demand of larger milking parlors. In the mid-1950s direct expansion refrigeration was first applied directly to the bulk milk cooler. This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank to remove heat from the milk. Direct expansion is able to cool milk at a much faster rate than early ice bank type coolers and is still the primary method for bulk tank cooling today on small to medium-sized operations.|$|E
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this <b>cooling</b> <b>method</b> of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} lambic beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E

50|$|Since PV cooling's cost {{effectiveness}} {{depends largely on}} the cooling equipment and given the poor efficiencies in electrical <b>cooling</b> <b>methods</b> until recently {{it has not been}} cost effective without subsidies.

500|$|Other {{bacteria}} {{found on}} lettuce include Aeromonas species, {{which have not}} been linked to any outbreaks; Campylobacter species, which cause campylobacteriosis; and Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia kristensenii (species of Yersinia), which have been found mainly in lettuce. Lettuce {{has been linked to}} numerous outbreaks of the bacteria [...] and Shigella; the plants were most likely contaminated through contact with animal feces. A 2007 study determined that the vacuum <b>cooling</b> <b>method,</b> especially prevalent in the California lettuce industry, increased the uptake and survival rates of E. coli O157:H7. Salmonella bacteria, including the uncommon Salmonella braenderup type, have also caused outbreaks traced to contaminated lettuce. Viruses, including hepatitis A, calicivirus and a Norwalk-like strain, have been found in lettuce. The vegetable has also been linked to outbreaks of parasitic infestations, including Giardia lamblia.|$|E
2500|$|Sitting in {{a bathtub}} of tepid or cool water (immersion method) can remove a {{significant}} amount of heat in {{a relatively short period of}} time. [...] It was once thought that immersion in very cold water is counterproductive, as it causes vasoconstriction in the skin and thereby prevents heat from escaping the body core. [...] However, a British analysis of various studies stated: [...] "this has never been proven experimentally. [...] Indeed, a recent study using normal volunteers has shown that cooling rates were fastest when the coldest water was used." [...] The analysis concluded that cool water immersion is the most-effective cooling technique for exertional heat stroke. [...] No superior <b>cooling</b> <b>method</b> has been found for non-exertional heat stroke. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the gold standard for life-threatening heat stroke.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936–1939, Goddard {{began work}} on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and {{designed}} to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624lbs.in February 1936. [...] This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around {{the outside of the}} combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain <b>cooling</b> <b>method</b> that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Returning to a smaller design, the L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7mi; 8,900ft), the highest of any of Goddard's rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.|$|E
