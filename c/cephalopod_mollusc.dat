We present {{data on the}} <b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc</b> Sepia officinalis, an invertebrate {{that is capable of}} not only maintaining calcification, but also growth rates and metabolism when exposed to elevated partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO 2). During a 6 wk period, juvenile S. officinalis maintained calcification under ~ 4000 and ~ 6000 ppm CO 2, and grew at the same rate with the same gross growth efficiency as did control animals. They gained approximately 4 % body mass daily and increased the mass of their calcified cuttlebone by over 500 %.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the distribution of oxytocin/vasopressin (OT/VP) superfamily peptides in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of the cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, by using antibodies raised against mammalian OT and VP. Several populations of OT-like and VP-like immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were widely distributed in cerebral structures involved in learning processes (vertical lobe complex, optic lobes), behavioral communication (peduncle, lateral basal and chromatophore lobes), feeding behavior (inferior frontal, brachial and buccal lobes), sexual activity (dorsal basal, subpedunculate, olfactory lobes), and metabolism (visceral lobes). The two most remarkable findings of this study were the occurrence of OT-like immunoreactivity in many amacrine cells of the vertical lobe and the dense accumulation of VP-like immunoreactive cell bodies in the subpedunculate 1 lobe. No double-immunolabeled cell bodies or fibers were found in any lobes of the CNS, indicating, {{for the first time in}} a decapod <b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc,</b> the existence of distinct oxytocinergic-like and vasopressinergic-like systems.

40|$|The {{cuttlefish}} Sepia officinalis (<b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc)</b> {{appears to}} be more tolerant to ocean acidification conditions compared to more hypometabolic invertebrates. It is concluded that the cuttlefish ecotype is not only an efficient acid-base regulator, but is also able to do so without disturbing metabolic equilibria in characteristic tissues. S. officinalis maintains control growth rates during six-week exposure to 0. 6 kPa CO 2, however, in contrast to most invertebrates, the calcification rate of the cuttlebone increases. The maintenance of calcification during exposure to elevated seawater pCO 2 is attributed to strong ion regulatory abilities. Our results are in line with existing studies that have found higher sensitivity to elevated seawater pCO 2 of early life stages compared to juveniles and adults. Assessment of ecologically relevant species sensitivity cannot yet be performed.

5|$|When <b>cephalopod</b> <b>molluscs</b> like squid and {{cuttlefish}} {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light.

Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{anthropogenic}} {{pressures in}} estuaries {{are responsible for}} the rise of contaminants in several compartments of these ecosystems. Species that benefit from the nursery services provided by estuaries are exposed to such contaminants (e. g. metals and metalloids). It is therefore relevant to understand if marine invertebrates that use these areas as spawning grounds accumulate contaminants in their tissues throughout embryogenesis. This study aimed to quantify As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Se, Pb, V and Zn concentrations in both capsule and embryos of the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in Sado Estuary (Portugal). Moreover, embryos at their initial, intermediate and final stage of development were collected in sites subjected to different anthropogenic pressures. In general, the capsule accumulated higher element concentration throughout embryogenesis which indicates that the capsule acts as an effective barrier against contaminants uptake by the embryo. Although the capsule becomes thinner throughout embryogenesis, embryo’s protection {{does not seem to be}} compromised at later development stages. Additionally, the higher concentrations of As, Cu, Se and Zn in the embryo in comparison to the capsule suggests important biological roles during the embryogenesis of this <b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis (<b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc)</b> has {{recently}} become a relevant model {{for studying the}} setting-up of brain asymmetry among invertebrates. As the animals age from 3 to 30 days post hatching, they progressively develop a left-turning bias resulting from an eye-use preference. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether anatomical (vertical, peduncle, inferior buccal, and optic lobes) or neurochemical (monoamines in optic lobes) brain asymmetries are present in the cuttlefish brain at 3 or at 30 post hatching days; and whether these correlate with side-turning preferences. We here find brain and behavioral asymmetry only at 30 post hatching days. Cuttlefish displayed a significant population bias towards a larger right peduncle lobe, and higher monoamine concentration in the left optic lobe (i. e. serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline). None of these brain asymmetries were correlated to the studied side-turning bias. However, we found individual variation in the magnitude of the vertical and optic lobes asymmetry. A striking correlation was found with the behavioral results: the larger the right optic lobe and the right part of the vertical lobe, the stronger the bias to turn leftwards. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a relationship at the individual level between brain and behavioral asymmetries in invertebrates...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEvidence of sex {{differences}} in spatial cognition {{have been reported in}} a wide range of vertebrate species. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences. The one best supported is the range size hypothesis that links spatial ability to range size. Our study aimed to determine whether male cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis; <b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc)</b> range over a larger area than females and whether this difference is associated with a cognitive dimorphism in orientation abilities. First, we assessed the distance travelled by sexually immature and mature cuttlefish of both sexes when placed in an open field (test 1). Second, cuttlefish were trained to solve a spatial task in a T-maze, and the spatial strategy preferentially used (right/left turn or visual cues) was determined (test 2). Our results showed that sexually mature males travelled a longer distance in test 1, and were more likely to use visual cues to orient in test 2, compared with the other three groups. This paper demonstrates for the first time a cognitive dimorphism between sexes in an invertebrate. The data conform to the predictions of the range size hypothesis.

While intensive literature reports that these neuropeptides influence behavior, especially learning and memory, in numerous species from diverse vertebrate groups, their roles in behavioral regulation have never been studied in invertebrates. Here, we investigated the role of two VP/OT superfamily peptides, octopressin (OP) and cephalotocin (CT), on long-term memory (LTM) formation of a passive avoidance task in a <b>cephalopod</b> <b>mollusc,</b> the cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. Subadult cuttlefish were intravenously injected, in a dose range of 3 - 60 microg/kg, 1 h after the training phase (consolidation design); retention performance was tested 24 h post-training. We found that administration of OP at low dose (3 microg/kg) enhanced LTM, whereas a dose of 60 microg/kg attenuated it. No effect of OP on LTM was observed for the 15 microg/kg dose. Conversely, an enhancement of retention performance was observed at all doses of CT tested. This study is the first to demonstrate the behavioral effects of VP/OT superfamily peptides in an invertebrate species.

Some nervous structures (e. g. the magnocellular lobes) exhibited a stained pattern in newborns similar to that reported in our previous study in adult cuttlefish whereas other lobes (e. g. the vertical lobe complex) showed maturation during the first weeks of life. Finally, at the age of 60 days, the general pattern of staining in the CNS was comparable to the adult distribution. The putative roles of the OT-like system with regard to the development of some behaviors in juvenile cuttlefish are discussed. The present study provides a neurochemical basis for the investigation of postnatal development of complex behaviors in cephalopods and suggests, for the first time in an invertebrate species, important organizational effects for the OT-like system in the course of the first weeks of life...|$|E
