50|$|A {{goods station}} is usually {{equipped}} {{with a large number}} of storage and loading sidings in order to fulfil its task. On the loading sidings there may be fixed facilities, such as cranes <b>or</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts,</b> <b>or</b> temporary equipment, such as wheeled ramps for the loading of sugar beet.|$|R
50|$|Revolving {{platform}} - Some dollies have {{a revolving}} platform to facilitate rotating the ULDs {{to the correct}} orientation before transferring them onto a cargo <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> ULD/pallet lift leading to the aircraft bay. Some revolving platforms are power assisted.|$|R
50|$|Slats {{are made}} by {{continuous}} casting. Casting is the pouring of molten metal or plastic into a mold. Continuous casting might involve a series of molds on a wheel <b>or</b> a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> the pushing of semi-solid material {{through a hole in}} a certain shape, as in the making of noodles.|$|R

50|$|Picking {{can be both}} manual or automated. Manual picking can be both man to goods, i.e. {{operator}} using a cart <b>or</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>or</b> {{goods to}} man, i.e. the operator benefiting from {{the presence of a}} mini-load ASRS, vertical or horizontal carousel or from an Automatic Vertical Storage System (AVSS). Automatic picking is done either with dispensers or depalletizing robots.|$|R
40|$|Programmable vector {{fields are}} an {{abstraction}} {{to represent a}} new class of devices for distributed, non-prehensile manipulation for applications in parts feeding, sorting, positioning, and assembly. Unlike robot grippers, <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts,</b> <b>or</b> vibratory bowl feeders, these devices generate force vector fields in which the parts move until they may reach a stable equilibrium pose.

5000|$|Hydroentanglement is a {{bonding process}} for wet or dry fibrous webs made by either carding, airlaying or wet-laying, the {{resulting}} bonded fabric being a nonwoven. It uses fine, high pressure jets of water which penetrate the web, hit the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> (<b>or</b> [...] "wire" [...] as in papermaking conveyor) and bounce back causing the fibres to entangle.|$|R
5000|$|If {{only a small}} {{section of}} a station {{is used for the}} loading and {{unloading}} of goods, it may be referred to as the [...] "loading area" [...] or [...] "loading dock" [...] and has its own access and signposting. Often there are no facilities for loading and the individual firm has to organise its own loading equipment such as <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> lorry cranes.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} of a laser spectroscopic gas detection {{system will be}} developed which allows high speed detection of explosives around a person or a mobile object up to distances of 1 m. High speed detection {{is a prerequisite for}} moving targets (e. g. on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt)</b> <b>or</b> for fast screening of persons and/or objects.

5000|$|Kaiten-zushi is a sushi {{restaurant}} where the plates with the sushi {{are placed on}} a rotating <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> moat that winds through the restaurant and moves past every table, counter and seat. Customers may place special orders, but most simply pick their selections from {{a steady stream of}} fresh sushi moving along the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> The final bill is based on the number and type of plates of the consumed sushi. Some restaurants use a fancier presentation such as miniature wooden [...] "sushi boats" [...] traveling small canals or miniature locomotive cars.|$|R
5000|$|If {{customers}} cannot {{find their}} desired sushi, {{they can make}} special orders. Sometimes speaker phones are available for this purpose above the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> If a small quantity of sushi is ordered, it {{is placed on the}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> but marked so other customers know that this dish was ordered by someone. Usually, the plate with the sushi sits on a labeled cylindrical stand to indicate that this is a special order. For large orders the sushi may also be brought to the customer by the attendants. Some restaurants in Japan also have touch screen displays for ordering specific dishes which might be delivered on a separate <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> by waiters.|$|R
30|$|In radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID), a reader device interrogates tags for identification. A large branch of RFID deals with the identification of a multitude of tags that may identify, e.g., products in a store, parts on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>or</b> items in a warehouse. Predominantly, passive tags that are powered by the field emitted by the reader are employed. Such tags are cheap and can be produced in high volumes, which has made RFID a ubiquitous technology. An overview is provided in [1, 2].|$|R
50|$|Ionizing {{bars are}} most {{commonly}} suspended above a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> other apparatus in a production line where the product can pass below it; the distance is usually calibrated {{for the specific}} application. The bar works by emitting an ionized corona onto the products below it. If then a product on the line has a positive or negative static charge, as it passes through the ionized aura created by the bar, it will attract the correspondingly charged positive or negative ions and become electrically neutral.|$|R
50|$|Curtain coating is {{a process}} that creates an {{uninterrupted}} curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate. The substrate is transported on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> calender rolls at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the die. The curtain is created by using a slit or die {{at the base of the}} holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Some polymers are melted and extruded for coating. Many manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.|$|R
50|$|Incoming {{trailers}} dock at {{the primary}} section of CACH, located {{in the center of}} the facility. There are 174 trailers in this section, separated into sections of three, called p-modules. Here, packages and bags of small packages are taken out of trailers and put on movable <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Individual small packages are put in boxes and sent to the small sort section of the building. The packages are then read in a tunnel by 16 scanners and a camera, which signals a series of paddles to divert the packages onto other <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> When a box is scanned, the box is diverted to the small sort on the mezzanine, or second level of the building. Items that are not diverted go onto <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> the DA (Data Acquisition), which relabels packages. Open packages are unloaded from the primary section and put on one of two <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> to be sorted.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{development}} of an optical sensor for surface-velocity measurement based on ordinary optical mouse sensor. The proposed sensor should have find its usage in industrial applications for low-cost contactless measurement of <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> semi-finished products, thus some other gauges could check quality of products. Theoretical part of this thesis includes introduction to optical sensors and their usage. Rest of the work describes practical part consisting of programming of communication between sensor and PC in MATLAB and Arduino environments, development of simple device based on Arduino hardware, the set-up of experimental workplace and providing speed tests...|$|R
40|$|The oceans are in {{constant}} flux. The movement of ocean water is readily observable {{in the rise}} and fall of the tides and the continual lapping of waves along the coastlines of continents and islands. Less obvious is the network of currents that constantly circulates ocean water from one side of the globe to another. This map illustrates the network of currents known as the great ocean <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>or</b> the thermohaline <b>conveyor,</b> and shows which portions are travelled by warm and shallow, or cold and salty, currents. A background essay and discussion questions are included. Educational levels: Middle school, High school...|$|R
50|$|Various test {{machines}} {{have been}} developed to measure slip angle in a controlled environment. A motorcycle tire test machine is located at the University of Padua. That uses a 3 meter diameter disk that rotates under a tire held at a fixed steer and camber angle, up to 54 degrees. Sensors measure the force and moment generated, and a correction is made to account for the curvature of the track. Other devices use the inner or outer surface of rotating drums, sliding planks, <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts,</b> <b>or</b> a trailer that presses the test tire to an actual road surface.|$|R
5000|$|Coal and culm were {{received}} {{at the ground}} level. Dry culm was taken away from the coal breaker by <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> rail car and dumped nearby. Very fine dry culm was sometimes separated from the heavier culm by forced air and blown through tubes to a separate pile. Wet culm was generally held in settling tanks or behind a coal slurry impoundment dam to allow particulate to settle out of the water. The [...] "clean" [...] coal, emerging from the coal breaker already sorted into its respective sizes, was collected primarily by rail cars and then delivered to market.|$|R
50|$|The {{supply in}} demand and {{production}} lines are symbolized through greediness, and formation of lines made by people. The lines of workers (maids, butlers, cooks, etc.) all represent {{some sort of}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>or</b> assembly line. If one looks at factories in America, they used these assembly lines {{to make sure that}} production was rapid! There are several times in this film where the maids and the butlers, or other workers of the Quakers are in lines. It is redundant throughout the film. These assembly lines represent the consumerism because these are what were needed in order to speed up production rate in the factories.|$|R

50|$|A {{wood waste}} burner, {{known as a}} teepee burner or wigwam burner in the United States and a beehive burner in Canada, is a {{free-standing}} conical steel structure ranging from 30 to 60 feet in height. They are named for their resemblance to beehives, teepees or wigwams. A sawdust burner is cylindrical. They have an opening at the top that {{is covered with a}} steel grill or mesh to keep sparks and glowing embers from escaping. Sawdust and wood scraps are delivered to an opening {{near the top of the}} cone by means of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> Archimedes' screw, whereupon they fall onto the fire near the center of the structure.|$|R

50|$|Back <b>belts,</b> <b>or</b> {{lumbar support}} <b>belts,</b> are {{generally}} lightweight belts worn around {{the lower back}} to provide support to the lumbar. Industrial back belts tend {{to be similar to}} weight lifting <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> special <b>belts</b> used in medical rehabilitation therapy. Back belts are popular among workers across a number of industries—airline baggage handlers, warehouse workers, grocery clerks, etc.—specifically to prevent lifting injuries.|$|R
30|$|In many mining {{operations}} material quality control measurements are taken at central {{locations in the}} downstream process, such as, on a central <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> from the trains that are loaded after the coal blending yard. In this case the measurements represent a blend {{or a combination of}} material originating from multiple extraction faces. The measurement of one sample cannot be tracked back to one origin of the material. However, a collection of multiple measurements over time would allow to solve this unambiguity. In this contribution the updating framework is applied while multiple excavators are producing at different benches. This is done {{in order to understand the}} updating performance when feeding the blended coal observations back to multiple excavator locations from where the production originates.|$|R
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> <b>or</b> in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|R
50|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> furnace is {{a furnace}} uses a <b>conveyor</b> <b>or</b> <b>belt</b> to carry process parts or {{material}} through the primary heating chamber for rapid thermal processing. It {{is designed for}} fast drying and curing of products and is nowadays widely used in the firing process of thick film and metallization process of solar cell manufacturing. Other names for <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> furnace include metallization furnace, belt furnace, atmosphere furnace, infrared furnace and fast fire furnace, to just list a few.|$|R

50|$|A webbed <b>belt,</b> {{military}} <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> skater <b>belt</b> {{is a type}} of belt {{distinguished by}} its belt buckle design and lack of holes in the cord, which is usually found in other belts where a pin is used as the fastening mechanism in the belt buckle.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{surfaces}} are smoothed, the bowls and tanks are sprayed with glaze {{of various kinds}} to get different colors. This glaze is designed to shrink and contract {{at the same rate}} as the greenware while undergoing firing. After being sprayed with glaze, the toilet bowls, tanks, and lids are placed in stacks on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> [...] "car" [...] that slowly goes through a large kiln to be fired. The belt slowly moves the glaze-covered greenware into a tunnel kiln, which has different temperature zones inside it starting at about [...] at the front, increasing towards the middle to over [...] degrees and exiting around out [...] During the firing in the kiln, the greenware and glaze are vitrified as one solid finished unit. Transiting the kiln takes glaze-covered greenware around 23–40 hours.|$|R
2500|$|Shorter trains may use railcars with an [...] "air-dump", which {{relies on}} air {{pressure}} from the engine plus a [...] "hot shoe" [...] on each car. This [...] "hot shoe" [...] when it comes into contact with a [...] "hot rail" [...] at the unloading trestle, shoots an electric charge through the air dump apparatus and causes the doors {{on the bottom of}} the car to open, dumping the coal through the opening in the trestle. Unloading one of these trains takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half. Older unloaders may still use manually operated bottom-dump rail cars and a [...] "shaker" [...] attached to dump the coal. Generating stations adjacent to a mine may receive coal by <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> massive diesel-electric-drive trucks.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} method to detect and {{estimate}} the three-dimensional pose of planar and textureless objects placed randomly on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> inside a bin. The method is based on analysis of single 2 D images acquired by a standard camera. The algorithm exploits a template matching method to recognize the objects. A set of pose hypotheses are then refined and, based on a gradient orientation scoring, the best object to be manipulated is selected. The method is flexible {{and can be used}} with different objects without changing parameters since it exploits a CAD model as input for template generation. We validated the method using synthetic images. An experimental setup has been also designed using a fixed standard camera to localize planar metal objects in various scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Students will {{discover}} from this text that oceans are major climate-controllers {{because of their}} large heat capacity. As a result, over a long period, oceans can store and transport heat from one location to another. Of particular interest is the ocean's <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Belt</b> <b>or</b> thermohaline circulation, since both temperature and salinity are {{at the root of}} its existence. A major player in the thermohaline circulation is a process known as deep convection (DC), that mixes warm and cold waters, affects sea ice melting and how much solar radiation is absorbed. DC is being modeled by computers to help answer the overwhelming question: how significant are greenhouse gases against the backdrop of larger climate changes, and how self-correcting is the Earth system to these changes.
