40|$|The rat {{cerebellar}} cortex represents an interesting animal {{model for the}} analysis of age-dependent changes in brain microanatomy and function. Moreover, the {{cerebellar cortex}} contains detectable amounts of nerve growth factor (NGF) and express NGF receptors, which are sensitive to aging. Previous studies of our group have shown that treatment with <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> (alpha-glyceryl-phosphorylcholine) countered the loss of nerve cells and fibers occurring with age in the cerebellar cortex. The present study was designed to assess whether treatment for 6 months with a daily dose of 100 mg/kg of <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> has any effect on the expression of NGF receptor immunoreactivity in male Wistar rats of 24 months of age. Twelve-month-old rats were used as an adult reference group. NGF receptor immunoreactivity which was developed in the 3 layers of the cerebellar cortex in adult rats was decreased in the neuropil of the molecular layer and in the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons of rats of 24 months. The number of NGF receptor immunoreactive Purkinje neurons was also lower in the oldest age group, whereas the NGF receptor immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of granule neurons was unchanged. Treatment with <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> increased NGF receptor immunoreactivity in the molecular layer and in the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons as well as the number of immunoreactive Purkinje neurons but was without effect on NGF receptor immunoreactivity in the granule neurons. These results suggest that <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> treatment may increase the expression of NGF receptors in the rat cerebellar cortex...|$|E
40|$|Amblyopia is a {{frequent}} disorder in pediatric ophthalmology. The term of amblyopia refers to reduced vision caused by limited visual sensory stimulation (visual deprivation) {{at a time of}} visual system development, so the vision can not be improved by proper sunglasses. Apparatus treatment of amblyopia have limited effect in rehabilitation of children with moderate (lens corrected visual acuity between 0. 2 and 0. 3) and severe (lens corrected visual acuity below 0. 2) amblyopia. Novel data concerning the use therapeutic agents affecting neural impulse transmission in patients with amblyopia have emerged over the recent years. The union of centers for vision care in children and adolescents «serene vision» has investigated the influence of agents containing <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> on vision of children with refraction amblyopia. We have observed that complex therapy including <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> agents has significantly improved the lens corrected visual acuity and visually induced potentials and has provided better results lasting through all the period of follow up (1 year).

40|$|Mossy fibres {{represent}} a major intrahippocampal associative pathway. They consist of axons of granule {{cells of the}} dentate gyrus and show an age-dependent loss as do the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. The present {{study was designed to}} assess whether long-term treatment of rats with <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> in their drinking water would be effective in countering the loss of mossy fibres and of granule cells occurring with aging. <b>Choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> is a precursor in the biosynthesis of brain phospholipids and increases the bioavailability of choline in nervous tissue. Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 18 months of age were divided into two groups. One group received a daily dose of 100 mg/kg <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> for 6 months; the other group was used as an untreated control. Twelve-month-old untreated animals were used as a reference group. The area occupied by mossy fibres, as well as their density, was significantly reduced in 24 -month-old control rats in comparison with 12 -month-old rats. The same is true for the density granule cells of the dentate gyrus which was decreased by about 20 % in the oldest animals. In choline alfoscerate-treated rats both the area occupied by mossy fibres and their density were significantly higher than in age-matched controls. Moreover, the number of granule neurons of the hippocampus was higher by about 7 % in choline alfoscerate-treated than in control 24 -month-old rats. The above data suggest that <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> treatment counteracts some anatomical changes of the rat hippocampus occurring in old age...|$|E
40|$|The age-related {{anatomical}} {{changes in}} the rat hippocampus were evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats of 3 (young), 12 (mature) and 24 (aged) months by {{counting the number of}} nerve cells in the CA 1 and CA 3 fields and in the dentate gyrus and by measuring the density of Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal and granule neurons of the above areas. Moreover, the effect of 3 months <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> treatment on the anatomical parameters examined was evaluated. The number of pyramidal neurons of the CA 1 field and of granule neurons of the dentate gyrus was not significantly changed between young and mature animals, but it was decreased in aged rats. The number of pyramidal neurons of the CA 3 field showed a progressive age-dependent reduction. The density of Nissl bodies was the highest in the cytoplasm of pyramidal or granule neurons in mature rats followed in descending order by young and aged animals. <b>Choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> treatment counteracted the age-related loss of nerve cells in the 3 hippocampal portions examined and slow-drown the decrease of Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm of pyramidal or of granule neurons in the hippocampus.

40|$|The {{influence}} of ageing and of 3 months <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> treatment on age-related microstructural changes in cerebellar cortex was studied in 3 -, 12 - and 24 -month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The number of Purkinje and granule neurons, {{the density of}} Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm of Purkinje and granule neurons and the density of silver-gold impregnated fibres within molecular and granule cells layers were assessed by neurohistological and neurohistochemical techniques associated with microdensitometry and quantitative image analysis. The number of Purkinje and granule neurons was approximately the same in rats of 3 and 12 months and significantly decreased in 24 -month-old animals. The density of Nissl bodies and of fine processes of silver-gold impregnated fibres were greatest in the cerebellar cortex of rats of 12 months of age, followed in descending order by 3 - and 24 -month-old rats. Both the density of Nissl bodies and of silver-gold impregnated fibres were significantly lower in the cerebellar cortex of the oldest age group considered {{in comparison with the}} young and middle age groups. Treatment with <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate,</b> a precursor in the biosynthesis of brain phospholipids which increases bioavailability of choline in the nervous tissue, noticeably reduced the loss of Purkinje and granule neurons in rats of 24 months. Moreover, it restored the density of Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm of Purkinje and granule neurons as well as the density of silver-gold stained fibres in the molecular and in the granule cells layers to values not significantly different from those found in rats of 3 months. These findings suggest that <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> treatment may be effective in counteracting the age-dependent disarrangement of rat cerebellar cortex.

40|$|The {{present study}} assesses {{the effect of}} {{unilateral}} lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) and of treatment with L-alpha-glyceryl phosphorylcholine (GFC, <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate)</b> on the acetylcholine-synthesizing (choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)), and acetylcholine-degradating (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) enzymes in the rat fronto-parietal cortex ipsilateral to the lesion. Ibotenic acid injections in the right NBM area caused a significant decrease of both ChAT and AChE activities {{as well as of}} histochemically reactive stores of AChE in the right fronto-parietal cortex. Treatment with GFC restored in part the loss of ChAT and AChE activities. Moreover, AChE reactivity is restored in the fronto-parietal cortex of NBM-lesioned rats treated with GFC. GFC is a precursor in the biosynthesis of brain phospholipids which increases the bioavailability of acetylcholine in the nervous tissue.

40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that monolateral lesions of the Nucleus Basalis Magnocellularis (NBM), {{which is a}} nucleus sending cholinergic projections to the fronto-parietal cortex, cause a loss in the intensity of Timm staining in the intrahippocampal pathway of mossy fibres (MF). Moreover, these lesions induce ultrastructural changes consistent with the occurrence of degeneration of presynaptic buttons of MF. The present {{study was designed to}} quantify the effects of NBM lesioning on the morphology of the presynaptic buttons of MF. Moreover the effects of 4 -week <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> (alphaGFC) treatment on the density of Timm staining and on the ultrastructure of presynaptic buttons of MF were assessed, alphaGFC, which was given at an oral daily dose of 100 mg/kg, is a precursor in the biosynthesis of several brain phospholipids which increases the availability of choline in the nervous tissue. Monolateral lesions of NBM cause, 4 weeks after lesioning, a significant decrease in the intensity of Timm staining in the MF area accompanied by a loss of about 23 % of presynaptic buttons of MF. Moreover about 40 % of presynaptic buttons of MF show an impaired morphology. alphaGFC administration restored the intensity of Timm staining in the MF area. In alphaGFC-treated rats, the loss of presynaptic buttons and the number of impaired buttons were reduced to about 12 % and 27 %, respectively in comparison with non-treated animals. These results confirm and extend our previous observations indicative of the occurrence of transneuronal degenerations in the MF of the hippocampus after monolateral NBM lesioning. Moreover these findings show that alphaGFC treatment is able to counter in part these degenerative changes...|$|E
40|$|Aim of the study. The {{key point}} of this {{research}} is studying the impact of different methods of medical treatment for patients with dysphonic syndrome after thyroid surgery due to intraoperative injury of the upper laryngeal nerve and complex injury of superior laryngeal nerve as well as the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Materials and methods. The research of various methods of medical treatment was performed on 47 patients after thyroid surgery with dysphonic manifestations. The patients were euthyroid; they were examined at all stages of the treatment by ENT specialist using video laryngoscope. The indices of acoustic voice analysis and evaluation of the voice handicap index, VHI‑ 30, were determined. The proposed method involves the application of a combination of two pharmacological agents: lysine and <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate.</b> At an early postoperative period in case of identifying dysphonic disorders the appropriate medical therapy was prescribed to patients. Identification of the indices of acoustic voice analysis, evaluation of the voice handicap index and fiber laryngoscopy aspect were carried out in groups of patients on the seventh and fourteenth day after the treatment order. Results. All the patients were divided into four groups. Conventional therapy was applied for the patients with diagnosed dysphonic syndrome in the first and the third groups. Patients in the second and the fourth groups received a combined therapy with lysine and cholini alfosceras. The study revealed that in the 2 nd and the 4 th groups of patients there was a significant change of indices with the trend to almost normal values in comparison with the 1 st and the 3 rd groups due to increased F 0 and ΔF 0. It is of great importance that the quality of life has improved, as evidenced by the decrease of VHI‑ 30. Conclusions. Using a combination of lysine and cholini alfosceras in postoperative dysphonia treatment indicates the effectiveness of this technique as compared to conventional drug therapy due to the improvement of mental and emotional states and functionality of the laryngeal voice apparatus. It can be used in complex treatment of paralyses and larynx paresis...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of dementia {{is growing in}} developed countries where elderly patients are increasing in numbers. Neurotransmission modulation is one approach {{to the treatment of}} dementia. Cholinergic precursors, anticholinesterases, nicotine receptor agonists and muscarinic M- 2 receptor antagonists are agents that enhance cholinergic neurotransmission and that depend on having some intact cholinergic innervation to be effective in the treatment of dementia. The cholinergic precursor <b>choline</b> <b>alfoscerate</b> may be emerging as a potential useful drug in the treatment of dementia, with few adverse effects. Of the anticholinesterases, donepezil, in addition to having a similar efficacy to tacrine in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD), appears to have major advantages; its use is associated with lower drop-out rates in clinical trials, a lower incidence of cholinergic-like side effects and no liver toxicity. Rivastigmine is efficacious in the treatment in dementia with Lewy bodies, a condition in which the other anticholinesterases have not been tested extensively to date. Galantamine is an anticholinesterase and also acts as an allosteric potentiating modulator at nicotinic receptors to increase the release of acetylcholine. Pooled data from clinical trials of patients with mild-to-moderate AD suggest that the benefits and safety profile of galantamine {{are similar to those of}} the anticholinesterases. Selective nicotine receptor agonists are being developed that enhance cognitive performance without influencing autonomic and skeletal muscle function, but these have not yet entered clinical trial for dementia. Unlike the cholinergic enhancers, the M, receptor agonists do not depend upon intact cholinergic nerves but on intact M, receptors for their action, which are mainly preserved in AD and dementia with Lewy bodies. The M, receptor-selective agonists developed to date have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials and have a high incidence of side effects. A major recent advancement in the treatment of dementia is memantine, a non-competitive antagonist at NMDA receptors. Memantine is beneficial in the treatment of severe and moderate to-severe AD and may also be of some benefit in the treatment of mild-to-moderate vascular dementia. Drugs that modulate 5 -HT, somatostatin and noradrenergic neurotransmission are also being considered for the treatment of dementia...|$|E
