40|$|Upper body {{strength}} and flexibility are <b>common</b> <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> in elite flat water kayaking yet {{the relationship between}} joint range of motion, muscular strength, and race time is unclear. The aim {{of this research was}} to firstly quantify the flexibility and strength of sub-elite kayakers and then determine the relationship of this data to performance race times. Twenty-nine national standard kayak paddlers were assessed for shoulder and pelvic flexibility, upper body strength, and performance time. The shoulder internal and external rotation range of movement for kayak paddlers was reduced in comparison to other populations. For the female paddlers significant (p 0. 70) were found between shoulder flexion range of movement, shoulder strength, and strength endurance. Strength scores for kayak paddlers are reported for the first time showing the Pull:Push strength ratio for male kayak paddlers was 129 %, and for females 147 %. The strength ratio was significantly different (p < 0. 01) across gender and also different to published ratios from other sports. Several other measures were also significantly different across gender. All paddlers showed significant and strong correlations between the three 8 RM shoulder strength exercises, highlighting the importance of maintaining balance of strength for the muscles acting on the shoulder. Therewas only one measure, the strength endurance Bench-Pull-Max-Power for females that significantly and strongly correlated to the on-water performances; identifying the poor relationship between current dry land training activities and race performance. No single strength or ROM measure correlated strongly with on-water performances for either sex, as a sport kayaking appears to reduce the ROM about the shoulder joint...|$|E

This result highlight highlights the need to develop <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> simulating competition requirements.

40|$|This study {{examined}} and evaluated protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> {{for responding to}} the disruptive behavior of students with psychological problems at institutions in the Massachusetts State College System during the 1997 – 1998 and 1998 – 1999 academic years. ^ A review {{and analysis of the}} literature and case law provided a basis for evaluating response protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities.</b> Interviews with policy makers provided a framework for studying the processes used to develop, implement, and evaluate response protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities.</b> Research questions focused on the number and types of incidents related to the disruptive behavior of students with psychological problems, the types and effectiveness of protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities,</b> and whether or not the elements of federal law, state statutes, and relevant case law were incorporated in protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities.</b> ^ This study revealed that the Massachusetts State College System utilized protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> to respond to the disruptive behavior of students with psychological problems. The types and breadth of protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> varied by campus and included emergency medical care, hospitalizations, students 2 ̆ 7 return to the residence halls, mandated evaluations, withdrawals, {{and the use of the}} student discipline system. ^ This study further revealed that the state colleges reported that the elements of federal and state laws, as well as court opinions, were included in response protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities.</b> ^ This study found that <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> were offered in varying degrees at the state colleges that participated in the study. Significant training was offered to student resident assistants, but faculty and staff did not participate in training programs to the same extent as students. ^ This study found that communication among individuals involved in developing, approving, implementing, and evaluating protocols was key to successful interventions. ^ From the study, the researcher recommended three topics for further study. They included a study of best practice collaborations between hospitals and colleges, a study of the emerging pattern of high school violence and school responses and <b>training</b> <b>activities,</b> and a study of legal issues surrounding the disruptive behavior of students with psychological problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies consider either <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> of the unemployed or <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> {{of the employees}} in Germany. However, a comprehensive comparison of both groups is missing. The paper closes this gap. Using data of the latest time use survey (Zeitbudgeterhebung) of the Federal Statistical Office, the amount of training is compared for both groups. Furthermore, it is described which types of activities are made use of in particular. Heterogeneity due to different relevant socioeconomic characteristics {{in the two groups}} is eliminated by the appliance of a matching procedure. Findings demonstrate that only 49 % of the unemployed persons participate in any kind of <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> off the job. In case of the full-time employment 59 % would take part. Concerning the average expenditure of time per week the difference turns around, i. e. the expenditure of time is higher during unemployment. However, a high proportion of the <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> of the unemployed falls upon general training, e. g. by reading books or watching TV. Furthermore, the result is driven by a different potential of time {{that can be used for}} <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> off the job. Relating to this potential of time the amount of <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> is still lower during unemployment. training, unemployment, matching...|$|R
