40|$|The {{recent report}} by the artist Sophie Hemon about the total loss of her {{archives}} of images sends one directly into the issue of memory and reconstruction. Starting from such a circumstantial introduction observations shall be made on the notion of editing, based on the analyses of contemporary artistic practices. Starting with Edward Ruscha, passing by Bernd and Hilla Becher, by Boltanski, Ritcher and Lara Amarcegui, a reflection will be carried out on the <b>constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>files</b> in contemporary art, and about the potency of discursive articulation of certain images and their commercialization be itby means of an exposition, be it in a publication. How such practices of resingularization of the world are given back to the world as works, and what other issues do they bring to the field of art and culture?O relato recente da artista Sophie Hemon sobre a perda total de seus arquivos de imagens nos lança diretamente na problemática relacionada à memória e à sua reconstrução.

Como estas práticas de re-singularização do mundo são devolvidas enquanto obra ao mundo e que outras questões trazem ao campo da arte e da cultura...|$|E

The Indian Supreme Court opined that the Italian ambassador had waived his diplomatic immunity and could be charged for contempt.
