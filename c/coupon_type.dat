40|$|Businesses (retailers) often wish {{to offer}} {{personalized}} advertisements (coupons) to individuals (consumers), but {{run the risk}} of strong reactions from consumers who want a customized shopping experience but feel their privacy has been violated. Existing models for privacy such as differential privacy or information theory try to quantify privacy risk but do not capture the subjective experience and heterogeneous expression of privacy-sensitivity. We propose a Markov decision process (MDP) model to capture (i) different consumer privacy sensitivities via a time-varying state; (ii) different <b>coupon</b> <b>types</b> (action set) for the retailer; and (iii) the action-and-state-dependent cost for perceived privacy violations. For the simple case with two states ("Normal" and "Alerted"), two coupons (targeted and untargeted) model, and consumer behavior statistics known to the retailer, we show that a stationary threshold-based policy is the optimal coupon-offering strategy for a retailer that wishes to minimize its expected discounted cost. The threshold is a function of all model parameters; the retailer offers a targeted coupon if their belief that the consumer is in the "Alerted" state is below the threshold. We extend this two-state model to consumers with multiple privacy-sensitivity states as well as coupon-dependent state transition probabilities. Furthermore, we study the case with imperfect (noisy) cost feedback from consumers and uncertain initial belief state.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{reliably}} and reproducibly sample surfaces contaminated with a biological agent {{is a critical}} step in measuring the extent of contamination and determining if decontamination steps have been successful. The recovery operations following the 2001 attacks with Bacillus anthracis spores were {{complicated by the fact}} that no standard sample collection format or decontamination procedures were established. Recovery efficiencies traditionally have been calculated based upon biological agents which were applied to test surfaces in a liquid format and then allowed to dry prior to sampling tests, which may not be best suited for a real-world event with aerosolized biological agents. In order to ascertain if differences existed between air-dried liquid deposition and biological spores which were allowed to settle on a surface in a dried format, a study was undertaken to determine if differences existed in surface sampling recovery efficiencies for four representative surfaces. Studies were then undertaken to compare sampling efficiencies between liquid spore deposition and aerosolized spores which were allowed to gradually settle under gravity on four different test <b>coupon</b> <b>types.</b> Tests with both types of deposition compared efficiencies of four unique swabbing materials applied to four surfaces with various surface properties.

40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the study}} of {{peer-to-peer}} file swarming systems à la BitTorrent, we introduce a probabilistic model of coupon replication systems. These systems consist of users, aiming to complete a collection of distinct coupons. Users are characterised by their current collection of coupons, and leave the system once they complete their coupon collection. The system evolution is then specified by describing how users of distinct types meet, and which coupons get replicated upon such encounters. For open systems, with exogenous user arrivals, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions in a layered scenario, where encounters are between users holding {{the same number of}} coupons. We also consider a system where encounters are between users chosen uniformly at random from the whole population. We show that performance, captured by sojourn time, is asymptotically optimal in both systems as the number of <b>coupon</b> <b>types</b> becomes large. We also consider closed systems with no exogenous user arrivals. In a special scenario where users have only one missing coupon, we evaluate the size of the population ultimately remaining in the system, as the initial number of users, N, goes to infinity. We show that this decreases geometrically with the number of coupons, K. In particular, when the ratio K / log(N) is above a critical threshold, we prove that this number of leftovers is of order log(log(N)). These results suggest that performance of file swarming systems does not depend critically on either altruistic user behavior, or on load balancing strategies such as rarest first. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{domestic}} bond markets of the Asia and Pacific region have grown considerably since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, although they remain undeveloped {{relative to the}} region's weight in the world economy. This paper proposes {{that in order to}} encourage further development of these markets, regulators should make them more accessible to foreign borrowers. To that end we offer insights into the nature and mechanics of foreign bond issuance by investigating the key characteristics of 3, 132 foreign bonds issued in 14 countries (other than the United States) between July 1928 and June 2009. We found that the foreign borrowers that tap domestic markets are overwhelmingly of high credit quality and comprise sovereigns, supranationals, and major financial institutions. There is a preference for simple fixed-rate payment structures, which can then be swapped into the currency and <b>coupon</b> <b>type</b> of choice using currency and interest rate derivatives. On the whole, the long-term viability of foreign bond markets appears linked to the presence of highly liquid foreign exchange and derivatives markets that facilitate risk management and transformation, enabling regulation that facilitates cooperation with market participants, the presence of benchmark issues, and competitive pricing between alternate market segments. bond markets; financial market development; foreign bonds...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of coupon promotions {{is an important}} issue since it {{is still one of the}} major promotion media. Although new distribution channels arise, the allocation of coupons does not go without problems. Companies are investing thoroughly in an attempt to convince as many customers as possible to buy their products. This results in a competitive battle between retailers and manufacturers since both target the same customer base. In this paper the methodology used by retailers and manufacturers to determine their target selection for promotional actions is improved by building separate predictive models for the same customer base. One model makes predictions concerning the redemption behavior of promotions that are distributed by the retailer while another model does the same for promotions issued by manufacturers. A logistic regression is used to predict coupon redemption behavior. The performance of the models will be quantified by the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The experiments are carried out on a real-life data set obtained from a world-wide FMCG retailer. The contributions of this study are as follows. First, we are able to make predictions concerning customers' coupon redemption. Secondly, the use of separate models for retailers' and manufacturers' coupon redemption makes it possible to split the entire customer base in four different segments. This enables a reduction of the conflict, which is likely to lead to higher profits for both parties. Finally, both models prove to have a different set of significant explanatory variables but capture more or less the same information related to the specific <b>coupon</b> <b>type...</b>|$|E

Future acceptance of the methodology by industry and certification authorities, however, requires the successful demonstration of the methodology on the structural level. For this purpose, a panel was selected that is reinforced with stiffeners. Shear loading causes the panel to buckle, and the resulting out-of-plane deformations initiate skin/stiffener separation {{at the location of}} an embedded defect. A small section of the stiffener foot, web and noodle as well as the panel skin {{in the vicinity of the}} delamination front were modeled with a local 3 D solid model. Across the width of the stiffener foot, the mixedmode strain energy release rates were calculated using the virtual crack closure technique. A failure index was calculated by correlating the results with a mixed-mode failure criterion of the graphite/epoxy material. Computed failure indices were compared to corresponding results where the entire web was modeled with shell elements and only a small section of the stiffener foot and panel were modeled locally with solid elements. Including the stiffener web in the local 3 D solid model increased the computed failure index. Further including the noodle and transition radius in the local 3 D solid model changed the local distribution across the width. The magnitude of the failure index decreased with increasing transition radius and noodle area. For the transition radii modeled, the material properties used for the noodle area had a negligible effect on the results.

40|$|The strains {{at which}} {{buckling}} and debond growth occur in adhesively bonded composite flanges containing an initial debond were experimentally measured using sandwich panel and <b>coupon</b> <b>type</b> specimens. Test parameters investigated were: initial debond geometry, the adhesive critical strain energy release rate (Gc), flange material stiffness, and layup sequence. ^ Buckling strains {{were found to}} be dependent on initial debond length, flange stiffness and layup sequence. Flanges with a longer initial debond length showed lower buckling strains. Buckling strains increased as the twisting to bending stiffness ratio (D 66 /D 11) increased due to changes in flange layup sequence. Debond growth was found to be strongly dependent on initial debond length but, weakly dependent on flange width. Flanges having higher bending stiffness exhibited a significantly lower debonding strain. Ultrasonic C-scans revealed that debond growth occurred along a curved front, as dictated by the post-buckling deformation of the flanges. Finally, changes in twisting to bending stiffness ratio (D 66 /D 11) due to different flange layup sequences resulted in a variation of post-buckled flange out-of-plane (u 3) deformation shape. This was found to affect the debond front shapes as the debond grew. ^ Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) fracture analysis was conducted. Critical strain energy release rates measured from Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and Mixed-Mode Fracture (MMF) tests were used as input values and the FEA predictions were shown to be capable of accurately simulating the buckling and debonding behaviors. The FEA study included all the testing parameters investigated in the experiments and also revealed the mode-I, II and III strain energy release rate profiles at the debond front. From the strain energy release rate profiles, fracture mode content and the major fracture mode in each specimen type were clearly understood. ^ The FEA methodology developed within the current study {{has been shown to be}} capable of predicting the buckling and debonding tests very well.

40|$|BackgroundTobacco {{marketing}} {{contributes to}} increased tobacco use susceptibility and sustained use. There are limited data on youth exposure to tobacco <b>coupons,</b> a <b>type</b> of pro-tobacco promotion. PurposeTo explore channels through which youth report exposure to coupons and characteristics {{associated with this}} exposure. This may help inform efforts aimed at decreasing youth exposure to advertising and promotion. MethodsData from the 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey were analyzed in 2013 to estimate the self-reported prevalence of U. S. {{middle and high school}} student exposure to coupons through various channels. Associations among exposure to coupons and demographics, tobacco use, living with a tobacco user, and receptivity to tobacco marketing were examined using multivariate logistic regression models. ResultsApproximately 13 % of students reported exposure to tobacco coupons in the past 30 days through mail, digital communications, or tobacco packages. Prevalence was greatest among current tobacco users (34. 0 %) and those receptive to tobacco marketing (23. 4 %) compared to non-tobacco users (9. 3 %) and those not receptive to tobacco marketing (8. 2 %), respectively. Coupon exposure varied by sex, grade, and race/ethnicity. In adjusted models, current tobacco use (AOR= 3. 4, 95 % CI= 3. 0, 3. 9); living with a tobacco user (AOR= 2. 1, 95 % CI= 1. 9, 2. 4); and receptivity to tobacco marketing (AOR= 2. 3, 95 % CI= 2. 0, 2. 7) were independently associated with coupon exposure. ConclusionsFindings from this study indicate that despite restrictions on marketing to youth, youth are still being exposed to tobacco promotions such as coupons.

A significant reduction in the log 10 CFU of each organism on all test materials was observed between the controls evaluated after a 1 -hour drying time and unexposed controls evaluated after decontamination. For all organisms, qualitative growth assessments showed that vaporous hydrogen peroxide exposure completely inactivated bacterial viability on all replicates of the test materials incubated up to 7 days post-exposure. In parallel, all Geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicators (BI) exposed to vaporous hydrogen peroxide exhibited no growth after 1 and 7 days incubation. This study provides information on {{using a combination of}} quantitative and qualitative growth assessments to evaluate vaporous hydrogen peroxide for the surface decontamination of B. suis, B. pseudomallei, F. tularensis, and Y. pestis within a large-scale chamber...|$|R
5000|$|SnipSnap is {{a mobile}} coupon {{application}} that {{allows users to}} take {{a photograph of a}} printed coupon in order to find or create a mobile coupon, which can later be redeemed at the register. The app scans the images, logos, and barcodes of the original coupon in order to recreate a mobile coupon, similar to what consumers would find printed in a store advertisement. This app is currently available for Android and iOS devices (iPhone and iPod Touch only). SnipSnap also allows users to report if a coupon was accepted in store or not, which creates a success score rating for each stored coupon on the app. The vast majority of the coupons are shared by SnipSnap users. However, not every coupon can be redeemed successfully due to differing store coupon policies and/or the inability of a store’s point of sale hardware to scan the mobile barcode. SnipSnap does not currently work with manufacturer coupons, but the company {{is in the process of}} accepting those <b>types</b> <b>coupons</b> inside the app. SnipSnap surpassed 1 million users in June 2013 and saw over 20 million coupons snipped in its first year.|$|R
40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Applied Probability Trust, The University, School Mathematics Statistics {{and can be found}} at: [URL] "coupon collection problem" refers to a class of occupancy problems, in which j identical items are distributed, independently and at random, to n cells, with no restrictions on multiple occupancy. Identifying the cells as coupons, a coupon is "collected" if the cell is occupied by {{one or more of the}} distributed items; thus some coupons may never be collected, whereas others may be collected once or twice or more. We call the number of coupons collected exactly r times <b>coupons</b> of <b>type</b> r. The <b>coupon</b> collection model we consider is general, in which a random number of purchases occurs at each stage of collecting a large number of coupons; the sample sizes at each stage are independent and identically distributed according to a sampling distribution. The joint behavior of the various types is an intricate problem. In fact, there is a variety of joint central limit theorems (and other limit laws) that arise according to the interrelation between the mean, variance, and range of the sampling distribution, and of course the phase (how far we are in the collection processes). According to an appropriate combination of the mean of the sampling distribution and the number of available coupons, the phase is sublinear, linear or superlinear. In the sublinear phase, the normalization that produces a Gaussian limit law for uncollected coupons can be used to obtain a multivariate central limit law for at most two other types - depending on the rates of growth of the mean and variance of the sampling distribution, we may have a joint central limit theorem between types 0 and 1, or between types 0, 1, and 2. In the linear phase we have a multivariate central limit theorem among the types 0, 1, [...] ., k, for any fixed k...|$|R
