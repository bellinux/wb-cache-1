50|$|In Western Christianity, <b>chalices</b> {{will often}} have a pommel or node where the stem meets the cup to make the {{elevation}} easier.

5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden <b>Chalice</b> of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a <b>Chalice</b> in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E
