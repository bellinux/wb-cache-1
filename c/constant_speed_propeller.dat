25|$|In the Mk I PR Type B (also {{known as}} Medium Range (MR)) {{conversions}} which followed, the F24 camera lenses were upgraded to an eight-inch (203mm) focal length, giving images up {{to a third}} larger in scale. An extra 29 gal (132 l) fuel tank was installed in the rear fuselage. It had been envisaged that much larger cameras would be installed in the fuselage immediately behind the pilot, {{but at the time}} RAF engineers believed this would upset the Spitfire's centre of gravity. Cotton was able to demonstrate that by removing lead weights, which had been installed in the extreme rear fuselage to balance the weight of the <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propeller</b> units, it was possible to install cameras with longer focal-length lens in the fuselage. The Type B was the first to dispense with the heavy bullet resistant windscreen. Many of these early PR Spitfires were fitted with the Merlin XII engine and Rotol constant-speed propeller with the early, blunt spinner of the Spitfire Mk II.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was built from aluminium and incorporated exceptional fuel capacity for an amateur-built of its era, including two [...] wingtip tanks and a [...] main tank, {{with a total}} of [...] of fuel carried, giving a range of [...] To make use of the long endurance an autopilot was fitted, for comfort the cockpit was [...] in width. Its [...] span rectangular wing with an aspect ratio of 6:1, employed an NACA 65A316 airfoil, mounted double-slotted flaps and adjustable-incidence ailerons. The engine was a Continental IO-360-A producing , driving a Hartzell <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propeller</b> of [...] diameter. Control was via center control sticks.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was similar to}} other contemporary airliners, but the construction was mixed. Welded steel {{was used for the}} fuselage structure, with light alloy covering fitted to the nose, underside and rear fuselage, and fabric covering for the fuselage sides and roof. The three-spar wing was also of wooden construction, with plywood skinning. The engines drove three-bladed metal <b>Constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|By July 1940, more {{efficient}} de Havilland and Rotol <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers</b> had begun replacing two-pitch propellers on front line RAF fighters. The new units allowed the Merlin to perform more smoothly at all altitudes {{and reduced the}} takeoff and landing runs. The majority of the front line RAF fighters were equipped with these propellers by mid-August. The Bf 109E also used a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM) three-blade unit with automatic pitch control.|$|R
50|$|In {{civilian}} service, {{individual aircraft}} would often be modified. Examples of these adaptations include extensive modification programmes {{in order to}} perform competitive aerobatics, for which aircraft are often re-engined and fitted with <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers</b> and inverted fuel systems; larger numbers of Chipmunks have been tasked as dedicated glider tows. It has become commonplace for Chipmunks to be re-engined, typically using the 180 hp Lycoming O-360.|$|R
2500|$|The Husky {{features}} a braced high wing, tandem seating and dual controls. The structure is steel tube frames and Dacron covering {{over all but}} {{the rear of the}} fuselage, plus metal leading edges on the wings. The high wing was selected for good all-around visibility, making the Husky ideal for observation and patrol roles. [...] Power is supplied by a relatively powerful (for the Husky's weight) [...] Textron Lycoming O-360 flat-four piston engine turning a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propeller.</b> In 2015 a reversible MT Propeller was approved under a Supplementary Type Certificate for better control during floatplane water operations. [...] The Husky's high power-to-weight ratio and low wing loading result in good short-field performance.|$|E
2500|$|On August 4, 2003, Wright {{unveiled}} his replica aircraft at the 2003 AirVenture at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. On his {{way home}} to Oregon, he refueled the aircraft in Gillette, Wyoming. Wright met briefly with local reporters {{and said that the}} aircraft had been having propeller [...] "gear problems." [...] An hour after taking off, the aircraft crashed just north of the Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, killing Wright. The replica, originally slated {{to be used in the}} film The Aviator, was completely destroyed. [...] The official accident report detailed a failure of a counterweight on the <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propeller.</b> On December 17, 2003, Cottage Grove State Airport was dedicated as Jim Wright Field.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1940 de Havilland began {{manufacturing}} a kit {{to convert}} their two pitch propeller unit to a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propeller.</b> Although this propeller {{was a great}} deal heavier than the [...] earlier types (500lb (227kg) compared with 350lb (183kg)) it provided another substantial improvement in take-off distance and climb rate. Starting on 24 June de Havilland engineers began fitting all Spitfires with these units and by 16 August every Spitfire and Hurricane had been modified. [...] "Two step" [...] rudder pedals were fitted to all frontline Spitfires; these allowed the pilot to lift his feet and legs higher during combat, improving his [...] "blackout" [...] threshold and allowing him to pull tighter sustained turns. Another modification was the small rear view mirror which was added {{to the top of the}} windscreen: an early [...] "shrouded" [...] style was later replaced by a simplified, rectangular, adjustable type.|$|E
50|$|Power {{was to be}} {{supplied}} by four Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65R turboprop engines driving five-bladed Hartzell <b>Propeller</b> <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> reversible <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army {{awarded a}} {{contract}} to Cessna for 418 of the aircraft, which was designated the L-19A Bird Dog. The prototype Cessna 305 (registration N41694) first flew on 14 December 1949. Deliveries began in December 1950, and the aircraft were soon in use fighting their first war in Korea from 1950 through 1953. An instrument trainer variant was developed in 1953, later versions had <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers,</b> and the final version, the L-19E, had a larger gross weight. Cessna produced 3,431 aircraft; it was also built under license by Fuji in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The Gulfstream I is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a semi-monocoque {{aluminium alloy}} fuselage structure. The aircraft {{is powered by}} two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops with Rotol four-bladed <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers.</b> The Gulfstream I has a retractable tricycle landing gear, with twin wheels on the two main units and the nose gear. The cabin is designed to take up to twenty-four passengers in a high-density arrangement or only eight in an executive layout, although ten to twelve was more usual. The aircraft has a hydraulically operated airstair in the forward cabin for entry and exit.|$|R
2500|$|Different {{propeller}} types were fitted, {{according to}} where the Spitfire V was built: Supermarine and Westland manufactured VBs and VCs used 10ft 9 in (3.28 m) diameter, 3 bladed de Havilland constant speed units, with narrow metal blades, while Castle Bromwich manufactured VBs and VCs were fitted with a wide bladed Rotol <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propeller</b> of either 10ft 9 in (3.28 m) diameter, with metal blades, or (on late production Spitfires) 10ft 3 in (3.12 m) diameter, with broader, [...] "Jablo" [...] (compressed wood) blades. The Rotol spinners were longer and more pointed than the de Havilland leading to a 3.5 in (8.9cm) increase in overall length. The Rotol propellers allowed a modest speed increase over [...] {{and an increase in}} the service ceiling. A large number of Spitfire VBs were fitted with [...] "gun heater intensifier" [...] systems on the exhaust stacks. These piped additional heated air into the gun bays. There was a short tubular intake {{on the front of the}} first stack and a narrow pipe led into the engine cowling from the rear exhaust.|$|E

50|$|However, {{a branch}} of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (United German Metalworks) named VDM-Halbzeugwerke in the town {{produced}} aircraft parts for <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers,</b> landing gear and aircraft engines, others were producing fuzes and tank parts (Senking-Factory), torpedoes (Ahlborn AG) and rubber products such as lifejackets and inflatable dinghies (Wetzell Gummiwerke). In the Hildesheim forest southwest of the city a subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH with the Code name „ELFI“ (Elektro- und Feinmechanische Industrie, Electrical and Precision Engineering Industry; from 1942 to 1952: Trillke-Factory) manufactured starters, generators and other components for lorry/truck and tank engines. There was also a goods station/marshalling (classification) yard in Hildesheim.|$|R
50|$|The main {{offensive}} load {{was up to}} 2000 lb {{of bombs}} (usually 250 or 500 lb), mines (1,000 lb) or other stores that were hung on traversing racks under the wing centre section (to and from the bomb room in the fuselage). Later, depth charges (usually 250 lb) were added. By late 1940, two Vickers K machine guns had been added to new hatches that were inserted into the upper sides of the fuselage just aft of the wing, with appropriate slipstream deflectors. A second gun {{was added to the}} nose turret. New <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers</b> and deicing boots were installed as well during 1940.|$|R

25|$|On 19 July nine convoys were at sea as German {{aircraft}} scouted {{the shipping}} lanes {{in the early}} morning. A Do17 from 4.(F)/121 was shot down by 145 Squadron at 07:04. No 264 Squadron flying Boulton Paul Defiants, had operated with success over Dunkirk eight weeks earlier and its sister unit, 141 Squadron with twelve aircraft, was moved from West Malling to Hawkinge. The unit was inexperienced and while the aircraft were being fitted with <b>Constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>propellers</b> in the early summer, the crews had little time to practice in the air; the gunners were uneasy about escaping their turrets in an emergency. Dowding and Park were dubious about the Defiant but ordered 141 Squadron to escort a convoy that morning.|$|R
50|$|Four aileron, two-seat, factory-built, {{symmetric}} airfoil, 260 hp (194 kW) Lycoming driving <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> three-blade <b>propeller,</b> current production model.

It is in production in 2008 by Aviat Aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 1,013 Taurus powered Mark Is were {{produced}} {{and a number}} of changes were introduced into the line. The original curved perspex bomb aimers' nose panels were replaced by flat, non-distorting panels from the 10th production aircraft. Successive Marks of the Bristol Taurus engine were installed: starting with the Taurus III, the more reliable Taurus IIs were used whenever possible. Initially Beauforts with the Taurus II engines were designated Beaufort Mk.II, while those with other Taurus Marks continued to be Beaufort Mk.Is. Finally all Taurus-engined Beauforts became Mk.Is with the introduction of the Wasp-powered Beaufort Mk.II. The Taurus Mk.IIs were modified to Mk.IIa, which later became the Taurus Mk.VI. All of these versions produced [...] The final marks of Taurus engines used were the more powerful [...] XII and XVIs.
