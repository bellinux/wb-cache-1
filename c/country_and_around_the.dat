2500|$|As a [...] "wheeler-dealer", Mickey bonded {{particularly}} well with another dodgy dealer on the Square, Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Swash has commented, [...] "It's natural for Mickey and Mo {{to be close}} because they're so similar. They're into the same things and doing business." [...] Their interaction was mostly used for comedic purposes. In 2004, the duo were featured in a special plot to highlight the BBC's fundraising event, Sport Relief, which tackles poverty and disadvantage, both in the UK and internationally. On-screen, Mickey competed in the Fitness First Sport Relief Mile, to raise money via sponsoring.

By the mid-1960s, the area, marked by the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets, had become {{a focal point for}} psychedelic rock music. Musicians and bands like Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin all lived a short distance from the famous intersection.

2500|$|Referencing {{contemporary}} Western {{views on}} gender diversity, psychologist Diane Ehrensaft states: [...] "I am witnessing a shake-up {{in the mental}} health community as training sessions, workshops and conferences are proliferating all over this <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, demanding that we reevaluate the binary system of gender, throw out the idea that gender nonconformity is a disorder, and establish new guidelines for facilitating the healthy development of gender-creative children." [...] Child-adolescent psychiatrist Edgardo Menvielle and psychotherapist Catherine Tuerck offer a support group for parents of gender non-conforming children at the Children's National Medical Centre in Washington D.C., aimed [...] "not at changing children's behaviours but at helping parents to be supportive". Other publications are beginning to call for a similar approach, to support parents to help their child become their authentic self. Community organizations established to support these families have begun to develop, such as Gender Spectrum, Trans Youth Family Allies, Gender Creative Kids Canada, and Trans Kids Purple Rainbow, as well as conferences such as Gender Odyssey Family Conference and summer camps such as Camp Aranu'tiq, all with the goal of supporting healthy families with gender non conforming or transgender children. Popular media accounts of parents assisting their children to live in their felt gender role have recently begun to emerge. These stories demonstrate that children and their parents face substantial stigma; however, Menvielle maintains that [...] "the therapist should focus on helping the child and family cope with intolerance and social prejudice, not on the child's behaviours, interests or choice of playmates". A host of new terms being applied to these children (such as gender variant), gender non-conforming, gender-creative and gender-independent) indicates that many are beginning to reject the label of Gender Identity Disorder in Children.|$|E
