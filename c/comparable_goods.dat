40|$|Abstract. Countries {{and regions}} within {{countries}} frequently import and export {{from the same}} standard industrial classification (SIC) groupings. In describing international trade, the Armington assumption recognizes that imported goods may substitute imperfectly for domestically produced goods. Imports and domestically produced goods may differ in quality or composition. Elasticities of import substitution have been extensively estimated for international trade but limited information is available on elasticities of substitution for regional imports. One h y-pothesis in the literature is that international trade elasticities {{should be considered as}} lower bounds for regional trade elasticities presumably because of fewer non-price trade restrictions. This research estimates regional elasticities of import substitution for 20 two-digit groupings using commodity trade date in the U. S. The range in elasticities is from 0. 45 to 2. 80 depending on the characteristics of the SIC grouping. These results tend to refute the hypothesis that international trade elasticities are lower bounds for regional trade elasticities for <b>comparable</b> <b>goods.</b> 1...|$|E

Furthermore, we show that most …rms only export or import a single service type and trade with a small number of countries. Trade volume, employment, turnover and value added are highly concentrated among a small group of …rms trading with many countries and/or in many services types.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the availability and}} affordability of a healthy food basket and to model how those on low-incomes might manage. Design and methodology: After determining access and availability of key items from shops in two localities, called Deepdale and Ingol, a healthy food basket was developed. From this a week’s healthy menu was devised for a mother and two children, then availability of the ingredients was checked using data collected from the shops and costed. The baskets represented the cultural preferences of White British and South Asian families informed by participatory work with both these groups. We chose the income level for a family entitled to income support and child allowance. Results: Analysis {{of the availability of}} some healthy options such as brown bread, wholemeal pasta, and brown rice showed they were not widely available within shops in the two areas. The price of the ‘White British’ basket in the area of Ingol was £ 70. 61 (lowest price). For <b>comparable</b> <b>goods</b> in the area of Deepdale, using the most expensive shopping basket, the price for the same basket was £ 42. 47. A South Asian family shopping at a major supermarket outlet in Deepdale would pay £ 47. 05. Using local shops they could pay between £ 38. 59 and £ 44. 28 by seeking out the best bargains in five shops (including some top-up items from a national supermarket). At the time of the research a mother with two children entitled to income support and child allowance would have to spend 28 – 32 per cent of her income in local shops and 34 per cent in a supermarket to buy a basket of healthy goods. This compared to the national average of 10 – 12 per cent of income being spent on food purchases. Conclusions: Prices varied enormously between the two areas. Local shops in one area offered a comparable price to shopping in the supermarkets. The Ingol area, with a large white working class population, was particularly poorly served for those on low incomes and the range of choices restricted. The percentages spent on food to meet the requirements of our healthy baskets and menus show that more than the national average – in both absolute and relative terms – would have to be spent to eat healthily. For the vulnerable and price dependent poor in Preston this will mean having to spend more on food and possibly more on travel to access basics, a healthy diet will cost more, while proportionally an unhealthy diet, as can be found in fast food outlets, may not be as expensive when other costs such as cooking are taken into account. An overall rise in food prices of 5 per cent will reduce living standards among high-income consumers by approximately 3 per cent; for low-income consumers this reduction in an already poor diet could be as high as 20 per cent. What we have demonstrated is the usefulness of local studies to highlight micro-differences in relatively small areas (Preston city) and the different experiences of groups in accessing healthy foods, and thus the need to refine interventions at a local level...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To map food {{access in}} the city of Preston in the north-west of England in order to {{determine}} access, availability and affordability of healthy food options. Design and methodology: The research design employed a number of distinct methods including: surveys of shops; interviews with local people and shopkeepers; a cost and availability survey of shops in two deprived areas of Preston —Deepdale and Ingol — the former with a majority South Asian population; and the use of geographical information systems to map access and availability. Results: • Preston had more fast food outlets (186) [not including restaurants who operate takeaways] than general groceries outlets (165). • There were more local shops selling affordable food in the area with the high South Asian population than in Ingol with its white working class population. There were clear gaps in provision and access in the white working class area (Ingol), with shops being more than 500 metres away from where people lived. Shops in this area stocked more familiar ‘British foods’ and less specialist or fresh produce. • Analysis of the availability of some healthy options such as brown bread, wholemeal pasta and brown rice showed that they were not widely available within shops in the two areas. • The price of the ‘White British’ basket in Ingol was £ 70. 61 (cheapest price). For <b>comparable</b> <b>goods</b> in Deepdale, using the most expensive shopping basket, the price for the same basket was £ 42. 47. • A South Asian family shopping at a major national supermarket outlet in Deepdale would pay £ 47. 05. Using local shops they could pay between £ 38. 59 and £ 44. 28 by seeking out the best bargains in five shops (including some top-up items from a national supermarket). • At the time of the research a mother with two children, entitled to income support and child allowance, would have to spend 28 — 32 per cent of her income in local shops and 34 per cent in a supermarket to buy a basket of healthy goods. Conclusions: There is a need to engage proactively with the location of shops in urban areas, to ensure they offer a healthy range of options and are sited near to where people live. The number of fast food outlets needs to be controlled and the food they offer improved. This latter issue of the number of outlets and quality of fast food contributes to an overall obesogenic environment. Access to food is heavily dependent on having access to a car; local shopping and the quality of food on offer are important for key groups such as those on benefits, the elderly, single parents and others with limited access to a car. Proactive policy solutions may lie with the engagement of health agencies with the planning processes in local authorities to ensure that the food retail environment reflects a healthy choice. Local area agreements between health agencies and local authorities offer a way forward, in that they can take into account the expressed needs of local residents...|$|E

While traditional approaches focus on finding a single broadcast tree in the network, we aim at maximizing the number of broadcast trees/calls that can be carried. In this paper, we first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for solving the minimum-channel-utilization broadcast tree problem in multi-channel multi-interface WMNs. In our ILP, channel assignment, routing, and scheduling are jointly considered for finding a broadcast tree that can minimize the maximum channel utilization. Intuitively, this balances all the accepted traffic load in the network, which in turn maximizes the chance of accepting future calls. However, solving ILP usually takes time and is less suitable for a system with real-time call arrival. An efficient heuristic algorithm is then designed.

The patient presented achieved full range of movements and regained elbow and forearm strength. Regardless of whether a repair or reconstruction is warranted, you have to decide if to repair either both tendon ruptures at the same time, or {{to do it in a}} staged manner. Several factors must be considered such as the patients’ social and occupational situation, hand dominance, medical comorbidities and general health. In cases with simultaneous repair or reconstruction, the mobility of the arms are reduced based on the postoperative regime, that normally restricts active flexion and supination for a 2 – 6 weeks, according the surgeons preferences. With the staged approach the patient is allowed complete use of the non-operated arm for activities of daily living while convalescing from surgery of the opposite arm. There is currently no evidence to guide this, and the decision should be made in collaboration with the patient.

40|$|Xylene {{has been}} {{generally}} {{used as a}} clearing and deparaffinizing agent in histology. Because of the potential toxic and flammable nature of xylene, its substitutes have been introduced into some laboratories. In this study, we introduced a novel, non-toxic xylene substitute (SBO), which was generated through a mixture of 86 % of white oil No. 2 and 14 % of N-heptane. SBO had a high boiling point (188 °C) and flash point (144 °C) coupled with a scentless and decreased volatility. To compare the effectiveness of SBO and xylene in histology, {{a wide range of}} tissue samples from rats and human beings were processed in parallel in SBO and xylene, subjected to various staining procedures. Similar to the xylene-processed paraffin blocks, the SBO-processed counterparts were easy to section without any evidence of cell shrinkage. Assessment of the SBO-treated sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin revealed a good maintenance of cell morphology and structure, and a clear definition of the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Moreover, <b>comparable</b> <b>good</b> results were achieved between the SBO- and xylene-processed tissues in other histochemical and immunohistochemical stainings. Six-month clinical applications at one department of pathology supported the potentials of SBO as a xylene substitute. In conclusion, we suggest that SBO is a safe and efficient substitute of xylene and may probably replace xylene without losing valuable diagnostic information...|$|R
