Only direct mass spectrometric analysis of the pyrolyzates from wood and lignin samples, without cooling, indicate significant contributions of coniferyl alcohol (MW: 180) and sinapyl alcohol (MW: 210) [7].

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work has been the {{development}} of new methodologies for the selective synthesis of arylated aldehydes by means of palladium catalysis. In the last decades, the alpha-arylation of enolizable carbonyl compounds has advanced with significant strides. In this context, aldehydes revealed to be particularly challenging substrates. In {{the first part of this}} study, extension of the palladium-catalyzed intermolecular alpha-arylation of aldehydes to alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes are presented. This reaction, based on the vinylogous principle, has been applied to the synthesis of gamma-arylated alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes bearing a congested gamma-quaternary centers with perfect regioselectivity and good E/Z selectivity. We next described a complementary approach for the synthesis of beta-arylated aldehydes by palladium-catalyzed intermolecular alpha-benzylation of aldehydes. This reaction showed to be remarkably general with respect to both coupling partners.

40|$|During {{the course}} of this PhD, a new one-pot thermal Overman {{rearrangement}} and ring-closing metathesis process was developed for the preparation of polycyclic compounds. In this method, commercially available phenols and anilines were converted to alkene derived allylic alcohols and then transformed via a one-pot process into 5 -amino 2, 5 -dihydro- 1 -benzoxepines and 5 -amino 2, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-benzazepines. The synthetic utility of these compounds was explored with the preparation of highly substituted hydroxylated analogues as well as a highly active hypotensive agent. A novel one-pot process was also developed for the synthesis of allylic amide derived 2 H-chromenes. The key substrates, propargyloxy <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> were rapidly prepared from readily available salicylaldehydes. One-pot thermal Overman rearrangement of the corresponding allylic trichloroacetimidates, followed by a gold(I) -catalysed hydroarylation gave the 2 H-chromenes in high yields.

Reactivity {{was quite different}} depending on the model structure: depolymerization: α-O- 4 [phenolic (ph), nonphenolic (nonph)], β-O- 4 (ph) > β-O- 4 (nonph), β- 1 (ph, nonph) > biphenyl (ph, nonph); condensation/carbonization: β- 1 (ph) > β-O- 4 (ph) > α-O- 4 (ph) > β-O- 4 (nonph), biphenyl (ph, nonph), α-O- 4 (nonph), β- 1 (nonph). Major degradation pathways were also identified for β-O- 4 and β- 1 model dimers: β-O- 4 types: Cβ-O cleavage to form <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and phenols and Cγ-elimination yielding vinyl ethers; β- 1 types: Cα-Cβ cleavage yielding benzaldehydes and styrenes and Cγ-elimination yielding stilbenes.

40|$|The mini article {{highlights}} the versatility of Ni-Al hydrotalcite (HT) catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant compared to Ni/SiO 2, Ni and other catalysts reported for oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds.

40|$|Within {{a broader}} program of {{study of the}} {{molecular}} structure of plant cell walls, molecular dynamics calculations were used to explore {{the character of the}} motion of lignin model compounds near a cellulose surface. Model cellulose microfibrils, which have a large number of hydroxyl groups on the surface, appear to have a net attractive interaction with the lignin models examined in this study. The lignin monomer coniferyl alcohol rapidly adsorbed onto the surface from a water layer after it was released 13 A from the surface. The major long-range force responsible for this adsorption is likely electrostatic. The attractive interaction is sufficient to restrict the motion of coniferyl alcohol when it is within 1 A of the surface and to orient the phenyl ring parallel to the surface. The [beta]-O- 4 -linked trimer also was observed to adsorb onto the surface with two of its phenyl rings parallel to the surface. These results suggest a mechanism by which the polysaccharide component of the plant cell wall could influence the structure of lignin. Furthermore, they provide a rationalization of the experimental observation that polysaccharides can change the course of dehydrogenation polymerization of <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>alcohols...</b>|$|R

CCR converts activated cinnamic acids (hydroxycinnamoyl–SCoAs) to cinnamaldehydes; cinnamaldehydes are then reduced to <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> by CAD. The transformations caused the incorporation of nontraditional components into the extractable tobacco lignins, as evidenced by NMR. Isolated lignin of antisense-CAD tobacco contained fewer coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol-derived units that were compensated for by elevated levels of benzaldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Products from radical coupling of cinnamaldehydes, particularly sinapaldehyde, which were barely discernible in normal tobacco, were major components of the antisense-CAD tobacco lignin. Lignin content was reduced in antisense-CCR tobacco, which displayed a markedly reduced vigor. That lignin contained fewer coniferyl alcohol-derived units and significant levels of tyramine ferulate. Tyramine ferulate is a sink for the anticipated build-up of feruloyl–SCoA, and may be up-regulated {{in response to a}} deficit of coniferyl alcohol. Although it is not yet clear whether the modified lignins are true structural components of the cell wall, the findings provide further indications of the metabolic plasticity of plant lignification.

40|$|Lignin, {{a complex}} heteropolymer of <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>alcohols,</b> is, second to cellulose, the most {{abundant}} biopolymer on Earth. Lignification has played a determining role in the adaptation of plants to terrestrial life. As all extracellular polymers, lignin confers rheological properties to plant tissues and participates probably in many other functions in cell and tissue physiology or in cell-to-cell communication. Economically, lignin is very important because it determines wood quality and it affects the pulp and paper-making processes {{as well as the}} digestibility of forage crops. For all these reasons the lignin biosynthesis pathway {{has been the subject of}} many studies. At present, most genes encoding the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lignin have been cloned and characterized. Various recent studies report on the alteration of the expression of these genes by genetic engineering, yielding plants with modified lignin. In addition, several mutants have been analyzed with changes in lignin content or lignin composition resulting in altered properties. Thanks to these studies, progress in the knowledge of the lignin biosynthesis pathway has been obtained. It is now clear that the pathway is more complex than initially thought and there is evidence for alternative pathways. A fine manipulation of the lignin content and/or composition in plants is now achievable and could have important economical and environmental benefits. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Monolignol glucosides {{are thought}} to be implicated in the lignin {{biosynthesis}} pathway as storage and/or transportation forms of <b>cinnamyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> between the cytosol and the lignifying cell walls. The hydrolysis of these monolignol glucosides would involve beta-glucosidase activities. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), in vitro studies have shown the affinity of beta-GLUCOSIDASE 45 (BGLU 45) and BGLU 46 for monolignol glucosides. BGLU 45 and BGLU 46 genes are expressed in stems. Immunolocalization experiments showed that BGLU 45 and BGLU 46 proteins are mainly located in the interfascicular fibers and in the protoxylem, respectively. Knockout mutants for BGLU 45 or BGLU 46 do not have a lignin-deficient phenotype. Coniferin and syringin could be detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in Arabidopsis stems. Stems from BGLU 45 and BGLU 46 mutant lines displayed a significant increase in coniferin content without any change in coniferyl alcohol, whereas no change in syringin content was observed. Other glucosylated compounds of the phenylpropanoid pathway were also deregulated in these mutants, but to a lower extent. By contrast, BGLU 47, which is closely related to BGLU 45 and BGLU 46, is not implicated in either the general phenylpropanoid pathway or in the lignification of stems and roots. These results confirm that the major in vivo substrate of BGLU 45 and BGLU 46 is coniferin and suggest that monolignol glucosides are the storage form of monolignols in Arabidopsis, but not the direct precursors of lignin...|$|R
