Although the contaminants in soil were inhomogenously distributed, a decrease in the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons attributable to biodegradation, volatilization <b>and</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>processes</b> was observed in several sampling areas.

A step-change in extract yield between microwave and conventional processes was shown to be caused by selective heating. A temperature gradient of the order of 1 oC is sufficient to reduce the water chemical potential within the cell structure, which changes the osmotic potential such that internal cell pressures can increase to the point where disruption occurs.

After roasting the insoluble alkali titanate is separated from rare-earth oxide mixture in colloidal form and water-soluble ferrite. Further leaching of alkali titanate is carried out with oxalic (0. 3 M) and ascorbic (0. 01 M) acid solution which removes the remaining Fe 2 + ions into the leachate and allows precipitation of high-purity synthetic rutile containing more than 95 % TiO 2.
