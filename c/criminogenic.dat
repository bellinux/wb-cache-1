25|$|Many {{prisons in}} the United States are overcrowded. For example, California's 33 prisons {{have a total}} {{capacity}} of 100,000, but they hold 170,000 inmates. Many prisons in California {{and around the country}} are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release 27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The three-judge court considering requests by the Plata v. Schwarzenegger and Coleman v. Schwarzenegger courts found California's prisons have become <b>criminogenic</b> as a result of prison overcrowding.|$|E

The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a <b>criminogenic</b> setting.|$|E

50|$|Sociologist Robert K. Merton {{believed}} deviance {{depended on}} society’s definition of success, and {{the desires of}} individuals to achieve success through socially defined avenues. Criminality becomes attractive when expectations {{of being able to}} fulfill goals (therefore achieving success) by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled. Criminal organizations capitalize on states of normlessness by imposing <b>criminogenic</b> needs and illicit avenues to achieve them. This has been used as the basis for numerous meta-theories of organized crime through its integration of social learning, cultural deviance, and <b>criminogenic</b> motivations. If crime is seen as a function of anomie, organized behavior produces stability, increases protection or security, and may be directly proportional to market forces as expressed by entrepreneurship- or risk-based approaches. It is the inadequate supply of legitimate opportunities that constrains the ability for the individual to pursue valued societal goals and reduces the likelihood that using legitimate opportunities will enable them to satisfy such goals (due to their position in society).|$|E

The Unit aims to reduce offending by the use of empirically sound risk assessment tools and a brokerage case management model, which targets <b>criminogenic</b> needs.|$|E

50|$|In one of {{its most}} {{important}} final report passages, the National Violence Commission observed:To be a young, poor male; to be undereducated and without means of escape from an oppressive urban environment; to want what the society claims is available (but mostly to others); to see around oneself illegitimate and often violent methods being used to achieve material success; and to observe others using these means with impunity - all this is to be burdened with an enormous set of influences that pull many toward crime and delinquency. To be also a Negro, Mexican or Puerto Rican American and subject to discrimination and segregation adds considerably to the pull of these other <b>criminogenic</b> forces.|$|E
50|$|Sutherland also {{believed}} that such disorganization causes and reinforces the cultural traditions and cultural conflicts that support antisocial activity. The systematic quality of the behavior was a reference to repetitive, patterned, or organized offending, as opposed to random events. He depicted the law-abiding culture as dominant and more extensive than alternative <b>criminogenic</b> cultural views, and as capable of overcoming systematic crime if organized for that purpose (1939: 8). But because society is organized around individual and small group interests, society permits crime to persist. Sutherland concluded that if the society is organized {{with reference to the}} values expressed in the law, the crime is eliminated; if it is not organized, crime persists and develops (1939:8).|$|E
5000|$|In criminology, {{the focal}} {{concerns}} theory, posited in 1962 by Walter B. Miller, attempts {{to explain the}} behavior of [...] "members of adolescent street corner groups in lower class communities" [...] as concern for six focal concerns: trouble, toughness, smartness, excitement, fate, autonomy. These focal concerns are described as [...] "areas or issues which command widespread and persistent attention and {{a high degree of}} emotional involvement." [...] Miller's theory, as it is often referred to, views these <b>criminogenic</b> influences as a learned part of the lower-class subculture values. In essence, the theory suggests that delinquency is in fact part of the learned cultural values rather than an anomic reaction to unattainable goals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{empirical}} {{basis for}} the subculture of violence theory, however, {{has been described as}} [...] "extremely limited and unpersuasive". Very little has been done to attempt an adequate assessment of supposedly <b>criminogenic</b> subcultural values, and several studies conducted in the late 1970s claimed to falsify the assumptions upon which the subculture of violence theory depends. More recently, scholars have criticized the theory as potentially racist in nature in its implication of one given ethnicity or culture supposedly being less fit for or less worthy of being qualified as [...] "civilized," [...] the built-in implication of which in turn would denote stereotypically [...] "white" [...] behavior as an objective norm for all societies to follow.|$|E
50|$|Findings {{from these}} studies and PADS+ {{highlight}} {{the role of}} the social environment and the interaction between people and environments in young people’s crime involvement. The book Breaking Rules provides a comprehensive overview of the rigorous study design, crime involvement and key relevant personal and social factors in a contemporary adolescent sample, and, {{for the first time ever}} in criminology, presents concrete evidence that crime occurs when (and only when) people with specific personal characteristics take part in settings with specific environmental features under specific circumstances. Wikström’s study and innovative methods allow for the identification of environmental features which make settings <b>criminogenic,</b> and personal characteristics which make some people vulnerable, and others resistant, to those settings. These findings have critical implications for crime prevention.|$|E
5000|$|William K. Black {{claims that}} {{inappropriate}} deregulation {{helped create a}} <b>criminogenic</b> environment in {{the savings and loan}} industry, which attracted opportunistic control frauds like Charles Keating, whose massive political campaign contributions were used successfully to further suppress regulatory oversight. The combination substantially delayed effective governmental action, thereby substantially increasing the losses when the fraudulent Ponzi schemes finally collapsed and were exposed. After the collapse, regulators in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) were finally allowed to file thousands of criminal complaints that led to over a thousand felony convictions of key Savings and Loan insiders. [...] By contrast, between 2007 and 2010, the OCC and OTS combined made ''''zero'''' criminal referrals; Black concluded that elite financial fraud has effectively been decriminalized.|$|E
5000|$|Youth may be {{directly}} controlled through constraints imposed by parents, limiting {{the opportunity for}} delinquency, {{as well as through}} parental rewards and punishments. However, they may be constrained when free from direct control by their anticipation of parental disapproval (indirect control), or through the development of a conscience, an internal constraint on behavior. The focus on the family as a source of control was in marked contrast to the emphasis on economic circumstances as a source of <b>criminogenic</b> motivation at the time. Although he acknowledged motivational forces by stating that, [...] "...some delinquent behavior results from a combination of positive learning and weak and ineffective social control" [...] (1958: 4), he adopted a control-theory position when he proposed that, [...] "...most delinquent behavior is the result of insufficient social control..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Marxist {{criminology}} {{is one of}} {{the schools}} of criminology. It parallels the work of the structural functionalism school which focuses on what produces stability and continuity in society but, unlike the functionalists, it adopts a predefined political philosophy. As in conflict criminology, it focuses on why things change, identifying the disruptive forces in industrialized societies, and describing how society is divided by power, wealth, prestige, and the perceptions of the world. [...] "The shape and character of the legal system in complex societies can be understood as deriving from the conflicts inherent in the structure of these societies which are stratified economically and politically" [...] (Chambliss, 1971, p3). It is concerned with the causal relationships between society and crime, i.e. to establish a critical understanding of how the immediate and structural social environment gives rise to crime and <b>criminogenic</b> conditions.|$|E

50|$|Let’s {{remind the}} reader that actual {{unchangeable}} figure representing the number of persons serving their sentence in penitentiary institutions {{is the product of}} society, and <b>criminogenic</b> situation in the country will not improve unless both the country leadership and the public come to understand that this “social product” should be released from jail with a new positive quality, new attitude towards the crime - this is the main goal of punishment. That is why public participation in psychological transformation of the prisoners should not be restricted, while the state should by all means promote fruitful cooperation and encourage public activists to participate in the reforming of the SPSU system. So far this system remains predominantly closed to the public, and we can only hope that eventually the situation will change for the better and the SPSU leaders will change their hostile attitude toward citizens and journalists and will not try to conceal the faults of their operation from public at large.|$|E
50|$|Sutherland {{goes further}} {{to say that}} deviancy is {{contingent}} on conflicting groups within society, and that such groups struggle over the means to define what is criminal or deviant within society. Criminal organizations therefore gravitate around illegal avenues of production, profit-making, protectionism or social control and attempt (by increasing their operations or membership) to make these acceptable. This also explains the propensity of criminal organizations to develop protection rackets, to coerce {{through the use of}} violence, aggression and threatening behavior (at times termed 'terrorism'). Preoccupation with methods of accumulating profit highlight the lack of legitimate means to achieve economic or social advantage, as does the organization of white-collar crime or political corruption (though it is debatable whether these are based on wealth, power or both). The ability to effect social norms and practices through political and economic influence (and the enforcement or normaliszation of <b>criminogenic</b> needs) may be defined by differential association theory.|$|E

5000|$|Magnetic {{facilities}} {{refer to}} the attractiveness of a location for deviant behavior. This study looked at the self-nominated hangouts of 5,082 delinquent youth living in Southern California. The structure of these networks remained relatively constant over the time the study was conducted. The centrality statistics used were in-degree and betweenness to identify facilities operating as stable regional convergence locations. [...] "Explaining the linkage between urban planning and crime patterns, Brantingham argues that four factors - accessibility through high-volume transportation conduits, placement, juxtaposition, and the operation of facilities - can account for the <b>criminogenic</b> capacity of specific places". [...] Of the locations included in the network, the top twenty with the highest in-degree centrality scores in both the valued and dichotomous networks were investigated for the following three characteristics: facility type - coded as public space, freestanding building, attached or terrace style structure, or mall facility; place type - coded as movies, video store, fast food restaurant, shopping, outdoor recreation, school, and other; and school accessibility - {{counting the number of}} schools within a 5-mile radius of the property.|$|E
5000|$|Walsh also says: [...] "Robinson's {{book is a}} tour {{de force}} for the criminologist who wants to learn {{something}} about the biosocial perspective." [...] Professor Schmalleger calls the work [...] "among the best work being done in the area of theoretical integration today." [...] Professor Barak says the theory is “consistent with … general <b>criminogenic</b> ‘facts of crime’ that have been associated with criminal behaviour … built around known risk factors that have been identified by scholars in numerous disciplines such as anthropology, behavioural genetics, biology, economics, neurology, psychology, and sociology … in true interdisciplinary fashion, the integrated systems theory incorporates propositions derived from genetics, brain structure, brain function, brain dysfunction, personality traits, intelligence levels, mental illness, diet and nutrition, drug consumption, family influences, peer influences, social disorganization, routine activities and victim lifestyles, deterrence, labelling, anomie, strain, culture conflict and subcultures, race, class, and gender … incorporates a developmental or life-course perspective … consistent with a growing literature on developmental criminology … in harmony with the empirical evidence.” ...|$|E
50|$|In recent years, Wikström {{has focused}} his {{energies}} on advancing multidisciplinary theory into {{the explanation of}} crime through Situational Action Theory (SAT). SAT {{represents one of the}} first attempts in the field of criminology to specify the situational mechanisms that link individual differences and behavioural contexts to specific acts of crime. At the core of SAT is the proposition that crime, which represents a form of moral rule-breaking (moral rules being rules, such as laws, that specify what it is right or wrong to do), is the outcome of an interaction between people with relevant personal characteristics (crime propensities - weak crime-relevant personal morality and a poor ability to exercise self-control) and settings with relevant (<b>criminogenic)</b> features (a weak moral context and poor enforcement). This interaction may lead certain people in certain settings to perceive crime as an action alternative (something they would consider doing), which they then choose to commit. SAT frames this situational perception-choice process against the backdrop of developmental processes which lead people and places to acquire crime-relevant characteristics, and selection processes which bring certain kinds of people and places together in space and time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commission}} {{of violent crime}} may form part of a criminal organization's 'tools' used to achieve <b>criminogenic</b> goals (for example, its threatening, authoritative, coercive, terror-inducing, or rebellious role), due to psychosocial factors (cultural conflict, aggression, rebellion against authority, access to illicit substances, counter-cultural dynamic), or may, in and of itself, be crime rationally chosen by individual criminals and the groups they form. Assaults are used for coercive measures, to [...] "rough up" [...] debtors, competition or recruits, in the {{commission of}} robberies, in connection to other property offenses, and {{as an expression of}} counter-cultural authority; violence is normalized within criminal organizations (in direct opposition to mainstream society) and the locations they control. [...] Whilst the intensity of violence is dependent on the types of crime the organization is involved in (as well as their organizational structure or cultural tradition) aggressive acts range on a spectrum from low-grade physical assaults to murder. Bodily harm and grievous bodily harm, within the context of organized crime, must be understood as indicators of intense social and cultural conflict, motivations contrary to the security of the public, and other psychosocial factors.|$|E
50|$|Since {{research}} suggests that incarcerated individuals {{are much more likely}} to have been exposed to violence and suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a trauma-informed approach may better help to address some of these <b>criminogenic</b> risk factors and can create a less traumatizing criminal justice experience. Programs, like Seeking Safety, are often used to help individuals in the criminal justice system learn how to better cope with trauma, PTSD, and substance abuse. Juvenile courts better help deter children from crime and delinquency when they understand the trauma many of these children have experienced. The criminal justice system itself can also retraumatize individuals. This can be prevented by creating safer facilities where correctional and police officers are properly trained to keep incidents from escalating. Partnerships between police and mental health providers can also reduce the possible traumatizing effects of police intervention and help provide families with the proper mental health and social services. The Women’s Community Correctional Center of Hawaii began a Trauma-Informed Care Initiative that aims to train all employees to be aware and sensitive to trauma, to screen all women in their facility for trauma, to assess those who have experienced trauma, and begin providing trauma-informed mental health care to those women identified.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory is}} related to earlier drift theory (David Matza, Delinquency and Drift, 1964) where people use the {{techniques}} of neutralization to drift {{in and out of}} delinquent behavior, and the Systematic Crime Theory (an aspect of Social Disorganization Theory developed by the Chicago School), where Edwin Sutherland proposed that the failure of families and extended kin groups expands the realm of relationships no longer controlled by the community, and undermines governmental controls. This leads to persistent [...] "systematic" [...] crime and delinquency. He also believed that such disorganization causes and reinforces the cultural traditions and cultural conflicts that support antisocial activity. The systematic quality of the behavior was a reference to repetitive, patterned or organized offending as opposed to random events. He depicted the law-abiding culture as dominant and more extensive than alternative <b>criminogenic</b> cultural views and capable of overcoming systematic crime if organized for that purpose. In a similar vein, Cohen and Felson (1979) developed Routine Activities Theory which focuses on the characteristics of crime rather than the characteristics of the offender. This {{is one of the main}} theories of environmental criminology as an aspect of Crime Prevention Theory. It states that for a crime to occur, three elements must be present, i.e. there must be: ...|$|E
