50|$|Icterids {{such as the}} <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> (Quiscalus lugubris) and {{the shiny}} cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), which often parasitizes the nests of the former species, are quite common.|$|E
50|$|Common birds include Great Egret (Ardea alba), Mealy Parrot (Amazona farinosa), Bicolored Wren (Campylorhynchus griseus), Brown-throated Parakeet (Aratinga pertinax), Tropical Kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus), <b>Carib</b> <b>Grackle</b> (Quiscalus lugubris). At least 28 {{species of}} dung beetles have been {{reported}} in systematic surveys, including Canthon.mutabilis, Canthidium.lebasi, Onthophagus.marginicollis, Dichotomius.agenor, Coprophanaeus.gamezi, Canthon.lituratus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle's</b> song is {{a mixture}} of harsh and more musical ringing notes, with a bell-like tickita-tickita-tickita-ting and a rapid chi-chi-chi-chi being typical. The calls vary in dialect between islands and the bird usually fluffs up its {{feathers}} when calling.|$|R
50|$|The two endemic lizard species, the Dominican ground lizard and the Dominican anole, {{are common}} {{on the grounds}} of the Botanical Gardens. It is also {{frequently}} visited by a variety of wild birds, including three species of hummingbirds, <b>carib</b> <b>grackles,</b> and the green heron.|$|R
50|$|Deforestation has led {{to recent}} {{establishment}} of the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) within the martinique oriole habitat. The shiny cowbird parasites 75% of the martinique oriole nests each year. Another possible threat is from the increase in native <b>Carib</b> <b>Grackles</b> (Quiscalus lugubris) which engage in nest-predation of the martinique oriole.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> is {{a highly}} gregarious species, {{foraging}} {{on the ground for}} insects, other invertebrates, or scraps. It can become very tame and bold, entering restaurants to seek food, normally feeding on leftovers. It will form groups to attack potential predators, such dogs, mongooses or humans, and at night it roosts colonially.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> (Quiscalus lugubris) is a New World {{tropical}} blackbird, {{a resident}} breeder in the Lesser Antilles and northern South America {{east of the}} Andes, from Colombia east to Venezuela and north-eastern Brazil.There are eight races, of which the most widespread is the nominate Q. l. lugubris of Trinidad and the South American mainland. This form was introduced to Tobago in 1905 and is now common there.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> is 27 cm long {{with a long}} {{wedge-shaped}} tail, although the latter is not so long as with other grackles. Its plumage is entirely black with a violet iridescence, its eyes are yellow, {{and it has a}} strong dark bill. The adult female is 23 cm long, with a shorter tail and brown plumage, darker on the upperparts. Young males are shorter tailed than adult males and have some brown in the plumage. Young females are very similar to the adult females.|$|E
40|$|Dunking behaviour, the dipping {{of food in}} water, {{has been}} anecdotally {{observed}} in more than 25 species of birds in the wild, but its function and ecology have not been systematically studied. In experiments conducted {{in the field and}} in captivity on <b>Carib</b> <b>grackles,</b> Quiscalus lugubris, in Barbados, we showed that: (1) dunking rate in the field was influenced by food type and that moistening dry food seems {{to be one of the}} major benefits of dunking; (2) most dunking observed in the field was performed by a minority of individuals, but the vast majority (86...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} invent new {{solutions}} to old or novel problems is often equated with intelligence, both in humans and non-human animals. Behavioural flexibility {{can be defined}} operationally {{by looking at the}} frequency of novel or unusual behaviours, i. e. innovations, in different taxa. Despite the potential survival benefits of behavioural flexibility in the face of changing conditions, there is variation among taxa in the propensity to innovate. Here, I examine in detail one foraging innovation, dunking behaviour (the immersion of food items in water) in <b>Carib</b> <b>grackles</b> (Quiscalus lugubris) of Barbados. I show that the rarity of dunking behaviour in the field is not due to the inability of most individuals to learn and/or perform it, but rather to the balance of costs and benefits not being favourable to its expression in most field conditions. In this population, dunking functions as a proto-tool food-processing technique speeding the ingestion of items that are difficult to swallow. The frequency of the behaviour depends on food characteristics, travel costs between the food source and water, and the probability of losing items to conspecifics. Dunking renders grackles vulnerable to food theft because it involves releasing food items in water, where there is often a build-up of conspecifics. When faced with a high risk of kleptoparasitism, grackles reduce the frequency of dunking, engage in aggressive displays, and keep items in the bill while dunking. Kleptoparasitism not only reduces the rate of dunking by increasing costs to the behaviour, but also by constituting an alternative foraging tactic. The payoffs to this tactic are frequency-dependent; i. e. they decrease as the frequency of kleptoparasites increases in the group. A comparative study on ecological, morphological and behavioural predictors of the occurrence of kleptoparasitic tactics among bird families point to an important role of predation and cognitive abilities in favouring the evolution of kleptoparasitism. Thus, avian food-stealing should not be regarded as a "cognitively simpler" alternative to intelligent behaviour, but as another form of behavioural flexibility. Large-brained primates and birds share the ability to learn quickly, innovate, use tools and engage in exploitative tactics, suggesting that these abilities have not been traded-off against each other, but have instead evolved together...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} social learning in Zenaida dove (Zenaida aurita) functions primarily in a mixed species foraging context. The field study recorded foraging associations and interactions between Zenaida doves and other species. The <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> (Quiscalus lugubris) was the most frequent foraging associate of Zenaida doves. The laboratory study consisted of two experiments where conflicting information about a novel food type and novel food-finding problem was provided simultaneously by a conspecific and a heterospecific (grackle) demonstrator. Both experiments showed that not only could Zenaida doves learn from another species, but that they preferred the heterospecific demonstrator over the conspecific. The results suggest that social information may be obtained more readily from foraging associations rather than interference competition and {{that the role of}} conspecifics may be overemphasized in cultural learning...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{present in}} captivity {{and in the}} field, {{experimental}} tests based on innovative feeding {{to a group of}} seven opportunistic avian species in Barbados. In chapter 1, I present an example of innovative feeding anecdotes by describing for the first time bread "hunting" and kleptoparasitisim at experimental patches by the Gray Kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis). In chapter 2, I compare three Passeriforme (the <b>Carib</b> <b>Grackle,</b> Quiscalus lugubris; the Shiny Cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis; the Lesser-Antillean Bullfinch, Loxigilla noctis) and two Columbiforme species (the Zenaida Dove, Zenaida aurita, the Common Ground Dove, Columbina passerina) on three measures of foraging flexibility presented in the field and in captivity: habituation to mew food patches, willingness to feed near unfamiliar objects (neophobia) and ability to obtain food from a new apparatus. In chapter 3, the two nectar-feeding species in the opportunistic "guild" of Barbados, the bullfinch and the Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), were given a neophobia test in the field, using dissolved sugar as food.

40|$|Foraging innovation, {{in which}} an {{individual}} eats a novel food or uses a novel foraging tech-nique, has been observed {{in a wide range}} of species. If other individuals are nearby, they may adopt the innovation, thus spreading it through the population. Much research has focused on this social transmission of behaviour, but the effect of social context on the emergence of novel behaviour is unclear. Here, we examine the effect of social context on innovative feed-ing behaviour in the <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> (Quiscalus lugubris), an opportunistic, gregarious bird. We test the effect of the proximity of conspecifics, while eliminating the direct effects of in-terference, scrounging, or aggression. Using a repeated-measures design, we found that birds took significantly longer to contact novel foraging tasks when in the presence of others vs. alone, and during playbacks of alarm calls vs. a control sound. Further, performance of a food-processing behaviour decreased when birds were with others, and individuals adjusted their behaviour depending on their distance from conspecifics. Our results suggest that feed-ing in groups may slow down or inhibit innovative foraging behaviour in this species. We discuss the implications of a trade-off between feeding in groups and taking advantage of new feeding opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Producer [...] scrounger (PS) game-theoretical {{foraging}} models {{make predictions}} about the decision of group-feeding animals either to look for food (produce) or for opportunities to exploit the discoveries of other foragers (scrounge). We report the most complete demonstration to date of {{the applicability of the}} PS foraging game in a free-living animal, the <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> (Quiscalus lugubris) of Barbados. As assumed by PS games, the payoffs obtained by scroungers were negatively frequency dependent. Experimentally, increasing the cost of scrounging led to a decrease in the observed proportion of scroungers, whereas raising the cost of producing increased the proportion of scroungers. Observations of marked birds revealed that group-level changes could be brought about by individual flexibility in tactic use. Despite consistent individual differences in tactic use, most birds used both tactics and could alter their use of producing and scrounging when conditions changed. We found no difference in the payoffs obtained by producers and scroungers, suggesting a symmetrical game equilibrium. Our results call for testing the PS foraging game in a broader range of biological systems that include different types of scrounging behavior (e. g., scramble, stealthful, or aggressive scrounging) as well as the exploitation of different phases of food production (e. g., searching, handling).

40|$|String-pulling {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular tests in animal {{cognition}} because of its apparent complexity, and of its potential to be applied to very different taxa. In birds, the basic procedure involves a food reward, suspended from a perch by a string, which can be reached by a series of coordinated pulling actions with the beak and holding actions of the pulled lengths of string with the foot. The taxonomic distribution of species that pass the test includes several corvids, parrots and parids, but in other families, data are much spottier and the number of individuals per species that succeed is often low. To date, the association between string-pulling ability and other cognitive traits was never tested. It is generally assumed that string-pulling is a complex form of problem-solving, suggesting that performance on string-pulling and other problem-solving tasks should be correlated. Here, we show that individuals of two innovative species from Barbados, the bullfinch Loxigilla barbadensis and the <b>Carib</b> <b>grackle</b> Quiscalus lugubris fortirostris, pass the string-pulling test. Eighteen of the 42 bullfinches tested succeeded, allowing us to correlate performance on this test to that on several other behavioral measurements. Surprisingly, string-pulling in bullfinches was unrelated to shyness, neophobia, problem-solving, discrimination and reversal learning performance. Only two of 31 grackles tested succeeded, precluding correlational analyses with other measures but still, the two successful birds largely differed in their other behavioral traits...|$|E
