40|$|Echocardiograms were {{recorded}} in 154 active athletes (from various sports) and 21 ex-athletes and compared with those in 40 normal control subjects (non-athletes). Diastolic cavity dimension and posterior wall and septal thickness were measured and left ventricular mass and the ratio of posterior wall thickness to <b>cavity</b> radius and <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> to posterior wall thickness calculated. As a group athletes had a significantly increased diastolic cavity dimension, posterior wall and septal thickness, and left ventricular mass. The ratio of posterior wall thickness to cavity radius was distributed as a single continuous variable with a significantly increased mean, {{and there was no}} separate subgroup of shot putters or weight lifters with inappropriate hypertrophy. The mean ratio <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> to posterior wall thickness was normal, but there was a wide range of values up to 2. 1 : 1. Ex-athletes had entirely normal left ventricular dimensions and wall thickness. When athletes are categorised by their standard of competition national standard competitors had a significantly increased posterior wall and septal thickness and left ventricular mass compared with university and non-competitive sportsmen. In conclusion, strenuous activity results in left ventricular hypertrophy which is appropriate to the body size of the athlete and the degree of activity but not to its type...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{approach}} to cystic fibrosis patients treatment doesn’t involve {{upper respiratory tract}} assessment, though abnormal changes — consequences of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductivity regulator gene mutation- do affect nasal and paranasal mucosa to the same extent. Approximately half of cystic fibrosis patients suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis and/or nasal polyposis that worsens the clinical course of already severe disease. Chronic hyperplasia in paranasal cavities can be quite extensive, recurrent {{and can lead to}} destruction of osseous walls <b>of</b> the <b>cavity</b> and <b>of</b> nasal <b>septum.</b> Thus increasing the amount of hospital admissions and and their duration. Low awareness of ENT-specialists working in polyclinics and in hospitals of ENT-pathology in cystic fibrosis patients leads to belated diagnostics, excessive manipulations, ineffective treatment, including surgery. All these lays grounds to implication of the early screening diagnostic program and development of proper treatment methods of ENT-complications of cystic fibrosis — therapeutic as well as surgical, with strict specification of indications and contraindications.

40|$|Abnormal {{systolic}} interventricular septal {{motion is}} an echocardiographic manifestation of right ventricular volume overload. In {{order to determine}} the anatomical basis for this echocardiographic finding, septal motion recorded by left lateral or left anterior oblique ventriculograms was compared with echocardiography ventricular septal motion. Thirteen patients with secundum atrial septal defects and 7 control patients with trivial or no heart disease were included in the study. We found that on ventriculograms the systolic motion <b>of</b> the interventricular <b>septum</b> was similar in both atrial septal defect and control patients. That is, the cephalic third <b>of</b> the <b>septum</b> moved anteriorly in systole in 9 of the 13 patients with atrial septal defect and in 3 of the 7 controls. The caudal two-thirds <b>of</b> the <b>septum</b> moved posteriorly in all patients. These results are compatible with the theory that argues that the echocardiographic abnormalities of septal motion in patients with atrial septal defect result from an end-diastolic septal flattening or bowing <b>of</b> the <b>septum</b> into the <b>cavity</b> <b>of</b> the left ventricle...|$|R

Previous genetic {{results suggest that}} the ability to separate nuclear division and septum formation depends upon a threshold level of activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase NIMX(cdk 1). Mutations in nimX and nimT, the gene encoding the NIMX(cdk 1) -activating phosphatase, have revealed that Tyr- 15 phosphorylation is important for determining the timing of the formation <b>of</b> the first <b>septum.</b> Here, we describe a screen for suppressors of nimT 23 (snt), designed to identify additional components of the pathway regulating septum formation.

Molecular characterization of sntA shows that it is allelic to the previously described ankA gene, which encodes the NIMX(cdk 1) Tyr- 15 kinase. Additional experiments described in this study show that nutritional conditions modulate the timing <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> formation and alter the phenotypes displayed by the snt mutants.

40|$|Introduction Myocardial {{hypertrophy}} of {{the left}} ventricle may be of physiological or pathological nature. Distinction of {{these two types of}} hypertrophy is sometimes not easy and represents a diagnostic challenge. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess global diastolic and regional systolic and diastolic myocardial function in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in athletes and hypertensive patients. Material and methods In 18 male hypertensive patients and 14 male athletes global diastolic left ventriclar function and regional systolic and diastolic myocardial function <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> and posterior wall were investigated by pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging. Results Ejection fraction and left ventricle mass index did not differ significantly between two groups. Hypertensive patients were found to have diastolic dysfunction while athletes had normal left ventricular diastolic function (the difference between the groups was P< 0. 00001). Index of regional diastolic function <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> as well as of the posterior wall was significantly less in hypertensive patients than in athletes (P< 0. 00001 for both). In spite of the normal global systolic function the regional systolic function <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> and posterior wall was significantly less in hypertensive patients than in athletes (P< 0. 02 for both). Conclusion The present results show significantly less global and regional diastolic function of hypertrophied myocardium in hypertensive patients than in athletes. In the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function, the quantification of myocardial velocity revealed significantly lower regional systolic function <b>of</b> <b>septum</b> and posterior wall in hypertensive patients than in athletes...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week, a crest grows that leaves the cephalic part. This crest is the first part <b>of</b> the <b>septum</b> primum.

The opening between the bottom edge <b>of</b> the <b>septum</b> primum and endocardial cushions is the ostium primum (first opening). The extensions of the upper and lower endocardial pads grow along the margin <b>of</b> the <b>septum</b> primum and close the ostium primum.

At birth, the neonate begins breathing and the associated decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance leads to a reversal of the pressure differential between the atria. The left atrium now has a greater pressure than the right, effectively closing the one-way flow valve formed by the two septa.
