40|$|A {{system for}} the NDI' testing of the {{integrity}} of conposite materials and of adhesive bonds has been developed to meet industrial requirements. The vibration techniques used {{were found to be}} applicable to the development of fluid measuring transducers. The vibrational spectra of thin rectangular bars were used for the NDT work. A machined cut in a bar had a significant effect on the spectrum but a genuine crack gave an unambiguous response at high amplitudes. This was the generation of fretting crack noise at frequencies far above that of the drive. A specially designed vibrational decrement meter which, in effect, measures mechanical energy loss enabled a numerical classification of material adhesion to be obtained. This was used to study bars which had been flame or plasma sprayed with a variety of materials. It has become a useful tool in optimising coating methods. A direct industrial application was to classify piston rings of high performance I. C. engines. Each consists of a <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ring</b> with a channel into which molybdenum, a good bearing surface, is sprayed. The NDT classification agreed quite well with the destructive test normally used. The techniques and equipment used for the NOT work were applied {{to the development of the}} tuning fork transducers investigated by Hassan into commercial density and viscosity devices. Using narrowly spaced, large area tines a thin lamina of fluid is trapped between them. It stores a large fraction of the vibrational energy which, acting as an inertia load reduces the frequency. Magnetostrictive and piezoelectric effects together or in combination enable the fork to be operated through a flange. This allows it to be used in pipeline or 'dipstick' applications. Using a different tine geometry the viscosity loading can be predoninant. This as well as the signal decrement of the density transducer makes a practical viscometer...|$|E

The Bridge The bridge bears the date 1813 and the name Salford Iron Works and was built as a carriage bridge over the river Goyt on the Brabyns estate of Nathaniel Wright, who from 1793 was connected with collieries in Poynton 1. The bridge spans about 46 feet and has three <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> arch ribs, each made in two pieces. Circular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> frame the spandrels between the ribs and the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> deck beams.

500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble.

40|$|Bimetallic {{castings}} {{are widely}} used in the mining industries as construction material for crushers which have to perform high abrasive resistance at the outer side and excellent machinability at the inner side. To manufacture bimetallic casting goods cconsecutive centrifugal and gravity casting methods are commonly applied. Centrifugal and consecutive casting come up with geometrical constraints at the parting line of both materials. This research dealed with the manufacturing of tapered grinding roll by applying gravity casting method. The possibilities of casting the white <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> outer <b>ring</b> in the preheated ductile <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> of the inner ring were investigated. The inner ring was first heated up by casting liquid metal around the inner side, which prevented the inner ring from cracking due to rapid expansion during the casting process and to provide adequyate shrinkage of inner ring during solidification. After achieving the desired temperature of the inner ring, the liquid metal of white <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was then poured into the cavity to form the outer ring. The preheating temperature of the inner ring was mainly derived from the linear thermal expansion of both quasi isotrophic material and the diffusion at the parting line. This preheating temperature has to facilitate the formation of metallurgical bonding and avoid cracks due to the difference of shrinkage value between inner and outer ring. The preheating temperature {{was set up in}} the range of 500 °C - 1000 °C and the flushing time was fixed for 7 seconds. Studies on the microstructure of sample material have revealed a formation of metallurgical bonding at all of the preheating temperature. The width of the diffusion at the interface area varied between 291 µm at 500 oC preheating temperature, 301 µm at 625 oC, 834, 8 µm at 750 °C, 909, 1 µm at 875 °C and 1027, 7 µm at 1000 °C. By preheating temperature of higher than 750 °C fusion occured at the interface area between inner and outer material. This research concludes that the casting of bimetallic by applying gravity casting method can be done by preheating the inner ring to 625 oC, interface temperature of 1150 oC, flushing time of 7 seconds and pouring the white <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> outer <b>ring</b> at the temperature of 1430 o...|$|R

40|$|The {{conformance}} {{between the}} liner and rings {{of an internal}} combustion engine depends mainly on their linear wear (dimensional loss) during running-in. Running-in wear studies, using the factorial design of experiments, on a compression ignition engine show that at certain dead centre locations of piston rings the linear wear of the cylinder liner increases with increase in the initial surface roughness of the liner. Rough surfaces wear rapidly without seizure during running-in to promote quick conformance, so an initial surface finish of the liner of 0. 8 μm c. l. a. is recommended. The linear wear of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> liner and <b>rings</b> decreases with increasing load but the mass wear increases with increasing load.
