40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{observational study}} was conducted to evaluate the animal welfare impacts of holding and mixing on boars; specifically, the need to tusk trim on arrival at assembly. <b>Cull</b> <b>boars</b> assembled in Manitoba from 3 western Canadian provinces were observed without intervention. Although aggression among boars was common, significant physical injury to boars from handling and other boars was rare. Tusk trimming was widely practised in mature boars prior to transport in the population studied. Length of time assembled, number of boars in a pen, temperature, size of boar, and presence of tusk were not associated with change in the skin score of new boars introduced into a pen. Holding groups of previously unfamiliar boars en route to slaughter {{did not appear to be}} a significant risk for increased skin lesions in the population studied. Further research is required into the methods and welfare implications to boars subjected to tusk trimming...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{failure to}} {{eradicate}} a disease in livestock {{has sometimes been}} related to wildlife reservoirs of infection. We describe the effects of Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) abundance reduction through increased culling on the prevalence of two chronic infectious diseases, tuberculosis (TB) and Aujeszky's disease (AD), in a region of South-central Spain (SCS). The two infections studied responded differently to an approximately 50 % reduction of wild boar abundance. Wild boar TB prevalence remained stable in control sites, whereas it decreased by 21 - 48 % in treatment sites. In one treatment site, the annual wild boar abundance {{was positively correlated with}} the annual percentage of skin test reactor cattle. In another treatment site, red deer (Cervus elaphus) M. bovis infection prevalence decreased after <b>culling</b> wild <b>boar.</b> No significant effect of wild <b>boar</b> <b>culling</b> on wild <b>boar</b> ADV seroprevalence was found. The reduction in wild boar TB was achieved despite no alternative M. bovis host being included in the culling strategy. We advocate that culling could become a part of integrated control strategies including habitat and game management changes and vaccination, contributing to increase their success likelihood, or reducing the total expenses.

40|$|Distribution of {{the wild}} boar in the Netherlands is {{strictly}} controlled, and is limited to two areas: the Veluwe in Gelderland and the Meinweg in central Limburg. Wild boars outside these areas are <b>culled.</b> Wild <b>boars</b> prefer varied landscapes {{with a mix of}} forest areas and open spaces. SInce the beginning of the 21 st century, annual population growth has increased to 200 - 250 % in many years. Recently, wild boar has expanded its range in Noord-Brabant. Culling will probably not suffice to stop further growth of this population...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study <b>boar</b> <b>culling</b> patterns in swine breeding herds. Data were obtained from 84 swine breeding herds and included 440 <b>boars</b> that were <b>culled.</b> Each producer was involved for 12 consecutive months, and recorded every boar that {{was removed from the}} herd, the date, and the reason for culling. The annual culling rate for the 84 farms averaged 59. 4 % ± 6. 4 (SEM). The correlation coefficient between <b>boar</b> and sow <b>culling</b> was 0. 52 (p < 0. 0001). Removal was the result of being overweight (47 %), reproductive problems (18 %), leg problems (12 %), death (7 %), and other diseases (4 %). From the annual culling rate, the average breeding life of boars was estimated at 20 months. From this study, we concluded that the annual <b>culling</b> rate for <b>boars</b> in commercial herds was high and related to several different factors...|$|R
40|$|Conjunctival swabs from 44 {{free-living}} wild <b>boars</b> <b>culled</b> {{during a}} demographic control programme applied in a Regional Park {{located in the}} Northern Italy were examined by 16 S rRNA encoding gene nested PCR. In total, 22 (50 %) wild boars were PCR positive. Sequencing of the amplicons identified Chlamydia suis and Chlamydia pecorum in 12 and 5 samples, respectively. For one sample found PCR positive, the nucleotide sequence could not be determined. Four conjunctival samples showed ≥ 92 % sequence similarities to 16 S rRNA sequences from Chlamydia-like organisms, as did large intestine, uterus, and vaginal swabs from the same four animals. Amoeba DNA was found in one Chlamydia-like organism positive conjunctival swab. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} detection of members of the Parachlamydiaceae family in wild boars, confirming a large animal host range for Chlamydia-like organisms...|$|R
40|$|The area of {{the spit}} of Vistula river spans 166 km 2 {{including}} 49 km 2 of forest. Population numbers of wild boars living in forests (n= 290) and in urban areas (n= 56 - 82) were determined. The city wild boars had a higher piglets/female ratio than forest wild boars (4. 3 vs. 3. 8). Among the <b>culled</b> forest wild <b>boars</b> (n= 62), 20 % of piglets had corpora lutea whereas 57. 1 % of subadult and adult females were pregnant. The size of the daily home range of city wild boars (n= 7) was determined by radio-telemetry and found to be 3. 5 - 5. 8 ha.

40|$|The {{collection}} of biological samples through non-invasive techniques represents {{one way of}} monitoring in vivo physiological changes associated with reproductive activity. Such techniques are particularly important {{for the study of}} animal species in the wild. The goals of this study were 1) to evaluate fecal progestogen (P), estrogen (E), and androgen (A) by means of radio- immunoassays, in male and female wild <b>boars</b> <b>culled</b> in the Piedmont, Italy area; 2) to compare them with plasmatic concentrations and the animals’ reproductive status; and 3) to assess variations in reproductive seasonality between two populations of wild boars living in a mountainous vs. a plain habitat in Piedmont. The results demonstrate a positive correlation between fecal and plasmatic steroid concentrations (r = 0. 46, 0. 58, and 0. 45 for plasma P 4 and P, E 2 and E, and T and A; P 170 ng/g and > 100 pg/g respectively) were found in 70. 6...|$|R

40|$|Wild boar is a {{recognized}} reservoir of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in the Mediterranean ecosystems, but information is scarce outside of hotspots in southern Spain. We describe the first high-prevalence focus of TB in a non-managed wild boar population in northern Spain {{and the result}} of eight years of TB management. Measures implemented for disease control included the control of the local wild <b>boar</b> population through <b>culling</b> and stamping out of a sympatric infected cattle herd. Post-mortem inspection for detection of tuberculosis-like lesions as well as cultures from selected head and cervical lymph nodes was done in 745 wild boar, 355 Iberian ibexes and five cattle between 2004 and 2012. The seasonal prevalence of TB reached 70 % amongst adult wild boar and ten different spoligotypes and 13 MIRU-VNTR profiles were detected, although {{more than half of the}} isolates were included in the same clonal complex. Only 11 % of infected boars had generalized lesions. None of the ibexes were affected, supporting their irrelevance in the epidemiology of TB. An infected cattle herd grazed the zone where 168 of the 197 infected boars were harvested. Cattle removal and wild <b>boar</b> <b>culling</b> together contributed to a decrease in TB prevalence. The need for holistic, sustained over time, intensive and adapted TB control strategies taking into account the multi-host nature of the disease is highlighted. The potential risk for tuberculosi...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrom 2004 to 2007, {{blood samples}} from 273 healthy wild <b>boars</b> (), <b>culled</b> during the hunting season, were {{obtained}} in three areas of Catalonia (NE Spain) : Pyrenees, Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac Natural Park (SLM), and Ports de Tortosa i Beseit National Hunting Reserve (PTB). We investigated {{the presence of}} antibodies against classical swine fever virus (CSFV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine vesicular disease virus (PVDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), porcine influenza A virus (PIV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2), porcine parvovirus (PPV),,, spp., and. Four wild boars were suspicious for CSFV, but the infection was discarded with a virus neutralization test, and infection with a border disease virus was confirmed. Negative results were obtained against ASFV and PVDV. Antibodies were detected against PRRSV (3 %), ADV (0. 8 %), PIV (6. 4 %), PCV 2 (64. 6 %), PPV (54. 7 %), (26. 6 %), (5. 3 %), spp. (11. 3 %), and (43. 5 %). In SLM, we detected a higher seroprevalence for PIV and and a lower seroprevalence for than {{in the other two}} areas. In PTB, seroprevalence was higher for PPV, spp., and PCV 2.

40|$|Summary- A {{study of}} parity-specific {{production}} values for 68 North American swine breeding herds revealed that nearly 10 %of litters {{had less than}} 7 piglets. 1 In a recent Minnesota study of swine production on 84 farms, over 18 %of the <b>boars</b> <b>culled</b> were removed for unspecified reproductive difficulties. 2 No examination of their chromosomes was made. The most common chromosomal abnormalities in swine are chromosome reciprocal translocations (CRT). They result from chromosomal breakage and faulty rearrangement during sperm and eggformation. They have been shown in Europe {{to be an important}} inherited cause of smalllitters. 3 It is estimated that 50 %of boars that sire an average of fewer than 8 liveborn piglets per litter are hypoprolific because of inherited CRT's. There are 33 different CRT'sknown worldwide which, on the average,reduce litter size 30 %- 50 %. These boars have sperm with normal structure and motility. Recently we surveyed PigCHAMP@data from 8203 boars, of which 4412 had six or more monospermic-mated litters. 4 Of these, 165 (3. 7 %) were found to be hypoprolific. This is 25 times higher than the estimated rate of hypoprolificacy found in France, where programs for chromosome testing of breeding stock have been used for approximately 20 years. In another study, the prolificacy of 15 boars that had at least six monospermic matings was determined. 4 Among them we identified one boar with an average of 7. 1 liveborn piglets from single boar/single service matings. When the same sowswere bred with the other 14 boars (cytogenetically normal) the average litter size increased to 10. 8 piglets (Table 1). The affected boar had a 1 / 14 CRT;a large portion of chromosome 14 was added to chromosome 1 (Fig 1). This same 1 / 14 CRT condition was inherited by four of 15 offspring examined from three litters sired by the affected boar. Chromosomalanalyses were carried out on heparinized blood (5 mL Vacutainer @ tube) within 48 hours of collection and kept at room temperature. Conclusion. Swine specialists and producers must become aware that chromosomal abnormalities caus...|$|R
