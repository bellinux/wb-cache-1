Healthy dependency, dysfunctional detachment and destructive overdependence (RPT subscales) were evaluated and correlated with SCL- 90 -R symptom dimensions. Destructive overdependence correlated positively with every SCL- 90 -R psychopathology dimension. On the contrary, healthy dependency correlated negatively with all these SCL- 90 -R dimensions. Gender differences were significant {{with regard to the}} correlation between dysfunctional detachment and paranoid ideation. In women dysfunctional detachment correlated positively with paranoid ideation, whereas in men the resultant correlation was negative and not significant. This gender difference in the relationship between dysfunctional detachment and paranoid ideation may suggest a new line of inquiry on paranoid pathology. Besides, the study explores the SCL- 90 -R psychopathology scores of several clusters of individuals with different profiles of dependency-detachment obtained from the RPT subscale scores...|$|E

Particularly, what we want to <b>ckeck</b> is: Have there been any significant changes in the participants during this training programme? The purpose of this research is also to know if this programme has represented a real alternative to traditional training of physical education teachers, through a democratic system very much interested in social issues. The professional changes undergone by the teachers involved in this study have been the following: •An increase of the profesional autonomy. Teachers device their own curricular materials in their real teaching context. •They have tried to forget about the technical teaching model and use a more active methodology for the total students development. Finally, we have a special interest in finding a more cooperative and democratic type of physical education...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is to <b>ckeck</b> if the star formation efficiency plays a relevant role {{in the evolution of}} the relative abundance N/O. In order to explore this idea, we analyze the evolution of the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio as predicted by a set of computed theoretical models. These models consist of simulated galaxies with different total masses which are evolved assuming different collapse time scales and different star formation efficiencies. The combinations of these two parameters produce different star formation histories, which in turn have, as we show, an important impact on the resulting N/O ratio. Since we want to check the effect of variations in these efficiencies on our models results, the same stellar yield sets are used for all of them. The selected yields have an important contribution of primary nitrogen proceeding from low and intermediate mass stars, which implies that N is ejected with a certain delay with respect to O. It allows to obtain, as we demonstrate, a dispersion of results in the N/O-O/H plane when star formation efficiencies vary which is in general agreement with observations. The model results for the N/O abundance ratio are in good agreement with most observational data trends. In particular, the behavior shown by the extragalactic Hi...|$|E

We analyze the evolution of the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio as predicted by a set of computed theoretical models of simulated galaxies with different total masses which are evolved assuming different collapse time scales and different star formation efficiencies, thus producing different star formation histories. The stellar yield set we use for all of them (Gavilán et al. 2005) have an important contribution of primary nitrogen proceeding from low and intermediate mass stars. It allows to obtain a dispersion of results in the N/O-O/H plane, when star formation efficiencies vary, in general agreement with observations. The model results for the N/O abundance ratio are in good agreement with most observational data trends: the extragalactic H ii regions is well reproduced with present time resulting abundances and the low N/O values estimated for high-redshift objects, as well as the higher and constant values of N/O observed for irregular and dwarf galaxies or halo stars, can be simultaneously obtained with our models at the same low oxygen abundances. We conclude that differences in the star formation history of galaxies and regions within them are a key factor to explain the data in the N/O-O/H plane.

40|$|The thesis shows {{practical}} ways {{of evaluating}} construction costs, which {{are necessary for}} the investor to be informed of expected final value and thus {{be able to make}} decisions about the intent of construction. In this context, we examined the laws and building regulations, which currently deal with the quantity surveying of designer documentation. This is followed by a look at the purpose of quantity surveying, its composition and the importance of its correct formulation due to the potential impact on the change in the contract price. Finally a cpecific construction of a structure is considered with a brief introduction of the site and the comparison of the actual cost of construction with the designer's extimate. Based on the comparison of the final bill and the construction book, the most divergent values of individual items are identified and the cause for divergence is established. When <b>ckecking</b> the quantities set, we used the software CostX, which as proven to be a particularly suitable tool for faster electronic surveying and ease of documentation...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} computer simulations of Kauffman's automata on several graphs {{such as the}} regular square lattice and invasion percolation clusters in order to investigate phase transitions, radial distributions of the mean total damage (dynamical exponent z) and propagation speeds of the damage when one adds a damaging agent, nicknamed "strange man". Despite {{the increase in the}} damaging efficiency, we have not observed any appreciable change at the transition threshold to chaos neither for the short-range nor for the small-world case on the square lattices when the strange man is added in comparison to when small initial damages are inserted in the system. The propagation speed of the damage cloud until touching the border of the system in both cases obeys a power law with a critical exponent α that strongly depends on the lattice. Particularly, we have <b>ckecked</b> the damage spreading when some connections are removed on the square lattice and when one considers special invasion percolation clusters (high boundary-saturation clusters). It is seen that the propagation speed in these systems is quite sensible to the degree of dilution. Comment: AMS-LaTeX v 1. 2, 7 pages with 14 figures Encapsulated Postscript, to be publishe...|$|R

The data packet is transmitted in frame that consist of f 1 ag, header, payload, and frame <b>ckeck</b> sequence Connection orientation is a major feature of frame relay. The features of those network that it exploits are the low error-rate characteristic and software-based switching. Frame relay combines the advantage of leased line, circuit transport, and packet transport by offers the user the low end-to-end delay and ability to handle bursty data. Frame relay provides three types of virtual circuit: permanent, multicast, and switched. The basic mechanism of frame relay is if there is the problem by handling a frame {{so it will be}} discard. The discard frame is caused by bit error or congestion. The discard frame is marked DE (discard eligible). Recover from error is responsibility of end-user eguipment not by network where if number sequence of frame is losed, receiver will request retransmission. This function occurs in layer 4 of OS!. Important thing that shoud be known by consumer is CIR (committed information rate) that representate warrant minimum bandwidth that can be found by user in busy hour traffic condition.
