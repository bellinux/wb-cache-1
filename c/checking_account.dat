5|$|Vick {{has been}} a {{principal}} in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with after-school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization came just {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program. The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to credit}} cards, each {{merchant}} had to evaluate each customer's credit history before extending credit. That task is now {{performed by the}} banks which assume the credit risk. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer {{does not have enough}} cash on hand or in a <b>checking</b> <b>account.</b> Extra turnover is generated {{by the fact that the}} customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance.

25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|E

Qapital directs each of its users to set savings goals, then automatically transfers money from their <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> to an account for savings, when a rule established in the app is met. It uses the [...] "if this then that" [...] (IFTT) rule-based web-service.

Users connect their bank accounts to Qapital, so it knows when purchases are made. When a rule is met, money for savings are transferred to a Qapital account operated in partnership with Lincoln Savings Bank.|$|E

[...] When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts.

[...] Edna remained the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own <b>checking</b> <b>account</b> that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn.
