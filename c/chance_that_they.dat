5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living. This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would ever receive them.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} point of Jewish Law arises in that Rav Yisroel {{raised the question}} how could the Tribe of Reuven have kept the semikhah alive, since they were outside the Land of Israel and the semikhah can be granted only in Land of Israel. He answered that since the Bnei Reuven had been distant {{from the rest of}} Klal Yisroel before this ruling had been accepted, {{there is no reason to}} assume that they accepted this ruling, and there was a <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were still keeping the institution of semikhah alive.|$|E

25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the presynaptic cell is increased. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{finished}} second in Round 4 of the Americas 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying, losing only to Argentina, and qualify for the World Cup. Canada finished third in their pool (with France, Fiji and Namibia), winning their match against Namibia but losing their other two fixtures. The victory against Namibia was uncharacteristic for Canada, as they ran the score up to 72–11, {{one of their most}} lopsided victories, as there was a very slight statistical <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could have advanced on points scored. This trashing was the one bright light in an otherwise gloomy and disappointing 1999 World Cup performance.|$|E

25|$|Despite these {{spectacular}} successes, Slim was uneasy. Although Messervy {{and several}} of his commanders considered there was a sporting <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might capture Rangoon at the beginning of May, Fourteenth Army's supply lines were strained to the limit by the rapid advances. The monsoon was imminent, and the heavy rains would make many roads impassable and make resupply by air difficult. It was feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon to the last man, as they had done elsewhere in the Pacific Theatre, as at Manila in the Philippines. Japanese forces defended the city for a month before they were eliminated. 100,000 civilians died during the fighting, and the city of Manila was left in ruins.|$|E
25|$|Ray Lindwall {{returned}} to Test bowling by dismissing Len Hutton {{with a beautiful}} swinging ball which moved from middle stump to flick {{the edge of his}} bat and was caught by Colin McCool at first slip. Bill Edrich joined Cyril Washbrook and together they took the score to 147/1 {{by the end of the}} second day, Edrich hit 10 fours in his 85 while Washbrook struck only 1 four in his 54. Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised £1 a run if he made a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and looked good for a big score. When he {{returned to}} the England dressing room he complained that he had hit the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Jack Ikin (48) and Norman Yardley (61) dug in for two over hours and restored the innings with a stand of 113 until McCool (2/53) bowled the vice-captain and Dooland (4/69) removed Ikin and Voce with successive balls. With England 298/8 there was still a <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could overtake Australia for the first time in the series. Godfrey Evans made 17 and added 26 with Alec Bedser who swung the bat for 27 not out making 27 runs for the last wicket with Wright until the spinner was bowled by Johnson and England were out for 351, 14 runs behind.|$|E
500|$|The {{criticism}} of Vrba {{stems from the}} tension between what Ruth Linn calls survivor and expert discourse.

When writing about himself and his personal experiences, Vrba's account is an important and true one, Bauer wrote, but he argued that Vrba was not justified in seeing himself as an expert on Holocaust history. Vrba often dismissed the opinion of historians. Regarding the numbers killed at Auschwitz, he said that Bauer and historian Raul Hilberg did not know enough about the history of Auschwitz.|$|E

In his book Project Alberta, Harlow Russ, a civilian scientist with Project Alberta who was part of the Fat man bomb assembly team, recounts that during the flight he asked Uanna why all the military people on the plane were armed, and Uanna informed him that while the islands that they were stopping at were held by US forces, they would be flying over or close to other islands that were still occupied by the Japanese. Because of the remote <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be engaged by Japanese aircraft or anti-aircraft guns, they flew over these islands at night.|$|E

T. Cooper Clark, a fellow of both the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, in his article [...] "The XXth International Congress of Americanists", described an expedition that he took to the site, and claimed that [...] "the lines are only formed by erosion" [...] and that [...] "the very inaccessibility of the spot at once dismisses the idea of such marks being the work of man." [...] In the book Geomorphological Landscapes of the World, it is suggested that the [...] "face" [...] of the structure is the result of differential weathering {{at the point where the}} granite cap of the mountain meets the gneiss layer. In August 2000, a group of geologists travelled to the summit of Pedra da Gávea with equipment to determine whether the mountain possessed any hollow spaces; their results showed that the structure was solid and that there were no internal tunnels or burial tombs. The group also concluded that the [...] "inscriptions" [...] were just vertical grooves that had been worn into the less resistant parts of the stone.|$|E
