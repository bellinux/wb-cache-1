5|$|BK Chicken Fries are a {{fried chicken}} product {{sold by the}} {{international}} fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At {{the time of their}} introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.|$|E

50|$|In some instances, {{retail sales}} of <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> may provide higher profit margins for food {{retailers}} {{compared to the}} profits attained from sales of the individual ingredients that {{are present in the}} <b>convenience</b> <b>foods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Convenience</b> <b>foods</b> {{can include}} {{products}} such as candy; beverages such as soft drinks, juices and milk; fast food; nuts, fruits and vegetables in fresh or preserved states; processed meats and cheeses; and canned {{products such as}} soups and pasta dishes.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and {{the total}} phenol content (TPC) of basic <b>foods</b> and <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> were analysed along the different steps of food preparation. The major loss of TEAC happens during the processing of <b>convenience</b> <b>foods.</b> A database has been constituted on the TEAC and the TPC of basic and <b>convenience</b> <b>foods,</b> commonly consumed by the French population. It showed that the addition of ingredients with high antioxidant activity to a complex preparation contributes {{to an increase in}} the total antioxidant capacity, but not in a proportional way. Differences between expected and measured values are 31 % for two ingredients and 14 % for three ingredients. For the TPC, the increase corresponds to the sum of the TPC of the ingredients. It also showed that microwave reheating and food storage, in most cases, did not lead to variations on TEAC and TPC of <b>convenience</b> <b>foods.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{prepared}} frozen meals {{first became}} {{widely available in}} the late 1970s. Since then they have steadily grown in popularity with the increased ownership of home freezers and microwave ovens. Demographic trends such as the growth of smaller households have also influenced the sale of this {{and other types of}} <b>convenience</b> <b>food.</b> In 2003, the United Kingdom spent £5 million a day on ready meals, and was the largest consumer in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Part of the product's format {{was in its}} packaging, {{which was}} {{designed}} to fit in a car cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States at the time. Since most of the fast food industry's business is take-out or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> purchaser to drive and eat with little effort. With the introduction of the BK Chicken Fries, BK began adapting some of its other product packaging so that it could also be placed in an automotive cup holder. In addition to the Chicken Fries container, the company added a trademarked and patented, round French fry container which it calls the [...] "FryPod", which is a paper cup made from 50 percent recycled materials that is also designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition hosted by the Quick Service Restaurant division of the Foodservice and Packaging Institute in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 20th century, semi-processed ground meat cutlets were {{introduced}} in the USSR. Colloquially known as Mikoyan cutlets (named after Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan), these were cheap pork or beef cutlet-shaped patties which resembled industrially produced American beef burgers. Some varieties bore names of well known Russian restaurant dishes but they had little in common with the original dishes. In particular, a variety of a pork patty was called [...] "Kiev cutlet". Since the late Soviet times, [...] "real" [...] chicken Kiev cutlets have been offered in Russia as <b>convenience</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} the trend back to open kitchens (and a {{foundation}} of the [...] "kitchen object" [...] philosophy) is changes in how food is prepared. Whereas prior to the 1950s most cooking started out with raw ingredients and a meal had to be prepared from scratch, the advent of frozen meals and pre-prepared <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> changed the cooking habits of many people, who consequently used the kitchen less and less. For others, who followed the [...] "cooking as a social act" [...] trend, the open kitchen had the advantage {{that they could be}} with their guests while cooking, and for the [...] "creative cooks" [...] it might even become a stage for their cooking performance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Convenience</b> <b>foods</b> {{are usually}} {{discouraged}} in weight loss diets {{as they are}} associated with higher intakes of energy, fat, salt and sugar. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of including <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> in weight loss regimens. Obese adults (131 F, 50 M) were randomly assigned one of three iso-energetic (5, 500 – 7, 500 kJ), weight loss meal patterns – six meals a day (6 D) (n = 61); three meals and three snacks (33 D) (n = 59); and three meals (3 D) (n = 61). Weight and body composition was assessed at baseline and three months using Tanita TBF 300 GS scale. Each diet pattern included <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> as part of options that participants could choose. More choices were available on the plans with more frequent eating occasions. During follow up sessions, limited samples of <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> such as biscuits, soups, juices, pre-packaged cheese and crackers, cooking stock and crisps, were offered to participants at no cost. Popular fast food suggestions were also provided as optional alternatives to fresh prepared selections. Preliminary data at 3 months (one way analysis of variance) showed more positive outcomes with small frequent meals with respect to weight − 6. 5 % 6 D vs. − 4. 8 % 33 D, − 4. 9 % 3 D p = 0. 041, and fat weight loss − 8. 3 % 6 D vs. − 2. 9 % 33 D and − 4. 8 % 3 D p = 0. 048. This suggests that including <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> in a weight loss diet does not negatively impact on weight and body composition. Further analyses are required to determine any long term effects of including <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> in weight loss diets...|$|R

[...] Convenience foods and restaurants are similar in that they save time.

40|$|Trends in {{the types}} of foods Americans {{purchase}} are evident just by looking around the grocery store. Foods stuffs requiring extensive preparation are being replaced by convenience products that require little time, energy, or preparation.

The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether the demand for <b>convenience</b> <b>foods</b> is growing around the globe, and if so, to identify the various drivers responsible for the increase in demand. Secondary data were collected for 67 different countries on the quantity and value for four different <b>food</b> types of <b>convenience</b> food: frozen processed foods, chilled processed foods, meal replacement products, and sweet and savory snacks. Data were also found on potential drivers of convenience such as age, income, food budget, etc. All data had 10 years of information (1998 to 2007) and were collected through databases from Euromonitor or the World Bank and analyzed using regression analysis.
