25|$|A literal {{reading of}} the above {{provision}} shows <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purpose of section 298A is to preserve public tranquility, and only to criminalize acts that incite racial and religious disharmony.

The only significant difference is that a violation of section 298A results in the commission of a criminal offence, while criminal liability attaches under the MRHA only when a restraining order has been breached.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the Earth was not only {{discussed}} in scholarly works written in Latin; it was also treated in works written in vernacular languages or dialects and intended for wider audiences. The Norwegian book Konungs Skuggsjá, from around 1250, states <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earth is spherical—and that there is night {{on the opposite side}} of the Earth when there is daytime in Norway. The author also discusses the existence of antipodes—and he notes that (if they exist) they see the Sun in the north of the middle of the day, and that they experience seasons opposite those of people in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|The Wills name {{indicates}} <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hall {{owes its}} existence {{to a family}} fortune derived from the tobacco trade in the American Republic. The tobacco trade was hugely important to whole city of Bristol in the 18th century when slave-produced tobacco mostly came from plantations in America. American tobacco was produced by slave labour until 1865, and this included plantations owned by the Wills family. The slave trade was formally abolished in 1807, although the Act did not abolish slavery itself. The founding donation by the Wills family to the University was made in 1908. There is debate {{in the city and}} University of Bristol about historical links with slavery. Some advocate rescinding all nomenclature tainted by such trade. Others take the view that names may stay but the implications of historical donations must be interrogated and challenged.|$|E
25|$|General Konev held {{a conference}} at his {{headquarters}} at Boltushki on 15 January with his commanders {{and their political}} commissars {{to pass on the}} orders received from Stavka. The initial attack was to be conducted by Konev's own 2nd Ukrainian Front from the southeast by 53rd Army and 4th Guards Army, with 5th Guards Tank Army to exploit penetrations supported by 5th Air Army, to be joined in progress by 52nd Army, 5th Guards Cavalry Corps and 2nd Tank Army. Additionally, from Vatutin's 1st Ukrainian Front, 27th and 40th Armies were to be deployed from the northwest, with 6th Tank Army to exploit penetrations supported by 2nd Air Army. Many of these formations had received an inflow of new personnel. Red Army planning further included extensive deception operations that the Soviets claimed were successful; however, the German 8th Army war diary shows <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German staffs were concerned with the threat at hand.|$|E
25|$|However, with a Militant-dominated Labour {{council in}} Liverpool having been elected in 1983, Heffer found {{increasing}} trouble in his constituency. The Liverpool Labour Party adopted Militant's policy of a 'deficit budget'. This included no cuts to jobs and services, and no rent and rates increases higher than inflation, {{and a promise}} to increase services and confront central government with the £270 million stolen, it claimed, in grants from the city since the Conservatives {{came to power in}} 1979. It was voted into office by a landslide. The administration produced a financial crisis, since the budget, set in April by the outgoing Tory-Liberal coalition, included unallocated cuts of £6 million, including 1000 job losses, which the administration cancelled, and an extra 1000 jobs had been promised instead. When the council met on 29 March 1984 it was told <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Militant proposed 'deficit budget' contained an illegal £30 million deficit, but no alternative could get a majority and it went through. All but seven Labour councillors stood by the budget, and Heffer supported the council in its demands of government and after a series of meetings with the Secretary of State for the Environment Patrick Jenkin, the government eventually gave way and allowed practically all of the budget.|$|E

[...] Her goals in this article and its successors were to propose a well-defined testable model, to work out the consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally. [...] In these goals, she succeeded; however, within a few years, experiments and further modeling showed that the cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} {{testing of}} the new cores in the Sandstone tests had a profound effect. Practically every component of the old weapons was rendered obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, Bradbury had halted production of the old cores, and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on the Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. The more efficient use of fissionable material would increase the nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949. The Mark III bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950. At the same time, new production plants were coming online and the Wigner effect problem had been solved. By May 1951, plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947, while uranium-235 production had increased eight-fold. The Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, saw <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> era of scarcity was over. He now [...] "recommended {{that we should be}} thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the case}} of the Mertens' water monitor, more {{commonly}} known as Merten's water monitor, there was only one region that was monitored, but over the course of 18 months. This region is located 70 kilometers south of Darwin, at the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] Within the Manton Dam Recreation Area, there were 14 sites set up to survey the population of water monitors, measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one. Seven surveys were conducted, each of which ran for four weeks and included 16 site visits, where each site was sampled twice per day for two consecutive days throughout the 4 weeks. Each site visit occurred between 7:30–10:30 AM, [...] and 4:00–7:00 PM, when Varanus mertensi can be viewed sunbathing on the shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore. The whole project lasted from December 2004 to May 2006, and unveiled a total of 194 sightings of Varanus mertensi in 1568 site visits. Of the seven surveys, abundance was highest during the second survey, which took place in February 2005, two months into the project. Following this measurement, the abundance declined in the next 4 surveys, before declining sharply after the second to last survey in February 2006. In the final survey taken in May 2006, there were only two Varanus mertensi observed. Cane toads were first recorded in the region of study during the second survey during February 2005, also when the water monitor abundance was at its highest {{over the course of the}} study. Numbers of the cane toad population stayed low for the next year after introduction, and then skyrocketed to its peak in the last survey during May 2006. When you compare the two populations side by side one can see <b>clearly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> onset of the cane toads had an immediate negative impact on the Varanus mertensi, as their population began to drop in February 2005, which was when the first cane toads entered the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] At the end of the study, some scattered population of water monitors remained in the upper sites of the Manton Dam, which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within Manton Dam, but a complete extinction of the population did not occur.|$|E
