25|$|Jewish Bolshevism, {{also known}} as Judeo-Bolshevism, is an antisemitic and anti-communist canard which alleges that the Jews were at {{the origin of the}} Russian Revolution and held the primary power among Bolsheviks. Similarly, the Jewish Communism theory implies that Jews have been {{dominating}} the Communist movements in the world. It is similar to the ZOG conspiracy theory, which asserts that Jews control world politics. The expressions have been used as a <b>catchword</b> for the assertion that Communism is a Jewish conspiracy.|$|E

Lyrics of the song uses Mansfield's <b>catchword</b> [...] "divoon", and refers to her heart-shaped swimming pool, her love of champagne and parties, and to the grisly automobile accident which claimed her life in 1967. In Grok, a novel by Tom Maremaa, a character plays the CD and asks, [...] "Yes, kiss them for me [...] I may be delayed." [...] Too Hot To Handle, the UFO song considered {{to one of the}} top 500 heavy metal songs, takes its title from a Jayne Mansfield film. Mansfield is also alluded in the song [...] "The Actor" [...] by Robbie Williams, from the album [...] "Rudebox". Alternative rock band The Chills released [...] "16 Heartthrobs" [...] as a memorial to Mansfield. In 1997, Courtney Love of the alternative rock band Hole used a photo of Mansfield's wrecked car in the album artwork for the group's compilation album, My Body, the Hand Grenade.|$|E

In Chicago, for example, the coming of prohibition at the end of World War I encouraged biological industries to create opportunities for new fermentation products, in particular a market for nonalcoholic drinks. Emil Siebel, the son of the founder of the Zymotechnic Institute, broke away from his father's company to establish his own called the [...] "Bureau of Biotechnology," [...] which specifically offered expertise in fermented nonalcoholic drinks.|$|E

This allowed rapid turnaround and immediate prototyping, allowing users to author custom solutions to problems with their own personalized interface.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} features of the Masoretic notes in the Leningrad Codex (L) which up till now have never been published, are the <b>catchwords</b> which are attached to many Masorah parva (Mp) doublet notes. Most Mp doublet notes are simply marked by the numeral bO “two, ” which indicates that an identical word or phrase occurs somewhere else in the Hebrew Bible (HB). The reader is given no indication as to where that parallel doublet might occur. However, a special group of over 500 doublets have <b>catchwords</b> attached to the numeral indicating in what specific verse the parallel doublet occurs. In effect, the <b>catchwords</b> serve as memory aids explicitly reminding the reader where the second form of the parallel doublet is to be found. These <b>catchwords</b> are written in the margins of L but surprisingly were never included in previous editions of Biblia Hebraica (neither in BHK 3 nor in BHS).

He was more feared than beloved, and, if not absolutely of a tyrannical disposition, was accounted haughty, violent, and vindictive. It pressed on Nigel's heart, that he himself, though he could not conceive how, nor why, might be the original cause of the resentment of the Duke against his benefactor. The others made their comments in whispers, until the sounds reached Ramsay, who had not heard a word of what had previously passed, but, plunged in those studies with which he connected every other incident and event, took up only the <b>catchword,</b> and replied,--"The Duke--the Duke of Buckingham--George Villiers--ay--I have spoke with Lambe about him." ...|$|E

Not a shred of self-respect is left to it. It is made the central figure of every farce, danced and sung round in every music-hall, yelled at by gallery, guffawed at by stalls.
