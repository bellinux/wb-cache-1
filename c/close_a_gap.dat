5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15–16 mya. This makes Apeomyoides the {{youngest}} known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> in the known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in Nevada and Arikareeomys in Nebraska. Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E
5|$|Two events then aided {{the final}} advance. First, to lessen {{frontline}} infantry casualties, {{it was decided}} to barrage remaining German strongpoints with 155 mm guns. Secondly, to assist the 1st Infantry Division, a battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment, US 28th Infantry Division, had been moved up from the V Corps sector on 18 October to <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> between forward 26th Infantry Regiment elements within the city. The defensive mission of this new battalion was changed on 19–20 October to closely support the urban assault, participating as the depleted regiment's missing third battalion. On 21 October, soldiers of the 26th Infantry Regiment, supported by the reinforced battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment finally conquered central Aachen; that day also marked the surrender of the last German garrison, in the Hotel Quellenhof, ending the battle for the city.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of August 19, the ROK 11th and 13th Regiments {{launched}} counterattacks along the ridges with some gains, however the fight continued to produce heavy casualties for both sides. Walker ordered another reserve unit, a battalion of the ROK 10th Regiment, to the Taegu front to <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> between the ROK 1st and 6th Divisions. Later in the day, Walker also ordered the US 23rd Infantry Regiment, under command of Colonel Paul L. Freeman, Jr., to move up and establish a defense perimeter around the 8th and 37th Field Artillery Battalions at their positions [...] north of Taegu, {{to protect them from}} North Korean attack. This was the only occasion during the war that two US regiments were assigned to a South Korean command. The 3rd Battalion, 23rd Infantry took up a defensive position around the artillery while the 2nd Battalion occupied a defensive position on the road behind the 27th Infantry. The next day the two battalions exchanged places. South Korean troops, suffering losses from the fighting, began recruiting students and civilians from nearby villages to fight.|$|E

2500|$|The {{buildings}} were transferred from Spanish to Mexican control in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence. [...] Soldiers continued to garrison the complex until December 1835, when General Martín Perfecto de Cos surrendered to Texian forces during the Texas Revolution. In the few months that Cos supervised the troops garrisoned in San Antonio, he had ordered many {{improvements to the}} Alamo. Cos's men likely demolished the four stone arches that were to support a future chapel dome. [...] The debris from these was used to build a ramp to the apse of the chapel building. [...] There, the Mexican soldiers placed three cannon, which could fire over {{the walls of the}} roofless building. [...] To <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> between the church and the barracks (formerly the convent building) and the south wall, the soldiers built a palisade. When Cos retreated, he left behind 19cannons, including a 16-pounder.|$|E

2500|$|A {{considerable}} tactical advantage {{had been}} gained by the French, who had regained [...] of ground. The new German defences around the area, were on ground overlooked from the Lorette Spur, were more costly to defend and made Vimy Ridge {{more vulnerable to}} attack. The apparent lost opportunity on 9 May, when Vimy Ridge was captured in the first rush, led the French army commanders to conclude that {{more of the same}} could achieve a breakthrough if better organised, which formed the basis of the planning for the autumn offensives in Artois and Champagne. Pétain wrote that the attack on 9 May showed that a breakthrough was possible and that it could be achieved by careful preparation of communication trenches, jumping-off trenches and assembly positions, if the German defences were carefully reconnoitred and sufficiently bombarded by artillery. Since the defenders could <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> quickly it would be necessary to maintain momentum, with reserve troops following up the attacking force closely. Attacks in open country were preferable to being bogged down in fighting for obstacles like villages and woods and the attack should be on a broad front, to allow centres of resistance to be outflanked and to disperse German fire power over a wider area.|$|E
