[...] Parametric estimating (also called parametric formulas) is a mathematical representation of cost relationships, that provide a logical and predictable correlation between the physical or functional <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> and its resultant cost. Larry R. Dysert In the mathematic model, the dependent variables (cost) are being regressed on the independent variables (cost drivers), which are physical, operational or performance characteristics associated with the project to be estimated. Pursuing decent results, the dependent cost variable needs to be regressed on multiple cost drivers. Additionally to that, this type of analysis avails itself from long-term data collection, that is, {{in order to}} create reliable cost relationship models, historical data and frameworks are required, which also have to be applicable to the new cost prediction project. Several factors have to be regarded in order {{to determine whether or not}} the previously used framework stays applicable to the new project, for instance, the technology used in the production or service process as well as changes in the legal framework.|$|E

Four case studies of service-producing project networks show that relational interaction processes tend to change over time – shifting between the dimensions of consent and negotiation. Project networks seeking to acquire legitimacy are characterised by consent-based interaction processes such as mapping by rhetoric and maintaining an element of vagueness. Even legitimate project networks are, on the other hand, characterised by negotiation-based interaction processes such as meetings between the representatives of different interests. Thus, actors in different types of project network adopt different interaction strategies in managing project networks with a view to creating legitimacy or mutual commitment...|$|E

30|$|When the ex ante {{control chart}} {{is used in}} {{practice}} concerns may arise that {{must be considered in}} advance. In the first place, it is good to say that, in this paper, fictitious projects with simulated data have been used to measure the capability of the ex ante control chart. Although, the results reveal that this chart has a relatively reliable performance for all possible scenarios that can occur in practice, however, the projects may differ while having some commonalities. For example, in reality, sometimes a small change in one <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> (such as uncertainty) may make a critical difference in the final status of the project. Therefore, the performance analysis of the ex ante control chart can be extended to the real project data sets with empirical project data. To better understand and improve the performance of the ex ante control chart, interested readers are encouraged to implement the proposed control chart in their projects. In addition, operations research and scheduling research group has cleverly made <b>an</b> excellent empirical <b>project</b> database which is freely available at www.projectmanagement.ugent.be.

40|$|TCD-CS- 2000 - 10 In {{this paper}} we assess the {{applicability}} of case-based reasoning to the difficult problem of early software project cost estimation. We conclude that a comprehensive case representation is not available early in the project and suggest instead that the objective should be risk assessment rather than cost estimation. In reaching this conclusion the existing techniques for cost estimation are discussed and evaluated. A case representation capturing the available predictive features for early estimation is identified and presented. The lack of features to predict size early in the development life cycle indicates a limitation of the conventional CBR model ? and indeed any knowledge-based approach. If a complete problem representation is not available an automated reasoning mechanism {{will not be able}} to produce good cost estimates. The alternative we propose is to focus on a measure called the productivity coefficient rather than the expected effort. The productivity coefficient gives a measure of the potential risk revealed by the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> compared with previous project experiences.

40|$|Digital Humanities is a {{relatively}} young but very productive discipline. In its short history scholars have produced thousands of digital resources which have been funded by governments, philanthropic bodies and universities. In the UK alone, over 250 digital humanities projects have been funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) since 1998. Yet what happens to such resources after completion is poorly understood. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some projects become well known but others have been relatively quickly forgotten.

It is vital for any manager to decide a trade-off between these conflicting objectives {{and they will be}} benefited of any scientific decision support tool. Our work will try to determine optimal solutions (rather than a single optimal solution) from which the project manager will select his desirable choice to run the project. In this paper, the problem in project scheduling notated as (1,T|cpm,disc,mu|curve:quality,time,cost) will be studied. The problem is multi-objective and the purpose is finding the Pareto optimal front of time, cost and quality of a project (curve:quality,time,cost), whose activities belong to a start to finish activity relationship network (cpm) and they can be done in different possible modes (mu) which are non-continuous or discrete (disc), and each mode has a different cost, time and quality. The project is constrained to a non-renewable resource i. e. money (1,T). Because the problem is NP-Hard, to solve the problem, a meta-heuristic is developed based on a version of genetic algorithm specially adapted to solve multi-objective problems namely FastPGA.
