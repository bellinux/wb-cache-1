60|$|As, however, {{differences}} of fertility slide {{into one another}} by insensible gradations; and {{differences of}} accessibility, that is, of distance from markets do the same; and since there is land so barren {{that it could not}} pay for its cultivation at any price; it is evident that, whatever the price may be, there must in any extensive region be some land which at that price will just pay the wages of the cultivators, and yield to the capital employed the ordinary profit, and no more. Until, therefore, the price rises higher, or until some improvement raises that particular land to a higher place in the scale of fertility, it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> any rent. It is evident, however, that the community needs the produce of this quality of land; since, if the lands more fertile or better situated than it could have sufficed to supply the wants of society, the price would not have risen so high as to render its cultivation profitable. This land, therefore, will be cultivated; and we may lay it down as a principle that, so long as any of the land of a country which is fit for cultivation, and not withheld from it by legal or other factitious obstacles, is not cultivated, the worst land in actual cultivation (in point of fertility and situation together) pays no rent.|$|E
6000|$|The law of rent, in the {{economic}} sense, operates in the United [...] States as truly as elsewhere, {{although there is no}} separate class [...] of landlords here. With us, almost all land is owned by the [...] cultivator; so that two functions, those of the landlord and [...] farmer, are both united in one person. Although one payment is [...] made, it is still just as distinctly made up of two parts, one of [...] which is a payment to the owner for the superior quality of his [...] soil, and the other a payment (to the same person, if the owner is [...] the cultivator) of profit on the farmer’s working capital. Land [...] which in the United States will only return enough to pay a profit [...] on this capital <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> any rent. And land which can pay more [...] than a profit on this working capital, returns that excess as [...] rent, even if the farmer is also the owner and landlord. The [...] principle which regulates the amount of that excess—which is the [...] essential point—is the principle which determines the amount of [...] economic rent, and it holds true in the United States or Finland, [...] provided only that different grades of land are called into [...] cultivation. The governing principle is the same, no matter [...] whether a payment is made to one man as profit and to another as [...] rent, or whether the two payments are made to the same man in two [...] capacities. It has been urged that the law of rent does not hold [...] in the United States, because “the price of grain and other [...] agricultural produce has not risen in proportion to the increase [...] of our numbers, as it ought to have done if Ricardo’s theory were [...] true, but has fallen, since 1830, though since that time our [...] population has been more than tripled.”(181) This overlooks the [...] fact that we have not even yet taken up all our best agricultural [...] lands, so that for some products the law of diminishing [...] productiveness has not yet shown itself. The reason is, that the [...] extension of our railway system has only of late years brought the [...] really good grain-lands into cultivation. The fact that there has [...] been no rise in agricultural products is due to the enormous [...] extent of marvelously fertile grain-lands in the West, and to the [...] cheapness of transportation from those districts to the seaboard.|$|E

25|$|Services {{in rural}} areas are {{provided}} by thousands of community-based water committees. According to a 2000 World Bank report, at that time communities were insufficiently involved in water system design and government and donor-supported schemes usually fell short of developing effective community construction and management mechanisms. Water committees were imposed local institutions, often suffering from internal management conflicts, leading to negligence of operation and maintenance which resulted in frequent break-downs. More than 50 percent of systems were broken down. Systems were often over-designed, and users <b>can</b> <b>not</b> afford <b>paying</b> {{the full cost of}} operating the schemes, let alone producing an operating surplus for the purchase of spare parts and major repairs. In addition, political and tribal leaders frequently demanded that the government allocates its resources to particular projects, thereby interrupting—even abandoning—the work of started schemes.

Little was done in the area of hygiene education, safe drinking water storage, and wastewater and excreta disposal.|$|R

6000|$|Soils are {{of every}} grade: some, which if cultivated, might replace [...] the capital, but give no profit; some give a slight {{but not an}} [...] {{ordinary}} profit; some, the ordinary profit. That is, “there is a [...] point up {{to which it is}} profitable to cultivate, and beyond which [...] it is not profitable to cultivate.

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} {{is that there}} is little empirical support in favor of the domain-specific theory. Leading evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby have found that performance on the selection task is content-dependent: People find it easier to detect violations of [...] "if-then” rules when the rules can be interpreted as cheating on a social contract. From this Cosmides and Tooby and other evolutionary psychologists concluded that the mind consisted of domain-specific, context-sensitive modules (including a cheater-detection module). Critics have suggested that Cosmides and Tooby use untested evolutionary assumptions to eliminate rival reasoning theories and that their conclusions contain inferential errors. Davies et al., for example, have argued that Cosmides and Tooby did not succeed in eliminating the general-purpose theory because the adapted Wason selection task they used tested only one specific aspect of deductive reasoning and failed to examine other general-purpose reasoning mechanisms (e.g., reasoning based on syllogistic logic, predicate logic, modal logic, and inductive logic etc.). Furthermore, Cosmides and Tooby use rules that incorrectly represent genuine social exchange situations. Specifically, they posit that someone who received a benefit and does <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> the cost is cheating. However, in real-life social exchange situations people <b>can</b> benefit and <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> without cheating (as in the case of receiving gifts or benefiting from charity).|$|R
50|$|The {{fight against}} {{unemployment}} was a multifaceted struggle for jobs, monetary relief, {{and an end}} to evictions. Due to lack of jobs and unemployment, one of the most immediate result was mass evictions. The Party organized numerous mass actions and protests in an effort to organize and raise money to provide relief to starving workers. One protest leaflet read, “white and colored workers are being evicted from their homes and thrown out on the streets to shift for themselves. Gas and water is sic being cut off because the unemployed workers <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> their bills.” One Metal Workers Industrial League mass meeting was planned to organize unemployed steel workers and call for an end to evictions, immediate relief, free light and heat for the city's jobless, and to reaffirm their support for a Communist-sponsored social insurance bill that proposed minimum cash assistance of $25 dollars per week to all unemployed. The protest drew over 2,500 people. However, it was postponed when Harry Jackson was detained by police. On December 16, 1930 an eighteen-year-old black Young Communist League (YCL) activist, Joe Burton, took leadership of a spontaneous protest demonstration of over 5,000 workers. Burton attempted to lead demonstrators in an action to storm the lobby of Hotel Morris and demand jobs or immediate relief, but police intervened and dispersed the protest.|$|E
