Sable points, Seal <b>points,</b> Blue <b>Points,</b> <b>Chocolate</b> <b>Points,</b> Lilac <b>Points,</b> <b>Siamese,</b> Pearl, and Sallander do not have the ch gene, which can be seen because they lack the red eyes of true pointed white rabbits. Those colors are created by the cchl, cchd, or cchm gene in {{conjunction}} with the e gene. Pointed White rabbits were first seen in the Himalayan breed, and are now seen in the Californian breed, but are accepted varieties in many breeds, including the French Angora, English Angora, Satin Angora, Jersey Wooly, Netherland Dwarf, Holland Lop, Mini Rex, Rex, Satin, Mini Lop, and American Fuzzy Lop, and it is a color in development in Mini Satins. No pointed white Rabbit can produce orange pigment, the points are always black, blue, chocolate or lilac, sometimes in conjunction with white agouti, marten, broken, Vienna, or harlequin patterns, but these are not colors recognized for showing. All pointed white rabbits have red eyes.|$|R
5000|$|In the USA, the {{imported}} kittens {{continued to be}} cross bred with the <b>Chocolate</b> and Seal <b>Point</b> <b>Siamese,</b> producing only <b>Chocolate</b> or <b>pointed</b> offspring, with the breeders selectively breeding for only self brown kittens. Genetic diversity quickly resolved any defects that were seen in the early imports. The breeders in the USA desired to maintain {{the look of the}} cats that were imported and bred specifically for brown offspring. Thus, the cats in the United States have a different look than the cats being bred in England. The American breeders focused on maintaining the unique head shape and did not breed for extremes. This American bred version was moderate in every way, with a rich, warm mahogany color that consistently produced like offspring. In 1964, the Havana Brown was accepted for Championship status in the worlds largest feline registry, The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA).|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s, a cat, {{owned by}} Siamese cat breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, {{produced}} {{a litter of}} Siamese kittens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three of the kittens had unique markings, consisting of white points and feet. Intrigued by their looks, she began working to breed cats like them, using seal <b>point</b> <b>Siamese</b> with bicolor American Shorthairs. The offspring of those cats lacked the <b>Siamese</b> <b>points,</b> but by breeding the offspring to Siamese cats, the desired look was accomplished. Hinds-Daugherty named the breed [...] "Snowshoe" [...] because of their white feet. Hinds-Daugherty promoted the Snowshoe at local cats shows, though they were not recognized at the time. Hinds-Daughtery eventually abandoned the Snowshoe breeding program, and it was taken up by Vikki Olander.|$|R

5000|$|Amber {{champagne}} {{is produced}} {{by the action of}} champagne on a bay coat. The coat is gold with <b>chocolate</b> <b>points.</b> Just as there are varying shades of bay, the gold body coat may vary in shade as well. The legs are often lighter than the mane and tail, and the colored points may be difficult to see. The mane and tail may also have [...] "frosting" [...] or light edges, a trait that also occurs in bay duns and some buckskins. Amber champagne can be confused with buckskin or bay dun.|$|R

5000|$|The colorpoint {{pattern is}} most {{commonly}} associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter {{version of the same}} color {{on the rest of the}} body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal <b>points</b> (dark brown), <b>chocolate</b> <b>points</b> (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a temperature sensitive mutation in one of the enzymes in the metabolic pathway from tyrosine to pigment, such as melanin; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.|$|R
5000|$|Tonkinese [...] - [...] {{originally}} {{a cross between}} a Siamese cat and a Burmese. Tonkinese × Tonkinese matings can produce kittens with Burmese sepia pattern, <b>Siamese</b> <b>pointed</b> pattern, or a Tonkinese mink pattern (which is something in between the first two, with less pattern contrast than the Siamese but greater than the Burmese); often with aqua eyes.|$|R
50|$|The Tonkinese {{is a true}} crossbreed type, with coat {{color and}} pattern wholly {{dependent}} on whether individuals carry the Siamese or Burmese gene. Breeding two mink Tonkinese cats does not usually yield a full litter of mink kittens, as this intermediate pattern {{is the result of}} having one gene for the Burmese solid pattern and one for the <b>Siamese</b> <b>pointed</b> pattern.|$|R

40|$|Journal ArticleBackground: Two {{theories}} {{explain how}} negative mood primes smoking behaviour. The stimulus-response (S-R) account argues {{that in the}} negative mood state, smoking is experienced as more reinforcing, establishing a direct (automatic) association between the negative mood state and smoking behaviour. By contrast, the incentive learning account argues that in the negative mood state smoking {{is expected to be}} more reinforcing, which integrates with instrumental knowledge of the response required to produce that outcome. Objectives: One differential prediction is that whereas the incentive learning account anticipates that negative mood induction could augment a novel tobacco-seeking response in an extinction test, the S-R account could not explain this effect because the extinction test prevents S-R learning by omitting experience of the reinforcer. Methods: To test this, overnight-deprived daily smokers (n∈=∈ 44) acquired two instrumental responses for tobacco and <b>chocolate</b> <b>points,</b> respectively, before smoking to satiety. Half then received negative mood induction to raise the expected value of tobacco, opposing satiety, whilst the remainder received positive mood induction. Finally, a choice between tobacco and chocolate was measured in extinction to test whether negative mood could augment tobacco choice, opposing satiety, in the absence of direct experience of tobacco reinforcement. Results: Negative mood induction not only abolished the devaluation of tobacco choice, but participants with a significant increase in negative mood increased their tobacco choice in extinction, despite satiety. Conclusions: These findings suggest that negative mood augments drug-seeking by raising the expected value of the drug through incentive learning, rather than through automatic S-R control. MR...|$|R

The temperature sensitive albino genotypes are cbcb Burmese (sepia), cscs <b>Siamese</b> (<b>pointed),</b> and cbcs Tonkinese (mink). The cscs gene can turn a cat's eyes blue due to a reduced number of melanocytes, affecting pigmentation of the eyes. If a cat has the dominant C allele, then the cat is non-albino and full pigment production occurs.|$|R
2500|$|But Burmese {{historian}} Htin Aung strongly {{counters that}} their analyses greatly understate Alaungpaya's genuine concern for his still nascent and unstable rule in Lower Burma, and that Alaungpaya never invaded Arakan as the Arakanese never showed him any hostility, although Sandoway (Thandwe) in southern Arakan {{had sent him}} tribute in 1755. Thant Myint-U also <b>points</b> out the <b>Siamese</b> longstanding policy of keeping [...] "a buffer against their aged-old enemies the Burmese" [...] has extended down to the modern era where families of insurgent Burmese leaders are allowed to live in Thailand, and insurgent armies are free to buy arms, ammunition, and other supplies.|$|R
5000|$|The pointed {{pattern is}} a form of partial albinism, {{resulting}} from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated tyrosinase enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler (< 33 °C) areas of the skin. This results in dark colouration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air through the sinuses. All Siamese kittens, although pure cream or white at birth, develop visible points in {{the first few months of}} life in colder parts of their body. [...] By the time a kitten is four weeks old, the points should be sufficiently clearly distinguishable to recognise which colour they are. Siamese cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult Siamese living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. Originally the vast majority of Siamese had seal (extremely dark brown, almost black) <b>points,</b> but occasionally <b>Siamese</b> were born with [...] "blue" [...] (a cool grey) points, genetically a dilution of seal point; <b>chocolate</b> (lighter brown) <b>points,</b> a genetic variation of seal point; or lilac (pale warm gray) points, genetically a diluted chocolate. These colours were at first considered [...] "inferior" [...] seal points, and were not qualified for showing or breeding. All of these shades were eventually accepted by the breed associations, and became more common through breeding programmes specifically aimed at producing these colours. Later, outcrosses with other breeds developed Siamese-mix cats with points in other cat colours and patterns, including Red and Cream point, lynx (tabby) point, and tortoise-shell ("tortie") point.|$|R

The American Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) had meanwhile officially classified Siamese with the newer red and cream as well as lynx (tabby) and tortoiseshell (or [...] "tortie") patterned points as a separate breed, the Colourpoint Shorthair, and the long-haired cats derived from these colors and patterns were subsequently likewise classified separately as [...] "Javanese", in keeping with the Indonesian island theme.|$|R

Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from the owner who lived behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what {{is now known as}} the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, and a tendency to go limp when picked up, as well as the striking pointed coloration.|$|R
40|$|Global {{localization}} in 3 D point clouds is {{a challenging}} problem of estimating the pose of robots without priori knowledge. In this paper, {{a solution to}} this problem is presented by achieving place recognition and metric pose estimation in the global priori map. Specifically, we present a semi-handcrafted representation learning method for LIDAR <b>point</b> cloud using <b>siamese</b> LocNets, which states the place recognition problem to a similarity modeling problem. With the final learned representations by LocNet, a global localization framework with range-only observations is proposed. To demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our global localization system, KITTI dataset is employed for comparison with other algorithms, and also on our own multi-session datasets collected by long-time running robot to see the performance under semistatic dynamics. The result shows that our system can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. Comment: 8 pages, 17 figs, for ICRA 201...|$|R
50|$|The coat {{is short}} and smooth, with no undercoat. Available colors include solid red, stag red, blue stag red, {{chocolate}} stag red, fawn stag red, as well as black, chocolate, blue, and fawn with tan points or rust points. For showing in the United States, AKC disqualifies all colors but the solid or stag red and the black or <b>chocolate</b> with rust <b>points.</b> The Pinscher-Schnauzer Club, which maintains the standard for showing in Germany, has the same restrictions. In the UK, blue with rust points is allowed in the show ring. White spots larger than half an inch or black spots on the points are disqualifications for showing in most countries. Merle is not an accepted coloring of the breed.|$|R
50|$|The same albino allele that {{produces}} coloured <b>points</b> means that <b>Siamese</b> cats' blue eyes lack a tapetum lucidum, a structure which amplifies dim {{light in the}} eyes of other cats. The mutation in the tyrosinase also results in abnormal neurological connections between the eye and the brain. The optic chiasm has abnormal uncrossed wiring; many early Siamese were cross-eyed to compensate, but like the kinked tails, the crossed eyes have been seen as a fault and due to selective breeding the trait is far less common today. Still this lack of a tapetum lucidum even in uncross-eyed cats causes reduced vision for the cat at night. This trait has led to their dependence and interest in humans, as it affects their hunting ability, a desirable trait for many owners. However, it also makes them vulnerable to urban dangers such as night-time vehicular traffic. Unlike many other blue-eyed white cats, Siamese cats do not have reduced hearing ability.|$|R
