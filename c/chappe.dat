5|$|In 1792, Claude <b>Chappe,</b> a French engineer, {{built the}} first fixed visual {{telegraphy}} system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.|$|E
5|$|The Tour du Guet (Watch Tower), {{situated}} in Calais Nord on the Places d'Armes, {{is one of}} the few surviving pre-war buildings. Dating from 1229, when Philip I, Count of Boulogne, built the fortifications of Calais, it {{is one of the}} oldest monuments of Calais, although the oldest remaining traces date to 1302. It has a height of 35–39 metres (sources differ). An earthquake in 1580 split the tower in two, and at one time it threatened to collapse completely. The tower was repaired in 1606, and then had the purpose of serving as a hall to accommodate the merchants of Calais. It was damaged in 1658 when a young stable boy set fire to it, while it was temporarily being used as royal stables during a visit of King Louis XIV. It was not repaired for some 30 years. In 1770, a bell identical to the original bell of 1348 was cast. Due to its height, from the late 17th century it became an important watchout post for the city for centuries until 1905; the last keeper of the tower was forced to leave in 1926. Abraham <b>Chappe,</b> (a brother of Ignace <b>Chappe)</b> installed a telegraph office in the tower in 1816 and operated for 32 years. It was this office which announced the death of Napoleon I to the French public in 1821. It also had the dual function as lighthouse with a rotating beacon fuelled by oil from 1818. The lantern was finally replaced by a new lighthouse on 15 October 1848. During the First World War, it served as a military observation post and narrowly missed destruction during World War II. This tower has been classified as a historic monument since 6 November 1931.|$|E

In 1320 he was elected Bishop of Arras in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras and {{transferred}} to the Diocese of Chartres in 1326. <b>Chappes</b> was made a cardinal by Pope John XXII in the consistory of 18 December 1327.

25|$|The French built similar towers {{along their}} own {{coastline}} {{that they used}} as platforms for communication by optical telegraphs (using the <b>Chappe</b> Telegraph).

25|$|Contrary to the {{extensive}} definition used by <b>Chappe,</b> Morse {{argued that the}} term telegraph can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit and record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from semaphore, which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to Morse, telegraph dates only from 1832 when Pavel Schilling invented {{one of the earliest}} electrical telegraphs.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{he worked}} with the <b>Chappe</b> {{brothers}} to be amongst the pioneers of auto glassfibre construction and produced a small coupe, based on 4CV mechanicals, called the Alpine A106. It used the platform chassis of the original Renault 4CV. The A106 achieved a number of successes through the 1950s and was joined by a low and stylish cabriolet. Styling for this car was contracted to the Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. Under the glassfibre body was a very stiff chassis based on a central tubular backbone {{which was to be}} the hallmark of all Alpines.|$|E

2500|$|By 1649 the Comédiens du Roi {{had become}} so successful, they were {{referred}} to as [...] "les grands comédiens" [...] {{in contrast to the}} troupe of the Marais, who were called [...] "les petits comédiens".

All the actors attended Molière's command performance given that year at the Louvre after his troupe's arrival in Paris from the provinces. They clearly recognized that Molière represented a serious challenge to their dominance, which had grown even more with the decline of the Marais after 1653. Concerned about the future, the troupe at the Bourgogne quickly added two new actors, Hauteroche (Noël Breton) and Belleroche/Crispin (Raymond Poisson).|$|E
