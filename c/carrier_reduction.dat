50|$|The {{main reason}} for using either MDCL method (or the {{combination}} of the two) is to save power and money. Alternatively, for the same total power consumption, the transmission coverage can be somewhat improved. The AMC method has two other advantages. It limits the peak voltages on transmitter and antenna circuits, possibly preventing damaging arcs. Also, if the degree of AMC is properly adjusted, the power drawn from the mains can be kept nearly constant with modulation. This is especially important when operating from a local generator. With conventional DCC the load variations on a generator are made worse. With both methods, the main disadvantage is marginal loss of coverage, comparable to running slightly less power. Also in lower signal strength parts of the coverage area, a station using Dynamic Carrier Control {{may be more likely to}} be skipped on digital-tuned radios during seek/scan tuning (if the frequency is passed during <b>carrier</b> <b>reduction),</b> an issue compounded by manual tuning (instead of seek/scan) selection not being easy on some receivers.|$|E

All samples had higher sheet resistances after plasma exposure. The effect of annealing on plasma damage depended upon the Al mole fraction of the material as follows. Damage in AlGa 1 _As (x = 0. 30, 0. 15) was increased by a 300 °C anneal, while that in GaAs remained unchanged. Damage in AlGa 1 _As (x = 0. 3 (J) was also increased after 450 °C annealing, while that in AlGai_rAs (x = 0. 15) and GaAs was repaired by the anneal. The increased resistiv-ity in A 1 GaAs after annealing is mainly due to further <b>carrier</b> <b>reduction</b> by magnification of the damaged region. Considering the similar effects of annealing on SF 6 /CHF 3 and He plasma-exposed A 1 GaAs, the increased sheet resistance after the anneal is though {{to be affected by}} incorporated low-mass ions, such as He and H disso-ciated from CHFa. The 4. 2 K FL measurements revealed a new spectral peak near 1. 70 eV only in the spectrum of the postexposure-annealed sample.

The FWHM of the E_ 2 (high) mode is decreased, indicating that the crystalline quality is slightly improved by the annealing.

The reactivity of the oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>reduction</b> is higher with a larger amount of copper impregnated.

A very interesting phenomenon is that the Cu-modified manganese ore can completely convert CO, even at a low temperature, such as 500 degrees C.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the study of methane {{combustion}} with NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 as oxygen carrier for {{a better understanding of}} Chemical Looping Combustion. Partial combustion of methane with NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 tablets has been investigated in a lab scale continuous perfectly auto-stirred tank reactor (CASTR) where reacting gases methane and steam were diluted in argon and temperature ranged from 700 °C to 833 °C. Influence of methane and water concentrations as well as temperature are studied. Experimental results show that total oxidized compounds are firstly produced, followed by the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and coke, covering the particles and limiting reactions. Increasing the temperature or water concentration enable reducing the coke formation. Analysis of reaction products helps defining a reaction mechanism and ensuring absence of any mass and heat transfer limitations. A model for the reduction of the oxygen carrier, based on the grainy pellet model and taking into account the diffusion of gas species through the tablet and their reactions at the surface of each grain is developed. Gas-solid reaction rates are calculated using the shrinking core model and catalytic reaction rates are defined according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. The kinetic parameters of the catalytic and redox reactions involved in the oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>reduction</b> are optimized by comparison between simulated and experimental results in the CASTR.

40|$|The {{ventilation}} and pollutant transport in {{a two-dimensional}} (2 D) street canyon of building-height-to-street-width (aspect) ratio h/b =  1 under different unstable stratifications were examined. To characterize the combined wind-buoyancy-driven flow and pollutant transport at different Richardson number Ri, a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with the Renormalization Group (RNG) k - ε{lunate} turbulence model was adopted. Unlike the isothermal condition, a secondary recirculation is initiated at the ground-level windward corner of the street canyon once the unstable stratification is switched on (Ri <  0). It traps the ground-level pollutant leading to elevated pollutant concentration there. As Ri further decreases, the enlarging secondary recirculation enables direct pollutant removal from its core to the shear layer that offsets the ground-level pollutant accumulation. The ventilation and pollutant removal performance under different unstable stratifications are compared by the air (ACH) and pollutant (PCH) exchange rates, and pollutant retention time (τ). Both the mean and turbulent components of ACH are found to increase with decreasing Ri, suggesting that unstable stratification promotes ventilation in street canyons. Moreover, the CFD results agree well with our theoretical model that ACH 2 varies linearly with Ri. Turbulent transport originally dominates the pollutant removal under isothermal condition. However, progressive domination of pollutant removal by mean wind can be observed with decreasing stability (decreasing Ri from 0 to - 10. 6). The critical value {{is estimated to be}} Ri = - 8, below which mean wind is the major pollutant removal <b>carrier.</b> <b>Reduction</b> in τ is also observed with decreasing Ri. Hence, in unstable stratification, pollutant resides shorter time in the street canyon compared with its isothermal counterpart, and the ventilation and pollutant removal are more favorable. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background Approximately 90 haemoglobinopathies {{have been}} {{identified}} that result in abnormally high oxygen affinity. One of these is haemoglobinopathy York (HbY), first described in 1976. HbY causes an extreme leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve with the P 50 value changing to 12. 5 - 15. 5 mmHg (normal value 26. 7 mmHg), indicating that {{approximately half of the}} haemoglobin is not available as oxygen carrier. Patients with haemoglobinopathies with increased oxygen affinity could suffer from the risk developing ischaemic complications {{due to a lack of}} functional oxygen carriers. This is, to best of our knowledge, the first case report on a patient with HbY published in connection with anesthesia. Case Presentation A 42 -year-old female with a severe headache and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15 was admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit with a ruptured, right sided ICA aneurysm with consecutive subarachnoid haemorrhage [Fisher III, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) I) ]. The medical history of the patient included an erythrocytosis (Hb 17. 5 [*]g/dl) on the base of a high-oxygen-affinity haemoglobinopathy, called Hb York (HbY). With no time available to take special preoperative precautions, rapid blood loss occurred during the first attempt to clip the aneurysm. General transfusion procedures, according to the guidelines based on haemoglobin and haematocrit values, could not be applied due to the uncertainty in the oxygen <b>carrier</b> <b>reduction.</b> To maintain tissue oxygen supply, clinical indicators of ischaemia were instead utilized to gauge the appropriate required blood products, crystalloids and colloids replacements. Despite this, the patient survived the neurosurgical intervention without any neurological deficit. Conclusions Family members of patients with HbY (and other haemoglobinopathies with increased oxygen affinity) should undergo clinical assessment, particularly if they are polycythaemic. If the diagnosis of HbY is confirmed, they should carry an "emergency anaesthesiology card" in order to avert perioperative risks arising from their "hidden" anemia. </p...|$|E

While the chemical potential shifts suggest doping {{of a large}} amount of <b>carriers,</b> a <b>reduction</b> of the coherent carrier density is found due to the loss of spectral weight. Therefore, none of the change in the Fermi surface, density of states, or charge distribution can be solely used for counting doped coherent carriers, let alone presenting the full effects of the disordered substitutions. Our study highlights the necessity of including disorder effects in the studies of doped materials in general...|$|R
40|$|Bifacial {{spectral}} response characterization of solar cells under near operating condition illumination {{is used in}} conjuncture with a novel bifacial DICE analysis to establish the collection efficiency {{as a function of}} i-layer position in p-i-n amorphous silicon solar cells. A significant portion of solar cell degradation can be explained in terms of electric field distortions which increase recombination losses. Unlike <b>carrier</b> lifetime <b>reductions,</b> the field distortions can be reduced. The numerical model is used to guide the intentional doping of the i-layer to counteract the field distortions caused by charged dangling bonds, and thus to optimize the electric field for the degraded state. Solar cells with graded low-level boron doping in the i-layer are analysed in detail. Increasing conversion efficiency during light-soaking, and enhanced stabilized n-side performance show the viability of the electric field optimization...|$|R
