5|$|Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery novel {{written by}} Blue Balliett and {{illustrated}} by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, A Lady In Writing, is stolen on route to the Art Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the <b>community</b> <b>can</b> discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, {{and the rest of}} Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the <b>community</b> <b>can</b> determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Corfiot Italian <b>community</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in the}} {{expansion}} of the Italian States toward the Balkans during and after the Crusades. In the 12th century, the Kingdom of Naples sent some Italian families to Corfu to rule the island. From the Fourth Crusade of 1204 onwards, the Republic of Venice sent many Italian families to Corfu. These families brought the Italian language of the Middle Ages to the island.|$|E

25|$|Saint John, New Brunswick, {{claims the}} {{distinction}} of being Canada's most Irish city, according to census records. There have been Irish settlers in New Brunswick since at least the late 18th century, but during the peak of the Great Irish Famine (1845–1847), thousands of Irish emigrated through Partridge Island in the port of Saint John. Most of these Irish were Roman Catholic, who changed the complexion of the Loyalist city. A large, vibrant Irish <b>community</b> <b>can</b> also be found in the Miramichi region of New Brunswick.|$|E
25|$|The term Kabuli {{literally}} means any inhabitant of {{the city}} of Kabul in Afghanistan. In Gujarat, the term was applied to any Pashtun who arrived in Gujarat during the 19th Century, the majority of whom were Ghilzais. Historically, the community were traders, buying horses from Kathiawar and selling them in Rajputana and Deccan. They are found mainly in Ahmedabad, and speak Hindustani as well as Gujarati. Some older members of the <b>community</b> <b>can</b> still speak Pashto. To a great extent, they form a distinct community, marrying among themselves, little interacting with other Gujarat Pathans.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the {{influence}} of the New Town movement, Reston was part of a back-to-the-land movement popular in the 1960s and early 1970s. The principles incorporated in the <b>community</b> <b>can</b> be seen as a reaction to the new suburban communities of the post-war era (e.g., Levittown). Among the problems in these communities that Reston responded to included income segregation, a lack of natural preservation, suburbs that served only as bedroom communities for commuters, a lack of public space in new developments, and a lack of community ties in new developments. Many early residents settled in Reston because of the ideals of the community.|$|E

25|$|The Kunbi Dhonoje are {{primarily}} {{a community of}} land-owning agriculturists with deep roots in Maharashtra, although their origin and historical background are unknown. Their home districts {{are primarily}} the Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara and Nagpur districts of the Vidharbha region in Maharashtra. The Anthropological Survey of India records in 2003 that while Hindi is spoken by when communicating with outsiders, {{the women of the}} <b>community</b> <b>can</b> only understand Hindi—they cannot speak it. The Dhonoje observe strict endogamy; most marriages are arranged by family elders. Kunbi Dhonoje males marry between 20 and 25 whereas the females marry between 18 and 22.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit {{priest in}} the US {{published}} “Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the L.G.B.T. <b>Community</b> <b>Can</b> Enter Into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion and Sensitivity.” This called on church leaders to show respect by using terms like “gay” and “L.G.B.T.,” instead of phrases like “afflicted with same-sex attraction.” He {{also argued that}} to expect a sinless lifestyle from gay Catholics, but not from any other group, {{is a form of}} “unjust discrimination” and that gay people should not be fired for marrying a same-sex spouse. Cardinal Joseph Tobin and Cardinal Kevin Farrell contributed blurbs to the book.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the human}} {{capacity}} for language provides strong support for a nativist view. Firstly, language is a species characteristic of humans: No human society has ever been discovered that does not employ a language, and all medically able children acquire at least one language in early childhood. The typical five-year-old can already use most, if not all, of the grammatical structures that {{are found in the}} language of the surrounding community. Yet, the knowledge of grammar is tacit: Neither the five-year-old nor the adults in the <b>community</b> <b>can</b> easily articulate the principles of the grammar they are following. Experimental evidence shows that infants come equipped with presuppositions that allow them to acquire the rules of their language.|$|E

The HCC is a one-of-a-kind building at UMW— an “academic commons” where a variety of technology, information, and teaching resources come together {{in an environment that}} is modern, energetic, and vibrant. A University Center was opened in Fall 2015 to provide a campus center that fosters a collaborative and respectful environment where members of the UMW <b>community</b> <b>can</b> engage in their extracurricular and academic pursuits.

25|$|Romania {{has had a}} Bahá'í {{community}} since 1926, {{whose members}} at that time included Marie of Edinburgh, Queen of Romania. After {{the fall of communism}} in Romania, the Romanian Bahá'í community organized itself in order to form its first National Spiritual Assembly in 1991. In 2005 the Romanian Bahá'í community numbered some 7,000, but in January 2007 a law was passed that imposed restrictive requirements on religious communities that wished to be recognized by the government, which Bahá'ís and adherents of other minority religions could not meet. Some of the restrictions include waiting as long as twelve years after petitioning before a religious <b>community</b> <b>can</b> start to apply for recognition and the requirement that a legally-recognized religion must have over 22,000 members.|$|E
25|$|Polygynous marriages can be {{distinguished}} between sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. For men, the benefits of polygyny are that {{it allows them to}} have more children, may provide them with more productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when their work load is lightened by the addition of junior wives to the family. Wives', especially senior wives', status in the <b>community</b> <b>can</b> be increased by the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or are a sign of conspicuous consumption (much like a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations would be in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for a second wife.|$|E
