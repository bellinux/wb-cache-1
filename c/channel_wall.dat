5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a <b>channel</b> <b>wall,</b> forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E

6000|$|At Sligo, where I still {{went for}} my holidays, I stayed with my uncle, George Pollexfen, {{who had come}} from Ballina to fill the place of my {{grandfather}}, who had retired. My grandfather had no longer his big house, his partner William Middleton was dead, {{and there had been}} legal trouble. He was no longer the rich man he had been, and his sons and daughters were married and scattered. He had a tall, bare house overlooking the harbour, and had nothing to do but work himself into a rage if he saw a mudlighter mismanaged or judged from the smoke of a steamer that she was burning cheap coal, and to superintend the making of his tomb. There was a Middleton tomb and a long list of Middletons on the wall, and an almost empty place for Pollexfen names, but he had said, because there was a Middleton there he did not like, [...] "I am not going to lie with those old bones;" [...] and already one saw his name in large gilt letters on the stone fence of the new tomb. He ended his walk at St. John's churchyard almost daily, for he liked everything neat and compendious as upon shipboard, and if he had not looked after the tomb himself the builder might have added some useless ornament. He had, however, all his old skill and nerve. I was going to Rosses Point on the little trading steamer and saw him take the wheel from the helmsman and steer her through a gap in the <b>channel</b> <b>wall,</b> and across the sand, an unheard-of-course, and at the journey's end bring her alongside her wharf at Rosses without the accustomed zigzagging or pulling on a rope but in a single movement. He took snuff when he had a cold, but had never smoked or taken alcohol; and when in his eightieth year his doctor advised a stimulant, he replied, [...] "no, no, I am not going to form a bad habit." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{biological}} transport mechanisms such as insect respiration and renal filtration, fluid travels along a leaky channel allowing {{exchange with}} systems exterior the the channel. The channels in these systems may undergo peristaltic pumping which {{is thought to}} enhance the material exchange. To date, little analytic {{work has been done}} to study the effect of pumping on material extraction across the <b>channel</b> <b>walls.</b> In this paper, we examine a fluid extraction model in which fluid flowing through a leaky channel is exchanged with fluid in a reservoir. The <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> are allowed to contract and expand uniformly, simulating a pumping mechanism. In order to efficiently determine solutions of the model, we derive a formal power series solution for the Stokes equations in a finite channel with uniformly contracting/expanding permeable walls. This flow has been well studied in the case of weakly permeable <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> in which the normal velocity at the <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> is proportional to the wall velocity. In contrast we do not assume weakly driven flow, but flow driven by hydrostatic pressure, and we use Dacry's law to close our system for normal wall velocity. We use our flow solution to examine flux across the channel-reservoir barrier and demonstrate that pumping can either enhance or impede fluid extraction across <b>channel</b> <b>walls.</b> We find that associated with each set of physical flow and pumping parameters, there are optimal reservoir conditions that maximizes the amount of material flowing from the channel into the reservoir.

40|$|A viscous {{micropump}} is {{a device}} such that a cylindrical rotor is eccentrically {{placed in a}} channel, and when the rotor is forced to rotate the viscous resistance between the small and large gaps between the cylinder and the <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> generate a net flow along the channel. Assuming that the gaps between the cylinder and the <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> are small compared to the radius of the rotor, the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication may be utilized to study the viscous pump. Here lubrication theory is used to obtain an analytical solution which relates the flowrate, rotation rate, pressure drop and applied torque as functions of the geometric parameters of the viscous pump. This analysis differs from a previous similar study {{of the effects of}} slip in two ways. Firstly, the applied pressure is implemented as a pressure load that the pump must overcome in its operation, and secondly different slip lengths are used on each of the <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> and the rotor. Numerical simulations are performed to confirm the results of the lubrication analysis, utilizing a finite element analysis modified with a penalty method to implement the slip boundary conditions. Results indicate that slip just on the <b>channel</b> <b>walls,</b> with no-slip on the rotor, improves the performance of the pump with respect to the flux through the pump, but the pressure load that the pump may overcome is reduced. Slip just on the rotor and slip on the <b>channel</b> <b>walls</b> and the rotor reduces the performance of the pump. Comparison between the lubrication and numerical solution shows excellent quantitative agreement for small values of the channel spacing and good qualitative agreement for larger channel spacing for the cases of no slip or slip on the <b>channel</b> <b>walls,</b> which are the results of practical interest. With slip on the rotor, there is good agreement for small values of slip. For the case of slip everywhere, one of the assumptions used in obtaining the lubrication solution noticeably breaks down.

40|$|We study {{different}} types of microswimmers moving in channels with varying cross section and thereby interacting hydrodynamically with the <b>channel</b> <b>walls.</b> Starting from the Smoluchowski equation for a dilute suspension, for which interactions among swimmers can be neglected, we derive analytic expressions for the lateral probability distribution between plane <b>channel</b> <b>walls.</b> For weakly corrugated channels we extend the Fick [...] Jacobs approach to microswimmers and thereby derive an effective equation for the probability distribution along the channel axis.
