2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the skilled workers {{fashioned}} the Tabernacle's <b>curtains,</b> <b>loop,</b> clasps, and coverings.|$|R
60|$|First the Governor, the Father: He {{suggested}} velvet <b>curtains</b> <b>Looped</b> about a massy pillar; And {{the corner}} of a table, Of a rosewood dining-table. He would hold a scroll of something, Hold it firmly in his left-hand; He would keep his right-hand buried (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat; He would contemplate the distance With a look of pensive meaning, As of ducks that die ill tempests.|$|R
60|$|There was a broad stone stair, {{leading to}} a large {{apartment}} hung with stamped Spanish leather, representing the history of King David, and with a window, glazed as usual below with circles and lozenges, but the upper part glowing with coloured glass. At the farther end was a dais {{with a sort of}} throne, like the tester and canopy of a four-post bed, with <b>curtains</b> <b>looped</b> up at each side. Here the Duchess sat, surrounded by her ladies, all in the sober dress suitable with monastic life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here, Sir,' said James, {{stopping}} {{in where the}} <b>curtain</b> was <b>looped</b> up, and showed King Henry half sitting, half lying, on a couch of cushions and deer-skins, his eyes full of fire, his thin face flushed with deep colour; Bedford, March, Warwick, and Salisbury in attendance.|$|R
60|$|The fire burnt clear {{between two}} pillars of greenish marble, {{and on the}} mantelpiece there was a green clock guarded by Britannia leaning on her spear. As for pictures--a maiden in a large hat offered roses over the garden gate to a gentleman in {{eighteenth-century}} costume. A mastiff lay extended against a battered door. The lower panes of the windows were of ground glass, and the <b>curtains,</b> accurately <b>looped,</b> were of plush and green too.|$|R
60|$|The voice uttering {{these words}} {{was the voice}} of Therese and I looked at her from a bed draped heavily in brown silk <b>curtains</b> fantastically <b>looped</b> up from ceiling to floor. The glow of a sunshiny day was toned down by closed jalousies to a mere {{transparency}} of darkness. In this thin medium Therese’s form appeared flat, without detail, as if cut out of black paper. It glided towards the window and with a click and a scrape let in the full flood of light which smote my aching eyeballs painfully.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Nothing,’ replied Seraphina ‘I {{desire to}} speak with you. Send off the rest.’ She panted between each phrase; but her mind was clear. She let the <b>looped</b> <b>curtain</b> down upon both sides before she drew the bolt; and, thus secure from any sudden eyeshot from without, {{admitted}} the obsequious Chancellor, and again made fast the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] said Bill bitterly. [...] "Carpets fading,--that's Aunt Zeruah's monomania. These {{women think}} that the great object of houses is to keep out sunshine. What a fool I was when I gloated over the {{prospect}} of our sunny south windows! Why, man, there are three distinct sets of fortifications against the sunshine in those windows: first, outside blinds; then solid, folding, inside shutters; and, lastly, heavy, thick, lined damask <b>curtains,</b> which <b>loop</b> quite down to the floor. What's the use of my pictures, I desire to know? They are hung in that room, and it's a regular campaign to get light enough {{to see what they}} are." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>curtain</b> was <b>looped</b> up, and {{the moon}} of a frosty night blanched a square on the carpet beneath the window, at which she often looked with a glistening gaze. Her father and brother had been {{expected}} at dinner-time; and though their detention was of frequent occurrence, Phoebe had deferred undressing till it should {{be too late for}} their arrival by the last train, since they would like her to preside over their supper, and she might possibly hear of Robert, whose doings her father had of late seemed to regard with less displeasure, though she had not been allowed to go with Miss Charlecote to the consecration of his church, and had not seen him since the Horticultural Show.|$|R
60|$|She {{pointed to}} a wide arch {{corresponding}} to the window, and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed <b>curtain,</b> now <b>looped</b> up. Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I {{caught a glimpse of}} a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.|$|R
6000|$|Renovated {{certainly}} the saloon of the Ferndale was {{to receive the}} [...] "strange woman." [...] The mellowness of its old-fashioned, tarnished decoration was gone. And Anthony looking round saw the glitter, the gleams, the colour of new things, untried, unused, very bright--too bright. The workmen had gone only last night; and {{the last piece of}} work they did was the hanging of the heavy <b>curtains</b> which <b>looped</b> midway the length of the saloon--divided it in two if released, cutting off the after-end with its companion-way leading direct on the poop, from the forepart with its outlet on the deck; making a privacy within a privacy, as though Captain Anthony could not place obstacles enough between his new happiness and the men who shared his life at sea. He inspected that arrangement with an approving eye then made a particular visitation of the whole, ending by opening a door which led into a large state-room made of two knocked into one. It was very well furnished and had, instead of the usual bed-place of such cabins, an elaborate swinging cot of the latest pattern. Anthony tilted it a little by way of trial. [...] "The old man will be very comfortable in here," [...] he said to himself, and stepped back into the saloon closing the door gently. Then another thought occurred to him obvious under the circumstances but strangely enough presenting itself for the first time. [...] "Jove! Won't he get a shock," [...] thought Roderick Anthony.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have come, my dear child, to {{take you}} back to your old home," [...] he said. [...] "No words can tell how fervently I wish you had never left your aunt and me. Well! well! we won't talk about it. The {{mischief}} is done, and the next thing is to mend it as well as we can. If I could only get within arm's-length of that husband of yours, Valeria--There! there! God forgive me, I am forgetting that I am a clergyman. What shall I forget next, I wonder? By-the-by, your aunt sends you her dearest love. She is more superstitious than ever. This miserable business doesn't surprise her a bit. She says it all began with your making that mistake about your name in signing the church register. You remember? Was there ever such stuff? Ah, she's a foolish woman, that wife of mine! But she means well--a good soul at bottom. She would have traveled all the way here along with me if I would have let her. I said, 'No; you stop at home, and look after the house and the parish, and I'll bring the child back.' You shall have your old bedroom, Valeria, with the white <b>curtains,</b> you know, <b>looped</b> up with blue! We will return to the Vicarage (if you can get up in time) by the nine-forty train to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I recommenced cursing--don't be angry, Nelly--and so Robert {{was ordered}} to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw should be {{informed}} of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly, secured the door again. The <b>curtains</b> were still <b>looped</b> up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they let her out. She {{sat on the sofa}} quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?' ...|$|R
