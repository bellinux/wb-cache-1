25|$|From an {{economic}} standpoint, Cuba relies {{much more on}} Venezuela than Venezuela does on Cuba.

Further budget cuts are in the plans for 2018 marking a third straight year.|$|E

It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, held {{each other in the}} 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas; its relative popularity in 19th-century <b>Cuba</b> <b>is</b> hard to estimate.|$|E
