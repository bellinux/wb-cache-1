5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> form syllables, {{which in}} turn <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E

5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun.

5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E

Similar methods have been applied to the 2x3 case, where Jarvis / Russell showed that there are 49 essentially different grids (see also the article by Bailey, Cameron and Connelly), to the 2x4 case, where Russell showed that there are 1,673,187 essentially different grids (verified by Pettersen), and to the 2x5 case where Pettersen showed that there are 4,743,933,602,050,718 essentially different grids (not verified).|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> yield hydrogen fluoride, {{in which}} discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E

5|$|Kota Kinabalu {{is often}} known as KK both in Malaysia and internationally. It {{is a major}} tourist {{destination}} and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu Park is located about 90kilometres {{from the city and}} there are many other tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu {{is also one of the}} major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E
5|$|Reversible inhibitors {{attach to}} enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds.

5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|Thayer {{observed}} and painted {{a number of}} examples, including the Luna moth caterpillar Actias luna, both in its habitual upside-down feeding position, where its countershading makes it appear flat, and artificially inverted from that position, where sunlight and its inverted countershading <b>combine</b> <b>to</b> make it appear heavily shaded and therefore solid. Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.|$|E
