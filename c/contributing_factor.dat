40|$|Introduction: Accident modelling, in {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} how the event happened, has traditionally being based on understanding accidents as a linear sequence of events and has not significantly evolved since its early inception in the safety sciences. Today however, modern software programs, particularly those being used for Social Network Analysis (SNA), offer the possibility to understand accidents and incidents as a complex network of relationships of <b>contributing</b> <b>factors,</b> perhaps for the first time. The analysis of railway incidents using this previously unexplored method has enabled accident investigations to move into a new era in the understanding of accident phenomenology in complex socio-technical systems. Aim: This research is interested in exploring how accident/incident data can be visually modelled using previously unexplored methods and what further understandings about the relationships between the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> in railway incidents can be gleaned by the use of more modern methods of data (network) analysis. Method: Major railway incident reports, for a five year period (2006 – 2010), were analysed and data was collected on the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> using the <b>Contributing</b> <b>Factors</b> Framework (CFF), a tool developed specifically for the rail industry in Australia. The <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for various types of incidents were then modelled using Social Network Analysis methods. Results: The use of Social Network Analysis has enabled the relationship between of each of the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to be identified. The resulting models were analysed and the relationship between the main <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for each type of railway incident was explored. By using this new methodology for accident analysis it is possible to obtain a clear visual picture of the inter-connectiveness of <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> and to further understand the relationship of constituent parts of complex systems. Discussion: The outcome of this research has been {{the development of a new}} method of accident modelling that moves beyond traditional linear models and better reflects modern day safety science thinking about complex socio-technical systems. It is hoped that this type of method can provide new and previously unknown knowledge about the interconnectedness of the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for different types of rail incidents and accidents in the quest to enhance accident prevention and learning...|$|R
40|$|The {{follow up}} time is an {{important}} parameter for estimating the entry capacity of roundabouts.

It is found that the follow up time is indeed significantly affected by traffic volume, waiting vehicles behind, vehicle type, and drivers’ gender. In order to establish {{the relationship between the}} follow up time and its <b>contributing</b> <b>factors,</b> an inverse Gaussian regression model is further developed.

5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely <b>contributing</b> <b>factor</b> to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Safety and Failure Event Network (SAFE-NET) {{method of}} {{accident}} modelling {{has been developed}} {{as part of a}} human factors research project which aimed to identify the relationships of <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> (including human factors) to major railway safety occurrences for the Rail Safety Regulator in Queensland, Australia. Whilst accident modelling had certainly progressed through various reiterations since the first simple linear model was developed, the identified gap has been for a practical methodology for undertaking accident modelling which can now cope with modern day system complexity and truly reflect the socio-technical systems under review. The aim of this research was to identify the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to railway safety occurrences and to examine how <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> were interconnected and networked. To meet this aim major railway safety occurrence reports which were submitted to the Rail Safety Regular, for a five year period (2006 – 2010), were analysed and data was collected on the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> using the <b>Contributing</b> <b>Factors</b> Framework (CFF), a human factors tool developed for the rail industry in Australia. The <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for various types of safety occurrences were then modelled using the Safety and Failure Event Network (SAFE-Net) method. The results have enabled various types of railway safety occurrences to be modelled with a view to understanding how the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> are interconnected and which factors are the main contributors to various types of safety occurrences. This representation allows management and others to review the railway system elements at a deeper level and enable the focus of safety efforts to be directed to the most important and central elements from a systems perspective...|$|R
40|$|In early 2009 the <b>Contributing</b> <b>Factors</b> Framework (CFF) was {{launched}} nationally {{to the rail}} industry in Australia. It was developed specifically for the rail industry and aligns with systemic incident investigation models. It was developed to capture and code information about all factors that {{may have contributed to}} a rail safety occurrence. The three main coding headings used in the CFF to capture this information are: Individual/Team Actions, Technical Failures and Local Conditions/Organisational Factors. Whilst the CFF currently captures <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> in the three stand alone headings this research is interested in visually modelling the previously unseen and unidentified non-linear network interactions of all the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> across these three headings. It is also interested in looking at the strength of the relationships amongst the factors as a more holistic way of understanding accident taxonomy. The aim is to identify the trends, through modelling, of which <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> the most to high risk types of rail safety accidents and incidents. To achieve this aim major rail safety occurrence reports were analysed for the 5 year period 2006 to 2010 using the CFF tool. The <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> for four high risk types of rail incidents: being Collisions, Derailments, Safe Working Breaches and Signals Passes at Dangers (SPADs) will be modelled. Work has now begun on using network analysis software to investigate how the <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> are interlinked, how <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> are networking and the contribution that the factors have on accident phenomenology. It is envisaged that the outcome of this project will be {{the development of a new}} form of visual accident modelling and that this modelling will identify which <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> need to be controlled or mitigated for each type of rail safety incident to enhance accident prevention...|$|R
40|$|Curves are {{a common}} feature of road infrastructure; however crashes on road curves are {{associated}} with increased risk of injury and fatality to vehicle occupants. Countermeasures require the identification of <b>contributing</b> <b>factors.</b> However, current approaches to identifying contributors use traditional statistical methods and have not used self-reported narrative claim to identify factors related to the driver, vehicle and environment in a systemic way. Text mining of 3434 road-curve crash claim records filed between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005 at a major insurer in Queensland, Australia, was undertaken to identify risk levels and <b>contributing</b> <b>factors.</b> Rough set analysis was used on insurance claim narratives to identify significant <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to crashes and their associated severity. New <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> unique to curve crashes were identified (e. g., tree, phone, over-steer) {{in addition to those}} previously identified via traditional statistical analysis of Police and licensing authority records. Text mining is a novel methodology to improve knowledge related to risk and <b>contributing</b> <b>factors</b> to road-curve crash severity. Future road-curve crash countermeasures should more fully consider the interrelationships between environment, the road, the driver and the vehicle, and education campaigns in particular could highlight the increased risk of crash on road-curves...|$|R
