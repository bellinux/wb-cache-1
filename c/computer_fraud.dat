5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the US Congress {{passed the}} Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which {{extended}} the Secret Service's jurisdiction over credit card fraud and <b>computer</b> <b>fraud.</b>|$|E

25|$|On May 4, 2009, the California Court {{deferred}} ruling {{with respect}} to forum non conveniens until the issue of personal jurisdiction could be fairly presented. The court also held that no choice-of-law determination was required here because neither the Lanham Act nor the <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act (CFAA) contain a special venue provision.|$|E
40|$|Forged and {{tempered}} {{digital images}} become increasingly common on Facebook to aid <b>computer</b> <b>frauds.</b> The situation is worsened as many users {{can use a}} phone to take a photo and upload it to Facebook within two clicks, which highlights the need of image forensics for the cyber fraud cases. In this paper, we show {{the existence of the}} Facebook image filter which automatically changes the Facebook photos and consequently challenges the validity of forensic results. We aim to enable forensic investigators to relate a seized camera and a Facebook image. Specifically, we utilize intrinsic sensor pattern noise produced by a camera 2 ̆ 7 s lens to derive forensically useful information as Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) patterns. We propose to compare the PRNU patterns of a Facebook image and the flat field images produced by the candidate cameras. And we conclude this method to be effective by successfully identifying the correct iPhone from a list of four for a given Face book image. <br /...|$|R

25|$|The MBTA {{claimed that}} the MIT {{students}} violated the <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act (CFAA) and on August 9, 2008, was granted {{a temporary restraining order}} (TRO) against the students to prevent them from presenting information to DEFCON conference attendees that could have potentially been used to defraud the MBTA of transit fares. The MIT students contended that submitting their research for review and approval by a government agency before publication is unconstitutional prior restraint.|$|E
25|$|Unauthorized {{access to}} a {{computer}} is illegal under computer crime laws, such as the U.S. <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act, the U.K.'s Computer Misuse Act, and similar laws in other countries. Since owners of computers infected with spyware generally claim that they never authorized the installation, a prima facie reading {{would suggest that the}} promulgation of spyware would count as a criminal act. Law enforcement has often pursued the authors of other malware, particularly viruses. However, few spyware developers have been prosecuted, and many operate openly as strictly legitimate businesses, though some have faced lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|While {{chairman}} in 2006, staffers {{of the committee}} obtained a copy of Maryland's 2006 Republican senate candidate Michael Steele's credit report. A staff researcher used Steele's social security number to obtain his credit report from TransUnion. The report was paid for with the DSCC credit card issued to the researcher's supervisor. After an internal investigation, the Maryland Democratic Party determined the credit report was obtained illegally and reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney. The staffer resigned and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of <b>computer</b> <b>fraud</b> {{and was sentenced to}} 150 hours of community service. The supervisor resigned from the DSCC.|$|E
25|$|The first local referendums in the U.S. on {{computerized}} voting {{occurred in}} Tacoma in 1982 and 1987.

25|$|In December 1999, Scott Moulton {{was arrested}} by the FBI and accused of {{attempted}} computer trespassing under Georgia's Computer Systems Protection Act and <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act of America. At this time, his IT service company had an ongoing contract with Cherokee County of Georgia to maintain and upgrade the 911 center security. He performed several port scans on Cherokee County servers to check their security and eventually port scanned a web server monitored by another IT company, provoking a tiff which {{ended up in a}} tribunal. He was acquitted in 2000, the judge ruling there was no damage impairing the integrity and availability of the network.|$|E
25|$|Several {{well-known}} {{revenge porn}} websites, including IsAnyoneUp and the Texxxan, {{have been taken}} down in response to actual or threatened legal action. The former was investigated by the FBI after anti-revenge porn activist Charlotte Laws uncovered a hacking scheme associated with the website. Indictments for fifteen felonies were handed down under the <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act in January 2014 for the site owner and his accomplices, and the trial was initially set to begin in November 2014 in Los Angeles. Hunter Moore, the owner of IsAnyoneUp pleaded guilty to hacking and identity theft in early 2015. Moore was sentenced to {{two and a half}} years in prison on December 2, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Operation Firewall: In October 2004, 28 suspects—located across eight U.S. {{states and}} six countries—were arrested {{on charges of}} {{identity}} theft, <b>computer</b> <b>fraud,</b> credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was {{in the hundreds of}} millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cyber-criminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.|$|E
50|$|Because these {{machines}} record votes internally, in <b>computer</b> software, vote <b>fraud</b> {{may be difficult}} to detect. Reconciling the electronic vote count with the physical vote count in all, or a random sampling of, machines allows poll-workers to screen for fraud.

25|$|The MBTA {{retained}} Holland & Knight {{to represent}} them and contended that under the norm of responsible disclosure, the students did not provide sufficient information or time before the presentation for the MBTA to correct the flaw and further alleged that the students transmitted programs to cause damage to (or attempted to transmit and damage) MBTA computers in an amount in excess of $5,000 under the <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act. Furthermore, it was contended that this damage constituted a threat to {{public health and safety}} and the MBTA would suffer irreparable harm if the students were allowed to present; that the students converted and trespassed on MBTA property; that the students illegally profited from their activities; and that MIT itself was negligent in supervising the undergraduates and notifying the MBTA.|$|E
25|$|Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. is {{a lawsuit}} brought by Facebook in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Power Ventures Inc., a {{third-party}} platform, collected user information from Facebook and displayed {{it on their}} own website. Facebook claimed violations of the CAN-SPAM Act, the <b>Computer</b> <b>Fraud</b> and Abuse Act ("CFAA"), and the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. According to Facebook, Power Ventures Inc. made copies of Facebook’s website during the process of extracting user information. Facebook argued that this process causes both direct and indirect copyright infringement. In addition, Facebook alleged this process constitutes a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Finally, Facebook also asserted claims of both state and federal trademark infringement, as well as a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law ("UCL").|$|E
