2500|$|The women {{disrupted}} courts, schools, {{and markets}} throughout the Kom region {{for the rest}} of the year with protests and disruptive activity. Administrative mechanisms, both traditional and colonial, proved to be entirely powerless and the protests continued. Anthropologist Paul Nkwi explains that [...] "The demonstrations were so wild that no police action <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> Only a few police officers were despatched to cover the event, and government had only to dialogue with the women. Even the traditional ruler, Foyn Alo'o Ndiforngu became virtually powerless. The women had taken over control of tribal affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
60|$|His mind next {{turned to}} his {{immediate}} future. What were {{they going to do}} with him? On this point he felt tolerably comfortable. This imprisonment could mean nothing more than that he would be compelled to disgorge a ransom. This did not trouble him. He was rich, and, now that the situation had been switched to a purely business basis, he felt that he <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A New York Times {{editorial}} {{praised the}} remarks, saying, [...] "Senator Barack Obama, {{who has not}} faced such tests of character this year, faced one on Tuesday. It {{is hard to imagine}} how he <b>could</b> have <b>handled</b> <b>it</b> better." ...|$|R
60|$|Unheeding of the clamour, {{this man}} upon the poop {{suddenly}} lifted the {{coil of rope}} and threw it shoreward. It was a thick and heavy rope, with a noose at its end, so heavy that none would have believed that one mortal <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> Yet it shot from him till it stood out stiff as an iron bar. Yes, and the noose fell {{over one of the}} stone posts on the quay, and caught there. Now the rope grew straighter still, stretching and groaning like a thing in pain as it took the weight of the great, drifting ship. She stayed; she swung round slowly and ranged herself broadside on against the quay as a berthed ship does. Then down the ladder on her side came the Man. Deliberately he set his white-sandalled feet upon the quay, advanced a few paces into the full light of the bright moon and stood still as though to suffer himself to be seen of every eye.|$|E

It'll be a matter of ten thousand quid, and I only wish I had my fingers on it now and was well out of the country. But this is where the rub comes in. If {{anything happens to}} me before I can bring this off, I'm hanged if I know what to tell you to do with the packet. It's worth its weight in banknotes to more persons than one, but there's a beastly risk in having anything to do with it. I think you'd better burn it! There's money in it, but I don't see how you <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> Burn it, Agnes. It's too risky a business for you! I only hope that in a week or so I shall burn this letter myself, and you and I will be on our way to America.|$|E
60|$|But its {{attractiveness}} {{begins and}} ends with its picturesqueness. From the time one starts ashore till he gets back again, he execrates it. The boat he goes in is admirably miscalculated for the service it is built for. It is handsomely and neatly fitted up, but no man <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> well in the turbulent currents that sweep down the Bosporus from the Black Sea, and few men could row it satisfactorily even in still water. It is a long, light canoe (caique,) large {{at one end and}} tapering to a knife blade at the other. They make that long sharp end the bow, and you can imagine how these boiling currents spin it about. It has two oars, and sometimes four, and no rudder. You start to go to a given point and you run in fifty different directions before you get there. First one oar is backing water, and then the other; it is seldom that both are going ahead at once. This kind of boating is calculated to drive an impatient man mad in a week. The boatmen are the awkwardest, the stupidest, and the most unscientific on earth, without question.|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the Intelligence Corps, he has little battle experience. He idolizes Issa, mostly because his first mission was with him.

5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the incident, faculty and students of the school {{have come to the}} defense of Bush's actions. Principal Gwendolyn Tose-Rigell, who died in 2007, stated, [...] "I don't think anyone <b>could</b> have <b>handled</b> <b>it</b> better.

6000|$|... 'This {{must be the}} man,' I said to myself, {{and then}} I said no more, for he was on me, sword up. I saw the keen point flash towards me, and sprang to one side having a desire to fly, as, being unarmed except for my stick, I might have done without shame. But spring as I would I could not avoid the thrust altogether. It was aimed at my heart and it pierced the sleeve of my left arm, passing through the flesh--no more. Yet at the pain of that cut all thought of flight left me, and instead of it a cold anger filled me, causing me to wish to kill this man who had {{attacked}} me thus and unprovoked. In my hand was my stout oaken staff which I had cut myself {{on the banks of}} Hollow Hill, and if I would fight I must make such play with this as I might. It seems a poor weapon indeed to match against a Toledo blade in the hands of one who <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> well, and yet there are virtues in a cudgel, for when a man sees himself threatened with it, he is likely to forget that he holds in his hand a more deadly weapon, and to take to the guarding of his own head in place of running his adversary through the body.|$|E
60|$|Serpents were fearful {{things to}} me at that period; but {{whatsoever}} is terrible and dangerous, or so reported, has an irresistible attraction for the mind, whether of child or man; it was therefore {{always a pleasure to}} have seen a snake in the day's rambles, although the sight was a startling one. Also in the warm season it was a keen pleasure to find the cast slough of the feared and subtle creature. Here was something not the serpent, yet so much more than a mere picture of it; a dead and cast-off part of it, but in its completeness, from the segmented mask with the bright unseeing eyes, to the fine whip-like tail end, so like the serpent itself; I <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> handle the serpent as it were, yet be in no danger from venomous tooth or stinging tongue. True, it was colourless, but silvery bright, soft as satin to the touch, crinkling when handled with a sound that to the startled fancy recalled the dangerous living hiss from the dry rustling grass! I would clutch my prize with a fearful joy, as if I had picked up a strange feather dropped in passing from the wing of one of the fallen but still beautiful angels. And it always increased my satisfaction when, on exhibiting my treasure at home, the first sight of it caused a visible start or an exclamation of alarm.|$|E

50|$|The Elberfeld {{system was}} {{a system for}} aiding the poor in 19th-century Germany.

50|$|Its {{successor}} Grand Prix 2 though, was {{notorious for}} its high CPU-demands. When it appeared, {{there were no}} systems available that <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> at full detail.
