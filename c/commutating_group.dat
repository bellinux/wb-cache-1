40|$|Due to {{robustness}} {{and simplicity}} of control, DC machines {{continue to be}} widely used in many applications including mining. Though a mature technology, DC machines still require research attention to accomodate for heavier loads and harder operation conditions dictated by production needs. Recent advances in sensoring, data acquisition and signal processing technologies allow for direct measurement of quantities {{that used to be}} theoretically modeled or indirectly measured in the past. Within a research project with industry partners, the research team obtained the measurements of flux densities inside the motor air gap under both static and dynamic conditions. A variety of valuable information about the motor performance can be derived from these measurements. This paper focuses on one particular aspect of the commutation performance of DC machines, namely, the magnitudes and uniformity of current density through a brush, which to a large degree dictate wear rates of the DC motor <b>commutating</b> <b>group.</b> The paper revisits the classical commutation theory, presents a mathematical model for current density estimation across a brush, and applies this model to the experimental results obtained. The results are then discussed and related to the commutation quality of the machine...|$|E
40|$|Let k be {{a perfect}} field of {{characteristic}} p> 0. Let X, Y be isoclinic Barsotti-Tate groups with Frobenius slopes µX, µY respectively, with µX < µY. The “extension part” DE(X, Y) of the equi-characteristic deformation space Def(X, Y) of X × Y has a natural structure as a <b>commutate</b> smooth formal <b>group</b> over k. We show that the central leaf in the deformation space Def(X, Y), the locus in Def(X, Y) defined by the property that the fiber of the universal Barsotti-Tate group of every geometric point of the central leaf is isomorphic to X × Y, {{is equal to the}} maximal p-divisible subgroup DE(X, Y) p-div of the smooth formal group DE(X, Y). We also determined the Cartier module of the p-divisible formal group DE(X, Y) p-div in terms of the Cartier modules of X and Y. A “triple Carter module ” BCp(k), defined to be the set of all p-typical curves of the Cartier ring functor, plays an important role. The “two-slope case ” treated in this article is an essential ingredient of a general loca...|$|R
