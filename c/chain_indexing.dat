Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for <b>chain</b> <b>indexing</b> versus air cylinders, gear racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> is {{recognized}} as representing a superior method for measuring the volume growth of National accounts aggregates, especially in periods of structural change and rapid movements of relative prices. So, if {{the objective is to}} measure the actual movements of prices and volumes from period to period (e. g. from t- 1 and t), indices should be compiled between consecutive time periods. Changes in prices and volumes between periods that are separated in time are then obtained by cumulating the short-term variations or, in other words, by linking the indices between consecutive periods, to form “chain indices”. In the context of the revision of the GDP estimates, carried out for the 2000 National accounts benchmark, the <b>chain</b> <b>indices</b> have been adopted to deflate National accounts aggregates.

We determine that the actual weight from year t- 3 data better produces a more correct chained-type producer price index at t between two available methods of selecting the weights. This weighting method also provides generally better statistical consistency and stability for the chained-type producer price index. We also compare the MAE and RMSE of the price equations of the fixed base and <b>chain</b> <b>indices.</b> Both the unit root test and comparison of the model performance evaluation reveal no critical difference, thus confirming a stability over the two indices.
