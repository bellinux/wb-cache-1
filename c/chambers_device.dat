Temporary epicardial pacemakers have become increasingly sophisticated over the years and have evolved from simple single <b>chamber</b> <b>devices</b> with few programmable parameters to complex dual <b>chamber</b> <b>devices</b> capable of adjustable parameters similar to permanent pacemakers.

40|$|A {{randomized}} clinical crossover {{trial was}} carried out to compare the use in the home, during 1 -week periods, of two commercially available <b>chamber</b> <b>devices</b> (the Aerochamber and the Spacer) and a standard metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in 24 patients with reversible bronchospasm and satisfactory inhaler technique. Measurements of peak flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), ratio of FEV 1 to FVC and forced midexpiratory flow rate were made immediately before and 15 minutes after inhalation of terbutaline sulfate. No difference was noted in results of spirometry, peak flow readings or side effects between the devices. The results of spirometry were better during the trial than immediately before it (p less than 0. 01). The mean score for inhaler technique was significantly lower at follow-up than during the trial (p less than 0. 001). The results suggest that in this population there is no advantage to using either a <b>chamber</b> <b>device</b> rather than an MDI or one <b>chamber</b> <b>device</b> rather than the other...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with sick sinus syndrome and normal atrioventricular conduction, physiological pacing {{can be accomplished}} with either a single chamber atrial pacemaker AAI/R or a dual chamber pacemaker DDD/R. The single <b>chamber</b> <b>device</b> has the advantages of simpler implantation and lower initial costs, while the dual <b>chamber</b> <b>device</b> offers protection in case atrioventricular conduction disturbances develop in the future. When rigorous {{attention is paid to}} the pre-implantation selection criteria, the incidence of reported second- or third-degree atrioventricular block varied between 0. 4 and 1. 8 % per annum. Medical practice, however, has shifted to predominant implantation of DDD/R pacemakers in more than 95 % of {{patients with}} sick sinus syndrome. Recent publications have reported an increase in left atrial diameter, decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening and increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with DDD/R pacing as compared with patients with single <b>chamber</b> atrial <b>devices.</b> These changes were proportional to the percentage of ventricular paced beats...|$|R
25|$|The DAVID {{trials have}} shown that {{unnecessary}} pacing of the right ventricle can exacerbate heart failure and increases the incidence of atrial fibrillation.

Our {{aim was to}} retrospectively assess the prevalence of VT clustering in primary and secondary SCD prevention pts and in single, dual and triple <b>chamber</b> ICD <b>device.</b> MethodsWe studied 360 consecutive pts with ischemic cariomyopathy who underwent ICD implantation for primary (20 %) and secondary (80 %) SCD prevention, over a mean follow-up period of 8 (5 years. Single, dual and triple chamber ICD was implanted in 29 %, 61 % and 10 % respectively of pts. Stored endocardial electrograms {{were used to determine}} the causative rhythm disorders provoking ICD activation. ResultsVT arrhythmic clustering was recorded in 43 pts (12 %). Concerning primary and secondary prevention pts, the prevalence was 4 % and 14 % respectively (p<. 001). Concerning Single, Dual and Triple <b>chamber</b> <b>device,</b> the prevalence was 12, 5 %, 11, 9 % and 12, 1 % respectively (p=NS).

40|$|Abstract The precipitating event {{leading to}} stroke, myocar-dial infarction, and/or sudden death {{may be related}} to the {{formation}} of mural thrombus at the site of a ruptured or superficially damaged stenotic plaque. The fluid dynamic properties at atherosclerotic plaques that may be implicated in this thrombus formation have been described in a wide variety of model systems in both the process of plaque rupture and the growth of platelet thrombi. In general, the local fluid dynamic conditions are complex and show major variations from flow in well-defined laminar flow systems. However, no studies have attempted to quantify the effect of stenosis-related distur-bances on thrombus formation in native human blood and to compare them with the local fluid dynamics.

40|$|The {{retention}} and adhesion of melamine formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules on a model fabric surface {{in aqueous solution}} were investigated using a customised flow chamber technique and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
