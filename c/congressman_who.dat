25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Houston City Council {{considered}} {{a plan to}} rename the airport after Mickey Leland—an African-American U.S. <b>Congressman</b> <b>who</b> died in an aviation accident in Ethiopia. Instead of renaming the whole airport, the city named Mickey Leland International Arrivals Building, which would later become Mickey Leland Terminal D, after the congressman. In April 1997, Houston City Council unanimously voted to rename the airport George Bush Intercontinental Airport/Houston, after George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Despite the transcontinental {{success and}} {{millions}} in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy {{less than three}} years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Crédit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad. The scandal hit epic proportions in the United States presidential election, 1872, which saw the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant and became the biggest scandal of the Gilded Age. It would not be resolved until the death of the <b>congressman</b> <b>who</b> was supposed to have reined in its excesses but instead wound up profiting from it.|$|E

25|$|While picking LaHood drew {{praise for}} its {{bipartisan}} symbolism {{there was also}} a sense that LaHood’s lack of expertise would diminish the department’s role in 2009 major policy debates and leave him as more of a ceremonial figure. James Oberstar, the Democratic <b>Congressman</b> <b>who</b> chaired the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, was expected to hold more influence and will likely play a stronger leading role. Oberstar praised LaHood’s “temperament” and “managerial talent,” but when asked to cite an issue LaHood championed during his time on the Transportation Committee in the 1990s, Oberstar seemingly drew a blank. “I can’t point to any specific legislation that he authored,” he said. “He was a team player all the way through.” Oberstar said LaHood would play a supporting role on tough policy calls.|$|E

25|$|As Speaker of the House, {{she also}} spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 {{as part of}} the 100-Hour Plan. The Act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was {{initially}} absent from the act, but as part of HR 2206 it was included. One Republican <b>congressman</b> <b>who</b> voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer. Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002. As of the 2002, 2004, and 2006 election cycles, Del Monte has not contributed to Democratic candidates.|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 2009, {{national}} news media {{reported that the}} {{five of the seven}} CtW unions had met with seven of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO in talks which explored the possibility of the five CtW unions rejoining the larger labor federation. Impetus for the talks came as the Obama administration signalled to both labor federations that it preferred to deal with a united rather than fragmented labor movement. Also, several Change to Win unions also concluded that they were not getting any significant advantage from being in a separate labor federation, and that a fragmented labor union was doing more harm than good. David Bonior, a former U.S. <b>Congressman</b> <b>who</b> once led the AFL-CIO's American Rights at Work division and {{who was a member of}} Barack Obama's presidential transition team, facilitated the meeting, and said talks were scheduled to last several weeks. The five CtW unions present included the Laborers, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE HERE. AFL-CIO unions present included AFSCME, the AFT, the Electrical Workers, the UAW, and the United Steelworkers. Also in attendance was Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, which is independent and belongs to neither group.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the redrawn 17th {{appeared}} to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% {{of his former}} territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% {{of the vote in}} 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a <b>congressman</b> <b>who</b> didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.|$|E

500|$|The Declaration's {{relationship}} to slavery {{was taken up}} in 1854 by Abraham Lincoln, a little-known former <b>Congressman</b> <b>who</b> idolized the Founding Fathers.

For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 Peoria speech, Lincoln said: ...|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the congressmen}} {{from the former}} Confederate states were either {{prevented}} from leaving the state or were arrested {{on the way to}} the capital.
