5|$|Media exposés {{and popular}} outrage led Congress {{to pass by}} {{unanimous}} vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized the production and sale of child porn. This act {{was signed into law}} by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. The legislation was supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of <b>children</b> <b>need</b> not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance.|$|E

25|$|Although neither {{introversion}} nor extraversion is pathological, psychotherapists {{can take}} temperament {{into account when}} treating clients. Clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Teachers can also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils, for example acknowledging that introverted <b>children</b> <b>need</b> more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{anatomical}} {{and physiological}} differences, injuries in <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to be approached differently {{from those in}} adults. Accidents are {{the leading cause of}} death in children between 1 and 14 years old. In the United States, approximately sixteen million children go to an emergency department due to some form of injury every year, with boys being more frequently injured than girls by a ratio of 2:1. The world's five most common unintentional injuries in children as of 2008 are road crashes, drowning, burns, falls, and poisoning.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{educational}} {{psychologists have}} conducted {{research on the}} instructional applicability of Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur {{at the same time}} in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.|$|E
25|$|A {{higher than}} average {{concentration}} of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as {{the primary reason for}} an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.|$|E
25|$|As infants grow, food {{supplements}} are added. Many parents choose commercial, ready-made baby foods to supplement breast milk or formula for the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary {{needs of their}} child. Whole cow's milk can be used at one year, but lower-fat milk is not recommended until the child is 2 to 3 years old. Weaning is the process through which breast milk is eliminated from the infant's diet through the introduction of solid foods in exchange for milk. Until they are toilet-trained, infants in industrialized countries wear diapers. The transition from diapers to cloth undergarments is an important transition {{in the development of}} an infant/baby to that of a toddler. <b>Children</b> <b>need</b> more sleep than adults—up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages. Until babies learn to walk, they are carried in the arms, held in slings or baby carriers, or transported in baby carriages or strollers. Most industrialized countries have laws requiring child safety seats for babies in motor vehicles.|$|E

500|$|All God's <b>Children</b> <b>Need</b> Traveling Shoes, {{published}} in 1986, {{is the fifth}} book in African-American writer and poet Maya Angelou's seven-volume autobiography series. [...] Set between 1962 and 1965, the book begins when Angelou is 33 years old, and recounts the years she lived in Accra, Ghana. [...] The book, deriving its title from a Negro spiritual, begins where Angelou's previous memoir, The Heart of a Woman, ends — with the traumatic car accident involving her son Guy — and closes with Angelou returning to America.|$|E
500|$|The themes {{encompassing}} African-American writer Maya Angelou's seven autobiographies include racism, identity, family, and travel.

500|$|All God's <b>Children</b> <b>Need</b> Traveling Shoes {{was greeted}} with both praise and disappointment, {{although}} reviews of the book were generally positive. [...] According to the Poetry Foundation, [...] "Most critics have judged Angelou’s subsequent autobiographies in light of her first, and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings remains the most highly praised". [...] Hagen states that Traveling Shoes, as in her previous books, demonstrated Angelou's [...] "broad appeal" [...] to both her readers and her critics. [...] The book's accuracy was verified by her close friend and fellow expatriate Julian Mayfield.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics were}} less {{favorable}} in {{their views of}} All God's <b>Children</b> <b>Need</b> Traveling Shoes. Even though the book left interviewer Russell Harris with [...] "a haunting feeling", he found the book more [...] "pedantic" [...] than her previous books, and thought that it contained fewer fictional aspects compared to Angelou's other autobiographies. [...] Scholar John C. Gruesser found the conflicts in the book unresolved and the ending [...] "too easily manufactured {{at the last minute}} to resolve the problem of the book". [...] Reviewer Deborah E. McDowell agreed, and found the resolution of the plot to be [...] "stereotyped and unauthentic".|$|E
500|$|According to Lupton, [...] "Angelou's {{exploration}} of her African and African-American identities" [...] {{was an important}} theme in her fifth autobiography All God's <b>Children</b> <b>Need</b> Traveling Shoes. The alliances and relationships with those she met in Ghana contributed to Angelou's identity and growth. Her experiences as an expatriate helped her {{come to terms with}} her personal and historical past, {{and by the end of}} the book she was ready to return to America with a deeper understanding of both the African and American parts of her character. [...] McPherson called Angelou's parallels and connections between Africa and America her [...] "double-consciousness", which contribute to her understanding of herself.|$|E
