40|$|Abstract: Study on the {{characteristics}} of tensile bond strength in concrete interfacial transition zone. Calculate the tensile bond strength of interfacial transition zone in concrete by the way of vertical drawing <b>cobblestones</b> of different grain size from C 30 concrete by MTS hydraulic loading system. (the grain size include 50, 70, 90, 100 mm) results show that: (1) when the <b>cobblestones</b> diameter is in a certain range(< 90 mm in this experiment) or the bonded area is in a certain range(< 5251 mm 2 in this experiment), The tensile bond strength of concrete interfacial transition zone {{nothing to do with the}} <b>cobblestones</b> diameter and the bonding area. (2) If the <b>cobblestones</b> diameter or the bonded area is too large, it will affect the bonding effect of the <b>cobblestones</b> and concrete, and cause the depression of tensile bond strength; therefore, in the actual engineering we should avoid the use of large diameter <b>cobblestones.</b> (3) The tensile bond strength of C 30 concrete interfacial transition zone is approximately 4 %- 10 % of compressive strength of concrete. 1...|$|R

5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the <b>cobblestone</b> terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E

5|$|On Falalop Island, the seawall erected during World War II {{was entirely}} {{destroyed}} and allowed storm surge to inundate the island; however, {{at no point}} was the entire island under water. Initially, Falalop was left under 1.2m (4ft) of water, though {{by the time the}} eye moved over this had decreased to 0.6m (2ft). Along the south shore, waves reached 1.8m (6ft) and caused moderate beach erosion. Sand from the coastline was found up to 215m (700ft) inland, filling many taro pits in the island's interior. Along the south shore, two children were killed when their home collapsed, pinning them underneath debris, and water later inundated the area and drowned them. Elsewhere on the island, three people sustained minor injuries. Asor Island experienced most of its flooding as the backside of Ophelia moved through. The island was shortened by 45m (150ft) to the north and southern beaches experienced varying degrees of erosion. Mogmog Island, located at the northern end of the atoll's lagoon, saw the deposition of large boulders and <b>cobblestone</b> along its north shore which covered an area 30 to 45m (100 to 150ft) wide. Flying debris resulted in one injury on both Asor and Mogmog. To the west, Potangeras Island saw an increase in land area by 60m (200ft) as sand was pushed from other areas.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Tracheal {{follicular}} pattern or so-called tracheal <b>cobblestoning</b> is {{a poorly}} described entity {{in the literature}} and is depicted as a nodular or lumpy appearance of the tracheal wall mucosa suggesting tracheal irritation from factors like gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD) or pulmonary infection. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of tracheal <b>cobblestones</b> in a large pediatric population. METHODS A large database of rigid tracheoscopies recorded in children (0 - 6 years of age) undergoing general anesthesia with planned tracheal intubation for elective surgical procedures was retrospectively analyzed. Tracheoscopy records were reviewed by five pediatric airway experts (authors 3 - 7). Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test, chi-square or Fisher exact test as appropriate (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). RESULTS A total of 971 rigid tracheoscopy records were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 3. 3 years (range 0. 4 - 6. 0 yrs). <b>Cobblestones</b> were present in 377 out of 971 patients (38. 8 %) with a male to female prevalence of 254 (40. 6 %) / 123 (35. 5 %). None of the children under four months of age showed the presence of <b>cobblestones.</b> The prevalence of <b>cobblestones</b> was significantly less in patients under 3 years of age compared to over 3 years (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). There was no association between prevalence of <b>cobblestones</b> and GERD, current or recent respiratory infection or concomitant enlarged tonsils. CONCLUSION The prevalence of tracheal <b>cobblestones</b> in otherwise healthy children is high and is not associated with GERD or respiratory infection. The gender and age related differences are novel interesting findings that require further investigations. Pediatr Pulmonol. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
