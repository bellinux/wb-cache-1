[...] By the same token, the court said, [...] "We see nothing here that would violate the antitrust laws or that would constitute unfair competition," [...] and it reversed the district court's ruling.|$|R

5000|$|The {{application}} for the registration of a patent {{is required to}} be filed with the Registrar and should contain a request for the patent, {{a description of the}} invention seeking patent protection, and where required, drawings of it. [...] The applicant must pay the prescribed application fee. [...] The request should contain a petition to the effect that a patent be granted, it should also include important details of the applicant, the inventor and the agent, if any, as well as the title of the invention. In circumstances where the applicant is not the inventor, the request shall be submitted with a justification as to the applicant's right to the patent. [...] The description disclosing the invention should be distinct, clear and easily understood, such that a person having ordinary skill in the art is capable of <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b> It should also indicate at least one mode of <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b> [...] The essence of a claim in the request is to define {{the subject matter of the}} protection.

40|$|Formal and {{functional}} analyses of verbal behavior have been often {{considered to be}} divergent and incompatible. Yet, {{an examination of the}} history of part of the analytical approach used in Verbal Behavior (Skinner, 1957 / 1992) for the identification and conceptualization of verbal operant units discloses that it corresponds well with formal analyses of languages. Formal analyses have been <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> since <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> of writing and fall within the scope of traditional grammar and structural linguistics, particularly in analyses made by the linguist Leonard Bloomfield. The relevance of analytical instruments originated from linguistic studies (which examine and describe the practices of verbal communities) to the analysis of verbal behavior, as proposed by Skinner, relates to the conception of a verbal community as a prerequisite for the acquisition of verbal behavior. A deliberately interdisciplinary approach is advocated in this paper, with the systematic adoption of linguistic analyses and descriptions adding relevant knowledge to the design of experimental research in verbal behavior...|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, the {{sufficiency}} {{of disclosure}} requirement is complemented by an additional requirement, generally {{not found in}} other national patent jurisdictions: the [...] "best mode requirement". According to the requirement, the disclosure must also contain the inventor's [...] "best mode" [...] of making or practicing the invention. For example, if an inventor knows that a liquid should be heated to 250 degrees for optimal performance, but discloses in the patent that the liquid should be heated to [...] "above 200 degrees", then the inventor has not disclosed his [...] "best mode" [...] for <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention.</b> The best mode must be disclosed for the entire invention, and not only its innovative aspects.|$|E

In other words, it is {{not sufficient}} to establish a lack of clarity of the claims for establishing lack of compliance with Article 83 EPC (...); it is necessary to show that the lack of clarity affects the patent as a whole (i.e. not only the claims) and that it is such that the skilled person - who can avail himself of the description and his common general knowledge - is hindered from <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> (...)." ...|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{mammography}} of {{the compressed}} breast is well {{recognized as the}} “gold standard” for early detection of breast cancer, but its performance is not ideal. One limitation of screening mammography is tissue superposition, particularly for dense breasts. Since 2001, several research groups in the USA and in the European Union have developed computed tomography (CT) systems with digital detector technology dedicated to x-ray imaging of the uncompressed breast (breast CT or BCT) for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. This CT technology—tracing back to initial studies in the 1970 s—allows some {{of the limitations of}} mammography to be overcome, keeping the levels of radiation dose to the radiosensitive breast glandular tissue similar to that of two-view mammography for the same breast size and composition. This paper presents an evaluation of <b>the</b> research efforts <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in <b>the</b> <b>invention,</b> development, and improvement of BCT with dedicated scanners with state-of-the-art technology, including initial steps toward commercialization, {{after more than a decade}} of R&D in the laboratory and/or in the clinic. The intended focus here is on the technological/engineering aspects of BCT and on outlining advantages and limitations as reported in the related literature. Prospects for future research in this field are discussed...|$|R

I grieve to think how we neglected them, and only noticed them when it suited our convenience.

40|$|Trade {{secrecy and}} patent rights {{traditionally}} {{have been considered}} mutually exclusive. Trade secret rights are premised on secrecy. Patent rights, on the other hand, require public disclosure. Absent a sufficiently {{detailed description of the}} invention, patents are invalid. However, {{with the passage of the}} Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (“AIA”) last fall, this once black-and-white distinction may melt into something a little more gray. Now, an inventor’s failure to disclose in her patent the preferred method for <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>invention</b> — the so-called “best mode” — will no longer invalidate her patent rights or otherwise render them unenforceable. In this Essay, we explain why it may become routine post-patent reform for patentees to attempt to assert both patent rights and trade secret rights for preferred embodiments of their invention in certain types of cases. We also consider potentially undesirable ramifications of this change and suggest one approach courts may use to limit claims of concurrent trade secret and patent protection when equity demands...|$|E
