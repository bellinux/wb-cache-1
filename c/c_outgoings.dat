40|$|Longitudinal changepoint data {{naturally}} {{arise in}} many applications. Examples include transition of core body temperature following the hypothermia therapy and prostate-specific antigen levels following treatment. Note {{that the trend}} change occurs due to a shock (e. g., treatment) to the system. Thus, an individual exhibiting a linear trend could be an indication of insignificant effects of the shock. One {{of the goals of}} this type of study is to investigate whether the shock is significantly associated in changing the trend of a trajectory. The bent-cable model characterizes the shock-through data using three phases: (a) an incoming phase characterizing the trend before the shock comes into effect, (b) a transition due to the shock, and (<b>c)</b> an <b>outgoing</b> phase due to the after-shock effects. In this article, we develop bent-cable methodology accounting for trajectories exhibiting either a linear trend or a trend change characterized by gradual or abrupt transition...|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, White was a Moderate Republican whereas most South Carolina party members and {{officials}} at that time were conservatives who had supported Barry Goldwater and Richard M. Nixon for U.S. President in 1964 and 1968. In 1970, White endorsed the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, John <b>C.</b> West, the <b>outgoing</b> lieutenant governor, rather than Republican Albert Watson, the U.S. representative from South Carolina's 2nd congressional district who carried the backing of U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond in a determined bid {{to become the first}} GOP governor of the state since Reconstruction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In a graph G = (V, E), a vertex subset S ⊆ V of size k {{is called}} c-isolated {{if it has}} less than <b>c</b> · k <b>outgoing</b> edges. We repair a nontrivially flawed {{algorithm}} for enumerating all c-isolated cliques due to Ito et al. [European Symposium on Algorithms 2005] and obtain an algorithm running in O(4 c · c 4 · |E|) time. We describe a speedup trick that also helps parallelizing the enumeration. Moreover, we introduce a more restricted and a more general isolation concept and show that both lead to faster enumeration algorithms. Finally, we extend our considerations to s-plexes (a relaxation of the clique notion), pointing out a W[1]-hardness result and providing a fixed-parameter algorithm for enumerating isolated s-plexes. ...|$|R

Algorithms, to appear] gave an algorithm to enumerate all c-isolated maximal cliques in O(4 c ·c 4 · |E|) time. We extend this to enumerating all maximal c-isolated cliques (which are a superset) and improve the running time bound to O(2. 89 c ·c 2 ·|E|), using modifications which also facilitate parallelizing the enumeration. Moreover, we introduce a more restricted and a more general isolation concept and show that both lead to faster enumeration algorithms. Finally, we extend our considerations to s-plexes (a relaxation of the clique notion), providing a W[1]-hardness result when {{the size of the}} s-plex is the parameter and a fixed-parameter algorithm for enumerating isolated s-plexes when the parameter describes the degree of isolation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rejection}} of Haynsworth {{became an issue}} in the 1970 race for governor of South Carolina. James B. Edwards, an oral surgeon from Charleston, who was then the Republican chairman of South Carolina's 1st congressional district, claimed that the Democratic candidate, John <b>C.</b> West, the <b>outgoing</b> lieutenant governor, had opposed Haynsworth's confirmation, a claim that West denied. Edwards claimed that the election of West over the Republican nominee, U.S. Representative Albert Watson of South Carolina's 2nd congressional district, a Haynsworth supporter, would mean an [...] "ultra-liberal, minority-dominated state government." [...] Democrats accused Edwards of [...] "twisting the truth almost beyond belief." [...] West defeated Watson, but in 1974 Edwards was himself narrowly elected as the first Republican governor of South Carolina since Reconstruction. At the time governors of South Carolina could not succeed themselves. Edwards was also the first United States Secretary of Energy in the Ronald W. Reagan administration.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Henderson was the {{unsuccessful}} Republican {{nominee for}} lieutenant governor of South Carolina. He {{lost to the}} Democrat Earle Morris, Jr., of Pickens. Henderson ran on the ticket headed by conservative U.S. Representative Albert Watson of South Carolina's 2nd congressional district, who lost the general election to the Democrat John <b>C.</b> West, the <b>outgoing</b> lieutenant governor, as the state swung to the left in the 1970 elections. Henderson questioned West's rhetoric: Why, he asked, had family income in South Carolina under Democrat state government declined over the previous two decades from 45th to 47th position nationally? Henderson also noted that average wages were higher in North Carolina or Georgia than in South Carolina. Henderson trailed Watson's total vote by 4,491 (.7 of 1 percent); hence virtually all Republican voters backed their party candidates for governor and lieutenant governor. Henderson received 216,745 votes (45.2 percent); Morris, 254,745 (53.3 percent). An Independent held the remaining 7,320 votes (1.5 percent).|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) are the {{two most}} toxic heavy metals listed among trace elements. Emission limit values for these exist when burning waste in European Union (EU) countries. These {{emission}} limits are also valid for the case of co-combustion of waste fractions with a clean biomass as wood chips originating from stem wood. This has been studied in the 12 MWth boiler located at Chalmers University of Technology by means of co-combustion of municipal sewage sludge and/or sorted, crushed and pre-dried waste pellets from IcoPower in the Netherlands. As base fuel a clean biomass was used consisting of only stem wood in the form of wood chips. Emissions of Hg and Cd were measured in the stack. An evaluation was also made of the importance of a highly efficient textile bag filter for the prevention of these emissions. Due to higher concentrations of Hg and Cd in the waste fuel streams, higher loading of Hg and Cd into the boiler was attained. The distribution of Hg and <b>Cd</b> into the <b>outgoing</b> flue-gas and fly ash streams was also determined...|$|R
