[...] All told, five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883. [...] A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles (~5km) downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals. [...] Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water {{by the use of}} sluice gates and head gates. [...] The drought of 1901–1902 caused the Jordan River, on occasion, to stop flowing, and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake. It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time, and contained seven pumps with a total capacity of [...] per second. [...] Twice, during the droughts of 1934 and 1992, Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry. [...] In the 1950s, due to flood control measures to increase river velocity, large sections of the river were straightened in Salt Lake County. [...] As part of the straightening process, meanders or curves in the river were cut off and the <b>channel</b> <b>slope</b> was increased. [...] The river was also shifted to opposite sides of the flood plain in Midvale and Murray as part of local smelter operations.|$|E

50|$|In {{sedimentary}} geology and fluvial geomorphology, avulsion is {{the rapid}} abandonment {{of a river}} channel {{and the formation of}} a new river channel. Avulsions occur as a result of <b>channel</b> <b>slopes</b> that are much less steep than the slope that the river could travel if it took a new course.|$|R
30|$|Natural rivers {{are often}} {{connected}} {{to one or}} two floodplains on their sides. Consequently, the flow sections of rivers may be symmetric or asymmetric compound sections. In many hydraulic projects, open channels are often designed and constructed as multi-stage compound channels to increase the stability of <b>channel</b> <b>slopes</b> and to carry different flow rates. Therefore, it is essential to understand the flow mechanism of compound channels with overbank flow conditions.|$|R
2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or <b>channel</b> <b>slope.</b> [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in <b>channel</b> <b>slope.</b> [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} upslope {{factor in determining}} flood magnitude is the land area of the watershed upstream of the area of interest. Rainfall intensity is the second {{most important}} factor for watersheds of less than approximately 30 sq mi.

50|$|Rivers {{can also}} avulse {{due to the}} erosion of a new channel that creates a straighter path through the landscape. This can happen during large floods in {{situations}} in which {{the slope of the}} new channel is significantly greater than that of the old channel. Where the new <b>channel's</b> <b>slope</b> is about the same as the old <b>channel's</b> <b>slope,</b> a partial avulsion will occur in which both channels are occupied by flow. An example of an erosional avulsion is the 2006 avulsion of the Suncook River in New Hampshire, in which heavy rains caused flow levels to rise. The flow level rise was pronounced behind an old mill dam, which produced a shallowly-sloping pool that overtopped a sand and gravel quarry, connected with a downstream section of channel, and cut a new (and shorter) channel at a rate of 25-50 meters per hour. Sediment mobilised by this erosional avulsion produced a depositionally-forced meander cutoff further downstream by superelevating the bed around the meander bend to nearly the level of the floodplain.|$|R

Although the perfect CSI is used, the channel coefficients mismatch between the PLM and the perfect channel coefficients still exists and will be more significant with the increasing normalized Doppler frequency. However, the proposed model will be more accurate than the ones used in [8, 20], which approximate the channels by the midpoint CIR with the slopes between two consecutive OFDM symbols rather than the two segments or only the midpoint CIR in one particular segment.|$|R

40|$|Restoration of streams {{that were}} {{formerly}} channelized for timber-floating {{has become increasingly}} common. Generally, this restoration returns boulders from riparian zones to streams, leading to wider, more heterogeneous channels with slower flows. The primary goal is to enhance fish populations, but riparian vegetation {{is also expected to}} be favoured. However, increases in floristic diversity have not been observed and reasons for this slow response are still unknown. One possible explanation might be the lack of colonist pools. I therefore investigated how surrounding plant compositions influence riparian recovery. The vascular plant flora was identified in riparian sites and in adjacent upstream riparian and upland sites. Four reach types were included: unchannelized, channelized, restored and demonstration restored. Species richness and floristic similarities among types of sites and reaches were compared. Correlations with upland and upstream <b>channel</b> <b>slopes</b> were made and the importance of variation in seed floating ability was tested. The results show that unchannelized reaches were floristically similar to their adjacent upstream riparian and upland sites, whereas channelized reaches showed more different floras. Restoration created a somewhat more homogeneous flora among the three site types and demonstration restored reaches were most similar to upstream sites. Soil moisture conditions (i. e. wetland vs. forest) in the uplands had stronger impacts on species similarities than upland or upstream <b>channel</b> <b>slopes.</b> I conclude that adjacent sites are important for floristic recovery of riparian reaches and that demonstration restoration is most advantageous for riparian recovery. I recommend protection of upland sites from forestry to facilitate recovery. Local- and landscape-scale effects on biodiversity after stream restoratio...|$|R

50|$|The channel form is {{described}} in terms of geometry (plan, cross-sections, profile) enclosed by the materials of its bed and banks. This form is under influence of two major forces: water discharge and sediment supply.
