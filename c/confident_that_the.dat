Cortés was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of Olid's men would rally to las Casas, and only assigned him about 150 men for the expedition. Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, {{who was in the}} Naco valley.|$|E

Shortly after they learn that a Russian Foxtrot class submarine has been hijacked by creatures whose descriptions match the Replicators, Thor arrives at Stargate Command and asks SG-1 for help against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy. As Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) go {{to deal with the}} hijacked submarine, Major Carter (Amanda Tapping) goes with Thor.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. <b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E

5|$|Despite the polls, Douglas was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Democratic {{registration}} edge {{would lead}} her to victory, {{so much so}} that she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office. On election day, November 7, 1950, Nixon defeated Douglas by 59percent to 41. Of California's 58counties, Douglas won only five, all in Northern California and with relatively small populations; Nixon won every urban area. Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin, Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate. Douglas, in her concession speech, declined to congratulate Nixon. Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. <b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UN air force could detect and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E

It opened in Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and New York City on December 9, 1988.

The film opened in wide release on January 27, 1989, playing at 1,058 theaters, and expanding to 1,074 theatres by its ninth week.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1943 {{national}} elections in French Mandatory Syria, the French authorities attempted {{to negotiate with}} Quwatli {{as head of the}} National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria's alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return for French help in securing Quwatli's election to the presidency. Quwatli refused, believing the Syrian people would view such negotiations negatively. He was also <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> National Bloc would win the elections regardless of French support. Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria's president on 17 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{recording}} quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder's size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver a good show. Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E

Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of Sicily, OKW feared that Italy would {{withdraw}} from the war, but Kesselring remained <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italians would continue to fight. OKW regarded Kesselring and von Rintelen as too pro-Italian and began to bypass him, sending Rommel to northern Italy, and Student to Rome, where his I Parachute Corps was under OKW orders to occupy the capital in case of Italian defection. Benito Mussolini was removed from power on 25 July 1943 and Rommel and OKW began {{to plan for the}} occupation of Italy and the disarmament of the Italian Army. Kesselring remained uninformed of these plans for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone {{in on his}} office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to {{identify}} two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} {{the problems and}} withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. <b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threat of invasion had been a success, the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $51.1million on its five-day {{opening weekend}} (June 27 – July 1, 2012) from 13 markets, with strong {{openings}} in many Asian countries. In India, it earned $6.0million, a record opening for a Hollywood film. Its final box office collection in India was $20 million {{making it the}} eightth highest grossing Hollywood film in India of all time. Kercy Daruwala of Sony Pictures in India felt very <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of famed Indian actor Irrfan Khan would enhance attendance. Opening in an additional 61 markets, the film made $127.5million over its second weekend. The movie ranked number one in over 30 countries. In Indonesia, it broke the opening-weekend record with $4.5million while, in the UK, it opened to £11.1 million ($18.1million) which is about equal with Spider-Man 3 (£11.8 million). In its last market, China, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $33.3 million over its seven-day debut, {{which is more than}} Spider-Man 3’s lifetime box office in China. China is also the movie's highest-grossing territory with $48.8 million.|$|E

5|$|Tri-Star Pictures {{had planned}} to release the film using a {{platform}} technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> limited theatrical run would generate strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. Birdy opened in limited release on December 21, 1984 in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A Films prompted the studio to refocus the film's marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, Modine and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. Birdy was a box office bomb, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, well below its estimated budget of $12 million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{results of}} the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan {{was the first to}} declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
