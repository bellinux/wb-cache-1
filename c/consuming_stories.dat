40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the effect that the news station {{affiliation}} of individuals 2 ̆ 7 primary news source has on their perception of violent crime in America. Past studies have indicated that politically conservative news stations use stories to promote the idea that it is the responsibility of the government to protect victims of crimes and potential victims of crimes through incarceration, whereas politically liberal news sources use stories to promote the idea that rehabilitation benefits society as a whole better than incarceration. Studies have also found that individuals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of crime are influenced by the media. The {{purpose of this}} study is to add to this literature by examining whether or not the political leanings of the news stations has an effect on the perceptions of individuals <b>consuming</b> <b>stories</b> from those news stations. Data was collected through a survey administered to one hundred and fifty Butler undergraduates between the ages of 18 and 24 in a classroom setting. Data was collected on the news sources individuals are most likely to watch, individual perceptions on the prevalence of violent crimes on T. V. and in reality, and whether or not individuals believe that what news stations they watch had an effect on their own perceptions. Respondents were also asked to report their own political affiliation and ideology. It is hypothesized that media consumption will affect individuals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of violent crime in America and that participants that obtain their news from a conservative station will perceive that violent crime is more prevalent than participants that obtain their news from a liberal station...|$|E
50|$|Nys {{also started}} in 1963 the fairytale comic Langteen en Schommelbuik (Longtoe and Wobblebelly), which ended after 11 stories because {{the work on}} Jommeke became too time <b>consuming.</b> The <b>stories,</b> a {{spin-off}} of some figures from the 14th story of Jommeke, were {{a result of his}} fascination with the work of Disney. They reappeared in the 168th Jommeke story. Apart from the continuous stories in the newspaper, a few hundred weekly Jommeke gags appeared on the back cover of the Flemish comic magazine Ohee.|$|R
40|$|Consumers of {{mass media}} must have a comprehensive, {{balanced}} and plural selection of news to get an unbiased perspective; but achieving this goal can be very challenging, laborious and time <b>consuming.</b> News <b>stories</b> development over time, its (in) consistency, and different level of coverage across the media outlets are challenges that a conscientious reader has to overcome in order to alleviate bias. In this paper we present an intelligent agent framework currently facilitating analysis of the main sources of on-line news in El Salvador. We show how prior tools of text analysis and Web 2. 0 technologies can be combined with minimal manual intervention to help individuals on their rational decision process, while holding media outlets accountable for their work...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{storytelling}} approach, called Hypermedia Novel (HYMN), that extends the classical narration concept of a story. We develop an underlying modular concept – the narration module – that facilitates a new manner of reception as well as creation of a story. The HYMN focuses on the recipient and his role of <b>consuming</b> a <b>story</b> and a heterogeneous group of creative authors by providing narration modules and their interfaces without defining the granularity of the modules. Using several kinds ofmultimedia elements and a hyperlink structure, we present a first demonstrator that implements this new concept. We also discuss improvements, e. g. MPEG- 4 / 7, that support both reception by the audience, {{and the process of}} creating the story by a dispersed team of authors...|$|R

Other <b>stories</b> emerged about how he did his own dental work and fixed a broken nose with a pair of pliers and a few shots of Jack Daniel's whiskey, stood out; by mid-season, Charboneau {{was the subject of a}} song, [...] "Go Joe Charboneau", that reached #3 on the local charts.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{addresses}} {{the dynamics of}} materiality over time and space. In cross-cultural, multi-temporal and interdisciplinary studies the authors examine how things gain meaning and status, generate a multitude of emotions, and feed into the propagation of myths, narratives and discourses. The book is divided according to four themes: soft objects, stoic <b>stories,</b> <b>consuming</b> and the collectable, and waste and technologies. The first section discusses the meanings of the lived environment on the individual and national levels. The second section provides specific examples {{on the role of}} things in identity construction. The third section focuses on historical and contemporary aspects of consumption and collecting. The phenomena under scrutiny in the fourth section are moral dilemmas associated with and representations of dirt/waste and advancements in science and technology. Presenting diverse case studies of material culture, the volume points to rich interdisciplinary approaches in cultural theory...|$|R
500|$|Around 6:30 pm on {{the evening}} of Friday, December 26, 1873, the three-story Orange Hotel station depot caught fire. Some staff of the re-christened Erie Railroad were {{examining}} a room in the roof of the building, and upon looking into it, found it engulfed in smoke. The fire quickly spread, <b>consuming</b> the entire <b>story.</b> There was a lull, but the building re-ignited as flames continued through the building. The Mansard roof on top of the building was destroyed by the flames. No fire-ridding materials to douse the blaze were available to staff and no one could get near the building to inspect where the flames were. The flames finally destroyed the entire building, and just two hours after the fire was discovered, the walls began to collapse on the structure. Within a half-hour, the entire hotel/depot had collapsed and was a pile of brick ruins. Train service on the Erie main line was disrupted for several hours due to the fire and station depot collapse. A later study determined the station depot burned down due to a defective flue.|$|R
40|$|In The Guardian, Alan Rushbridger {{compared}} {{the future of}} newspapers to climate change. Five years ago, many climatologists were sceptical whether climate change was a real and serious issue. Today, most scientists agree {{that global warming is}} a fact of life. In the world of newspapers, at present, almost everyone agrees that the traditional, particularly quality, newspapers are facing huge problems. The blog ‘Print is dead’ chose a fitting title for Rushbridger’s article: Print is dead: an inconvenient truth. Another traditional icon of the information society, the public library, is facing similar problems as the newspaper industry. The information function, the core business of the library, is under threat. People tend to use search engines at home instead of visiting and accessing the (virtual) library and ask for professional advice. It {{is important to note that}} these search engines are more and more driven by commercial interests than by a genuine concern of quality information. Ranking algorithms are more beauty contests and quality stamps. (Local) governments tend to demand more and more new social services included in the library. Commercial publishers’ concerns are understandable. In the United States and Europe the world of the press faces a real crisis, and the battle to survive is a race against the clock. Newspapers, especially the quality press, will only survive if they can persuade the audience of generation Z to read them on the Web. Failure to do this will signal their demise. We will discuss the tensions in this field by addressing the mutual relationships between the stock market driven economic business model and the traditional characteristics of quality journalism as well as the cultural changes in <b>consuming</b> news <b>stories</b> and analyses in print and on the web. The key question is: how these societal tendencies will affect the quality of information consumed by the public and hence the public quality of discourse? This paper aims to address both issues by asking whether quality is really under siege and to what extent can the new, convergent media improve the quality of the information society by fostering the interaction of the roles of journalists and librarians. In the new world of journalism and librarianship both will prove their roles and functions by engagement, enrichment, empowerment and entertainment for both readers and library users...|$|R
