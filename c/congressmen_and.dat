5|$|In {{response}} to this, a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met <b>congressmen</b> <b>and</b> senators in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing {{the need for}} a space telescope, and eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States <b>congressmen</b> <b>and</b> fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E
5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from <b>congressmen</b> <b>and</b> other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{remained}} {{involved in}} Philippine affairs. During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904, he urged that Philippine agricultural products {{be admitted to}} the U.S. without duty. This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to complain to Roosevelt, who remonstrated with his Secretary of War. Taft expressed unwillingness to change his position, and threatened to resign; Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter. Taft returned to the islands in 1905, leading a delegation of <b>congressmen,</b> <b>and</b> again in 1907, to open the first Philippine Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Van Rensselaer had {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} history of the United States. The American Van Rensselaers all descend from Kiliaen's son Jeremias and the {{subsequent}} Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States, producing multiple State Legislators, <b>Congressmen,</b> <b>and</b> two Lieutenant Governors in New York.|$|E
5|$|From 1858 to 1860, Crittenden {{sought out}} moderates from all {{sections}} {{of the country to}} effect compromise on the territorial and slavery issues, thus averting war. In 1860, he was named chair of the National Union Executive Committee, a group of <b>congressmen</b> <b>and</b> journalists who feared that sectional differences would destroy the Union. His efforts helped form the Constitutional Union Party later that year. Chosen as the keynote speaker at the party's national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to become their nominee for president. At age seventy-three, however, Crittenden was already contemplating retirement and instead orchestrated the nomination of John Bell, whom he actively supported in the 1860 presidential race.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making {{millions of acres of}} government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern <b>congressmen</b> <b>and</b> senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1923, {{during a}} {{procession}} by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event {{resulted in a}} confrontation between the <b>Congressmen</b> <b>and</b> the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, {{on the first of}} May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{struck at}} least several hundred {{patterns}} using Longacre's flying eagle design in the proposed composition. In an effort to secure public acceptance of the new pieces, these were distributed to various <b>congressmen</b> <b>and</b> other officials, initially in November 1856. Two hundred {{were sent to the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, while four were given to President Franklin Pierce. At least 634 specimens were distributed, and possibly several thousand; extra were available on request. This was the origin of the highly collectable 1856 Flying Eagle cent, which is considered by numismatists as part of the Flying Eagle series although it was actually a pattern or transition piece, not an official coin, as congressional approval had not yet been granted. Additional 1856 small cents were later struck by Snowden for illicit sale, and to exchange for pieces the Mint sought for its coin collection.|$|E

25|$|Because {{ratification}} of the Bell Trade Act required a two-thirds vote of the House and the Senate, Primicias - with the eight other <b>Congressmen</b> <b>and</b> the three Senators - were unseated from the Philippine Congress on spurious charges while the ratification process was underway {{in order to ensure}} its passage. Upon appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court all twelve legislators were reinstated, but by that time their temporary ejection had served its purpose and the Bell Trade Act had already been ratified.|$|E

Judah returned to Washington in December 1859.

25|$|Virginia has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} more Republican Southern states, for instance it was the only Southern state not to vote for Jimmy Carter in 1976, its congressional delegation is mostly conservative, with eight of eleven <b>Congressmen</b> <b>and</b> both Senators belonging to the Republican Party prior to the 2006 election, this made Virginia's Congressional delegation the most Republican of any Southern state. Despite this, Democrats had won the previous two gubernatorial races, in 2001 and 2005. The state's political majority has been changing from conservative white to a mixture of races, especially Hispanic. The state is increasingly diverse; it has the highest percentage of Asians (4.7%, according to the 2005 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census) of any Southern state. 9.9% of Virginians are foreign-born.|$|E
25|$|Riding {{a wave of}} {{approval}} during a dramatic economic recovery from a 2001-02 crisis, the Kirchners' FPV had prevailed enjoyed increasingly large majorities in Congress, reaching their peak following the 2007 general elections (with 153 <b>Congressmen</b> <b>and</b> 44 Senators, at the time). In March 2008, Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, effectively raising levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, starting on March 12, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on the new taxation scheme. They were joined on March 25 by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and in front of the presidential palace.|$|E
