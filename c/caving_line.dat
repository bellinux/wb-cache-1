5000|$|The cave of Trophonius: The site of {{a terrifying}} Boeotian cult to the hero Trophonius. Strepsiades dreads {{entering}} The Thinkery just {{as if it were}} this <b>cave</b> (<b>line</b> 508) ...|$|R
50|$|Wat Khao Khun Phanom and the Khao Khun Phanom Scientific Study Centre (วัดเขาขุนพนมและศูนย์วิทยาศาสตร์เพื่อการศึกษาเขาขุนพนม) Wat Khao Khun Phanom is {{a temple}} of {{historical}} and archaeological importance. The temple has a <b>cave</b> <b>lined</b> with brick and marked with heart-shaped stones marking {{the limits of}} the temple similar to those along the city wall.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>cave</b> <b>lines,</b> {{distance}} lines, penetration lines and jackstays. These are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks {{and other areas}} where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious. Guidelines are also useful {{in the event of}} silt out.|$|R
50|$|The town of Ohum is in {{a valley}} and bounded on all sides by {{beautiful}} rolling hills covered in grass. There is a waterfall (Awhum falls), about 30 meters in height and several <b>caves</b> <b>lining</b> the track to the waterfall. The track itself is actually a small stream with big rocks overhanging in some places along the track.|$|R
50|$|A second, {{more recent}} train depot, further north from the Sentul station, is {{primarily}} designated for KTM Komuter EMUs, where the storage {{and maintenance of}} a majority of the Komuter service's rolling stock take place. The depot consists of two metal framed structures covered with metal sheets located along what was a portion of the main railway lines, connected to (as of 2007) the sparsely used Sentul-Batu <b>Caves</b> single track <b>line.</b> A single railway line running around the EMU depot acts as a direct link between the Sentul station to the Sentul-Batu <b>Caves</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Cave</b> arrows, <b>Line</b> arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a <b>cave</b> <b>line</b> by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know {{which way to go}} at a line junction there is a risk of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, he or she can identify which way to turn.|$|R
50|$|It {{was later}} {{announced}} that the station would form part of a long-postpone double-tracking, modernisation and electrification of the Sentul-Batu <b>Caves</b> <b>line,</b> {{as well as the}} resumption of YTL's development project. Site possession was given to contractor YTL on November 17, 2006 and the project was scheduled to be completed in May 2009. The rebuilt Sentul station opened in 2010 as the first completion of the project.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} wave-cut arches and <b>caves</b> <b>line</b> the shore. For about 3 months in 1904 {{one of these}} caves was the home of one Kim Lee, a Cantonese {{fruiterer}} who had been diagnosed (possibly mistakenly) as a leper. Even though Matiu/Somes was the human quarantine station at the time, Lee was exiled to Mokopuna, where he was supplied with food and water by a flying fox from Matiu/Somes.|$|R
50|$|A {{distance}} <b>line,</b> penetration <b>line,</b> <b>cave</b> <b>line</b> or {{guide line}} is {{an item of}} diving equipment used by scuba divers {{as a means of}} returning to a safe starting point in conditions of low visibility, water currents or where pilotage is difficult. They are often used in cave diving and wreck diving where the diver must return to open water after a penetration when {{it may be difficult to}} discern the return route. Guidelines are also useful in the event of silt out.|$|R
5000|$|The main rail station serving Batu Caves is the [...] KC05 [...] Batu Caves Komuter station, {{opened in}} 2010 {{as part of}} the {{refurbishment}} of the Sentul-Batu <b>Caves</b> branch <b>line.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since then, {{measures}} {{were taken to}} prepare the village for a creation of value of the <b>cave,</b> in <b>line</b> with ecotourism. In order to reduce poverty, the village {{was thought to be}} involved in a large scale to benefit from the revenue. Supported by German Development Service, workshops as tourguiding and cooking trainings were arranged and a tourist guesthouse for overnight stays was built.|$|R
25|$|Double {{tracking}} and electrification of {{the stretch of}} the Batu <b>Caves</b> branch <b>line</b> between Sentul and Batu Caves are now complete, it added 7.5km of double track and electrified sections to the network. Double tracking of the West Coast line between Ipoh and Padang Besar has started in January 2008 and {{expected to be completed}} by November 2014 and will add a further 329km of double track to the network.|$|R

25|$|A {{total of}} 438km {{of the network}} is double track and electrified. They include {{portions}} of the West Coast Line between Gemas and Ipoh and the entire Kuala Lumpur-Port Klang branch line {{as well as the}} stretch between Kuala Lumpur and Sentul – Batu <b>Caves</b> branch <b>line.</b> The double-track and electrified portions between Kuala Kubu Bharu and Seremban and the Port Klang to Kuala Lumpur branch lines are used as the commuter train services.|$|R

50|$|Minnetonka Cave {{is one of}} {{the larger}} {{limestone}} caves in the state of Idaho. It is located in Cache National Forest in Bear Lake County, Idaho, United States, above the village of St. Charles (located {{at the north end of}} Bear Lake). Tours through the cave are offered from Memorial Day (weather permitting) through Labor Day by Scenic Canyons Recreational Services, the concessionaire that holds the special use permit from the United States Forest Service. The half-mile route through the <b>cave</b> is <b>lined</b> with stalactites and stalagmites.|$|R
50|$|Blombos Cave's outer talus forms a gently sloping {{platform}} of about 23m² that extends 4-5 meter southwards, before the terrain abruptly drops down towards shoreline that lies some 34,5 meters below the cave entrance. The talus, which primarily consists of Middle Stone Age deposit, rock fall and unconsolidated sediments, is stabilised by {{an area of}} large, exposed blocks (14m²). At some stage - and in between the prehistoric occupation of the cave site - these blocks have fallen down from the rock face above, effectively preventing site erosion and allowing sediments to stabilize and accumulate {{in front of the}} <b>cave's</b> drip <b>line.</b>|$|R

25|$|By 1859, {{when the}} Louisville and Nashville Railroad opened its main line between these cities, Colonel Larkin J. Procter owned the Mammoth Cave Estate. He also owned the stagecoach line that ran between Glasgow Junction (Park City) and the Mammoth <b>Cave</b> Estate. This <b>line</b> transported {{tourists}} to Mammoth Caves until 1886, when he established the Mammoth Cave Railroad.|$|R
50|$|The Grotto {{comprises}} {{a number}} of small flint <b>lined</b> <b>caves</b> set in a semi-circle. Originally these were next to the driveway to the Abbey just down from the gatehouse at the original main gate to the estate. They can now be accessed {{on the other side of}} the Fastrack bus road from the Cave of the Seven Heads.|$|R
50|$|The road {{used to have}} a level {{crossing}} with the Sentul-Batu <b>Caves</b> railway branch <b>line.</b> As part of the KTM railway double-tracking and electrification project, and the extension of the KTM Komuter service to Batu Caves, the {{level crossing}} was eliminated by building a spiral bridge across the railway. Construction began in 2007 and was completed in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|In Terrence Malick's film Badlands, the nicknames of {{the protagonists}} are Red and Kit, a {{possible}} reference to Stevens's poem, [...] "Red Loves Kit". Nick <b>Cave</b> cited the <b>lines</b> [...] "And the waves, the waves were soldiers moving" [...] in his song [...] "We Call Upon the Author". They come from Stevens's poem [...] "Dry Loaf".|$|R
50|$|The main {{intercity}} {{passenger train}} operator is Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB), a corporation {{owned by the}} Malaysian government. It operates KTM Intercity passenger trains on both main lines and the Bukit Mertajam-Butterworth branch. The other branch lines are either used for freight or not used at all, {{with the exception of}} the Kuala Lumpur-Port Klang and Batu Junction-Sentul stretch of the Batu <b>Caves</b> branch <b>lines</b> which are used for its commuter train service, KTM Komuter. The commuter service also uses the double-track and electrified portions of the West Coast Line between Rawang and Seremban. KTMB is also the main operator of freight trains in Malaysia.|$|R
60|$|A gorge in {{the yellow}} rock opened {{suddenly}} before us. We stood at the constricted neck {{of one of the}} great splits in the second wall. The side opposite was almost perpendicular, and formed of mass on mass of broken stones. This was a weathered slope on a gigantic scale. Points of cliffs jutted out; <b>caves</b> and cracks <b>lined</b> the wall.|$|R
50|$|The Big Sugar is {{used for}} {{recreation}} during all seasons. Camping, hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, swimming and canoeing {{are some of the}} activities available along Big Sugar Creek. Spring and summer offer the best floating conditions.

50|$|Stoke's back <b>line</b> <b>caved</b> in {{regularly}} and seven goals were put past them on three occasions at Mansfield, Northampton and Walsall. Stoke finished 25th (out of 34) {{in the final}} South Regional League this season when a points average decided league placings rather than points simply because some teams didn't play as many games as others e.g. Birmingham played 16 and Stoke 36.|$|R
50|$|At a {{distance}} of 250 m from {{the southern part of}} the entrance of the <b>cave</b> the railway <b>line</b> from Serres to Drama passes. Near the railway line and on the southern side of it is the Aggitis River. As a result of the waterflow of the river the limestone layers of the mountain has been corroded and the ravine of Aggitis river has been shaped.|$|R
25|$|The main {{intercity}} {{passenger train}} operator is Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB), a corporation {{owned by the}} Malaysian government. It operates KTM Intercity passenger trains on both main lines and the Bukit Mertajam-Butterworth branch, as well as electrified KTM ETS passenger trains along the Gemas - Pandang Besar stretch. The other branch lines are either used for freight or not used at all, {{with the exception of}} the Kuala Lumpur-Port Klang and Batu Junction-Sentul stretch of the Batu <b>Caves</b> branch <b>lines</b> which are used for its commuter train service, KTM Komuter. The commuter service also uses the double-track and electrified portions of the West Coast Line between Rawang and Seremban. KTMB is also the main operator of freight trains in Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cave</b> diving: Guide <b>lines</b> {{are used}} in cave diving as {{standard}} procedure whenever {{it is possible that}} the divers may be confused about the way out. In effect, this is in any dive where there is no free surface overhead and where daylight is not visible at all points of the dive. By the most common definition of cave diving, this would mean guide lines should be used for all cave dives.|$|R
5000|$|According to Malcom Field and Guanguan Li: Flow {{along the}} length of the cave is {{relatively}} uniform along much of its length, but older, higher passages can be inundated by flood-flow conditions. Blocks of the Lost River Chert routinely detach from <b>cave</b> walls and <b>line</b> the <b>cave</b> floor as the limestone dissolves away. The detached chert blocks create minor detention backwaters containing immobile-flow regions. Undercut benches and recirculation with scalloped walls also serve as minor immobile flow regions.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} Land Trust, volunteers have crafted and {{maintain}} the trails. Land Trust trails include Three <b>Caves</b> Loop, Bluff <b>Line,</b> Toll Gate, Alms House, Fagan Springs, Oak Park, and Old Railroad Bed trails. [...] The Old Railroad Bed Trail preserves {{what is left of}} the path of the steam locomotive that traveled from the Huntsville Depot to the (no longer standing) Hotel Monte Sano from 1888 to 1896. This trail {{is one of the first}} 500 Rails to Trails.|$|R
