40|$|Thousands of {{landings}} {{in commercial}} transport-category (FAA, 2013) airplanes are executed {{every single day}} all over the world. Accurate touchdowns are crucial in saving excessive {{wear and tear on}} brakes, tires, and airplane structure. They are especially critical when landing on wet and/or <b>contaminated</b> <b>runways</b> or during LAHSO operations. Despite so much operational experience, the control of landing flare and touchdown accuracy is still a “hit or miss ” event. The statistics on touchdown points and the large scatter of data indicates that landings are not very accurate even when full auto-land capabilities are used (FAA, 2007). Large operational cushions (67 % for dry DLDR and 92 % for wet WLDR runway) are provided over (un-factored gross measured) demonstrated dry landing distance (gross DDLD) for airplanes used in commercial air transportation (e. g., Title 14 CFR 121). <b>Contaminated</b> <b>runways</b> may require 2 - 3 times longer runway lengths than DDLD (Daidzic & Shrestha, 2008; Daidzic, 2011 a). The highest frequency of transport-category airplane incident/accidents occurs indeed during the landing/rollout phase...|$|R
50|$|Reverse thrust mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on <b>contaminated</b> <b>runways</b> where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.|$|R

40|$|Landing {{excursion}} accidents {{have become}} a major concern over recent decades regarding airline and airport safety. Available runway friction has {{a significant impact on}} aircraft landing performance. This is especially noted when aircraft are landing on wet or otherwise <b>contaminated</b> <b>runways</b> due to the reduced braking action, which has been well documented since the dawn of the jet aircraft age. The objective of this thesis is to develop a tool to help make recommendations for airports that are subjected to diverse weather conditions. In order to model an aircraft’s real landing performance, a mechanistic-empirical aircraft deceleration equation was developed. This equation contains all of the major forces that contribute to aircraft braking, and is calibrated and validated using digital flight data from dry runway aircraft landings. Digital flight data from a Boeing 737 - 700, runway pavement condition monitoring data, and weather data was collected. Finally, a Boeing 737 - 700 case study was conducted. As a result, it is able to back calculate the braking friction coefficient from the developed equation and evaluate the impact of wet and <b>contaminated</b> <b>runways</b> on aircraft braking performance. A study of a Boeing 737 - 700 aircraft landing performance on runways under different conditions was conducted. A mechanistic-empirical landing distance model is established based on the mechanistic-empirical deceleration equation, in order to accurately calculate the required landing distance. When developing the landing distance model, the following characteristics are considered: pilot settings (TLA, spoiler position, and flap position configurations), aircraft operational characteristics (touchdown speed and weight), the runway friction condition, and aircraft braking system characteristics. A Boeing 737 - 700 real data case study was conducted and a comparison was made with the Boeing 737 Quick Reference Handbook reference landing distance. The results indicate the model offers an accurate prediction of aircraft landing distance. Finally, future applications of this thesis are introduced. The potential of the development of a runway assessment, evaluation, and reporting framework was proposed. Opportunities of applying this thesis in on-board landing distance calculation, quick exit taxiway design and airport operation optimization, and fuel consumption reduction were presented. Moreover, the development of the Braking Availability Tester was discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPilots need {{accurate}} predictions on {{the quality}} of runway surface conditions when operating on snow/ice <b>contaminated</b> <b>runways.</b> These predictions are typically made by friction measurements, or by expert judgments of runway inspectors. This study presents a decision support model (the IRIS runway model) for runway inspectors that interprets descriptive data from SNOWTAM reports and predicts the braking action on the common scale from 1 to 5, ranging from “poor” to “good”. The model is tested on two airports in Norway during the winter seasons 2008 / 2009 to 2010 / 2011. Two other predictors of the braking action (assessments by runway inspectors and friction measurements) were also included. Analyses of 1261 friction-limited landings of commercial airplanes were used to compare predicted and measured braking actions. The IRIS runway model was found to be more conservative than the assessments of Norwegian runway inspectors, and even more conservative than friction measurements. In 86 % of the landings, the IRIS runway model predicted the conditions within ± 1 category of what the airplanes experienced, compared to 77 % achieved by the runway inspectors. The predictions by the friction measurement devices were the least conservative and predicted the conditions within ± 1 category in 61 % of the landings. The model is now implemented in 15 airports in Norway...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Ice formation on aircraft can disrupt the smooth flow of air over the wings and prevent the aircraft from taking off or decrease the pilot's ability to maintain control of the aircraft. Taxi and landing operations can also be risky in winter weather. Despite a variety of technologies designed to prevent ice from forming on planes, as well as persistent efforts by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other stakeholders to mitigate icing risks, icing remains a serious concern. As {{part of an ongoing}} review, this statement provides preliminary information on (1) the extent to which large commercial airplanes have experienced accidents and incidents related to icing and <b>contaminated</b> <b>runways,</b> (2) the efforts of FAA and aviation stakeholders to improve safety in icing and winter weather operating conditions, and (3) the challenges that continue to affect aviation safety in icing and winter weather operating conditions. GAO analyzed data obtained from FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and others. GAO conducted data reliability testing and determined that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Further, GAO obtained information from senior FAA and NTSB officials, representatives of the Flight Safety Foundation, and representatives of some key aviation industry stakeholder organizations. GAO provided a draft of this statement to FAA, NTSB, and NASA and incorporated their comments where appropriate. ...|$|R

40|$|Tests with {{specially}} instrumented NASA Boeing 737 and 727 aircraft {{together with}} several different ground friction measuring devices were conducted {{for a variety}} of runway surface types and conditions. These tests are part of joint FAA/NASA Aircraft/Ground Vehicle Runway Friction Program aimed at obtaining a better understanding of aircraft ground handling performance under adverse weather conditions and defining relationships between aircraft and ground vehicle tire friction measurements. Aircraft braking performance on dry, wet, snow and ice-covered runway conditions is discussed as well as ground vehicle friction data obtained under similar runway conditions. For a given <b>contaminated</b> <b>runway</b> surface condition, the correlation between ground vehicles and aircraft friction data is identified. The influence of major test parameters on friction measurements such as speed, test tire characteristics, type and amount of surface contaminant, and ambient temperature are discussed. The effect of surface type on wet friction levels is also evaluated from comparative data collected on grooved and ungrooved concrete and asphalt surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of friction between aircraft tires and <b>contaminated</b> <b>runway</b> surfaces. Wet-, snow- and ice-covered surfaces are considered. A tire Brush model developed for aircraft braking on dry runways is adapted {{to take into account}} the effect of contaminants. Compared with a dry surface, contaminants are assumed to affect the static and dynamic friction coefficients, the tire stiffness, the tire slip ratio and the length of the contact patch. Linear relationship is established between static and dynamic friction coefficients. The dynamic friction coefficient is reduced using an empirical model for wet surfaces and experimental fitting for snow- and ice-covered surfaces. The tire stiffness is modified considering the frequency and temperature dependence of the tire mechanical properties. Values on snow and ice are lower than those on wet and dry surfaces. A physical model is developed to calculate the length of the wet contact patch. Finally, it is assumed that the aircraft effective slip ratio is surface dependent; values are determined for each of the studied contaminants. Theoretical friction-slip curves are realistic in terms of shape and differentiation between surface conditions. The model is applied to a Falcon 20 aircraft and a runway monitoring device called IMAG. Friction-slip and friction-speed curves are calculated and compared to experimental data. It was found that the model can be used to relate ground friction to aircraft braking performance with enough reliability...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} described herein {{is composed}} of four major areas of practice. It examines the overall performance of runways and provides tools designed to improve current runway operations and management with particular emphasis on contaminated surfaces. Presented in this thesis is an overview of how to design airport pavements {{in order to achieve}} optimal friction by specifically focusing on material selection and construction techniques for rigid and flexible pavements. Rubber buildup and the impact rubber accumulation has on decreasing runway friction, particularly in a range of climatic conditions, is discussed. Four commonly used rubber removal techniques are presented and evaluated. Through this research, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) decision making protocol was developed for incorporation into airport pavement management systems (APMS). Runway surface condition reporting practices used at the Region of Waterloo International Airport are evaluated and recommendations for improving current practices are identified. Runway surface condition reporting can be improved by removing subjectivity, reporting conditions to pilots in real time, standardizing terminology and measurement techniques, and including runway pictures or sketches to identify contaminant locations where possible. Reports should be incorporated and stored in the APMS. Aircraft braking systems and their effects on landing distances under contaminated conditions are discussed. This thesis presents a proposed solution for monitoring and measuring <b>contaminated</b> <b>runway</b> surfaces and identifying the risks associated with aircraft landing through using the Braking Availability Tester (BAT). Also proposed in this thesis is a testing framework for validating the Braking Availability Tester. The proposed BAT measures interaction between aircraft antiskid braking systems and runway contaminants to determine landing distances more accurately. Finally, this thesis includes a discussion explaining how pavement design, contaminant removal, results from friction tests, and results from the BAT can be incorporated into airport pavement management systems. APMS data can be analyzed to economically optimize and prioritize scheduling of pavement maintenance, preservation and rehabilitation treatments to maintain a high level of service, thereby contributing to runway safety and optimization...|$|E
