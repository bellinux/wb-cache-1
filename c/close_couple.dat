The continual growing {{field of}} {{applications}} for Contactless Smartcards and NFC (Nearfield Communications) {{leads to the}} occur-rence of several <b>close</b> <b>coupled</b> labels in the operating field. This <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> leads to additional physical effects, as a strong mutual interac-tion between labels results. It is topic of this work to characterize the physical behavior of such <b>close</b> <b>coupled</b> systems exemplary in terms of effected resonance frequency and seen voltage at the label.

40|$|The {{excitation}} {{of atomic}} hydrogen by electron and proton impact is examined. Some {{of the available}} theoretical methods are discussed, in particular the methods {{of the first and}} second born approximation., the <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> approximation and the Glauter approximation are outlined. The <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> approximation is presented in both the wave and impact parameter formulations. The neglect of the continuum states in the eigenfunction expansion of the <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> method is shown to be unsatisfactory and the methods of including the effects of these states described. The relationship between the two forms of <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> approximation is explored via the eikonal approximation, and the Glauber approximation is shown to be a solution of a set of <b>close</b> <b>coupled</b> equations where all states are approximately included. A <b>close</b> <b>coupling</b> approximation that includes some eigenstates explicitly and the rest, including the continuum states, approximately is present. The method is applied in the impact parameter approximation to electron and proton collisions with hydrogen. Results are presented for the 1 s - 2 s and the 1 s - 2 p excitation cross sections and are compared with the available experimental cross sections. The comparison is inconclusive and suggestions are made for further work. Comparison with other theoretical predictions suggest that the effects of charge transfer on the direct excitation process are not allowed for despite the inclusion of the continuum states...|$|R

Her father, Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, and her mother, Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom (herself the eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort) were already the parents of a large family and as the penultimate child, Sophie was eleven years younger than her eldest brother, the future Emperor William II of Germany. Frederick and Victoria were a <b>close</b> <b>couple,</b> both on sentimental and political levels.

5000|$|The BBC {{tried to}} persuade the {{producers}} of the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks to get Will Mellor and Natalie Casey {{to work with them}} when they appeared in the show. Ralf Little and Sheridan Smith were cast soon after completing work on another BBC sitcom, The Royle Family. Although initially reluctant, he agreed to audition when he realised that Two Pints would be very different from The Royle Family. Kathryn Drysdale was brought in after producers saw her perform at drama school.The show's unbroadcast pilot starred Little and Mellor, though the characters of Janet, Louise and Donna were portrayed by Clare Buckfield, Lucy Punch, and Maxine Peake. Little and Smith, and Mellor and Casey, play couples Jonny and Janet, and Gaz and Donna. Mellor and Casey had previously portrayed an onscreen couple in Hollyoaks. Smith stated how lucky she was to work with Little after starring together before, as playing such a <b>close</b> <b>couple</b> would have been awkward for both. Mellor stated in a past interview how he sees Casey as a younger sister—which makes kissing scenes a bit awkward. Smith also classes Casey as the [...] "mummy" [...] in the show, due to her knowledge and problem-solving skills. Typically, episodes end with a particularly dramatic scene, such as Jonny breaking the news to Janet that her parents turned down his request for her hand in marriage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe current {{scenario}} of high {{growth rate of}} automobile usage, the automobile industry is forced to adopt the government emission norms to keep the environment green. Latest technologies have been developed in the automotive exhaust system to acknowledge the emission norms. Diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler both are playing major roles in reducing emission and noise level as well. Diesel oxidation catalyst reduces CO and unburned HC emissions. Muffler reduces noise level of exhaust gases. Nowadays automobile industry is using CFD software extensively to analyze the flow properties inside the diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler. Flow analysis helps to optimize the geometric design of Diesel oxidation catalyst to oxidize the CO and unburned HC of exhaust gases. In this present work we studied pressure drop and uniformity index of an existing exhaust system which consists of <b>close</b> <b>couple</b> catalytic convertor, under body catalytic convertor and muffler. Exhaust system has been modelled by using CATIA V 5 which is advanced CAD software. The substrate has been modelled as porous medium for analysis purpose. These models have been imported in CFD tool for analysis. After importing the CAD data inside the CFD software, with proper boundary conditions, the CFD analysis has been carried out. Based on the study, individual system contributions to the total pressure drop and flow uniformity have been analyzed and improvement areas of the existing system for better flow uniformity have been suggested...|$|E

A theoretical criterion based on fixed-nuclei calculations and not on experiment can be given as to which partial waves and energy domains require the various approximations. The theory allows all cross sections (i. e., pure rotational, vibrational, simultaneous vibration-rotation, differential and total) to be calculated.
