40|$|A {{review of}} 50 hospital-based {{outbreaks}} of food poisoning which {{were reported in}} Scotland during 1973 [...] 7, is described. At least 1530 persons consuming hospital-prepared food were involved. Thirty-one episodes were associated with <b>Clostridium</b> perfringens (C. <b>welchii),</b> 11 were due to food-borne salmonella infection, three to enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus, and five incidents were of undetermined aetiology. This differs noticeably from the experience in England and Wales where salmonellas appear to predominate as {{the main cause of}} hospital outbreaks. Twenty-two incidents occurred in hospitals for psychiatric or mentally subnormal patients, and ten others were located in geriatric units. Only 33 hospitals were involved in the 50 outbreaks as nine hospitals experienced two or more episodes. The role of the hospital in the occurrence of food poisoning may be over-emphasized in comparison with other catering establishments, as outbreaks are more readily recognized and laboratory facilities are usually available for investigation, but it is also believed that many episodes may not be reported. The peculiar problems of the hospital-catering service and particularly those of the older long-stay hospitals, are discussed in relation to preventive measures which would minimize the hazards of food poisoning...|$|R

50|$|After {{childbirth}} a woman's {{genital tract}} {{has a large}} bare surface, which is prone to infection. Infection may {{be limited to the}} cavity and wall of her uterus, or it may spread beyond to cause septicaemia (blood poisoning) or other illnesses, especially when her resistance has been lowered by a long labour or severe bleeding. Puerperal infection is most common on the raw surface of the interior of the uterus after separation of the placenta (afterbirth); but pathogenic organisms may also affect lacerations of any part of the genital tract. By whatever portal, they can invade the bloodstream and lymph system to cause septicemia, cellulitis (inflammation of connective tissue), and pelvic or generalized peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining). The severity of the illness depends on the virulence of the infecting organism, the resistance of the invaded tissues, and the general health of the woman. Organisms commonly producing this infection are Streptococcus pyogenes; staphylococci (inhabitants of the skin and of pimples, carbuncles, and many other pustular eruptions); the anaerobic streptococci, which flourish in devitalized tissues such as may be present after long and injurious labour and unskilled instrumental delivery; Escherichia coli and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>welchii</b> (inhabitants of the lower bowel); and Clostridium tetani.|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary {{infection}} {{is one of}} the commonest infections in childhood and is responsible for con-siderable mortality and morbidity, especially in Nigeria. Most infections are caused by Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, though occasionally other organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, coliform, and salmonella are responsible. Rarely does one encounter mixed infection with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>welchii,</b> coliform, and anaerobic streptococci organisms which are the causative organisms in the case reported here. The child presented with features of a bronchopneumonia and empyema, and was later shown to have destructive lung disease due to unusual organisms.

The child was treated with appropriate antibiotics and postural drainage and, when the condition had improved, was sub-jected to thoracotomy and excision of the diseased lung. He made an uneventful recovery. Pulmonary infection with anaerobic organisms is a well-recognized entity. Often these infections occur secondary to penetrating wounds of the chest. Reports of primary infections with anaer-obic streptococci or <b>Clostridium</b> <b>welchii</b> are scanty in the literature. Welch (1941) described the first cases of pulmonary infection with Cl. welchii. Since then there have been two further reports of pulmonary infection with the same organism (O'Donnell, 1952; Sweeting and Rosenberg, 1959). Three cases of necrotizing pneumonitis and empyema due to microaerophilic streptococci were reported by Finegold, Smolens, Cohen, Hewitt, Miller, and Davis (1965).

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Clostridium</b> <b>welchii,</b> {{used as a}} control, {{was found}} to grow well in a microaerophilic jar used for campylobacters but {{appeared}} resistant to a metronidazole disc although the campylobacter was sensitive. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for six strains of Cl. welchii were up to 64 -fold higher in these conditions than when grown anaerobically. Zones of inhibition with both Cl. welchii and Bacteroides fragilis varied {{with the amount of}} air admitted to anaerobic jars. It was reported recently that metronidazole sensi-tivity discs can be inactivated by light (Jones and Scott, 1977); we report here another explanation for the apparent failure of these discs. Some months ago, when testing the sensitivity of campylobacters to metronidazole, it was found that when <b>Clostridium</b> <b>welchii</b> was used as a control, this organism grew well in the microaerophilic condi-tions used but appeared resistant to metronidazole, although the campylobacter was sensitive. When re-tested anaerobically, the Cl. welchii reverted to sensi-tive. This phenomenon is known to the manufac-turers, who have demonstrated it with otherclostridia, particularly Cl. tertium. Recently, an anaerobic sensitivity test was seen in the clinical laboratory in which the Cl. welchii control showed little inhibition round the metroni-dazole discs, and it was suggested that the discs had deteriorated. The culture had been incubated in a BBL Gaspak jar, and regrettably the state of the indicator had not been noticed when the jar was opened, but as both discs were affected it seemed possible that the disc failure was due to incomplete anaerobiosis. This belief was strengthened when 10 discs taken from each of the bottles containing the original discs were tested and showed no loss of activity.
