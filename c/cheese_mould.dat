Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura.

50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into <b>cheese</b> <b>moulds</b> lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the <b>cheese</b> <b>moulds</b> and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|R

Natural non-standardized rennin is added without measuring, and after the curds set, they are checked for cutting {{resilience}} with a spoon. If ready, they are cut with the spoon and stirred to promote whey separation. The curd is then pressed by hand in the pot. Women dip their hands carefully into the curd and with slow and gentle movements pack the solids together for 20 minutes They say the warmth of their hands helps separate the whey. Then they bring handfuls of solids out of the whey and start compacting it between their hands, above the pot so the whey drips back into it. As soon as they feel it is dry enough they place it into a mould, where they continue to press by hand to make it firmer and give it its final shape. Moulding takes seven to 10 minutes per <b>cheese.</b> <b>Moulds</b> are improvised, made of anything they can find that is round.

Preparing the rennin solution is a complex process that takes a week and requires a fresh suckling kid’s stomach, which they sometimes buy at a market in the city. Constraints as perceived by the producers, in order of importance, are pressing and whey removal, quality and uniformity of rennin, milk temperature at arrival, cheese curdling, and cleanliness. The main quality control problems are variable strength of natural rennin, no exact measurements (amount of rennin, temperatures, pH, and process times), and scarce sanitary conditions.|$|R

RESULTS: Proteolytic activity was more intensive {{in the case of}} the strains of P. nalgiovense in comparison with the control strains of P. camemberti. Some differences in the proportion and amount of free amino acids were observed between the strains of P. nalgiovense during ripening. Lower proteolytic activity of P. nalgiovense was more desirable for sensory properties of cheese, especially in case sample N 2. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on the usability of selected strains of P. nalgiovense that could support the development of sensory properties of mould-ripened soft cheese. The cheese with the culture N 2 had the best flavour after 35 days of storage. Moreover, this strain showed the lowest bitterness in comparison with the other used P. nalgiovense cultures. The intensity of bitterness of sample N 2 was comparable to that of the control sample with P. camemberti. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

In this study, the distribution of safranal in cheese, whey and r equesón (Spanish whey cheese) and the antifungal potential of whey fractions against the mould Penicillium verrucosum were studied.

40|$|Oxidation-reduction (redox) {{potential}} {{is a fundamental}} physicochemical parameter that affects the growth of microorganisms in dairy products and contributes to a balanced flavour development in cheese. Even though redox potential has an important impact {{on the quality of}} dairy products, it is not usually monitored in dairy industry. The aims of this thesis were to develop practical methods for measuring redox potential in cheese, to provide detailed information on changes in redox potential during the cheesemaking and cheese ripening and how this parameter is influenced by starter systems and to understand the relationship between redox potential and cheese quality. Methods were developed for monitoring redox potential during cheesemaking and early in ripening. Changes in redox potential during laboratory scale manufacture of Cheddar, Gouda, Emmental, and Camembert cheeses were determined. Distinctive kinetics of reduction in redox potential during cheesemakings were observed, and depended on the cheese technology and starter culture utilised. Redox potential was also measured early in ripening by embedding electrodes into Cheddar <b>cheese</b> at <b>moulding</b> together with the salted curd pieces. Using this approach it was possible to monitor redox potential during the pressing stage. The redox potential of Emmental cheese was also monitored during ripening. Moreover, since bacterial growth drives the reduction in redox potential during cheese manufacture and ripening, the ability of Lactococcus lactis strains to affect redox potential was studied. Redox potential of a Cheddar cheese extract was altered by bacterial growth and there were strain-specific differences {{in the nature of the}} redox potential/time curves obtained. Besides, strategies to control redox potential during cheesemaking and ripening were developed. Oxidizing or reducing agents were added to the salted curd before pressing and results confirmed that a negative redox {{potential is}} essential for the development of sulfur compounds in Cheddar cheese. Overall, the studies described in this thesis gave an evidence of the importance of the redox potential on the quality of dairy products. Redox potential could become an additional parameter used to select microorganisms candidate as starters in fermented dairy products. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the redox potential influences the development of flavour component. Thus, measuring continuously changes in redox potential of a product and controlling, and adjusting if necessary, the redox potential values during manufacture and ripening could be important in the future of the dairy industry...|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a fogou is no longer known. Their central {{location}} in settlements and the work that evidently went into constructing them is indicative of their importance to the community. It has been conjectured that they were used for religious purposes, as refuges, or for food storage. Many are oriented south-west-north-east, facing the prevailing wind. Their use as refuge during raiding trips was first suggested by Darvill in his book 'Prehistoric Britain' (London: Batsford. 1987, page 177). An argument was put forward by Kenneth L MacGregor; was that they mainly served as refuges since food storage is impractical due to the damp conditions and ritual use is unlikely because the Celtic Druid tradition focused more on the living world. Both documentary and archaeological evidence support their use as refuges. Nancy Edwards wrote that [...] "evidence would support this: creeps, hidden chambers and sally-ports, {{as well as the}} fact that most sonterrains were invisible above ground, would all have helped to provide protection in the case of sudden attack. They could, however, turn into death-traps if the aggression was prolonged." [...] Where they were open at both ends, a fogou could provide ideal conditions for food storage, especially the drying of meat or storage of dairy products such as milk, butter and <b>cheese</b> where natural <b>moulds</b> would assist in preservation of perishable foodstuffs. Ashpits found at Trewardreva and in the circular side-chamber at Carn Euny were probably for preserving gulls' eggs, as was done on Saint Kilda in Scotland. A layer of black greasy mould with charcoal, animals and bird bones at Treveneague is also very suggestive of food storage. Diodorus Siculus stated that Iron Age people in Britain stored their grain in [...] "underground repositories", adding contemporary evidence [...] to the speculation that they were mainly used for food storage. Excavated examples at Halliggye, Carn Euny and Boden suggest fogous may have been deliberately filled after use or upon abandonment of the associated settlements.|$|R

The pH change fluctuated between 6. 00 to 6. 10 on the surface and 6. 00 to 5. 95 in the centre; the lowest aw was approximately 0. 96 on the surface and 0. 97 in the centre; and the highest NaCl concentration was 3. 3 % on the surface and 3 % in the centre. The survival and growth of the two B. cereus strains (D 1 and ATCC 13061) during the manufacture of Ricotta Salata cheese were similar. The B. cereus grew from approximately 5 log 10 CFU/g to a maximum of 7. 7 log 10 CFU/g of <b>cheese</b> curd during <b>moulding</b> (20 h at room temperature). The survival and growth of the two L. monocytogenes strains (W 1 and ATCC 35152) during the manufacture of Ricotta Salata cheese were similar. The difference between the bacteria count on the surface and in the centre was very small. L. monocytogenes increased from 5 to 6 log 10 CFU/g to a maximum of 8. 6 log 10 CFU/g during manufacture and maintained a level of around 8 log 10 CFU/g in the final product. The Ricotta Salata supported the survival and growth of B. cereus and L. monocytogenes during manufacture. It is important to improve the management of process hygiene for reducing the environmental contamination. Ideally, some lethal treatments should be applied after the packaging of the cheese, to limit the contamination of Ricotta Salata with these two bacteria...|$|R
40|$|A {{centripetal}} {{temperature gradient}} {{takes place in}} Grana Padano (GP) during moulding because of the slow heat transfer within the cheese and the fast cooling of the outer part. This gradient, {{in combination with the}} low pH value, induces a centripetal inactivation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Throughout the ripening process, the activity of the enzyme keeps > 3 10 (5) mU/kg cheese in the peripheral zones and < 300 mU in the core. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the presence of heat load gradients and ALP inactivation improves the analytical distinction between GP and imitation hard cheeses and affects the ripening behaviour. Differently ripened samples of traditional GP, grana cheese of reduced size, or made from pasteurized milk following GP technology, or collected at the market were submitted to a stratigraphic study. For each cheese sample, subsequent portions collected from the rind to the core were analyzed for moisture and water activity, a(w), ALP activity, furosine, free amino acids (FAA), casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) and free fatty acids (FFA). Regarding cheese characterization, thermal treatments of cheese milk can be recognized in GP only by determining the enzyme activity in the most peripheral portions. When the size of the cheese is reduced, cooling in moulding is faster and ALP inactivation in the core is lower. When the <b>moulded</b> <b>cheese</b> is heated, inactivation of the enzyme also takes place in the outer parts. The furosine values, which describe the extent of heat load in dairy systems, increase from the outer part to the GP core (from IO mg to 60 mg/ 100 g protein). This gradient is unaffected by prolonged ripening, but changes when modifications in technological parameters such as pasteurization of milk, forced heating in moulding and reduction of cheese size are introduced. The distribution of ALP and furosine values within the cheese constitutes a distinctive parameter between GP and its imitation products. Regarding cheese ripening, all the values of chemical indices adopted for describing the ripening of GP show a progressive increase from the inner to the outer portions of nine- or 15 -month-old cheese samples. These patterns are more pronounced for most of the FAA, and are marked for free serine which increases in the outer zones up to 50 % more than in the core. The amount of 'enzyme resistant' CPP beta-CN(f 16 - 22) 3 P, the accumulation of which requires the presence of active phosphatases and aminopeptidases, has the same stratigraphic behaviour as that of FAA. The close correlation (r = - 0. 97) between furosine and FAA values suggests a possible effect of the heat load occurring in moulding on the centripetal ripening of GP...|$|R
