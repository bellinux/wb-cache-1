40|$|ABSTRACT: The convenience, {{safety and}} trust {{required}} for national and global markets to function are largely provided by {{clearing and settlement}} arrangements. Well designed settlement arrangements can address the most serious risk of loss of the entire principal value of an asset being traded. A spectrum of risk-control arrangements and procedures at the <b>clearing</b> <b>stage</b> of a transaction provide further benefits. The recent and current development of clearing and settlement practices exemplifies the re-engineering and continuous-improvement approaches that have been of proven value throughout the economy, and that particularly have facilitated the advantageous adoption of new technologies. The resulting strength and flexibility of current practices have contributed to financial markets' responsiveness to three major challenges and opportunities: the invention of financial derivatives (e. g., futures, options and swaps) {{and the establishment of}} exchanges to trade many of them; the availability of computing and telecommunication technology that can simultaneously link a large, geographically dispersed group of traders, and the consequent feasibility of conducting trading by means other than open outcry on a trading floor; and the explosive growth of transaction volume on a number of exchanges. * Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the archeological {{findings of the}} 2011 data recovery investigations at the Murvaul Creek site, 41 PN 175, in far northeastern Texas in Panola County. The site is located along Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 10 approximately 1 mile north of Gary, Texas (Figure 1). Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), performed this work under contract to the Texas Department of Transportation, Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT ENV) under the Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5879 (Work Authorization [WA] 579 06 SA 005; WA 590 08 SA 005; CSJ: 1222 - 01 - 014; Geo-Marine project numbers 22005. 00. 06 and 22005. 00. 09). The fieldwork for this project was conducted {{in advance of the}} planned widening of FM 10 that was to replace three bridges and a culvert over Murvaul Creek with a larger structure and shift the road approximately 26 meters (m; 85 feet [ft]) to the east. Since the planned improvements of FM 10 would result in the loss of information at the Murvaul Creek site—a site that was recommended eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL; formerly State Archeological Landmark) —the current data recovery investigations were initiated. The data recovery investigations were conducted between February 7, 2011, and April 3, 2011. During this period, the fieldwork was conducted in several stages: site clearing, geophysical survey, 50 -x- 50 -centimeter (cm) excavations, block excavations, and mechanical site scraping. With the exception of the site <b>clearing</b> <b>stage,</b> the results of each of the fieldwork stages are reviewed individually in this report. The investigations resulted in the documentation of numerous features that appeared to have been the remains of a small Middle-to-Late Caddo settlement or farmstead situated on the edge of an interfluve south of the Murvaul Creek floodplain. Additionally, materials pertaining to the Archaic period were documented across the site. Although the site has been intensively studied within the TxDOT right-of-way (ROW), both the current investigations and previous work were limited to the ROW (cf. Cliff and Perttula 2002). Hence, the site is very likely larger than has been adequately documented...|$|E
