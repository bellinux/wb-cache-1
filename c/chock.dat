Names recorded include wodjalok, durdal, doongorok, and djoongong (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird). In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla people knew it as ngarkarko or ngarkabukko.

5|$|Robinson's character, {{his use of}} nonviolence, and his {{unquestionable}} talent {{challenged the}} traditional basis of segregation which then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the culture of and {{contributed significantly to the}} Civil Rights Movement. Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB, and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, <b>Chock</b> full o'Nuts. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. After his death in 1972, in recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E

From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was {{the vice president}} for personnel at <b>Chock</b> full o'Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation. Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry. Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem. He also served as the bank's first chairman of the board. In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{presented}} a new procedure of the seating of a combustion engines at the marine power plant with steel <b>chocks</b> cemented by a thixotropic polymer composition between the engine’s spot footing and the foundation ledge. A combustion engine is seated on foundation at the marine power plant by steel <b>chocks</b> or the <b>chocks</b> that are cast from polymer composition at the marine power plant. The arrangement, number and dimensions of foundation <b>chocks,</b> as well as arrangement, number and dimensions of the lateral and frontal stoppers that secure <b>chocks</b> work, are established by an engine manufacturer and are approved by Classification Society that supervises the vessel’s construction and operation. The author’s intention was to develop such <b>chocks</b> that combine the good resistance of steel <b>chocks</b> with the easiness of adjustment the bearing surfaces of polymer compositions <b>chocks.</b> Combination of these features was obtained for steel <b>chocks</b> which are glued by the relatively thin layers of polymer compositions between the engine spot footing and the foundation ledges. Such a method of making the <b>chocks</b> and seating with them the engines on foundation was claimed with the Patent RP No. 192120 on 24 th July 2000 for the Polish Naval Academy. In order to receive {{the approval of the}} Polish Register of Shipping to use new <b>chocks</b> at the marine power plants, the author carried out appropriate research, results of which are presented below. The results obtained in the research show that by seating of a combustion engine with these steel-thixotropic polymer <b>chocks</b> at the marine power plant, the foundation bolts tension can be diminished to the value equal to five times of the engine weight...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{safety of}} {{supercritical}} CO 2 pipeline {{is a key}} aspect of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS). For reducing the high pressure in supercritical pipeline when accidental cases arise, man-made release will be applied using <b>chocking</b> process. The downstream parameters of <b>chocking</b> process can be predicted based on the adiabatic process assumption. In the critical <b>chocking</b> process, the critical velocity at outlet is sonic. A <b>chocking</b> pipe can be designed for buffering between different <b>chocking</b> orifices according to the length of turbulence area produced by jetting momentum. For the effect of noise hazard produced by large jetting velocity, a muffler can be applied at the outlet of final stage orifice to atmosphere. For the influence of impurities on the <b>chocking</b> process of anthropogenic CO 2 pipeline, the presence of SO 2 as an impurity is helpful for increasing the downstream temperatures through the <b>chocking</b> device to prevent the frozen hazard, whereas the presence of N 2 as an impurity indicates a lower downstream temperature. The higher initial temperature can prevent the dry ice formation at the outlet of vent pipe when the multistage <b>chocking</b> is applied...|$|R

5|$|Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, {{producing}} {{a range of}} raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male {{producing a}} loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1and 3kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles {{that may or may}} not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single <b>chock</b> note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact call. These calls all carry over long distances.|$|E

25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and <b>chock</b> the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E
