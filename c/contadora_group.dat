5|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E
5000|$|The Council also {{expressed}} {{appreciation for the}} <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> and its efforts to resolve the situation in Central America. The Foreign Ministers of Mexico, Venezuela, Panama and Colombia had previously expressed concern at foreign interference in conflicts and disputes in Central America, urging the countries themselves, along with the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> to solve disputes to establish peace in the region. The resolution urged the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> to [...] "spare no effort" [...] to find solutions and, along with the Secretary-General, to keep the Council informed of developments in the situation.|$|E

The Anglo-Argentine CBMs are contained in a series of joint declarations signed in 1989, 1990 and 1991, and include classic CBMs such as the establishment of direct communication links, exchanges of information, search and rescue procedures, notification of military movements and maneuvers above certain specified levels, and the establishment of certain [...] "rules of behavior".|$|R
5|$|When {{he became}} president, {{he sent a}} bill to the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, {{which led to the}} Trial of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of the heads of the former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading Alfonsín to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the <b>Contadora</b> support <b>group</b> to mediate between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, CIP campaigned {{in support}} of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> and the {{subsequent}} Esquipulas Peace Agreement.|$|E
5000|$|The Council also reaffirmed {{its support}} for {{the efforts of the}} <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> and called upon all Member States to refrain from {{carrying}} out or supporting political, military or economic actions in the region that would impede the peace initiatives of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group.</b> It also called upong the governments of the United States and Nicaragua to resume dialogue they had been holding in Mexico with a view to normalising their relations.|$|E

50|$|Parlacen {{was born}} as a {{parliamentary}} body emulating the Federal Republic of Central America, with Costa Rica an observer. It {{evolved from the}} <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> a project launched during the 1980s to deal with civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Although the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> was dissolved in 1986, the concept of Central American integration is implicitly referenced in several countries' constitutions. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement (among other acts) agreed {{to the creation of}} a Central American Parliament composed of 20-22 directly-elected deputies from each country. Costa Rica has not ratified the agreement, and is not represented in the Parlacen. Parlacen is seen by some (including former President of Honduras Ricardo Maduro) as a white elephant.|$|E
5000|$|The Contadora {{support group}} (Grupo de apoyo a contadora, Grupo de Apoio à Contadora) {{was a group}} {{composed}} by Argentina, Brasil, Peru and Uruguay. It provided support for the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> from South America, in the conflict between Nicaragua and the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, {{the exiled}} Iranian shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, briefly lived in Contadora. The Contadora Peace Accords, which laid the {{foundation}} for peace in Central America, were negotiated in this island during the 1980s. Hence the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> took their name from the island's name.|$|E
5000|$|The Argentine {{president}} Raúl Alfonsín met the Peruvian president Alan García in Peru, {{during his}} presidential inauguration in 1985. Both of them {{agreed to make}} coordinated diplomatic actions {{in relation to the}} US-Contras conflict. According to the Argentine chancellor Dante Caputo, the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> was growing inactive, and required a second group to support it. Chancellors Dante Caputo, Olavo Setúbal from Brazil and Enrique Iglesias from Uruguay met in Punta del Este and had a similar agreement. The creation of a group with the four countries was announced in Lima, on July 29, 1985. The <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> and the Contadora support group met in Cartagena, Colombia, on August 24 and 25, 1985. Both groups were collectively known as [...] "the group of eight".|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Colombia broadened its {{bilateral}} and multilateral relations, joining the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> the Group of Eight (now the Rio Group), and the Non-Aligned Movement, which it chaired from 1994 until September 1998. In addition, it has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 {{during the}} Sandinista {{revolution}} in Nicaragua, Colombia headed by President Belisario Betancur {{was part of}} the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> along Panama, Mexico and Venezuela. The United Nations supported group intended to promote peace in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, which were engulfed in internal armed conflicts.|$|E
50|$|Several Latin American nations {{formed the}} <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> {{to work for}} a {{resolution}} to the region's wars. Later, Costa Rican President Óscar Arias succeeded in convincing the other Central American leaders to sign the Esquipulas Peace Agreement, which eventually provided the framework for ending the civil wars.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> was an {{initiative}} {{launched in the}} early 1980s by the foreign ministers of Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela {{to deal with the}} Central American crisis (military conflicts in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala), which were threatening to destabilize the entire Central American region.|$|E
50|$|From 1983 to 1986, he {{was posted}} to the Mexican Permanent Mission to the UN in New York, {{where he was}} {{responsible}} of the Decolonization Committee {{and member of the}} Council for Namibia.

50|$|The PARLACEN origins {{date back}} to the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> a project of the 1980s that sought to help resolve the civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Although the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> was disbanded in 1986, the idea of a greater Central American {{integration}} remained, giving rise to the Esquipulas II Agreement, which among other things, created the Central American Parliament.The Treaty establishing the Central American Parliament and other political bodies was signed in 1987; its first formal session was carried out on 28 October 1991 in Guatemala City.The PARLACEN as a political body in the region is part of the Central American Integration System SICA, established by the Protocol of Tegucigalpa to the Charter of the Organization of American States (ODECA) signed on 13 December 1991. SICA has the fundamental aim to realize an integration that is political and ideological representative in a pluralistic democratic system that guarantees free elections and participation under equal conditions for political parties.|$|E
50|$|During the central-American wars {{taking place}} in {{neighboring}} El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua; both Costa Rica and Mexico led mediation dialogues between waring factions in each nation {{in order to bring}} peace and stability to the region. Mexico (along with Colombia, Panama and Venezuela) created the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> which helped create the framework for the Esquipulas Peace Agreement, led by Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias.|$|E
50|$|In September 1983, {{mediated}} by the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group,</b> the foreign ministers of the Central American countries adopted a Document of Objectives in Panama City. This document declared their intent to promote democratization and to end armed conflict in the region, to act in compliance with international law, to revitalize and restore economic development and co-operation in Central America, and to negotiate better access to international markets.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> {{ultimately}} {{failed to}} establish a credible peace formula {{with the backing of}} all regional governments, it did lay the foundations for such a plan to emerge in subsequent years. Under the leadership of Costa Rican president Óscar Arias, the so-called Esquipulas Peace Agreement emerged from the remains of Contadora in 1986 and led to a fundamental reshaping of Central American politics.|$|E
50|$|The Esquipulas Peace Agreement was an {{initiative}} {{in the mid-1980s}} to settle the military conflicts that had plagued Central America for many years, {{and in some cases}} (notably Guatemala) for decades. It built upon groundwork laid by the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> from 1983 to 1985. The agreement was named for Esquipulas, Guatemala, where the initial meetings took place. The US Congress lobbying efforts were helped by one of Capitol Hill's top lobbyists, William C. Chasey.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, Mexico {{became a}} vocal {{supporter}} for dialogue between Panama and the United States for eventual Panamanian {{control of the}} Panama Canal. In 1977, Panama and the United States signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties giving Panama eventual control of the canal in December 1999. During the 1980s, foreign ministers of Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela created the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> in order to diplomatically try to resolve the crisis facing many Central American nations at the time.|$|E
50|$|The Esquipulas Nicaraguan Peace Agreement was a peace {{initiative}} {{in the mid-1980s}} to settle the military conflicts that had plagued Central America for many years, {{and in some cases}} (notably Guatemala) for decades.

50|$|The {{military}} dictatorship, at {{that time}} supported by the United States, perpetrated the assassination and torture {{of more than one}} hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15). Noriega also began playing a double role in Central America {{under the supervision of the}} CIA. While the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied Nicaraguan Contras and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition.|$|E
50|$|He was {{appointed}} Ambassador of Colombia to the Kingdom of Norway in 1980 by President Julio César Turbay Ayala, post he occupied until 1983 when he {{was appointed}} Ambassador to El Salvador where he participated in the crucial peace talks of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group.</b> His diplomatic career reached its highest point as Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States between 1988 and 1990 where he worked closely lobbying the US Congress to advance Colombian interests in passing the Andean Trade Preference Act.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} twentieth century, many Latin American leaders saw a need for an {{alternative}} organization that was not dominated by the United States. The experience {{of dealing with the}} 1970s and 1980s communist insurgencies in Central America through the creation of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> which did not include the United States, inspired the creation of the Rio Group in 1986. The Rio Group did not create a secretariat or permanent body and instead chose to rely on yearly summits of heads of states.|$|E
50|$|From 16 March to 30 November 1982, {{he served}} as Ambassador to the United States of America and from 1989 to 1993, as Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Between those two {{diplomatic}} postings from December 1982 to 1988, {{he served as}} Secretary of Foreign Affairs under President Miguel de la Madrid. During {{his time in the}} Cabinet, he was instrumental in establishing the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group,</b> which worked to bring peace to Central America, and {{in the creation of the}} Grupo de Ocho, since expanded to become the Rio Group.|$|E
50|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the <b>Contadora</b> <b>group</b> from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E
50|$|Prior to this, in 1983, the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> in Latin America, {{which was}} an {{initiative}} formed by Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, began promoting peace in the Central American countries undergoing internal conflicts (El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala). The group served as mediators in peace talks among all Central American rulers, {{which led to the}} drafting of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America. The document did not fully receive the support of the United States and was ultimately rejected by three of the Central American countries (Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica) in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|The Rio Group (Grupo do Rio Grupo de Río [...] ) was an {{international}} organization of Latin American and some Caribbean states. It was created on 18 December 1986 in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro {{by means of}} the Declaration of Rio de Janeiro, signed by Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela (the members of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> and the Contadora Support Group). To some extent it was perceived by some observers as an alternative body to the Organization of American States during the Cold War, since that body was dominated by the United States. The Rio Group did not have a [...] or permanent body, and instead relied on yearly summits of heads of states.|$|E
5000|$|On December 31, 1981, Pérez de Cuéllar succeeded Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General and was re-elected for {{a second}} term in October 1986. During his two terms, he led mediations between Britain and Argentina in the {{aftermath}} of the Falklands War and promoted the efforts of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> to bring peace and stability to Central America. He also interceded in the negotiations for the independence of Namibia, the conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, the war between Croatian forces seeking independence and the Yugoslav federal as well as local Serb forces, and the Cyprus issue. He also presided in 1986 an international arbitration committee that ruled http://www.iilj.org/courses/documents/RainbowWarrior.pdf on the Rainbow Warrior incident between New Zealand and France.|$|E
50|$|Orfila lent the OAS' {{support to}} the {{establishment}} of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group</b> in hopes of alleviating the worsening wars in Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. This support, {{as well as that of}} the United Nations and a number of other international bodies, failed to compensate for President Reagan's opposition to the initiative, however. A 1982 resolution he supported, asserting Argentina's claims on the Falkland Islands, resulted in a policy embarrassment for the OAS after Falklands War ended in disaster. The severe economic downturn in almost the entire western hemisphere was addressed by Orfila with efforts to renegotiate Latin American debt repayments; this met with opposition in the Reagan Administration on this, as well, and on 26 October 1983, the OAS voted to condemn the U.S. invasion of Grenada, making Orfila's policy rift with Reagan final.|$|E
50|$|The Heads of State and Government {{confirmed}} {{their close}} interest in developments in Central America. They are deeply concerned {{at the economic}} and social conditions {{in many parts of the}} region, at the tensions which these create and at the widespread misery and bloodshed.They are convinced that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means, but only by a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers. They, therefore, fully support the current initiative of the <b>Contadora</b> <b>Group.</b> They underlined the need for the establishment of democratic conditions and for the strict observance of human rights throughout the region.They are ready to continue contributing to the further development in the area, in order to promote progress towards stability.|$|E
