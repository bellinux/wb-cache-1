However, studies addressing the prevalence of pulmonary function abnormalities according to both definitions in patients with chronic HF are lacking. METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, 164 chronic HF outpatients (age 68 +/- 10 years, 78 % men, 88 % New York Heart Association class I-II) with left ventricular ejection fraction 0. 05). The LLN identified fewer patients with abnormal lung function, whereas the conventional <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> classified more patients with diffusion impairment, airway obstruction, or a mixed category.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia is a {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) risk factor. We determined plasma homocysteine (Hcy) reference values at optimized vitamin status and investigated {{their influence on}} the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy adults. Results were compared with those obtained using European Concerted Action Project (ECAP) <b>cutoff</b> <b>values.</b> METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 101) received folic acid (5 mg/day) and vitamin B(12) (1 mg/day) for 2 weeks and the same dosages of folic acid and vitamin B(12) plus vitamin B(6) (1 mg. kg(- 1). day(- 1)) during the following 2 weeks. Hcy concentrations, both fasting and 6 -h post-methionine load, were determined at baseline and after 4 weeks. RESULTS: Baseline (4 weeks) fasting and 6 -h postload Hcy reference values were 4. 7 - 14. 6 (4. 1 - 9. 3) and 18. 8 - 49. 7 (12. 9 - 35. 1) micromol/L, respectively. Mean fasting and 6 -h postload Hcy decreased after 4 weeks of vitamin supplementation by 3. 5 micromol/L (33. 5 %) and 8. 5 micromol/L (26. 3 %), respectively. The percentages of subjects exhibiting significant decreases in fasting Hcy following vitamin supplementation were 88 % (all subjects), 92 % (non-vitamin users), and 72 % (vitamin users). The prevalences of hyperhomocysteinemia with use of ECAP <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> were 29 % for all groups, 29 % for men, 27 % for premenopausal women, and 53 % for postmenopausal women. With vitamin-optimized <b>cutoff</b> <b>values,</b> prevalences were 58 %, 58 %, 76 %, and 89 %, respectively. Use of vitamin-optimized <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> increased the diagnostic value of fasting Hcy and decreased that of a 6 -h postload Hcy compared with use of ECAP <b>cutoff</b> <b>values.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Use of vitamin-optimized <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> gives rise to high hyperhomocysteinemia pretest probabilities {{in the general population}} and, therefore, precludes any meaningful role for Hcy testing. Future demonstration of a beneficial effect of decreasing Hcy on CVD risk would justify use of vitamin-optimized <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> for assessment of CVD risk...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are: (1) to study the relation between body mass index (BMI), percentage-weight-for-height (PWH) and percentage body fat (PBF) in Singaporean Chinese children; (2) to assess the applicability of an international definition of obesity (the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) BMI) as a screening tool to detect childhood obesity, {{as compared with the}} current Singapore population-specific definition using PWH. Methods: A total of 623 Chinese children aged 6 - 11 y (321 males, 302 females) were recruited from a school by proportionate (40) stratified random sampling. BMI and PWH were calculated from weight and height, while PBF was derived using leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis. The strength of association among the three indices of obesity was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Obese children were defined as those above the 95 th percentile of PBF in each age gender-specific group. Sensitivity and specificity of IOTF-BMI <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> and PWH <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> were compared by testing their ability to correctly identify obese children. Results: All three indices correlated well with one another (BMI: PWH r= 0. 83, BMI: PBF r= 0. 87, PWH: PBF r= 0. 76). Prevalence of obesity was lower using IOTF-BMI cutoffs (6. 9) than using PWH cutoffs (16. 4). The sensitivity and specificity of IOTF-BMI <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> were 75. 0 and 96. 0, respectively, with sensitivity differing between boys (83. 3) and girls (66. 6) (P= 0. 35). In comparison, PWH <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> had higher sensitivity (91. 6) but lower specificity (86. 6), with {{no significant difference between the}} genders. Conclusion: IOTF-recommended BMI <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> had low sensitivity and may underestimate the local prevalence of childhood obesity.

40|$|PurposeThe {{prevalence}} rates of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and percentile distribution of insulin resistance (IR) among Korean {{children and adolescents}} were investigated.

MethodsData from 3, 313 Korean subjects (1, 756 boys and 1, 557 girls, aged 10 – 18 years) were included from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted during 2007 – 2010. Three different sets of criteria for MetS were used. Indirect measures of IR were homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and triglyceride and glucose (TyG) index. The <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> of the HOMA-IR and TyG index {{were obtained from the}} receiver operation characteristic curves. ResultsAccording to the MetS criteria of de Ferranti el al., Cook et al., and the International Diabetes Federation, the {{prevalence rates}} in males and females were 13. 9 % and 12. 3 %, 4. 6 % and 3. 6 %, and 1. 4 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. Uses these 3 criteria, the <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> of the HOMA-IR and TyG index were 2. 94 and 8. 41, 3. 29 and 8. 38, and 3. 54 and 8. 66, respectively. The <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> using each of the 3 criteria approximately corresponds to the 50 th– 75 th, 75 th, and 75 th– 90 th percentiles of normal HOMA-IR and TyG index levels.

For the selection of <b>cutoff</b> <b>values,</b> data from a clinical database including 609 children with JIA were used. Optimal <b>cutoff</b> <b>values</b> were determined against external criteria by calculating the 75 th percentile of cumulative score distribution and through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. External criteria included formal definitions of inactive disease and minimal disease activity, subjective rating of remission by physicians, parents, and children, and rating of acceptable symptom state by parents and children. The choice of cutoffs was made based on clinical and statistical grounds. Cross-validation was performed using 4 JIA patient samples that included a total of 1, 323 patients, and was based on assessment of construct, discriminant, and predictive validity. With all versions of the JADAS, the cutoff score for classifying a patient as having inactive disease was 1, whereas the cutoff for classification of minimal disease activity was 2 for oligoarticular JIA and 3. 8 for polyarticular JIA. Cutoffs for physicians', parents', and children's subjective rating of remission ranged from 2 to 2. 3.
