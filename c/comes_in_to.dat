25|$|The {{foraging}} activity of Vespula vulgaris {{is dependent on}} the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2°C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2°C, light intensity <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be – i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is another}} {{possible}} mechanism for rapid methane release. [...] As the Arctic Ocean {{becomes more and}} more ice free, the ocean absorbs more of the incident energy from the sun. The Arctic Ocean becomes warmer than the former ice cover and much more water vapour enters the air. [...] At times when the adjacent land is colder than the sea, this causes rising air above the sea and an off-shore wind as air over the land <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> replace the rising air over the sea. [...] As the air rises, the dew point is reached and clouds form, releasing latent heat and further reinforcing the buoyancy of the air over the ocean. [...] All this results in air being drawn from the south across the tundra rather than the present situation of cold air flowing toward the south from the cold sinking air over the Arctic Ocean. [...] The extra heat being drawn from the south further accelerates the warming of the permafrost and the Arctic Ocean with increased release of methane.|$|E
