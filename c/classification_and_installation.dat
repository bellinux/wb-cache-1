40|$|Aimed at {{the health}} {{monitoring}} and evaluation of bridges based on sensing technology, the monitoring contents of different structural types of long-span bridges were defined. Then, the definition, <b>classification,</b> selection principle, <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> requirements of the sensors were summarized. The concept was proposed that new adaptable long-life sensors could be developed by new theories and new effects. The principle and methods to select controlled sections and optimize the layout design of measuring points were illustrated. The functional requirements were elaborated on about the acquisition, transmission, processing, and management of sensing information. Some advanced concepts about the method of bridge safety evaluation were demonstrated and technology bottlenecks in the current safety evaluation were also put forward. Ultimately, combined with engineering practices, an application was carried out. The results showed that new, intelligent, and reliable sensor technology {{would be one of}} the main future development directions in the long-span bridge health monitoring and evaluation field. Also, it was imperative to optimize the design of the health monitoring system and realize its standardization. Moreover, it is a heavy responsibility to explore new thoughts and new concepts regarding practical bridge safety and evaluation technology...|$|R

Working from the dual vantage points of South Africa and Europe, the research considers plants as both witnesses and actors in history, and as dynamic agents – linking nature and humans, rural and cosmopolitan medicine, tradition and modernity – across different geographies, histories and systems of knowledge, {{with a variety of}} curative, spiritual and economic powers. Works in video, sound, photography <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> investigate botanical nationalism and other legacies of colonialism, plant migration and invasion, biopiracy, flower diplomacy during apartheid, the garden planted by Mandela and his fellow inmates on Robben Island prison, as well as the role of <b>classification</b> <b>and</b> naming of plants...|$|R

30|$|The radial {{stiffness}} {{of the wheel}} directly influences the vehicle ride comfort, driving safety, steering stability, and passing ability [20]. Therefore, researchers should thoroughly understand the radial stiffness characteristics of the wheel. In reality, machining <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> errors are inevitable [21, 22]. Owing {{to the design of}} the ME-Wheel, the machining <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> errors significantly influence the radial {{stiffness of}} the wheel. Therefore, it is of theoretical and practical significance to investigate the effects of machining <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> errors on the radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel.|$|R
