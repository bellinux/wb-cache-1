40|$|During several Active Aeroelastic Wing {{research}} flights, {{the shadow}} of the over-wing shock could be observed because of natural lighting conditions. As the plane accelerated, the shock location moved aft, and as the shadow passed the aileron and trailing-edge flap hinge lines, their associated hinge moments were substantially affected. The observation of the dominant effect of shock location on aft <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>hinge</b> moments led to this investigation. This report investigates the effect of over-wing shock location on wing loads through flight-measured data and analytical predictions. Wing-root and wing-fold bending moment and torque and leading- and trailing-edge hinge moments have been measured in flight using calibrated strain gages. These same loads have been predicted using a computational fluid dynamics code called the Euler Navier-Stokes Three Dimensional Aeroelastic Code. The computational fluid dynamics study was based on the elastically deformed shape estimated by a twist model, which in turn was derived from in-flight-measured wing deflections provided by a flight deflection measurement system. During level transonic flight, the shock location dominated the wing trailing-edge <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>hinge</b> moments. The computational fluid dynamics analysis based on the shape provided by the flight deflection measurement system produced very similar results and substantially correlated with the measured loads data...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort was to show that real-time aircraft control-surface hinge-moment information {{could be used to}} provide a robust and reliable prediction of vehicle performance and control authority degradation. For a given airfoil section with a control surface [...] be it a wing with an aileron, rudder, or elevator [...] the control-surface hinge moment is sensitive to the aerodynamic characteristics of the section. As a result, changes in the aerodynamics of the section due to angle-of-attack or environmental effects such as icing, heavy rain, surface contaminants, bird strikes, or battle damage will affect the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>hinge</b> moment. These changes include both the magnitude of the hinge moment and its sign in a time-averaged sense, and the variation of the hinge moment with time.

40|$|Successful flight-testing of the Active Aeroelastic Wing {{airplane}} {{was completed}} in March 2005. This program, which started in 1996, was a joint activity sponsored by NASA, Air Force Research Laboratory, and industry contractors. The test program contained two flight test phases conducted in early 2003 and early 2005. During {{the first phase of}} flight test, aerodynamic models and load models of the wing control surfaces and wing structure were developed. Design teams built new research control laws for the Active Aeroelastic Wing airplane using these flight-validated models; and throughout the final phase of flight test, these new control laws were demonstrated. The control laws were designed to optimize strategies for moving the wing control surfaces to maximize roll rates in the transonic and supersonic flight regimes. <b>Control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>hinge</b> moments and wing loads were constrained to remain within hydraulic and load limits.

40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{were used to}} model wing bending-moment loads, torsion loads, and control surface hinge-moments of the Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW) aircraft. Accurate loads models are required {{for the development of}} control laws designed to increase roll performance through wing twist while not exceeding load limits. Inputs to the model include aircraft rates, accelerations, and control surface positions. Neural {{networks were}} chosen to model aircraft loads because they can account for uncharacterized nonlinear effects while retaining the capability to generalize. The accuracy of the neural network models was improved by first developing linear loads models to use as starting points for network training. Neural networks were then trained with flight data for rolls, loaded reversals, wind-up-turns, and individual control surface doublets for load excitation. Generalization was improved by using gain weighting and early stopping. Results are presented for neural network loads models of four wing loads and four <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>hinge</b> moments at Mach 0. 90 and an altitude of 15, 000 ft.

40|$|Icing {{alters the}} shape and surface {{characteristics}} of aircraft components, which results in altered aerodynamic forces and moments caused by air flow over those iced components. The typical effects of icing are increased drag, reduced stall angle of attack, and reduced maximum lift.

40|$|The present thesis {{summarizes}} work {{on developing}} {{a method for}} unsteady aerodynamic analysis primarily for aeroelastic simulations. In contrast to widely used prediction tools based on frequency-domain representations, the current approach aims to provide a time-domain simulation capability which can be readily integrated with possibly nonlinear structural and control system models. Further, due to the potential flow model underlying the computational method, and the solution algorithm based on an efficient boundary element formulation, the computational effort for the solution is moderate, allowing time-dependent simulations of complex configurations. The computational method is applied to simulate a number of wind-tunnel experiments involving highly flexible models. Two of the experiments are utilized to verify the method and to ascertain the validity of the unsteady flow model. In the third study, simulations are used for the numerical optimization of a configuration with multiple control surfaces. Here, the flexibility of the model is exploited in order to achieve a reduction of induced drag. Comparison with experimental results shows that the numerical method attains adequate accuracy within the inherent limits of the potential flow model. Finally, rather extensive aeroelastic simulations are performed for the ASK 21 sailplane. Time-domain simulations of a pull-up maneuver and comparisons with flight test data demonstrate that, considering modeling and computational effort, excellent agreement is obtained. Furthermore, a flutter analysis is performed for the same aircraft using identified frequency-domain loads. Results are found to deviate only slightly from critical speed and frequency obtained using an industry-standard aeroelastic analysis code. Nevertheless, erratic results for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>hinge</b> moments indicate that the accuracy of the present method would benefit from improved control surface modeling and coupled boundary layer analysis.

The aim of the flight simulator is twofold: serving as a research tool for model characterization and for the investigation of flying qualities of very-light and ultra-light aircraft; and offering a training options to the pilots of such airplanes. For these reasons the simulator cockpit has been conceived and set up as a generic cabin of a general aviation aircraft. The software suite that guides the various components {{of the system is}} based mainly on the features of FlightGear, an open-source flight simulation software. The simulation of aircraft motion, the cockpit instrument panel and flight controls, the outside scenery are all managed by a number of instances of FlightGear. All FlightGear instances are appropriately executed on different machines and communicate with each other via net protocols. Simulations are also supported by two other software modules. The first one controls the 6 DOF motion of the cockpit. The second module implements a force reproduction system on the cockpit controls. An overview of all these modules is given in the paper, along with the discussion of the advantages and potentialities given by the source code accessibility and the high configurability of FlightGear. The force feedback model is particularly important to the purposes that this flight simulation facility has being designed for. To obtain an enhanced realism in piloting efforts, particular care has been taken to implement hinge moment equations in the simulation software. The result is a reliable closed-loop force-feedback system on all aircraft commands.
