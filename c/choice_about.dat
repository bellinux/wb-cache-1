40|$|Introduction This report {{provides}} {{you with}} a detailed stock-take of the current system for funding school-age education in New Zealand. At a high level, the stock-take is organised around the key policy questions that underpin a schooling funding system. We could consider each of these policy questions to progressively and systematically review schooling funding: 	<b>Choices</b> <b>about</b> funding access to schooling 	<b>Choices</b> <b>about</b> how delivery of education services is funded 	<b>Choices</b> <b>about</b> how funding is provided 	<b>Choices</b> <b>about</b> how funding is calculated 	<b>Choices</b> <b>about</b> the timing of resourcing 	<b>Choices</b> <b>about</b> how funding can be use...|$|R

This project is aimed at devising integrated decision-assisting models for helping ex-ecutives and engineers make informed <b>choices</b> <b>about</b> alternatives ap-proaches to improving seismic safety. The platforms integrate state of the art understanding of structural response, alternative means for mitigating the risk, normative decision-assisting models, and behavioral models of organizational choice and decision processes...|$|R

25|$|In 1524 Governor and Captain General Cortés left Mexico City for Honduras {{to march}} against Cristóbal de Olid. He had {{intended}} that Albornoz accompany {{him on the}} expedition, {{but because of the}} illness of the latter, he remained in Mexico City. Cortés left the government in charge of Estrada, Albornoz and Zuazo. The transfer of power occurred October 12, 1524. This triumvirate shared power with the ayuntamiento (city government). The ayuntamiento was composed of partisans of Cortés; Estrada and Albornoz were his enemies. However, since these men held independent royal appointments, Cortés had little <b>choice</b> <b>about</b> whom to leave in charge.|$|E
25|$|There {{has also}} been some {{secondary}} migration of Somalis to the UK from the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. According to refugee expert Jill Rutter, in some locations, secondary migrants make {{up the majority of}} the Somali community. An academic article published in 2011 suggests that, since 2000, between 10,000 and 20,000 Somalis in the Netherlands have moved to the UK. The driving forces behind this secondary migration included: a desire to reunite with family and friends; a rise in Dutch opposition to Muslim immigration; Somali opposition to housing policies which forced them to live scattered in small groups all over various cities rather than in a larger agglomerated community; a restrictive socio-economic environment which, among other things, made it difficult for new arrivals to find work; and the comparative ease of starting a business and acquiring the means to get off social welfare in the UK. Research into this relocation also suggests that some Somali migrants in the Netherlands did not intend to end up there as a final destination. Their journeys may have been interrupted in the Netherlands, or they may have had little <b>choice</b> <b>about</b> their destination. As a result, some secondary migration {{can be seen in the}} context of the desire to complete an intended migration to the UK.|$|E

He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last thing I {{wanted to do was to}} defend those peckerwoods.

500|$|... "High and Dry" [...] {{became a}} modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was {{insufficient}} {{to repeat the}} worldwide success of [...] "Creep". The Bends peaked at No. 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there. Nonetheless, Radiohead {{were satisfied with the}} album's reception. Jonny Greenwood later said: [...] "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after The Bends was released and it started appearing in people's [...] polls {{for the end of the}} year. That's when it started to feel like we made the right <b>choice</b> <b>about</b> being a band." [...] In later years, The Bends appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2012 edition of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] at No. 111.|$|E
500|$|Also {{like his}} {{predecessors}} Louverture and Dessalines, Christophe used military might to force former slaves {{to stay on}} the plantations. [...] Plantation workers under Louverture and Christophe were not unpaid—they received one quarter of what they produced, paying the rest to plantation owners and the government. [...] Under Christophe's rule it was also possible for black people to rent their own land or work in government, and agricultural workers on plantations could make complaints to the royal administration about working conditions. These ex-slaves may also have sometimes had a <b>choice</b> <b>about</b> what plantation they would work on—but they could not choose not to work, and they could not legally leave a plantation they were [...] "attached" [...] to. [...] Many ex-slaves were probably forced to work on the same plantations they had worked on as slaves.|$|E
500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a <b>choice</b> <b>about</b> the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E

500|$|The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{considers}} a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market [...] "nutritious" [...] snack bars to park visitors. Ron (Nick Offerman) supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie (Amy Poehler) initially supports the deal as well, until Ann (Rashida Jones) informs her they {{are filled with}} unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors {{so they can make}} an informed <b>choice</b> <b>about</b> Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying about how much he is drinking during a recent outing, feeling she is stifling his personal freedoms. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's CEO Nick Newport Jr. (Gary Weeks) and his son and daughter, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience exclaims with excitement and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful servings of steak ("turf and turf"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having [...] "been a horse's ass".|$|E
