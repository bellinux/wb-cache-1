40|$|Abstract AIMS: A novel {{antibacterial}} peptide from <b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis</b> hemoglobin hydrolysate (CHHs) was characterised for antimicrobial activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: CHHs was hydrolysed for 2 h (2 h-CHH), 4 h (4 h-CHH), 6 h (6 h-CHH) and 8 h (8 h-CHH). 8 h-CHH showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 20, 20, 20 and 10 mg ml- 1 (w/v), respectively. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that 8 h-CHH had bactericidal activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. β-galactosidase assay supported by RT-qPCR demonstrated that 8 h-CHH resulted in differential expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis (ftnA and bfd) and oxidative stress (sodA, soxR and oxyR). Siderophore assay indicated that 8 h-CHH also impaired siderophore production with diminished expression of pvdF. This pattern of gene expression suggests that 8 h-CHH triggers {{the release of}} free ferric ions in the cytoplasm. However, decreased expression of genes associated with the SOS response (recA and lexA) in combination with neutral comet revealed that no DNA damage was caused by 8 h-CHH. Membrane permeabilisation assay indicated that 8 h-CHH caused membrane leakage thought to mediate the antibacterial and iron-stress responses observed, due to loss of regulated iron transport. The novel active peptide from 8 h-CHH was determined as QAIIHNEKVQAHGKKVL (QL 17), with 41 % hydrophobicity and + 2 net charge. CONCLUSIONS: The QAIIHNEKVQAHGKKVL fragment of <b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis</b> hemoglobin is antibacterial via a mechanism that likely relies on iron dysregulation and oxidative stress which results in bacterial death. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We have described for the first time, a novel peptide derived from <b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis</b> hemoglobin hydrolysate, {{that has the potential}} to be developed as a novel antimicrobial peptide.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the fate and disposition of marbofloxacin (MBF) in freshwater crocodiles (<b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis),</b> MBF was administered either intravenously (i. v.) or intramuscularly (i. m.) at a dosage of 2. 0 mg/kg body weight. The concentrations of MBF in plasma were measured using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} equipped with a fluorescence detector. The concentrations of MBF in the plasma were measurable up to 144 h after i. v. and i. m. administration. After the first 45 min, the mean pharmacokinetic profiles produced by the two administration routes were almost identical. No statistically {{significant differences in the}} pharmacokinetic parameters between the groups were observed. The half-life was long (about 2. 5 days), the volume of distribution was large (about 1. 44 L/kg), λz was small (0. 01 h- 1), and the clearance was slow (22. 6 mL/h/kg).

40|$|Sauropsida (all {{existing}} reptiles and birds) comprises Archosauromorpha (birds, crocodiles, and turtles) and Lepidosauromorpha (tuataras and squamate reptiles). Squamate reptiles have {{a variable}} number of chromosomes (2 n = 30 – 50), and their karyotypes are basically categorized into two types: the karyotype with {{few or no}} dot-shaped microchromosomes; and the other type consisting of macrochromosomes and many microchromosomes (Olmo and Signorino 2005). This karyotypic feature is also observed in birds and turtles, which comprise {{a small number of}} macrochromosomes and a lot of indistinguishable microchromosomes (Belterman and De Boer 1984; Olmo and Signorino 2005). On the contrary, the karyotype of crocodiles contains macrochromosomes with only a few large chromosomes, and the absence of dot-shaped microchromosomes.

50|$|The lake {{is linked}} to the Mekong River by the Tonlé Sap River. From November until June the lake flows into the Mekong. However, each year during the rainy season (mid June-late October) the Mekong River is {{inundated}} with rain waters. Its lower delta becomes flooded and cannot flow into the sea quickly enough to eliminate all the excess water. This causes the Mekong River to rise enough to reverse the flow of the Tonlé Sap River causing it to flow back into the lake. The lake expands from 2500 km2 to more than 16,000 km2 creating an enormous wetland area. This wetland area supports a tremendous amount of biodiversity including plants, reptiles, mammals, birds and other animals. Many of these are known to be rare or endangered. These wetlands are also an important breeding area for fish from the lake and Mekong River. Both Siamese crocodiles (<b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis)</b> and saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) once occurred side-by-side in the lake, and there is thought to be inter-species breeding amongst the crocodiles found in the floating farms on {{the western part of the}} Lake in and around Prek Toal.|$|R

Mycoplasma alligatoris sp. nov. was cultured from multiple organs, peripheral blood, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid of affected alligators. In a subsequent experimental inoculation study, the Henle-Koch-Evans postulates were fulfilled for M. alligatoris as the etiological agent of fatal mycoplasmosis of alligators. That finding was remarkable because mycoplasmal disease is rarely fatal in animals. An {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{for the detection of}} antibodies produced by alligators in response to M. alligatoris exposure was developed by using plasma obtained from naturally infected alligators during the original epidemic.

Crocodile bone samples obtained from Thailand (<b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis)</b> and Australia (<b>Crocodylus</b> porosus), being the tail and the tibia respectively, were treated to remove organic material and the inner spongy (trabecular) material. The dense cortical bone was used for comparative instrumental analyses. Specific comparisons were made against bovine cortical bone and pure synthetic hydroxyapatite. The material was then analyzed using simultaneous differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TGA), Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Imaging of full bone samples was also conducted using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The SEM provided valuable information through the imaging of samples, showing a marked increase in bone porosity for crocodile material when compared to bovine samples. The crystallinity and/or crystallite size of carbonated hydroxyapatite {{has been found to}} be lower than synthetic apatite, with the tibia being the least crystalline of the bone types studied. The crystallinity index (CI) is used as a measure of crystallite size and internal strain. The strain is affected by substitutions in the structure and these results provide a starting point for comparison of the resulting mechanical properties. There is a need for any biomaterial chosen for bone replacement to allow adequate osteointegration.

CHH obtained by 2 -H hydrolysis (2 H-CHH) showed the highest anti-inflammatory activity with respect to decreasing nitric oxide (NO) production, whereas the strongest antioxidant activity was found for 6 -H hydrolysis (6 H-CHH) against nitric oxide radicals. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of individual peptide components, 2 H-CHH and 6 H-CHH were purified by semipreparative HPLC. Peptide fraction P 57 isolated from 6 H-CHH was found to exhibit the highest nitric oxide radical inhibition activity (32. 0 %). Moreover, purification of 2 H-CHH yielded peptide fraction P 16, which displayed a high efficacy in decreasing NO production of macrophage RAW 264. 7 cells (83. 2 %) and significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), and prostaglandin-E 2 (PGE 2) production to about 2. 0, 0. 3, and 1. 9 ng/mL, respectively.

40|$|The Siamese {{crocodile}} (<b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis)</b> and Saltwater crocodile (C. porosus) {{are two of}} {{the most}} endangered animals in Thailand. Their numbers have been reduced severely by hunting and habitat fragmentation. A reintroduction plan involving captive-bred populations that are used commercially is important and necessary as a conservation strategy to aid in the recovery of wild populations. Here, the genetic diversity and population structure of 69 individual crocodiles, mostly members of captive populations, were analyzed using both mitochondrial D-loop DNA and microsatellite markers. The overall haplotype diversity was 0. 924 - 0. 971 and the mean expected heterozygosity across 22 microsatellite loci was 0. 578 - 0. 701 for the two species. This agreed with the star-like shaped topology of the haplotype network, which suggests a high level of genetic diversity. The mean ratio of the number of alleles to the allelic range (M ratio) for the populations of both species was considerably lower than the threshold of 0. 68, which was interpreted as indicative of a historical genetic bottleneck. Microsatellite markers provided evidence of introgression for three individual crocodiles, which suggest that hybridization might have occurred between C. siamensis and C. porosus. D-loop sequence analysis detected bi-directional hybridization between male and female individuals of the parent species. Therefore, identification of genetically non-hybrid and hybrid individuals is important for long-term conservation management. Relatedness values were low within the captive populations, which supported their genetic integrity and the viability of a breeding and reintroduction management plan.

This is the first report on the protokaryotypes of amniotes and tetrapods and the evolutionary processes of microchromosomes inferred from comparative genomic analysis of vertebrates, which cover all major non-avian reptilian taxa (Squamata, Crocodilia, Testudines). The eight largest macrochromosomes of the turtle and chicken were equivalent, and 11 linkage groups had also remained intact in the crocodile. Linkage groups of the chicken macrochromosomes were also highly conserved in X. tropicalis, two squamates, and the salamander, but not in human. Chicken microchromosomal linkages were conserved in the squamates, which have fewer microchromosomes than chicken, and also in Xenopus and the salamander, which both lack microchromosomes; in the latter, the chicken microchromosomal segments have been integrated into macrochromosomes. Our present findings open up the possibility that the ancestral amniotes and tetrapods had at least 10 large genetic linkage groups and many microchromosomes, which corresponded to the chicken macro- and microchromosomes, respectively. The turtle and chicken might retain the microchromosomes of the amniote protokaryotype almost intact.

Methods: Twenty-four rats were assigned equally into four groups using a random-number table, and two burns were created on the dorsum of each animal except for the sham group. The three treatment groups received with saline solution (12 burns, served as negative control), silver sulfadiazine (12 burns, served as positive control), or crocodile oil (12 burns). Silver sulfadiazine cream was used as standard care, and the treatments were repeated twice daily for 28 days.

40|$|Abstract Background The Siamese {{crocodile}} (<b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis)</b> is {{a critically}} endangered species of freshwater crocodiles. Crocodilians live with opportunistic bacterial infection but normally suffer no adverse effects. They are not totally immune to microbial infection, but their resistance thereto is remarkably effective. In this study, crude and purified plasma {{extracted from the}} Siamese crocodile were examined for antibacterial activity against clinically isolated, human pathogenic bacterial strains and the related reference strains. Methods Crude plasma was prepared from whole blood of the Siamese crocodile by differential sedimentation. The crude plasma was examined for antibacterial activity by the liquid growth inhibition assay. The scanning electron microscopy was performed to confirm the effect of crude crocodile plasma on the cells of Salmonella typhi ATCC 11778. Effect of crude crocodile plasma on cell viability was tested by MTT assay. In addition, the plasma was purified by anion exchange column chromatography with DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M and the purified plasma was tested for antibacterial activity. Results Crude plasma was prepared from whole blood of the Siamese crocodile and exhibited substantial antibacterial activities of more than 40 % growth inhibition against the six reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the four clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Vibrio cholerae. Especially, more than 80 % growth inhibition {{was found in the}} reference strains of Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis and in the clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholerae. The effect of the crude plasma on bacterial cells of Salmonella typhi, a certain antibacterial material probably penetrates progressively into the cytoplasmic space, perturbing and damaging bacterial membranes. The effect of the crude plasma was not toxic by the yellow tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using a macrophage-like cell, RAW 264. 7.

APD search {{revealed that the}} closest (40 %) similarity of YD 1 was with an AMP Leucrocin I (AP 02344) isolated from white blood cell extracts of crocodile, <b>Crocodylus</b> <b>siamensis</b> (Pata et al. 2011). Furthermore, sequence alignment suggested other AMPs (Table  4) showed ≤ 40 % similarity. Sequences comparison with other AMP sequences revealed that YD 1 possesses unique characteristics. Most of the AMPs are minuscule and strongly cationic (Yeung et al. 2011). Characteristics of the YD 1 protein {{suggests that it is}} an AMP include: (1) small size (0.924  kDa) with 10 amino acids; (2) cationic character (net charge + 1); and (3) theoretical pI of 8.80 (calculated according to amino acids sequences by ProtParam; [URL] Owing to its broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and unique mechanism of action. Initial results from our study showed synergism between YD 1 and erythromycin, a protein synthesis translocation inhibitor, indicating a relationship between their mechanisms of action (Odds 2003) and the property of YD 1 to interact with intracellular macromolecules rather than the cell wall machinery. Using E. coli (106  cfu/mL bacterial suspension) as a model organism, antimicrobial mechanism of action study was performed. TEM images showed morphological alteration in E. coli when treated with 5 x MIC (40  µg/mL) of YD 1 (Fig.  5 a); while > 88 % of spheroplasts remained intact (Fig.  5 b), 80 % of E. coli cells died at the same YD 1 concentration (Fig.  5 c). This antibacterial action might result from effects on cellular metabolism. Kang et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2014) also reported the similar observation of morphological alteration of E. coli cells when treated with berberin and α-terpineol respectively (Kang et al. 2015; Li et al. 2014). In Fig.  5 a, we demonstrated that YD 1 possesses cell-penetrating and translocation ability, likely responsible for its antimicrobial activity without damaging bacterial cell wall or causing without cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (Fig.  5 d). A recent review by Katrin and Neundorf (2011) enlisted the commonly used cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) and AMPs (Splith and Neundorf 2011). Furthermore, the positively charged residues in the α-helical sequence, and Arg-rich peptide, associate with the lipid phosphate groups to neutralize the Arg residue and allow the peptide translocation across the membrane (Amand et al. 2008; Boman 1995; Su et al. 2009). Recently, a report by Xie et al. (2011) suggested that the position of Pro residue in buforin II was more important than the overall α-helical content for the translocation (Xie et al. 2011). Consistent with these previous reports, YD 1 AMP, a positively charged peptide, contains 3 glycines ([G 4, 7, 10]) and 2 proline ([P 2, 8]) residues out of 10 amino acids. The antimicrobial potency of YD 1 might not be determined solely by the coil-shaped secondary structure, but other factors such as the type of positive charge or the location of Pro might also be vital. In 2012, Jang and his co-workers (Jang et al. 2012) reported two cell-penetrating motifs Q-F-P–V-G and Q-W–P-V-G for peptides Buforin IIb and Buf IIIa, respectively. Analogously, Q-G-P-N-G is the likely expected cell-penetrating motif for YD 1. Moreover, I-TASSER prediction analysis has suggested the presence of ligand binding sites in YD 1 sequence for a nucleic acid (NUC) (Fig.  6 b) which was consistent with the DNA binding affinity result shown in Fig.  5 c.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{evaluation}} of an international trade with species of Crocodylidae family. The main data source was CITES trade database, in which there are registered all the trades with required species. Based on data analysis it was identified the course of commerce with all the commodities between 1993 and 2012. The most frequently marketed species are these four crocodiles: <b>Crocodylus</b> niloticus, porosus, <b>siamensis</b> a novaeguineae. For these species were observed total net import, gross export, the number of trades per year, share of countries participated on import and export, the purpose of the trade and the source of traded commodities. At the rest of the species the less marketed ones summary tables of import and gross export were created. From the analysis was found out that the most of monitored species come from the farm breeding, which are specialised inleather and meat production. The third significant commodity is leather products. From charts can be noticed the growth of leather and skin production for Nile crocodile and of live specimens export for Siamese crocodile. For the next two in detail analysed species there was no production growth noted...|$|R
40|$|Four polypeptides were {{isolated}} by non-exchange chromatography from the crude cardiotoxin fraction of Thailand cobra (Naja naja <b>siamensis)</b> venom. Fraction <b>I</b> and 71 amino acid residues including 1 tryptophan, while fractions, II, III and IV had 60 amino acids and no tryptophan. When tested on isolated skeletal muscle (chick biventer cervicis, chick embryo muscle in culture, guinea pig hemidiaphragm) and cardiac muscle (guinea pig and cat left atria, cat papillary muscle) preparations, fractions II, III and IV, but not fraction I, caused contracture and depolarization. The cardiotoxin-induced contractions could be prevented by pretreatment with raised concentrations of calcium, {{but were not}} influenced by {{a wide range of}} pharmacological agents which modify nerve-muscle transmission or muscle contractility. The results suggest that cardiotoxins do not act at a specific step in normal excitation-contraction coupling but directly on cell membranes, where they probably cause the formation of pores which result in depolarization and in the influx of calcium...|$|R
