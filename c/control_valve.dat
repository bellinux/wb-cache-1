5|$|A coolant <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{is mounted}} on the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the actual}} demand, the gas flow {{characteristics}} of butterfly vacuum <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> are investigated in this paper. Classification and characteristic of vacuum <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{are discussed in}} detail. The geometric and mathematic models for two kinds of butterfly vacuum <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> with seal and without seal, are respectively built. The gas flows through the valve at different opening angles are simulated under different pressure {{by means of the}} Fluent software. The flow percentage function and adjustment sensitivity are introduced and formulated to describe the flow regulating characteristic of <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> The flow conductance coefficient and flow loss coefficient are defined and formulated to describe the resistance characteristic of <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> The dates and curves of some simulating examples are given and discussed...|$|R

These types of valves are also known as Automatic <b>Control</b> <b>Valves.</b> The hydraulic actuators will respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open/close the <b>valve.</b> Automatic <b>Control</b> <b>Valves</b> do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close the valve.|$|R

25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|E

50|$|DPCVs help {{maintain}} a {{constant differential pressure}} across a sub-branch, thereby protecting downstream <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> from excessive pressures and nullifying the effects of pressure variations caused by the movement of <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in other branches. In systems with 2-port <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> DPCVs can perform the dual duties of maximum-volume control and differential-pressure control, thereby simplifying the commissioning process.Once a sub-circuit has been commissioned, the DPCV prevents the flow and the balance in the sub-circuit being affected by other sub-circuits. This approach is what I term a semi-automatic method of balancing the system.|$|R

25|$|The larger pipe was glass so the {{behaviour}} of {{the layer}} of the dyed stream could be observed, {{and at the end}} of this pipe there was a flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> used to vary the water velocity inside the tube. When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this happened was the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{scientists}} at BMI-TNO, the research unit of Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research at the University of Amsterdam, invented and patented {{a series of}} additional key elements that make the volume clamp work in clinical practice.

An acronym for physiological calibration of the finger arteries, this Physiocal tracker was found to be accurate, robust and reliable.|$|E
25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|E
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Compressed {{air leakage}} {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 42 % of electrical energy loss on a typical mine compressed air system.

In this study the electrical and financial savings realised by underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> and surface <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> were calculated.

According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty rudder <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which went down in the early 1990s.

500|$|On {{the same}} day that the sealed {{atmosphere}} experiment was terminated, 24 April 1960, Triton experienced a major equipment failure.
