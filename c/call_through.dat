5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a class can implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a <b>call</b> <b>through</b> any of the class's interfaces.|$|E

25|$|In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes {{where the}} Duchess was an {{in-patient}} for hyperemesis gravidarum.

25|$|The stormy sea created big {{problems}} for the torpedo boats when their propellers were lifted {{too close to the}} surface. This reduced their efficiency and what worsened the situation {{was the fact that the}} S2s bearings were worn out, which caused a lot of vibrations in the ship and threatened to open up a leak where the shaft went through the hull. Both of the torpedo boats began taking in water in the high seas. This was mainly due to the construction of the superstructure. The coal was also slowly running out since the crew had to feed more into the boilers than usual due to the high seas. The flotilla leader Klas Horn sent out a distress call on behalf of the torpedo boats. The rescue ship Protector, which was located in Vaasa, received the distress <b>call</b> <b>through</b> the Finnish headquarters in Helsinki, and the message was also received by the Swedish rescue vessel Helios. Both promised that they would come to the rescue.|$|E
25|$|On 7 January, Belfast City Council met for {{the first}} time since the vote was passed. The PSNI closed roads around City Hall while loyalists protested outside. The protesters called for the {{decision}} to be reversed. About 400 people had gathered near the city hall for a peaceful protest for the first time since the vote as a result of a <b>call</b> <b>through</b> social media. As protesters passed the Short Strand on their return to East Belfast, clashes again broke out between the protesters and nationalist residents. When police tried to disperse the crowds, they were attacked with petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks and bottles. Officers and their vehicles were also attacked with hatchets and sledge hammers. They responded with plastic bullets and water cannon. On 9 January, the Union Jack was raised at the city hall for the first time since the vote in commemoration of Catherine Middleton's birthday. The first meeting of the 'Unionist Forum' took place on 10 January. It was set up by the DUP and UUP to address the flag protests and other concerns among unionists.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Lois Pope, {{widow of}} National Enquirer owner Generoso Pope Jr., met a {{disabled}} American veteran at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and {{realized there was}} no memorial in the city which honored disabled veterans. Although {{she did not know}} him, Pope called the office of United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put her <b>call</b> <b>through.</b> Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Because the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 (P.L. 99-625) barred the expenditure of federal funds for memorials, a foundation needed to be established to oversee private fundraising. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), an organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans. The DAV was itself not a nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation (DVLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created. Brown (who left office in 1997), Pope, and Wilson incorporated the foundation in 1998, and Wilson was named its president.|$|E

Larson and Gallagher prepared for their roles by shadowing line staff at a group home similar to that in the film, and collaborated to create backstories for their characters. Lakeith Stanfield was the only actor from the original short film to reprise his role in the feature. Cretton struggled to contact Stanfield when casting the film in 2012—Stanfield had stopped acting, left his managers, and did not own a cell phone—but Cretton was eventually able to reach him by email to tape an audition. Most of the children featured in the film were cast through open casting calls, and most had no prior acting experience. Alex Calloway, who played Sammy, found a casting <b>call</b> <b>through</b> Craigslist and won the role after sending in a cell phone video audition.|$|E

"Irresistible grace", {{also called}} [...] "efficacious grace", {{asserts that the}} saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has {{determined}} to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying {{the call of the}} gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's Holy Spirit cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, [...] "graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ." [...] This is not to deny the fact that the Spirit's outward <b>call</b> (<b>through</b> the proclamation of the Gospel) can be, and often is, rejected by sinners; rather, it's that inward call which cannot be rejected.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{a couple}} of months before ElBaradei took office, the Model Additional Protocol was adopted, [...] {{creating}} a new environment for IAEA verification by giving it greater authority to look for undeclared nuclear activities. When in office, ElBaradei launched a program to establish [...] "integrated safeguards" [...] combining the IAEA’s comprehensive safeguard agreements with the newly adopted Additional Protocol. In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: [...] "One of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence. I would, therefore, urge all states with outstanding-safeguards agreements to conclude them, and I would also urge all states to accelerate their consideration of the Model Additional Protocol and enter into consultations with the Agency at the earliest possible opportunity. We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [...] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol." [...] ElBaradei repeated this <b>call</b> <b>through</b> his years as the Director General of the IAEA. In November 2009, 93 countries had Additional Protocols in force.|$|E

[...] In the 1980s, {{with the support of}} the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Soka Gakkai created the exhibition [...] "Nuclear Arms: Threat to Our World," [...] which attempted to raise public awareness of the grave consequences of nuclear weapons and toured different parts of the world. In 2007, [...] the Soka Gakkai International launched a grassroots antinuclear campaign called [...] "People’s Decade for Nuclear Abolition" [...] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the antinuclear declaration made by Toda. The exhibition [...] "From a Culture of Violence to a Culture of Peace: Toward a World Free From Nuclear Weapons" [...] was created as its initial project. [...] The exhibition toured more than 230 cities in 31 countries and territories around the world and concluded [...] in Bahrain in March 2013. A new exhibition, [...] "Everything You Treasure – For a World Free From Nuclear Weapons," [...] developed {{with the support of the}} International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), aims to foster a deep awareness of the consequences of nuclear weapons by reexamining the challenges they pose from twelve different perspectives, including ecological integrity, human rights and gender. [...] The English-language version of the exhibition was first launched at the 20th World Congress of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) in Hiroshima in 2012. It has since been shown at ICAN’s Civil Society Forum in Oslo, Norway, in March 2013, and later at the UN Office at Geneva, during the Second Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for the 2015 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in April 2013.|$|E
