40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of nozzles with different angles on PDE performance, PDE with <b>nozzles</b> of different <b>convergent</b> and divergent angles were simulated and propane-air mixture was used. The simulation {{results indicated that the}} effects of nozzles with different angles on the pressure at the thrustwall of PDE and nozzle outlet were not the same. The pressure at the thrustwall and nozzle outlet of PDE with <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> was higher than that with divergent nozzles, and the pressure peak appeared earlier in the case of <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The peak value of the pressure at the nozzle outlet increased and appeared ahead of time as the convergent angle increased. The peak value of the pressure at the nozzle outlet increased and the evacuation time was prolonged with <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The pressure at the nozzle outlet dropped quickly and the evacuation time was shortened with divergent nozzles...|$|R
50|$|<b>Convergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{accelerate}} subsonic fluids. If {{the nozzle}} pressure ratio is high enough, then the flow will reach sonic velocity at the narrowest point (i.e. the nozzle throat). In this situation, the nozzle {{is said to}} be choked.|$|R
40|$|The nozzle {{test chamber}} was {{modified}} {{to provide a}} high-pressure-ratio nozzle static-test capability. Experiments were conducted to determine {{the range of the}} ratio of nozzle total pressure to chamber pressure and to make direct nozzle thrust measurements using a three-component strain-gage force balance. Pressure ratios from 3 to 285 were measured with several axisymmetric nozzles at a nozzle total pressure of 15 to 190 psia. Devices for measuring system mass flow were calibrated using standard axisymmetric <b>convergent</b> choked <b>nozzles.</b> System mass-flow rates up to 10 lbm/sec are measured. The measured thrust results of these nozzles are in good agreement with one-dimensional theoretical predictions for <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Convergent-divergent nozzles can {{therefore}} accelerate fluids that have choked in the convergent section to supersonic speeds. This CD process {{is more efficient}} than allowing a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> to expand supersonically externally.The shape of the divergent section also ensures that {{the direction of the}} escaping gases is directly backwards, as anysideways component would not contribute to thrust.|$|E
50|$|AJM {{machines}} are usually self-contained bench-top units. First it compresses {{the gas and}} then mixes it with the abrasive in a mixing chamber. The gas passes through a convergent-divergent nozzle before entering the mixing chamber, and then exits through a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The nozzle can be hand held or mounted in a fixture for automatic operations.|$|E
50|$|Propelling nozzles {{accelerate}} the available gas to subsonic, transonic, or supersonic velocities {{depending on the}} power setting of the engine, their internal shape and the pressures at entry to, and exit from, the nozzle. The internal shape may be convergent or convergent-divergent (C-D). C-D nozzles can {{accelerate the}} jet to supersonic velocities within the divergent section, whereas a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> cannot accelerate the jet beyond sonic speed.|$|E

Nozzle performance is presented in terms of velocity coefficient. Estimates of the hot thrust available during emergency (engine out) with the suppressor nozzle installed are compared with the current thrust levels produced by the round <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Convergent nozzles {{are used}} on many jet engines. If the nozzle {{pressure}} ratio {{is above the}} critical value (about 1.8:1) a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> will choke, resulting {{in some of the}} expansion to atmospheric pressure taking place downstream of the throat (i.e. smallest flow area), in the jet wake. Although jet momentum still produces much of the gross thrust, the imbalance between the throat static pressure and atmospheric pressure still generates some (pressure) thrust.|$|E
50|$|Increasing exhaust {{velocity}} increases thrust {{for a given}} mass flow, but matching the {{exhaust velocity}} to the air speed provides the best energy efficiency. However, momentum considerations prevent jet aircraft from maintaining velocity while exceeding their exhaust jet speed. The engines of supersonic jet aircraft, {{such as those of}} fighters and SST aircraft (e.g. Concorde) almost always achieve the high exhaust speeds necessary for supersonic flight by using a CD nozzle despite weight and cost penalties; conversely, subsonic jet engines employ relatively low, subsonic, exhaust velocities and therefore employ simple <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle,</b> or even bypass nozzles at even lower speeds.|$|E
50|$|When the {{pressure}} ratio across a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> exceeds a critical value, the flow chokes, and thus {{the pressure}} of the exhaust exiting the engine exceeds {{the pressure of the}} surrounding air and cannot decrease via the conventional Venturi effect. This reduces the thrust producing efficiency of the nozzle by causing much of the expansion to take place downstream of the nozzle itself. Consequently, rocket engines and jet engines for supersonic flight incorporate a C-D nozzle which permits further expansion against the inside of the nozzle. However, unlike the fixed convergent-divergent nozzle used on a conventional rocket motor, those on turbojet engines must have heavy and expensive variable geometry to cope with the great variation in nozzle pressure ratio that occurs with speeds from subsonic to over Mn3.|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamc and {{acoustic}} measurements of single and twin free and impinging jets {{were made for}} circular <b>convergent</b> and CD <b>nozzles,</b> rectangular CD <b>nozzles,</b> and D-shaped <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Measured shock cell lengths and screech tone frequencies compare well with existing theory. Noise due to jet impingement correlates {{on the basis of}} the nozzle-to-ground distance relative to the free jet shock structure, with the highest sound pressure levels generally due to jet impingement tones. All nozzle types experienced near-field OASPL of 160 dB at some nozzle-to-ground distances, including the CD nozzles operating at their design pressure. The effect of the second jet was to sometimes increase levels due to twin jet resonance and at other times reduce levels due either to suppression of the screech/impingement feedback process or more simply by acoustic interference of the noise produced by the two jets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fundamental mechanism of broadband shock noise generation in an improperly expanded supersonic jet. The study includes circular convergent-divergent {{as well as}} circular <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The main source of shock noise is determined to be the transient interaction between the shock front and the convected vorticity within the jet plume. The discussion of the noise-generation mechanism is based on detailed numerical analysis, theoretical aerodynamic and acoustic modeling, refined measurements of the jet mean flow, shock-cell structure, turbulence, and noise. These results provide a broad-based generalization for the Harper-Bourne and Fisher analysis and prediction method...|$|R
50|$|The {{velocity}} of the gas leaving a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> may be subsonic or sonic (Mach 1) at low flight speeds or supersonic (Mach 3.0 at SR-71 cruise) for a con-di nozzle at higher speeds where the nozzle pressure ratio is increased with the intake ram.The nozzle thrust is highest if the static pressure of the gas reaches the ambient value as it leaves the nozzle. This only happens if the nozzle exit area is the correct value for the nozzle pressure ratio (npr). Since the npr changes with engine thrust setting and flight speed this is seldom the case. Also at supersonic speeds the divergent area is less than required to give complete internal expansion to ambient pressure as a trade-off with external body drag. Whitford gives the F-16 as an example. Other underexpanded examples were the XB-70 and SR-71.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect of}} adding a {{divergent}} section was demonstrated with Pratt &Whitney's first C-D nozzle. The <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{was replaced with}} a C-D nozzle on the same engine J57 in the same aircraft F-101.The increased thrust from the C-D nozzle (2000 lb at SL TO) on this engine raised the speed from Mn=1.6 to almost 2.0 enabling the Air Force to set a world's speed record of 1207.6 mph which was just below Mn=2 for the temperature on that day. The true worth of the C-D nozzle was not realised on the F-101 as the intake was not modified for the higher speeds attainable. [...] Another example was the replacement of a convergent with a C-D nozzle on the YF-106/P&W J75 when it would not quite reach Mn=2. Together {{with the introduction of}} the C-D nozzle, the inlet was redesigned. The USAF subsequently set a world's speed record with the F-106 of 1526 mph (Mn=2.43). Basically, a divergent section should be added whenever flow is choked whithin the convergent section.|$|E

The stream function distribution on the sonic line is adjusted iteratively to match the boundary conditions at the lip and free streamline.

Subsonic pressure-plus-friction drag levels were generally similar for boattails which did not have large separated regions.

40|$|Air {{flowing from}} a <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> at {{pressure}} ratios greater than 2. 5 has {{been split into}} eight separate jets by overexpansion of the flow into a divergent, eight-lobed passage. The splitting of the flow {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in the nozzle axial centerline Mach number. This in part is due to the radial inflow of secondary air between the lobes toward the nozzle centerline. Each of the smaller jets is partially split after it leaves the end of the divergent lobed section of the nozzle, thus creating a velocity profile having 16 peaks. At a pressure ratio of 3. 5 the flow decelerates to Mach 1 in three <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> throat diameters. <b>Convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow normally requires 12 diameters to reach Mach 1.

The spectral distributions of the sound power for the engine and the air jet were in good agreement for the case where the engine data were not greatly affected by reflection or jet interference effects. Such power spectra for a subsonic or slightly choked engine or air jet show that the peaks of the spectra occur at a Strouhal number of 0. 3...|$|R

40|$|Hot-wire and {{acoustic}} measurements were {{taken for a}} round <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> and a round convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzle at a jet Mach number of 0. 61. The C-D nozzle had a design Mach number of 2. 2. Compared to the <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> jet flow, the Mach 2. 2 nozzle jet flow produced excess broadband noise (EBBN). It also produced a transonic resonance tone at 1200 Herz. Computational simulations were performed for both nozzle flows. A steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulation was performed for the <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> jet flow. For the Mach 2. 2 nozzle flow, a steady RANS simulation, an unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation, and an unsteady Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) were performed. The RANS simulation of the <b>convergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> showed good agreement with the hot-wire velocity and turbulence measurements, though the decay of the potential core was over-predicted. The RANS simulation of the Mach 2. 2 nozzle showed poor agreement with the experimental data, and more closely resembled an ideally-expanded jet. The URANS simulation also showed qualitative agreement with the hot-wire data, but predicted a transonic resonance at 1145 Herz. The DES showed good agreement with the hot-wire velocity and turbulence data. The DES also produced a transonic tone at 1135 Herz.

The trend is confirmed with data from a large facility. However, several anomalies are noted. In particular, the wedge {{is found to be}} ineffective with nozzles having parallel flow lines near the exit. In the latter case, the wedge simply causes a lateral spreading of the flow.
