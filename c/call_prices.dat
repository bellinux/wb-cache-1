5000|$|Although the VIX {{is often}} called the [...] "fear index", a high VIX is not {{necessarily}} bearish for stocks. [...] Instead, the VIX {{is a measure of}} market perceived volatility in either direction, including to the upside. In practical terms, when investors anticipate large upside volatility, they are unwilling to sell upside call stock options unless they receive a large premium. Option buyers will be willing to pay such high premiums only if similarly anticipating a large upside move. The resulting aggregate of increases in upside stock option <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> raises the VIX just as does the aggregate growth in downside stock put option premiums that occurs when option buyers and sellers anticipate a likely sharp move to the downside.

5000|$|Pai {{argued against}} {{adoption}} of the FCC 2013 analysis and proposed rulemaking regarding {{the high cost of}} inmate telephone calls, referred to as Inmate Calling Service (ICS) by the FCC. He submitted his written dissent in which he argued that the nature of the exclusive single carrier contract between private ICS providers and prison administrators, meant inmates cannot [...] "count on market competition to keep prices for inmate calling services just and reasonable." [...] (ICS has become a $1.2 billion telecommunications industry and the two largest providers in the United States were private equity-backed companies). Prior to the FCC’s imposition of rate caps on interstate prison and jail phone calls in February 2014, the largest ICS provider Global Tel-Link (GTL) - which has been profitably bought and sold by private equity firms such as American Securities and Veritas Capital - charged some of the highest rates in the US - up to $17.30 for a 15-minute call. The 2013 FCC analysis, described how, in some cases, long-distance calls are charged six times the rate on the outside. Pai opposed the FCC imposition of [...] "safe harbor" [...] of 12 cents with a cap of 21 cents on private ICS providers like GTL and CenturyLink Public Communications, arguing instead for a [...] "simple proposal to cap interstate rates, with one rate for jails and a lower rate for prisons" [...] that are cost-based to protect providers and ensure [...] "some return on investment." [...] In 2015, Pai again opposed rate caps on in-state inmate calls with families paying up to $54 a phone call. He raised concerns about the increased use of contraband cell phones in prisons. In November 2016, the ICS provider won a halt to cap the rates. Pai criticized Democrats for appealing and the courts for intervening on ICS rate regulations. [...] Shortly after his January 23 confirmation as chairman, Pai withdrew support for the FCC case involving GTL and CenturyLink set for February 6, 2017 which had called for curbing phone <b>call</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the position of}} the Buchen-Kelly density in a family of entropy maximising densities which all match European call option prices for a given maturity observed in the market.

We present a fast root-finding algorithm {{that can be used to}} calculate the Buchen-Kelly density, and give upper boundaries for three different discrepancies that can be used as convergence criteria. Given the <b>call</b> <b>prices,</b> arbitrage-free digital prices at the same strikes can only move within upper and lower boundaries given by left and right call spreads. As the number of <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples where the densities converge to the Buchen-Kelly density in the sense of relative entropy when we use centered call spreads as proxies for digital prices.

It can be shown that the <b>call</b> <b>price</b> estimator is pointwise consistent and asymptotically normal. The estimator of the state price density is also consistent.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of fixed network liberalisation in Europe in the late 1990 s, the main concern of regulators was to lower retail <b>call</b> <b>prices.</b> This was done by introducing wholesale regulation and promoting service-based competition. Some years later, the concern of some regulators turned from too high retail <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> to too low <b>call</b> <b>prices,</b> which might 'squeeze' entrants {{out of the market}}. This paper looks at a simple model in which this development is explained by increasing competitive pressure from an 'outside opportunity', most notably mobile telephony and cable. It is concluded that a margin squeeze is not necessarily used by the incumbent as a device to drive competitors out of the market and to increase market power but can also result from increased inter-modal competition. If this is the case, it is argued that the appropriate response would be deregulation or - under particular circumstances - a switch from cost-oriented access prices to alternatives such as retail-minus or capacity-based interconnection.

European <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> are then estimated using Monte Carlo and finite difference methods.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} regulating termination for interconnected telecommunications networks. We develop two models, the first that involves fixed market shares and the second, {{based on the work}} of Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998 a), which allows for subscriber competition. We show that if a dominant network (i. e., one with the greatest market share) has its termination charges regulated then this will tend to lower the average price of calls. It is also likely to lead to other networks raising their termination charges. If market shares are fixed, then extending termination regulation to non-dominant networks lowers <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> and is unambiguously welfare improving. However, if networks actively compete for subscribers then extending termination charge regulation to a non-dominant network may lead to higher <b>call</b> <b>prices.</b> This is most likely if the non-dominant network has a very low market share relative to the dominant network.

30|$|We propose an {{efficient}} method {{for the construction}} of an arbitrage-free <b>call</b> option <b>price</b> function from observed <b>call</b> <b>price</b> quotes. The no-arbitrage theory of option pricing places various shape constraints on the option price function.

Using the properties of this basis, we transform the constrained functional regression problem to the least-squares problem of finite dimension and derive the sufficiency conditions of no-arbitrage pricing to a set of linear constraints. The resultant linearly constrained least square minimization problem can easily be solved using {{an efficient}} quadratic programming algorithm.
