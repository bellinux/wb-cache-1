50|$|In the 2005-2006 Hajj season, Phuket Airlines {{provided}} Boeing 747-200 and 747-300 aircraft on a {{short term}} wet lease to Saudi Arabian Airlines. The carrier commissioned Air France Industries, the aircraft maintenance-service arm of the French flag carrier, to hep lift Phuket Airlines' safety standards which was successful in lifting the EU ban. In late 2006-07, the airline flew <b>charters</b> <b>for</b> the Saudi Arabia Ministry of the Interior flying out deportees.

In October 2007, Phuket Airlines resumed operations and provided three Boeing 747-200/-300 aircraft to Saudi Arabian Airlines {{on a short}} term ACMI/wet lease <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> the Hajj <b>charters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike Laker's {{established}} {{rivals in}} the trooping business, the Yorks Air Charter proposed {{to use on}} trooping flights offered unprecedented safety standards and a hitherto unknown level of comfort, including rear-facing seats with headrests. These were industry-firsts in the trooping business. In addition, Air Charter proposed to place spare parts along the routes to be flown — another industry-first. These innovations secured Air Charter its first trooping <b>contract.</b> <b>For</b> Laker, Air <b>Charter's</b> owner, the new contract was a goldmine. The £90 per flying hour the War Office was contracted to pay Air Charter made flying troops in cheap, second-hand planes a very profitable business, {{given the fact that}} Laker could easily amortise the cost of each York for about £5,000 {{as a result of the}} massive spares stockpile he had purchased at rock-bottom prices in government surplus sales on behalf of Aviation Traders.|$|R
