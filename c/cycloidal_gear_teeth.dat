40|$|Abstract. The pin-rack gearing is a {{particular}} type of <b>cycloidal</b> <b>gearing</b> which transforms a rotation motion to a linear one. Comparing with rack and pinion gearing and hydraulic swing cylinder, the pin-rack gearing has a more compact structure, less mass and lower cost.

Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile. There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. <b>Cycloidal</b> <b>gears</b> only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. <b>Cycloidal</b> <b>gears</b> are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{concentrates}} on the investigations regarding the situations of frictional shear stress of <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> and the relevant frictional effects on bending stresses and transmission error in gear meshing. Sliding friction {{is one of the}} major reasons causing gear failure and vibration; the adequate consideration of frictional effects is essential for understanding gear contact behavior accurately. An analysis of tooth frictional effect on gear performance in spur gear is presented using finite element method.
