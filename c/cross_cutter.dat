5000|$|Electromagnetic Combination Galaxy Mega (Denji Gattai Gyarakushī Mega): Combination of Mega Ship and Mega Shuttle, a {{homage to}} Bioman's Biorobo. Initially INET thought the Megarangers {{did not fully}} utilize the robots {{potential}} and had their tactics programmer, Professor Toyokawa, install a program that allows Galaxy Mega to fight without a human pilot. But the Shirmp Nejire incident helped Toyokama's to understand the negative potential and he allows the robot to remain in Kubota's control. The Galaxy Mega's last appearance in the series was when it was rendered inoperable by Burning Yugande, but was repaired and used again in Gingaman vs. Megaranger. Galaxy Mega's power helped to power up GaoKing in Gaoranger vs. Super Sentai. The Galaxy Mega's weapons are the MegaSaber (Mega Sāberu), a sword which the Galaxy Mega can use to perform {{a wide variety of}} attacks; Mega Side Cutter (Mega Saido Kattā) - a horizontal slash, Mega Flying Cutter (Mega Furaingu Kattā) - a jumping slash, Saber Electromagnetic Whip (Sāberu Denji Muchi) - an energy whip that is used to weaken an opponent, Mega Dash Cutter (Mega Dasshu Kattā) - a dashing horizontal slash, Mega <b>Cross</b> <b>Cutter</b> (Mega Kurosu Kattā) - a double diagonal Slash attack that forms an X, Galaxy Lance (Gyarakushī Ransu) - a sword extension attack that destroys its target from a distance, Mega Flash Arrow (Mega Furasshu Arō) - the saber is thrown like an arrow/spear to impale its enemy, Mega Straight Cutter (Mega Straighto Katta) and Saber Electromagnetic Snake (Sāberu Denji Hebi) - used against Toad Nejire, where Mega Pink took advantage of a toad's natural fear of snakes, by transforming the tip of the sword into a projection of a snake; MegaShield (Mega Shīrudo), which can protect the Galaxy Mega and enable it to safely enter Earth's atmosphere; and Booster Rifle (Būsutā Raifuru), a gun created from the Shuttle Booster which originally enabled the Mega Shuttle to make it into space. The Booster Rifle can fire energy blasts or freezing gas to freeze opponents.|$|E
40|$|The AOSD {{tools and}} methodologies have {{developed}} in a rapid speed in Java area. However, no matter how homologous. Net and Java are, AOP tools on. Net platform are still in experimental stage. The complex infrastructure and multi-language support {{make it hard to}} establish aspect-oriented programming on. Net. Microsoft provides Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL) to facilitate language implementation on. Net platform. But MSIL doesn’t support aspect-oriented languages. To facilitate aspect-oriented language implementation on. Net platform, it is best to provide an aspect-oriented intermediate language. This paper presents CCC, an aspect-oriented intermediate language on. Net platform. CCC stands for Common language <b>Cross</b> <b>Cutter.</b> Any aspect-oriented. Net language could first be transformed to CCC and then woven by CCC compiler. Since CCC supports high-level aspect-oriented language constructs directly, such as aspect, there is a little work to do for language implementation and the developers could concentrate on language design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Double-edged hob is {{commonly}} used as a tunneling tool when the shield machine works and {{it is easy to}} failure due to its insufficient strength in the rock breaking process. In order to solve this problem, the paper used the theory of finite element to do static simulation analysis of the hob. Firstly, the paper generated a three-dimensional model by using the software Pro/E based on a constant <b>cross</b> section double-edged <b>cutter.</b> Then, the maximum stress, maximum strain and their distributions on the double-edged hob could be obtained from static analysis based on the finite element analysis software ABAQUS. Finally, we could get the conclusion that double-edged hob met strength requirements in the test load conditions by comparing the maximum stress and yield strength of hob material. The results of static simulation analysis provided reference to material selection and optimization design of the double-edged hob and cutter head...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a high pressure experimental and modelling investigation on the ignition of n-butylcyclohexane and its mixtures with n-heptane. Mixtures {{were chosen to}} represent a surrogate for n-decylcyclohexane, a constituent of transportation fuels which has an extremely low vapour pressure and hence it is currently impossible to carry out gas phase experiments using this fuel. Thus, mixtures of 53 % n-butylcyclohexane and 47 % n-heptane were prepared and studied to mimic the same hydrogen/carbon ratio as n-decylcyclohexane. Ignition delay times were measured in two heated shock tubes in the temperature range 800 - 1550 K, at reflected shock 1, 10, 30 and 50 atm and at equivalence ratios of 0. 3, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 in air for both n-butylcyclohexane and mixtures of n-butylcyclohexane / n-heptane. The shock tubes {{used in this study}} consists of a 3 m driver section and 5. 73 m driven section separated by a double diaphragm section. Upon rupture of the diaphragm a shock wave is generated. This shock wave moves into the driven section compressing and heating the test gas. The ignition delay time is defined as the time from the arrival of the shock wave at the end wall to the ignition of the fuel. Ignition delay times were measured from 50 Âµs to 3 ms. Ignition delay times were also measured in a heated rapid compression machine in the temperature range 580 - 800 K, at compressed gas pressures of 10 and 30 atm for both n-butylcyclohexane and mixtures of n-butylcyclohexane / n-heptane at the equivalence ratios outlined for the shock tube. The rapid compression machine used in this study is a twin opposed system capable of compression of test gas mixtures up to 60 atm with a compression time of approximately 16 ms. Ignition delay times were measured from 3 ms to 100 ms. Due to the low vapour pressures of the fuels used in this study homogeneous heating of the equipment was essential to ensure that the fuel remained in the gas phase. Heating systems were installed onto the shock tubes and rapid compression machine, mixing tanks and manifolds. Experimental results obtained for both n-butylcyclohexane and mixtures of n-butylcyclohexane / n-heptane were compared to simulations of two models which are available in the literature, JetSurF 2. 0 and Natelson et al [...] The models failed to capture the experimental data. In addition ignition delay times are also measured in the low pressure shock tube. This is a stainless steel shock tube with a 6. 22 m driven section and a barrel shaped driver section. This is a single diaphragm shock tube. During an experiment the diaphragm is ruptured by a <b>cross</b> shaped <b>cutter</b> housed inside the driven section of the shock tube. Increased drive gas pressure caused the diaphragm to bulge and come in contact with the cutter resulting in the bursting of the diaphragm. Ignition delay time is defined as the time from the arrival of shock wave at the end wall to the maximum rise in CH* emission. Ignition delay times were measured from 50 Âµs to 1000 Âµs. Ignition delay times of the isomers of pentene were measured in the low-pressure shock tube. Experiments were carried out using 1 - and 2 -pentene in the temperature range 1250 - 1900 K, at a reflected shock pressure of 1 atm and at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 at 1 % fuel concentration. Experimental results were used to validate the model of Mehl et al. This work was presented at the 33 rd Internal Symposium on Combustion. Ignition delay times were also measured for 2, 5 -dimethylfuran in the low pressure shock tube. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range 1300 - 2000 K, at a reflected shock pressure of 1 and 2 atm and at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 at 0. 75 % fuel concentration. This works builds upon a study previously carried out by G. Black at NUI Galway where low pressure shock tube ignition delay times were measured at 1 atm, phi = 1. 0 and 2. 5. Experimental results from this study were used for model validation. Ignition delay times were also measured for 2, 5 -dimethylfuran in the low pressure shock tube.
