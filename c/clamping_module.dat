40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel measurement set-up {{dedicated to the}} characterization {{of the evolution of}} the high-frequency shielding-effectiveness of gaskets due to corrosion and ageing. The measurement set-up is based on the recently introduced stripline set-up which has been validated previously up to 40 GHz. Compared to the original stripline set-up, the adapted set-up has a removable “clamping module” which can be easily mounted and removed from the set-up. The <b>clamping</b> <b>module</b> allows to age the gasket inside e. g. a climate chamber while always keeping the gasket under the same compression rate. As the <b>clamping</b> <b>module</b> can be made out of different materials, it allows to study the influence of shielding-effectiveness of gaskets when applied to different materials. In order to avoid parallel leakage inside the measurement set-up, a high-performant gasket needs to be compressed below the module. Based on full-wave simulations, it is shown that the shielding-effectiveness given by this gasket underneath the <b>clamping</b> <b>module</b> is the main determining factor for the dynamic range of the set-up. In addition, a first set of measurements show the validity of the measurement set-up and approach. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Part 2 : Handling and Manipulation in AssemblyInternational audienceEven though {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the field of micro production and the development of miniaturized micro production-machines in the last ten years, an explicit consideration of clamping-devices has not taken place. The requirements for clamping technology in the manufacturing of microparts and the manufacturing of macroscale parts are highly different. Special clamping devices for each sector are needed. This article presents the designing of a special adhesive micro-clamping device for micro production. The clamping force is applied by fixing the workpiece to the <b>clamping</b> <b>module</b> using hot melt adhesives. Thus high surface pressure and damage to the micro-component is avoided. The development of this adhesive clamping device is a first implementation of a novel and promising approach for micro production. Basic functioning could be confirmed by practical tests...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the process and {{operations}} planning system ROUND and the strategies which underlie the decision making processes in the planning of turning operations. At first, an outline is given about the environment for which generative systems like ROUND are being developed. The differences between high volume production and job shop production, with respect to flexibility and productivity, are designated. The impact of automation on job shop production and its consequences for process and operations planning are discussed. In small batch manufacturing systems, relatively large amounts of process planning data have to be processed, which leads to an increasing interest for sophisticated computer aided process planning tools. Because available NC part programming systems usually {{do not support the}} generation of reliable and economic technological data, it is necessary to develop generative process and operation planning systems. Due to the relative complexity of the technological models, generative systems use a lot of computing power. Reduction of possible variants, combined with model refinement are techniques which are used in ROUND, in order to avoid excessive iteration. This is illustrated by the explanation of strategies which are implemented in two newly developed modules: The <b>clamping</b> <b>module</b> RNDFIX and the module for selection of tools for the roughing operation RNDRTL...|$|E

This station involves {{the development}} of a nanomanipulation platform and a planar patch-clamp module. The nanomanipulation platform not only enables the observation of biological cells, but also has the ability to give a precise pico-Newton force stimulus on a certain position of cells. The membrane potential of cells can be recorded by the patch <b>clamp</b> <b>module.</b> The module also has the ability to generate electric stimulus to the biological cells.

40|$|Abstruct- Commercially {{available}} modular fixturing systems typically {{include a}} lattice of holes with precise spacing {{and an assortment}} of precision locating and <b>clamping</b> <b>modules</b> that can be rigidly attached to the lattice. Currently, machinists manually design a suitable arrangement of these modules to hold a given part. This requires expertise and can delay production. Futhermore, a machinist may in many cases settle upon an arrangement that is not optimal for a given machining operation. In this paper we present an implemented algorithm that accepts a polygonal description of the part silhouette, and efficiently constructs the set of all feasible fixture designs that kinematically constrain the part in the plane. Each fixture is comprised of three locators rigidly attached to the lattice and one sliding clamp, and constrains the part without relying on friction. The algorithm is based on an efficient enumeration of admis-sible designs that exploits part geometry and a graphical force analysis. The algorithm run time is linear in the number of designs found, which is bounded by a polynomial in the number of part edges and the part’s maximal diameter in lattice units. Our review of the literature suggests {{that this is the first}} fixturing algorithm that is complete in the sense that it is guaranteed to find all admissible fixture designs for an arbitrary polygonal part silhouette and to identify the optimal fixture relative to an arbitrary quality metric. The algorithm does not consider out-of-plane forces or motions; however, we view this planar result as an essential component of a larger algorithm that solves the 3 -D fixture design problem by treating the planar and out-of-plane constraint problems separately. This approach is analogous to the widely used 3 - 2 - 1 fixture design heuristic, and appears to be applicable to a broad class of man-made parts. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSystem induced {{degradation}} {{can occur}} {{depending on the}} system design of PV power plants. In case of amorphous silicon solar modules this causes e. g. a diffusion of sodium ions from the cover glass into the TCO front contact, followed by a chemical reaction that leads to an irreversible power loss and is called TCO-corrosion. Leakage currents between the cover glass and the electrical connectors {{can be used as}} an indicator of the corrosion rate. It is state-of-the-art that a negative potential of the TCO-layer in respect to the cover class (resp. mounting structure) can {{have an impact on the}} corrosion process. To avoid corrosion the negative DC pole of the PV-generator has to be grounded. Thus a positive potential occurs between the TCO-layer and the cover glass and the positive charged sodium ions do not migrate into the TCO-layer [2]. In contrast to this, the results of newer studies show that the corrosion occurs for positive potentials, too [3, 4]. Consequently the basic objective of this paper is the analysis of leakage currents according to the mounting and grounding situation of amorphous silicon solar modules under outdoor conditions. For this purpose nine amorphous silicon solar modules were mounted with different mounting systems, with backrails and <b>module</b> <b>clamps.</b> Furthermore, an external voltage with negative and positive bias is applied between the mounting system and the short-circuited module connectors. Additionally the influence of an AC potential is investigated. This case may occur due to perturbations of an inverter. The leakage currents were measured and logged continuously...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a 5 year, $ 10 million Sandia/Industry project {{to develop an}} advanced borehole seismic source for use in {{oil and gas exploration}} and production. The development Team included Sandia, Chevron, Amoco, Conoco, Exxon, Raytheon, Pelton, and GRI. The seismic source that was developed is a vertically oriented, axial point force, swept frequency, clamped, reaction-mass vibrator design. It was based on an early Chevron prototype, but the new tool incorporates a number of improvements which make it far superior to the original prototype. The system consists of surface control electronics, a special heavy duty fiber optic wireline and draw works, a cablehead, hydraulic motor/pump <b>module,</b> electronics <b>module,</b> <b>clamp,</b> and axial vibrator module. The tool has a peak output of 7, 000 lbs force and a useful frequency range of 5 to 800 Hz. It can operate in fluid filled wells with 5. 5 -inch or larger casing to depths of 20, 000 ft and operating temperatures of 170 C. The tool includes fiber optic telemetry, force and phase control, provisions to add seismic receiver arrays below the source for single well imaging, and provisions for adding other vibrator modules to the tool in the future. The project yielded four important deliverables: a complete advanced borehole seismic source system with all associated field equipment; field demonstration surveys funded by industry showing the utility of the system; industrial sources for all of the hardware; and a new service company set up by their industrial partner to provide commercial surveys...|$|R
