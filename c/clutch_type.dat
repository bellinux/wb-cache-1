50|$|Over its lifetime, the OC-9 {{had several}} {{different}} models of engines, both gasoline powered and diesel powered. In 1960, the crawler was {{fitted with a}} 4-cylinder, 198 cuin L, 62 hp Hercules diesel engine. The same year, the OC-9 introduced Oliver's Trans-O-Matic power-shift transmission, the case made of cast alloy steel. The hydrostatic transmission allowed for on-the-go changes {{between high and low}} ranges and also the ability to have one drive sprocket in forward and the other in reverse, something not possible with <b>clutch</b> <b>type</b> crawlers. The transmission, along with power steering and instant reverse, made the crawler easily maneuverable. While a conventional <b>clutch</b> <b>type</b> bulldozer only allows for the engine's kinetic torque to be transmitted to the ground, a converter type set up allows the engine to build static torque and transfer more power to the ground.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} Japanese-spec C models, US-spec STis {{received}} additional rear fender flaring {{in order to}} allow an increase in wheel size. The wheel size went from 17" [...] x 7.5" [...] to 17" [...] x 8". In accordance with the increased wheel width, steering lock-to-lock turns have been reduced. Wheel hub strength was improved. The P.C.D. was changed from 5 x 100 to 5 x 114.3. The Suretrac front LSD in the 2004 model was replaced with a helical unit, the rear differential remains the same <b>clutch</b> <b>type</b> unit. Torque split is set at 35/65. In the interior, the Stereo became standard. The badging has been revised and different look was given to the steering wheel, shift knob, HVAC controls, and center console.|$|E

In this setting, the ACD will almost {{immediately}} allow the center differential to go into a free state upon detecting a steering input. Additionally, this mode provides the strongest limited-slip clamping force of the three modes. Although the US versions did not come with the AYC, it did come with a rear 1.5way <b>clutch</b> <b>type</b> LSD (limited slip differential)which, limits the slip from both rear wheels causing less traction loss of the rear wheels. The most common setup is the 1.5 way LSD, locking on throttle and partially locking on braking. In racing, Lancer Evolutions are not equipped with AYC or ACD because it is believed that better lap times are achieved by pure driver skill without any computer based assistance systems.|$|E
40|$|In {{several studies}} and {{on-going}} developments for advanced rotorcraft, {{the need for}} variable multi-speed capable rotors has been raised. Speed changes of up to 50 have been proposed for future rotorcraft to improve vehicle performance. A rotor speed change during operation not only requires a rotor that can perform effectively over the operating speedload range, but also requires a propulsion system possessing these same capabilities. A study was completed investigating possible drive system arrangements that can accommodate up to a 50 speed change.

40|$|Female-female {{pairs of}} Ring-billed Gulls were studied on Granite Island, {{northern}} Lake Superior, during the breeding seasons of 1979 and 1980. In 1979 the colony consisted of approximately 2400 pairs with 99 nests (4. 1 %) containing {{five to seven}} eggs. In 1980 the colony had increased in size to 2600 pairs and contained 71 (2. 7 %) superclutches. Extrapolating from superclutches in my observation areas, where all attendants were known, approximately 85 % of the total ntmber of superclutches were attended by female-female pairs. The difficulty distinguishing these nests from those of polygynous groups laying in a single nest-cup or nests receiving dump eggs is discussed. Because of these difficulties, all superclutches were monitored and treated as a single sample. Eggs laid in superclutches were slightly smaller than those from normal clutches, but {{did not differ in}} shape. The incubation period differed significantly for eggs of the two <b>clutch</b> <b>types,</b> with eggs in superclutches taking Ionger to hatch than those in normal clutches. Ihis may be because the eggs toward the outside edge of nests containing superclutches received significantly less heat. Nests containing superclutches were larger than those containing normal clutches but were of similar quality and were not differentially located by substrate, density or colony location. Nearest neighbour distance was also similar for the two <b>clutch</b> <b>types.</b> Nest success did not differ significantly between superclutches and normal clutches. Hatching success for superclutches was 33 % in 1979 and 29 % in 1980, while normal clutches had 77 % and 61 % in 1979 and 1980, respectively. Significantly more eggs rolled from the nest or were destroyed or abandoned in superclutches compared to those from normal clutches. Egg fertility rates were 87 % and 94 % for eggs in superclutches while normal clutches had 100 % and 99 % fertility in the two years of study. Chicks from normal clutches had a significantly higher fledging success than those of superclutches. Chicks from the latter had a higher rate of mortality due mainly to a higher death rate during the week following hatching. During both years of my study chicks from superclutches hatched at significantly lighter weights than those from normal clutches, but their weights did not differ after the first week post hatch. Tarsal and culmen measurements followed a similar pattern to that of weight. Food types brought to chicks from the two <b>clutch</b> <b>types</b> did not differ. Their diet consisted almost totally of fish and insects. Females of female-female pairs were of normal size, weight, age and condition compared to heterosexually paired females. Levels of 13 blood chemistry parameters were measured for female-female pair members and heterosexually paired birds. The only consistent differences were low cholesterol and elevated progesterone levels in members of female-female pairs. Intra-pair size differences suggest that the females assertively paired by size. They exhibited mate fidelity {{and to a lesser extent}} nest-site tenacity. Behaviour of female-female pairs is compared to heterosexual pairs during courtship, the incubation period and rearing of the brood. Females involved in female-female pairs cooperated well. Four polygynous groups were monitored, and their behaviour and reproductive success is reported.

5000|$|In 2007, quite {{a number}} of changes were made to the US-spec STI. Due to Subaru's {{decision}} to reduce costs by cutting the amount of aluminum used, the US-spec STI no longer receives the J-spec Spec C control arms. The control arms are now the aluminum ones used on the Japan-spec revision A and B non-Spec C STis. The high caster angle has been reduced, which in turn reduces the wheelbase from 100" [...] to 99.4". The rear sway bar has decreased in size from 20 mm to 19 mm. The gear ratios of second, third and fourth gears have been made longer (higher ratio) in order to improve fuel economy and drivability, which inadvertently reduces 1/4 mile drag racing times due to the ability to trap 114 mi/h km/h in 4th gear, without the shift to 5th. The transmission oil pump that was deleted in the 2006 model year was also brought back for the 07 model year transmission. The EJ257's cylinder heads have been redesigned to improve cooling, and the sodium-filled exhaust valves have been deleted. Pistons are the same as previous years. The alternator is changed from a 90A rating to 110 amps. The rear Limited Slip Differential is now a Torsen unit, considered an upgrade over the previous model's <b>clutch</b> <b>type</b> unit.

40|$|High {{variation}} in egg coloration among birds {{has traditionally been}} explained as adaptation for camouflage. We tested this hypothesis by conducting reciprocal clutch exchanges (n" 301) among Brewer’s blackbirds Euphagous cyanocephalus, red-winged blackbirds Agelaius phoeniceus, and yellow-headed blackbirds Xanthoce-phalus xanthocephalus. We predicted that clutches placed against their natural nest backgrounds would have higher survival rates than heterospecific clutches. Intraspecific clutch exchanges were used as a control. Clutch survival was monitored for a 9 -d period at all nests, during which time incubation rhythm and nest defense were quantified. Intraspecific clutch exchanges did not influence incubation or nest defense. For two of the species, intraspecific clutch exchanges did not influence clutch survival; in red-winged blackbirds, however, intraspecifically exchanged clutches had somewhat depressed survival curves relative to control clutches (P" 0. 08).
