30|$|Chilean forest {{companies}} commonly dry {{large quantities}} of pulp logs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>roadside</b> before being transported to pulp and paper plants, and recently to industrial boilers for the generation of steam, heat and electricity.

Moreover, yard handling would become unfeasible when considering drying and storing large log quantities {{for long periods of}} time.|$|R
