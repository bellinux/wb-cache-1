5|$|Tank was a {{commercial}} success and {{is credited with}} buoying the finances of the newly merged Atari at a critical time for the company. It sold over 10,000 units, considered a large hit at the time, though Ralph H. Baer claims that was only the 1974 sales, with a further 5,000 sold in 1975. Atari produced a second version of the game, a cocktail cabinet form {{in which the two}} players sat across a <b>circular</b> <b>table</b> from each other. A sequel, Tank II, was released in 1974 to sales of around 1,000 units; gameplay was identical, though the maze could be changed to a new format by modifying the circuitry and more sound effects were added. It was followed by three further sequels: Tank III in 1975, the first game to be third in a series; the color Tank 8 in 1976, which featured eight tanks and players simultaneously; and Ultra Tank in 1978, which reverted to a two-player black and white game with the ability to select multiple different maze types and have invisible tanks.|$|E

[...] Much of the furniture is in the French Boulle revival style (with brass inlays in the style of André Charles Boulle). [...] An alcove was intended to be occupied by an organ but it contains a rosewood bookcase in boulle work. [...] The <b>circular</b> <b>table,</b> couches and chairs are also in boulle style, made by Gillows. [...] The fireplace is made from white marble and is decorated with images of musical instruments and motifs. [...] Two vases on the mantelpiece are 19th-century Meissen. The harpsichord was made by Kirckman's and is dated 1789. [...] The paintings include pieces by Gaspard Dughet, Aernout van der Neer, [...] Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem, and Guercino, and two still life paintings by Jan Davidszoon de Heem and Cornelis de Heem. [...] To the south of the music room is the Drawing Room which is decorated in a similar style. [...] The ceiling is gilded and coffered and is decorated with rosettes. [...] Together with its elaborate furniture it is the [...] "most impressive and ostentatious room in the house". The paintings include two views of Venice by Canaletto, The Sacrifice of Noah by Poussin, The Martyrdom of St. Stephen by Van Dyck, and paintings by Annibale Carracci and Giovanni Battista Cimaroli. [...] A full-length portrait of Samuel Egerton is by Bartolomeo Nazari.|$|E

The carcase of a cold chicken, a bowl of fruit, a great ham, deeply gashed to its heart of tenderest white and pink, the brown cannon ball of a cold plum-pudding, a slender Hock bottle, and a decanter of claret jostled one another for a place on this festive board.

60|$|There {{was once}} a fine {{collection}} of old boys to be seen round the <b>circular</b> <b>table</b> at Offley’s every night, between the hours of half-past eight and half-past eleven. We have lost sight of them for some time. There were, and may be still, for aught we know, two splendid specimens in full blossom at the Rainbow Tavern in Fleet-street, who always used {{to sit in the}} box nearest the fireplace, and smoked long cherry-stick pipes which went under the table, with the bowls resting on the floor. Grand old boys they were—fat, red-faced, white-headed old fellows—always there—one on one side the table, and the other opposite—puffing and drinking away in great state. Everybody knew them, and it was supposed by some people that they were both immortal.|$|E
60|$|They {{entered a}} cupolaed hall. Seats of ivory and gold were ranged round a <b>circular</b> <b>table</b> of cedar, inlaid with the campaigns against the Titans, in silver exquisitely worked, a nuptial present of Vulcan. The service of gold plate threw all {{the ideas of}} the King of Thessaly as to royal magnificence into the darkest shade. The {{enormous}} plateau represented the constellations. Ixion viewed the Father of Gods and men with great interest, who, however, did not notice him. He acknowledged the majesty of that countenance whose nod shook Olympus. Majestically robust and luxuriantly lusty, his tapering waist was evidently immortal, for it defied Time, and his splendid auburn curls, parted on his forehead with celestial precision, descended over cheeks glowing with the purple radiancy of perpetual manhood.|$|E
60|$|Somehow or other, {{stunned and}} speechless, we lifted {{ourselves}} heavily into the opening. We {{fell into the}} full glow of a lamp-lit, cushioned, tiny room, with a circular wall lined with books, a <b>circular</b> <b>table,</b> and a circular seat around it. At this table sat three people. One was Basil, who, in the instant after alighting there, had fallen into an attitude of marmoreal ease {{as if he had}} been there from boyhood; he was smoking a cigar with a slow pleasure. The second was Lieutenant Drummond Keith, who looked happy also, but feverish and doubtful compared with his granite guest. The third was the little bald-headed house-agent with the wild whiskers, who called himself Montmorency. The spears, the green umbrella, and the cavalry sword hung in parallels on the wall. The sealed jar of strange wine was on the mantelpiece, the enormous rifle in the corner. In the middle of the table was a magnum of champagne. Glasses were already set for us.|$|E
60|$|But his abashments last too long; {{his cheek}} hath changed from blush to pallor; what strange thing does Pierre Glendinning see? Behind the first close, busy breast-work of young girls, are several very little stands, or <b>circular</b> <b>tables,</b> where sit {{small groups of}} twos and threes, sewing in small {{comparative}} solitudes, as it were. They {{would seem to be}} the less notable of the rural company; or else, for some cause, they have voluntarily retired into their humble banishment. Upon one of these persons engaged at the furthermost and least conspicuous of these little stands, and close by a casement, Pierre's glance is palely fixed.|$|R
50|$|The {{site that}} is {{currently}} {{open to the public}} comprises two catacombs out of the 24 in the St Paul’s cluster.

60|$|Next night Jack and his messmates gave a grand entertainment. Harry and {{two other}} lieutenants of the 33d--for {{the battle of the}} Alma had made so many death {{vacancies}} in the regiment that he had obtained his promotion--were there, and two young officers of the 30th who were cousins of one of Jack's tentmates. It certainly was a close pack. Tom Hammond had obtained some planks, and, laying these on the flour barrel, had contrived a sort of <b>circular</b> <b>table,</b> round which the parties sat with their backs to the wall, on boxes, empty preserved potato tins, rum kegs, and portmanteaus. There was no room for Tom to enter the tent, so the full dishes were handed in through the entrance, and the empty ones passed out. Each guest of course brought his own plate, knife, fork, spoon, and drinking tin. As for a change of plates, no one dreamed of such a thing.|$|E
60|$|Twelve o'clock came, and we {{went into}} the crown-room, with a throng of other visitors,--so many that they could only be {{admitted}} in separate groups. The Regalia of Scotland lie on a <b>circular</b> <b>table</b> within an iron railing, round and round which the visitors pass, gazing with all their eyes. The room was dark, however, except for the dim twinkle of a candle or gaslight; and the regalia did not show to any advantage, though there are some rich jewels, set in their ancient gold. The articles consist of a two-handed sword, with a hilt and scabbard of gold, ornamented with gems, and a mace, with a silver handle, all very beautifully made; besides the golden collar and jewelled badge of the Garter, and something else which I forget. Why they keep this room so dark I cannot tell; but it is a poor show, and gives the spectator an idea of the poverty of Scotland, and the minuteness of her sovereignty, which I had not gathered from her royal palaces.|$|E
6000|$|Most of {{our readers}} will {{understand}} what was meant by Mary Pratt's [...] "inclination of the earth's axis to the plane of its orbit;" [...] but as {{there may be a}} few who do not, and as the consequences of this great physical fact are materially connected with the succeeding events of the narrative, we propose to give such a homely explanation of the phenomenon as we humbly trust will render it clear to the most clouded mind. The orbit of the earth is the path which it follows in space in its annual revolution around the sun. To a planet there is no up or down, except as ascent and descent are estimated from and towards itself. In all other respects it floats in vacuum, or what is so nearly so as to be thus termed. Now, let the uninstructed reader imagine a large <b>circular</b> <b>table,</b> with a light on its surface, and near to its centre. The light shall represent the sun, {{the outer edge of the}} circle of the table the earth's orbit, and its surface the plane of that orbit. In nature there is no such thing as a plane at all, the space within the orbit being vacant; but the surface of the table gives a distinct notion of the general position of the earth as it travels round the sun. It is scarcely necessary to say that the axis of the earth is an imaginary line drawn through the planet, from one pole to the other; the name being derived from the supposition that our daily revolution is made on this axis.|$|E

60|$|Here {{he saw the}} {{important}} and delicate core again carefully tested as to its electrical condition, after which it received a new jacket of tanned jute yarn {{to protect it from}} the iron top coat yet to come. Its jute jacket on, it was then coiled away in tanks full of water, where it was constantly kept submerged and continuously tested for insulation. Last of all the top coat was put on. This consisted of ten wires of peculiarly fine and strong iron. Each of these ten wires had put on it a special coat of its own, made of tarred Manilla yarn, to protect it from rust as well as to lighten its specific gravity. The core being brought from its tank, and passed round several sheaves, which carried it below the factory floor, was drawn up {{through a hole in the}} centre of a <b>circular</b> <b>table,</b> around the circumference of which were ten drums of the Manilla-covered wire. A stout iron rod, fastened to the circumference of the table, rose from between each drum to the ceiling, converging in a cone which passed through to the floor above. Our core rose in the middle of all, and went through the hollow of the cone. When all was put in noisy and bewildering motion, the core which rose from the turning-table and whirling drums as a thin jute-clad line, came out in the floor above a stout iron-clad cable, with a Manilla top-dressing, possessing strength sufficient to bear eleven miles of its own length perpendicularly suspended in water--or a margin of strength more than four and a half times that required,--and with a breaking strain of seven tons fifteen hundredweight.|$|E

The {{most common type}} of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs, although numerous configurations exist, including trapezoid and <b>circular.</b> <b>Tables</b> in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes - in depictions of banquets, it appears as though each participant would have utilized a single table, rather than a collective use of a larger piece. Tables also figured prominently in religious contexts, as indicated in vase paintings, for example the wine vessel associated with Dionysus, dating to around 450 BC and now housed at the Art Institute of Chicago. Chests were used for storage of clothes and personal items, and were usually rectangular with hinged lids.
