50|$|<b>Cipemastat</b> (rINN, {{also known}} as Ro 32-3555 and by the {{tentative}} trade name Trocade) is a selective inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 that has been investigated as an anti-arthritis agent. It is being developed by Roche.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} rationally {{designed}} MMP inhibitors have shown some promise {{in the treatment}} of pathologies that MMPs are suspected to be involved in (see above). However, most of these, such as marimastat (BB-2516), a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, and <b>cipemastat</b> (Ro 32-3555), an MMP-1 selective inhibitor, have performed poorly in clinical trials. The failure of Marimastat was partially responsible for the folding of British Biotech, which developed it. The failure of these drugs has been due largely to toxicity (in particular, musculo-skeletal toxicity in the case of broad spectrum inhibitors) and failure to show expected results (in the case of trocade, promising results in rabbit arthritis models were not replicated in human trials). The reasons behind the largely disappointing clinical results of MMP inhibitors is unclear, especially in light of their activity in animal models.|$|E
50|$|The {{pioneering}} hydroxamate-based inhibitors {{were followed}} {{by a set of}} 'new generation' molecules with features including a substituted aryl, a sulfonamide and a hydroxamate zinc-binding group.In MMI-270 there is also an amino acid sidechain-type substituent on the carbon that is α to the hydroxamate, along with a sidechain on the sulfonamide (which was later shown to be unnecessary). The N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminoacid hydroxamate of MMI-270 mimics the marimastat succinate motif. <b>Cipemastat,</b> which was developed as an MMP-1, -3 and -9 collagenase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis, also has the marimastat succinate motif. Its clinical trial was terminated prematurely.MMI-166 has an N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminocarboxylate zinc-binding group, different from the hydroxamate-zinc binding group seen in MMI-270 and <b>Cipemastat.</b> It also has a triaryl substitution that the other structures didn‘t have. ABT-770 and Prinomastat also have an aryl substitution. In ABT-770 the two phenyl rings are directly connected but in Prinomastat the two phenyl rings are connected by an oxygen atom, forming a diphenylether. These three permutations direct the SAR away from MMP-1 and toward the „deep pocket“ MMPs such as the gelatinases. ABT-770 shows anticancer activity in animal models, but it is easily metabolised to an amine metabolite that causes phospholipidosis. MMI-166 has shown anticancer activity in numerous animal models, but there is no data available of its clinical performance. Prinomastat on the other hand, {{is one of the best}} studied MMP inhibitors. It showed excellent preclinical animal anticancer efficacy, but a recurring limitation to these hydroxamates (Prinomastat in particular) is drug metabolism including loss of the hydroxamate zinc-binding group.These inhibitors {{were followed by}} the next group of hydroxamate-based inhibitors, which focus on the suppression of metabolism, minimization of MMP-1 inhibitory activity and the control of subtype selectivity, by structure-based design. The tetrahydropyran in RS-130830 introduces a steric block that suppresses metabolism, which would fix the problem that the the previous generation of inhibitors showed. The outcome of its clinical evaluation has not yet been disclosed. 239796-97-5 has improved ADME and MMP-1 selectivity properties and has shown excellent oral efficacy in an animal model of osteoarthritis. Although, the therapeutic objectives for these inhibitors is not cancer, like it has been for most of the MMP inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis kills {{more people}} than any other {{bacterial}} disease. The characteristic tissue destruction that occurs during infection contributes to morbidity, mortality, and transmission. Tissue damage limits antibiotic effectiveness, and generates regions of immune privilege. Therefore, therapies that target tissue destruction may improve treatment outcomes. Currently, modelling tissue destruction in vivo requires the infection of large animals for prolonged periods. These models are highly variable in outcome. This makes experimentation challenging, and limits there use in testing therapeutic strategies, which in turn limits the progression of potential therapies to clinical trials. This thesis outlines {{the development of a}} highly consistent rabbit model of cavitary tuberculosis, in which novel therapies can be investigated, using small groups of animals. A method to assess pathology in vivo by breath-hold computed tomography was also developed. Matrix metalloproteinase- 1 is confirmed as a potential mediator of tissue destruction, and cathepsin K is newly identified as a potential mediator of tissue destruction. These collagenases are targetable with the drugs <b>Cipemastat</b> and Odanacatib respectively, both of which are safe in man. This thesis provides a novel system for trialling treatments for tuberculosis in the context of human-like, tissue-destructive pathology. This may facilitate the selection of both antibiotic and non-antibiotic treatment strategies for tuberculosis. This model will allow for {{a better understanding of the}} physical, chemical, molecular, genetic and immunological characteristics and determinants of cavitary tuberculosis. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Pneumococcal {{meningitis}} (PM) {{results in}} high mortality rates and long-lasting neurological deficits. Hippocampal apoptosis and cortical necrosis are histopathological correlates of neurofunctional sequelae in rodent models and are frequently observed in autopsy studies {{of patients who}} die of PM. In experimental PM, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -converting enzyme (TACE) {{has been shown to}} reduce brain injury and the associated impairment of neurocognitive function. However, none of the compounds evaluated in these studies entered clinical development. Here, we evaluated two second-generation MMP and TACE inhibitors with higher selectivity and improved oral availability. Ro 32 - 3555 (Trocade, <b>cipemastat)</b> preferentially inhibits collagenases (MMP- 1, - 8, and - 13) and gelatinase B (MMP- 9), while Ro 32 - 7315 is an efficient inhibitor of TACE. PM was induced in infant rats by the intracisternal injection of live Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ro 32 - 3555 and Ro 32 - 7315 were injected intraperitoneally, starting at 3 h postinfection. Antibiotic (ceftriaxone) therapy was initiated at 18 h postinfection, and clinical parameters (weight, clinical score, mortality rate) were recorded. Myeloperoxidase activities, concentrations of cytokines and chemokines, concentrations of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, and collagen concentrations were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. Animals were sacrificed at 42 h postinfection, and their brains were assessed by histomorphometry for hippocampal apoptosis and cortical necrosis. Both compounds, while exhibiting disparate MMP and TACE inhibitory profiles, decreased hippocampal apoptosis and cortical injury. Ro 32 - 3555 reduced mortality rates and cerebrospinal fluid TNF, interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and collagen levels, while Ro 32 - 7315 reduced weight loss and cerebrospinal fluid TNF and IL- 6 levels...|$|E
