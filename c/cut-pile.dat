25|$|In Australia, Datsun {{released}} the locally produced 180B in October 1972 as a four-door sedan in Deluxe and GL trims, and a two-door SSS coupe. The engine fitted was the 1.8-liter L18 engine paired to a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission; Datsun upgraded the SSS to a five-speed manual in 1975. Over the base Deluxe, GL models added: vinyl roof, radio with separate speaker, upgraded interior upholstery and trim, <b>cut-pile</b> interior carpeting, chrome exhaust extension, rear mounted GL badge, and whitewall tyres. In early 1974, wrap-around front indicators, new tail-lights and cabin trim changes heralded a range-wide facelift, while a fully imported (not locally manufactured) luxury GX sedan arrived in November 1974.|$|E
25|$|This {{model was}} also {{released}} to New Zealand in 1977, assembled CKD in 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon forms. A coupe model was also released, imported built-up from Japan. Unlike the Australian models the sedans used the {{independent rear suspension}} system of the Japanese specification models. This Bluebird {{was the first to}} be assembled in Nissan New Zealand's own brand-new assembly plant at Wiri, South Auckland. For {{the first two years of}} assembly the cars were fitted with a 1.8-litre unit, hence they used the 180B nameplate. Automatic transmission was optional for both. Nissan also added its first luxury ZX version with this generation – features included velour upholstery, 'luxury' <b>cut-pile</b> carpet sourced locally and tinted glass.

2500|$|During {{most of the}} Toronado's second-generation run, two {{interior}} trims {{were generally}} offered each year. The standard interior trim consisted of a choice of cloth or vinyl upholstery and a Custom Sport notchback bench seat with center armrest. An optional Brougham interior available in cloth, velour or vinyl trims included <b>cut-pile</b> carpeting, door-mounted courtesy lighting and a split 60/40 bench seat with armrest. From 1971 to 1973, the Toronado's [...] "Command Center" [...] wrap-around instrument panel was similar to other full-sized Oldsmobiles featuring a large squared speedometer {{directly in front of}} the driver, heating/air conditioning and lights/wipers switches on the left hand side and the radio controls and cigar lighter on the right hand side.

2500|$|Polypropylene, a {{polyolefin}} stiffer {{than the}} cheaper polyethylene, {{is used to}} produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as [...] "olefin", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops {{tend to be more}} resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade <b>cut-pile</b> styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, {{it can be difficult to}} clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4" [...] thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car {{for that}} model year. [...] "Now it's beautiful," [...] said the {{brochure}} of Nova's all-new sheet metal, [...] "refined {{along the lines}} of elegant European sedans." [...] Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional flip-out windows) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had <b>cut-pile</b> carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars.

5000|$|Kuba women {{traditionally}} wore overskirts during burial displays, but the overskirt {{was later}} adopted {{as part of}} many ceremonial ensembles worn during ritual dances, celebrations and masked performances. The wraparound skirt was secured with a belt and worn over a typically monochrome red or white embroidered skirt. These skirts exhibit a variety of design components; some skirts employ flat linear embroidery exclusively, while others employ this technique exclusive on {{the borders of the}} fabric, in which case the interior is executed with <b>cut-pile</b> embroidery, which lends the surface a [...] "plush" [...] appearance and feel. [...] In the <b>cut-pile</b> embroidery technique, short raffia strands are individually inserted with a needle under one or more warps or wefts of a plain-woven raffia panel, then cut close to the surface at each end to produce the raised [...] "pile."

5000|$|A third {{example of}} the Ceremonial Panel from the Shoowa people, also made of woven raffia palm fiber, <b>cut-pile</b> and linear embroidery, dating from 1950-1975, is 24" [...] × 24 1/4" [...] (60.96 cm. × 6l.28 cm.) in size. The {{colorful}} dots (diamonds, rectangles, triangles) belong to the familiar tiny tunjoko designs seen in many Shoowa cloths. However here, instead of filling in the intervals between major motifs, they become the principal designs that fill the entire cloth. Intruding upon this dot-filled ground we see a grid of squares drawn by multiple, fine, dark-and-light embroidered lines. In front of this grid two large vertical interlace designs begin at the bottom as thin curved forms and rise crisscrossing to the top.|$|E

5000|$|An early {{example of}} Shoowa {{textiles}} is the Ceremonial Panel. This piece dates from 1885-1910, and is 17" [...] × 59" [...] (41.91 cm × 149.86 cm) in size. This ancient cloth {{is composed of}} two pieces joined across the center; and bordered by pompoms, a technique reported for textiles on the Kongo coast in the seventeenth century. The basic weave is typical for Shoowa with close warps and weft of similar thickness and even distribution. The designs are shaped by two embroidery techniques: lines of stem stitching and <b>cut-pile.</b> To create the plush effect, an embroiderer twists a strand of raffia into an iron needle which she inserts between the warp and weft, leaving a short tuft. After pulling the fiber strand through to about two milimeters in height, she cuts it with a narrow knife held vertically in the same hand and brushes both ends.|$|E
50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in <b>cut-pile</b> carpets by all means. A cut pile carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and {{ergonomic}} disadvantages for the “walker” as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn’t absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called “pinpoint tip definition” in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1986 model year, the Grand Wagoneer {{received}} a new four part front grille and a stand-up hood ornament.

Changes {{were made to the}} instrument panel that now featured square gauges, featured woodgrain overlays and contained an improved climate control system. A new two spoke steering wheel also included new stalks for the lights and wiper and washer controls on the column.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being applied to visualize moisture distributions within textile structures; pore structure and moisture movement (both vertical and horizontal) during loading and/or drying are being measured. Magnetic resonance imaging {{has been used}} to visualize moisture distribution in <b>cut-pile</b> nylon carpet following the dyeing and finishing process and before it enters the dryer. At moisture levels typical of those following hydro-extraction (i. e., ~ 70 %), water is concentrated within the carpet yarns of the backing. From optical micrographs, {{it can be seen that}} this is the same region as the smallest capillaries. Through-flow drying was simulated inside the MRI scanner. Overall drying rate at room temperature and constant air flow (3 L/min) does not depend on whether air is blown on backing or on carpet face. However, local drying rates do depend on whether air hits the backing or the surface first. When air is blown on the backing, pile and backing region reach same low moisture levels at the same time. When air is blown on the carpet surface, tufts dry faster and backing dries slower. Based on these results, a potentially faster drying process is proposed...|$|E
