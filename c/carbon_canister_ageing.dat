50|$|Built {{during the}} era when tougher fuel economy laws {{had just come}} into effect in the US and the {{national}} speed limit was 55 mph to save fuel, the LeSharo was intended to appeal to drivers who wanted better fuel efficiency than traditional motor homes. The chassis and cab were built by Renault, {{based on the same}} platform as the Renault Trafic (T5, LWB). Renault sold complete knock down (CKD) kits to Winnebago All the 1983 models were powered by the 2068cc all aluminum OHC 4 cylinder normally-aspirated diesel engine (producing 66 hp) with a 4 speed manual transaxle, yielding 22 mpg (US). In 1984 an optional turbo charger was added, increasing power to 75 hp. In 1985, a 2165cc Bosch fuel injected, 4 cylinder gasoline engine became available, with a 3 speed computer-controlled automatic transaxle, delivering more power, but somewhat less fuel economy and making the vehicle 423 lb (192 kg) heavier. After 1986, the diesel engine was discontinued. Catalytic converters and <b>carbon</b> <b>canisters</b> were not required for motor vehicles exclusively for sale in Europe and were only fitted for the US market to comply with the US E.P.A. requirements for exhaust and evaporative emissions at the time.

40|$|This report {{documents}} how the EPA NONROAD {{emission inventory}} model {{accounts for the}} effects of temperature and RVP on diurnal evaporative emissions. Background The EPA NONROAD model estimates diurnal evaporative emissions from gasolinefueled engines. Evaporative emissions from diesel-fueled engines are considered negligible due to the extremely low volatility of diesel fuel and, therefore, are not included in the NONROAD model. Evaporative emissions from most gasoline-fueled engines are very sensitive to the volatility of the fuel (typically expressed as Reid Vapor Pressure or RVP) as well as the temperatures that the fuel experiences. In highway vehicles, this sensitivity is mitigated to some degree by the <b>carbon</b> <b>canister</b> evaporative control systems that have been used for many years, but such control systems are not currently used on nonroad equipment.

During the study, numerous technologies were thoroughly evaluated, which allowed BP Solar to select systems that outperformed the stringent federal and state regulations.

40|$|In {{the second}} phase of the {{speciation}} profile review, new headspace vapor profiles were developed using vapor-liquid equilibrium theory and liquid fuel composition profiles provided by ARB. Headspace vapor profiles were developed for 4 liquid fuels (gasoline with MTBE @ 2 wt % oxygen, gasoline with ethanol @ 2 wt % oxygen, gasoline with ethanol @ 3. 5 wt % oxygen, and gasoline without oxygenates). The theoretical calculations of headspace vapor composition presented here were made because ARB staff had concerns about the applicability and consistency of available vehicle test data used to characterize speciation of diurnal evaporative emissions, especially for ethanol-containing gasoline blends. However, it should be noted that while headspace vapor composition can be used to represent the speciation of some vapor displacement emissions that occur during vehicle refueling (Furey and Nagel, 1986), the presence of control equipment such as activated <b>carbon</b> <b>canisters</b> can affect the speciation of diurnal evaporative emissions (Urbanic et al., 1989). Therefore, calculated headspace vapor composition profiles developed here may not represent the composition of diurnal evaporative emissions. Furthermore, while the vapor-liquid equilibrium theory and methods used here have been verified for pure hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon-MTBE mixtures, measured headspace vapor composition profiles for ethanol-containing gasolines were not available from ARB at the time this report was prepared. Predicted headspace vapor composition profiles for the ethanol-containing gasolines should be evaluated using measured values before these profiles can be considered for use. ...|$|R

However, this resin is expensive and cannot be regenerated. In {{an effort to find}} a less expensive method for removing Tc- 99 from the groundwater, a literature search was performed. The results indicated that activated carbon may be used to recover technetium (as pertechnetate, TCO{sub 4 }{sup -}) from groundwater. Oak Ridge National Laboratory used activated carbon in both batch adsorption and column leaching studies. The adsorption study concluded that activated carbon absorbs TCO{sub 4 }{sup -} selectively and effectively over a wide range of pH values and from various dilute electrolyte solutions (< 0. 01 molarity). The column leaching studies confirmed a high adsorption capacity and selectivity of activated carbon for TCO{sub 4 }{sup -}.

40|$|A test {{programme}} designed {{to investigate the}} influence of gasoline vapour pressure and ethanol content on evaporative emissions from modern passenger cars {{has been carried out}} by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission jointly with CONCAWE and EUCAR. Seven gasoline passenger cars representative of current EURO 3 / 4 emissions technology were tested for evaporative emissions with ten different test fuels. The test fuel matrix comprised 60 and 70 kPa hydrocarbon base fuels with 5 and 10 % ethanol splash blends and 5 and 10 % ethanol matched volatility blends. The evaporative emission tests were carried out according to a test protocol based on the European homologation test procedure, with no additional vehicle conditioning. Although this test protocol turned out to have a considerable influence on the results, the programme has provided valuable information and several clear conclusions can be drawn. The programme confirmed that vapour pressure (DVPE) is a key fuel variable for evaporative emissions. However the effect of vapour pressure is strongly non-linear; the ethanol blends with final DVPE around 75 kPa gave considerably higher evaporative emissions than the lower volatility fuels in most of the vehicles. Differences between fuels with DVPE in the range 60 - 70 kPa were small. Additional tests on two vehicles performed after the main programme have raised some questions about possible effects of ethanol on <b>carbon</b> <b>canister</b> working capacity and on the role of permeation in determining evaporative emissions. Further research would be required to clarify these effects. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|R

40|$|A {{physical}} model simulating canister adsorption and desorption processes on activated carbon was developed from experimental {{data obtained from}} repeated tests on a single <b>carbon</b> <b>canister.</b> The model is able to predict canister behaviour under different loading and purging conditions and is thus able to predict canister breakthrough emissions. The {{physical model}} can accurately simulate butane adsorption and desorption on activated carbon. An empirical model was then developed, using simpler expressions for describing adsorption and desorption. Based on the empirical model a full evaporative emissions test procedure was simulated, enabling the calculation of evaporative emissions from canister-equipped vehicles. The fair agreement between measured and modelled emissions verifies that the empirical model {{may be used for}} the estimation of evaporative emissions from modern gasoline vehicles. For the calibration of the model extensive testing was conducted on one vehicle and for the final validation a smaller number of targeted tests were performed on other vehicles. These tests covered a wide range of parameters having an effect on evaporative emissions, namely fuel volatility, ambient temperature, canister and fuel tank sizes, fuel system materials. The source of evaporative emissions depends largely on the canister condition. A well purged canister, e. g. after extensive driving on the road, results in effective adsorption of vapour generated in the fuel tank. Evaporative emissions in this case may be attributed to fuel permeation and/or leakage rather than the canister. When the canister is close to saturation, breakthrough emissions dominate the total evaporative emissions. The empirical model is applied {{for the development of a}} methodology for the calculation of evaporative emissions from a fleet of vehicles. The development of emission factors for various vehicle categories taking into account a large number of activity data facilitates emissions inventorying. ...|$|R

The analysis is based on 36 scenarios, defined by varying the climate conditions, the fuel vapour pressure, the tank material, the tank headspace volume, the purging volume flow rate and the mass of the activated carbon contained in the canister. The results show that in May 4 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Modena and 6 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Firenze lead to evaporative emissions values above the current type approval limit (i. e. 2 [g/day] per vehicle).

5000|$|Carburetor units may not {{effectively}} {{deal with}} fuel vapor {{being delivered to}} the float chamber. Most designs incorporate a pressure balance duct linking {{the top of the}} float bowl with either the intake to the carburetor or the outside air. Even if the pump can handle vapor locks effectively, fuel vapor entering the float bowl has to be vented. If this is done via the intake system, the mixture is, in effect, enriched, creating a mixture control and pollution issue. If it is done by venting to the outside, the result is direct hydrocarbon pollution and an effective loss of fuel efficiency and possibly a fuel odor problem. For this reason, some fuel delivery systems allow fuel vapor to be returned to the fuel tank to be condensed back to the liquid phase, or using an active <b>carbon</b> filled <b>canister</b> where fuel vapor is absorbed.
