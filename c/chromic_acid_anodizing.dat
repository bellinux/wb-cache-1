Reports indicate that the <b>chromic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>anodize</b> was stable in solar absorptance and thermal emittance, but that contamination effects caused increases in absorptance on surfaces exposed to low atomic oxygen fluences.

40|$|<b>Chromic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>anodizing</b> is {{important}} for the corrosion protection of aerospace aluminium alloys. Previous study has demonstrated that SO 42  − impurity in the chromic acid affects the film growth on aluminium at a voltage of 100  V. The present work further investigates aluminium and extends the study to industrial anodizing conditions (Bengough-Stuart (B-S) process) and to the AA 2024 -T 3 alloy. It is shown that SO 42  − concentrations between ~  38 – 300  ppm reduce the film growth rate for aluminium anodized at 100  V in comparison with an electrolyte than contains ≤  1. 5  ppm SO 42  −, whereas ~  1500 – 3000  ppm SO 42 have an opposite effect and lead to an unstable pore diameter. Under the B-S process, the film growth depends on the substrate composition, the SO 42  − content of the film, the film morphology and, for the alloy, oxygen generation. Corrosion tests of the alloy in 3. 5 % NaCl solution revealed better protection with films formed in chromic acid containing 38  ppm SO 42  − compared with ≤  1. 5  ppm SO 42  −, which are within the specified limits for sulphate impurity for <b>chromic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>anodizing.</b> The difference in corrosion protection is proposed {{to be related to the}} observed differences in the film morphologies; it is speculated that this may influence the retention of residues of chromate ions in the films...|$|E

In this work, potentiodynamic anodizing of aluminum alloys AA 1050 and AA 2024 -T 3 clad was performed in phosphoric sulfuric acid (PSA) and sulfuric acid (SAA).

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} {{aluminium alloys}} {{are widely used}} in the civil and military aerospace industry due to their low weight and high mechanical properties, achieved by selected alloying elements and heat treatments. The resulting multiphase alloy system, a solid solution of alloying elements in the aluminium matrix {{and a variety of}} second phase material, requires specific anticorrosion measures in order to prevent localized corrosion, which is promoted by microgalvanic coupling between the different metallographic phases. Traditionally, the anticorrosion performances are achieved by <b>chromic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>anodizing</b> (CAA), followed by painting. However, environmental issues and associated costs for the disposal of chromate wastes, require the development of new approaches for anodizing of aluminium alloys. In this work, the potential for tailoring the porous anodic film morphology through the film thickness by controlled variations of the anodizing potential is inspected. The procedure developed is, in principle, applicable to any aluminium alloy in any anodizing electrolyte and results in the generation of innovative graded porous anodic film morphologies which promise improvement of anticorrosion properties and replacement of CAA...|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} six decades, <b>chromic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>anodizing</b> (CAA) has been the central process in the surface {{pre-treatment}} of aluminum for adhesively bonded aircraft structures. Unfortunately, this electrolyte contains hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), a compound known for its toxicity and carcinogenic properties. To comply with the new strict international regulations, the Cr(VI) -era will soon {{have to come to}} an end. Anodizing aluminum in acid electrolytes produces a self-ordered porous oxide layer.

The whole life cycle of the process should also be taken into account to ensure that the possible chosen solution for eliminating or lowering chromium (VI) emissions would not drastically damage the overall process performance in other environmental areas. In our study, we used a simplified life cycle assessment methodology that only took into account the key environmental issues of the considered industrial sector. Both the scope and the data needs were reduced by focusing only on significant flows and by using a generic database for steps other than the anodizing one.

In such hybrid structures, where metal and composite are closely in contact, {{the strength of the}} interface between the metal and the composite can be altered by the galvanic corrosion between the aluminium and the composite when Carbon Fibres Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) is used. This paper is related to the corrosion and mechanical properties of an Aluminium/CFRP co-cured hybrid structure.
