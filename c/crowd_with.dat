5|$|Battersea council {{agreed to}} provide space for the statue on its Latchmere Recreation Ground, part of the council's new Latchmere Estate, which offered terraced homes to rent for seven and sixpence a week. The statue was {{unveiled}} on 15 September 1906 {{in front of a}} large <b>crowd,</b> <b>with</b> speakers that included George Bernard Shaw and the Irish feminist Charlotte Despard.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting began local magistrates called on the {{military}} authorities to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him, and to disperse the crowd. Cavalry charged into the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large <b>crowd,</b> <b>with</b> Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a few people in the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915 Dyer {{was through}} with Australia, the New Zealand Truth {{reporting}} that he had left by 4 December, and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States. In January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 {{he was back in}} the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight went the distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney. After the fight Dyer entertained the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> an operatic song.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor {{was back}} full-time. West {{averaged}} 27.8points, 7.0rebounds and 5.6assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team; however, {{he played in}} only 55 regular season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 {{in front of their}} home <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.|$|E

Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford lived in Bond Street and was unhappy {{about the presence}} of the Bond Street Loungers. Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801 he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> a pistol.|$|E

Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan waved to the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E

5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him {{tips on how to}} give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E
5|$|In late May Philadelphia {{hosted the}} Middle States tournament at its Germantown Cricket Club; Cochet {{advanced}} to the semifinal where Tilden's superiority proved to be his undoing. Cochet then sailed home to France and consequently missed the US Pro Tennis Championships. He chose instead to gather money in exhibition matches in Havana, Haiti, and Martinique on his way home. In France the official tour continued in Bayonne in August, where Cochet dropped his two singles matches to Tilden and Keith Gledhill {{in front of a}} home crowd. A Marseilles team event was scheduled in September where Cochet lost to Tilden, equalized against Gledhill and lost again in the doubles with Plaa to the Americans, who took the final victory as well. Two weeks later in a single-elimination tournament at Cochet's native Lyon Football Club he almost delighted the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> home victory but Tilden stole the second and third set to spoil the feat. Cochet subsequently suffered from an illness and missed the following events. Throughout the season Cochet earned a total of $17.381.|$|E

5|$|Many fans {{hoped to}} see him play for Italy at Euro 2004, or with the 2004 Olympic squad that {{eventually}} managed a Bronze medal, {{but this was not}} to be the case. However, he was given an international send-off by Trapattoni at age 37 in a friendly match against Spain on 28 April 2004, in which he wore the number 10 shirt for the final time, as well as the captain's armband for part of the match. Although Baggio entertained the <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> his creativity and skill, he was unable to score, despite winning a free-kick from which Vieri's equalising goal arose. The match finished 1–1 and Baggio was given a standing ovation after being substituted off for Fabrizio Miccoli. This was Baggio's 56th and final match for Italy, {{and it was the first}} time an Italian footballer's career had been celebrated this way since Silvio Piola retired.|$|E
5|$|To {{the left}} of the 4th Grenadiers were the two squares of the 1st/ and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs who angled further to the west and had {{suffered}} more from artillery fire than the grenadiers. But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead. Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under Maitland who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column. The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> the chasseurs in pursuit. At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the 52nd Light Infantry, led by John Colborne, which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd. The 52nd then charged, and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.|$|E
