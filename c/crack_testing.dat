The cracks were introduced (crack history) into the specimens by three methods: (1) saw cutting; (2) fatigue precracking at a low stress range; and (3) fatigue precracking at a high stress range. For the single <b>crack</b> <b>tests,</b> the initial <b>crack</b> history influenced the stress required for the onset of stable crack growth and the first 10 mm of crack growth.

40|$|The hot {{and cold}} {{cracking}} tendencies of some early iron aluminide alloy compositions limited their use to applications where good weldability was not required. Considerable {{progress has been made}} toward improving this situation. Using hot <b>crack</b> <b>testing</b> techniques developed at ORNL and a systematic study of alloy compositional effects, we have established a range of compositions within which hot cracking resistance is very good, essentially equivalent to stainless steel. Cold cracking, however, remains an issue, and extensive efforts are continuing to optimize composition and welding parameters, especially preheat and postweld heat treatment, to minimize its occurrence. In terms of filler metal and process development, we have progressed from sheared strip through aspiration cast rod and shielded metal arc electrodes {{to the point where we}} can now produce composite wire with a steel sheath and aluminum core in coil form, which permits the use of both the gas tungsten arc and gas metal arc processes. This is a significant advancement in that the gas metal arc process lends itself well to automated welding, and is the process of choice for commercial weld overlay applications. Using the newly developed filler metals, we have prepared clad specimens for testing in a variety of environments both in-house and outside ORNL, including laboratory and commercial organizations. As a means of assessing the field performance of this new type of material, we have modified several non-pressure boundary boiler components, including fuel nozzles and port shrouds, by introducing areas of weld overlay in strategic locations, and have placed these components in service in operating boilers for a side-by-side comparison with conventional corrosion-resistant materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for the in-situ measurement and structural health {{monitoring of the}} rotating components in gas turbine engines is of major interest to NASA. As part of this on-going effort, several experiments have been undertaken to develop methods for detecting cracks and measuring strain on rotating turbine engine like disks. Previous methods investigated have included the use of blade tip clearance sensors to detect the presence of cracks by monitoring the change in measured blade tip clearance and analyzing the combined disk-rotor system's vibration response. More recently, an experiment utilizing a novel optical Moir based concept has been conducted on a subscale turbine engine disk to demonstrate a potential strain measurement and crack detection technique. Moir patterns result from the overlap of two repetitive patterns with slightly different spacing. When this technique is applied to a rotating disk, {{it has the potential}} to allow for the detection of very small changes in spacing and radial growth in a rotating disk due to a flaw such as a crack. This investigation was a continuation of previous efforts undertaken in 2011 - 2012 to validate this optical concept. The initial demonstration attempted on a subscale turbine engine disk was inconclusive due to the minimal radial growth experienced by the disk during operation. For the present experiment a new subscale Aluminum disk was fabricated and improvements were made to the experimental setup to better demonstrate the technique. A circular reference pattern was laser etched onto a subscale engine disk and the disk was operated at speeds up to 12 000 rpm as a means of optically monitoring the Moir created by the shift in patterns created by the radial growth due the presence of the simulated <b>crack.</b> <b>Testing</b> was first accomplished on a clean defect free disk as a means of acquiring baseline reference data.
