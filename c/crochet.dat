5|$|Agata Oleksiak, {{known as}} Olek (born 5 April 1978,) is a Polish-American artist who {{is based in}} New York City. Her works include sculptures, {{installations}} such as crocheted bicycles, inflatables, performance pieces, and fiber art. She has covered buildings, sculptures, people, and an apartment with <b>crochet</b> and has exhibited in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Turkey, France, Italy, Poland, and Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, <b>crochet,</b> embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
25|$|Filet <b>crochet,</b> Tunisian <b>crochet,</b> {{tapestry}} <b>crochet,</b> broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and Irish <b>crochet</b> are all {{variants of}} the basic <b>crochet</b> method.|$|E
5000|$|Originally <b>crocheted</b> lace was not {{regarded}} as true lace. <b>Crocheting</b> {{was considered an}} easy, and less time-consuming, but otherwise clearly inferior surrogate for [...] "true" [...] lace such as bobbin lace, needle lace or [...] netting. The first examples of <b>crocheted</b> lace try to reproduce the products of other lacemaking techniques as faithfully as possible. Later, the many possibilities and inherent beauty of <b>crocheted</b> lace were appreciated more.|$|R

50|$|During the 1940s, the {{rationing}} {{of textiles}} for World War II {{led to the}} manufacturing of handbags made in materials like raffia or <b>crocheted</b> from yarn. Some women <b>crocheted</b> their own small handbags from commercial patterns during this period.|$|R
25|$|<b>Crochet</b> hooks {{used for}} Tunisian <b>crochet</b> are {{elongated}} {{and have a}} stopper {{at the end of}} the handle, while double-ended <b>crochet</b> hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle. There is also a double hooked apparatus called a Cro-hook that has become popular.|$|E
25|$|While most <b>crochet</b> is {{made with}} a hook, {{there is also a}} method of {{crocheting}} with a knitting loom. This is called loomchet. Slip stitch <b>crochet</b> is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch <b>crochet</b> is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch <b>crochet</b> can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that <b>crochet</b> uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most <b>crochet,</b> the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian <b>crochet),</b> while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with <b>crochet</b> work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and <b>crochet.</b> In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas <b>crochet</b> stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|E

A tie is visible at the left; after untying, the hank may be wound {{into a ball}} or balls suitable for <b>crocheting.</b> <b>Crocheting</b> from a normal hank directly is likely to tangle the yarn, producing snarls.|$|R
25|$|Knitting can be {{accomplished}} by machine, while many <b>crochet</b> stitches can only be crafted by hand. The height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single <b>crochet</b> stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double <b>crochet</b> stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.|$|E
25|$|Steel <b>crochet</b> hooks {{range in}} size from 0.4 to 3.5 millimeters, or from 00 to 16 in American sizing. These hooks are used for fine <b>crochet</b> work such as doilies and lace.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding the {{categorical}} {{assertion of}} a purely British origin, there is solid {{evidence of a}} connection between French tambour embroidery and <b>crochet.</b> The former method of production was illustrated in detail in 1763 in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable {{from that of a}} present-day inline <b>crochet</b> hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 Penélopé instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for <b>crochet</b> and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms tambour and <b>crochet</b> as synonyms. This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} very common for people and groups to <b>crochet</b> {{clothing}} and other garments and then donate them to soldiers during war.

50|$|To {{showcase}} African {{history and}} culture, Ms. Chamblin created unique <b>crocheted</b> wall hangings, including a rendition of King Tut {{in a mixture}} of brown yarns and gold metallic yarn, a door size hanging of Queen Nefertiti's bust, the Egyptian Pyramids at Giza, African adinkra symbols and other African centered items including beaded wooden jewelry and <b>crocheted</b> pendants. These afrocentric creations were featured in a monthlong exhibit in the main showcase windows at the Wyandanch Public Library, Long Island, New York in 1992. Ms. Chamblin's first published works (swan and robin <b>crocheted</b> wall hangings) appeared in Family Circle Fashions and Crafts magazine in 1986.|$|R

25|$|The strong Victorian colours disappeared, though, and new {{publications}} {{called for}} white or pale threads, except for fancy purses, which were often crocheted of brightly colored silk and elaborately beaded. After World War I, far fewer <b>crochet</b> patterns were published, {{and most of}} them were simplified versions of the early 20th-century patterns. After World War II, from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the United States, with many new and imaginative <b>crochet</b> designs published for colorful doilies, potholders, and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications. These patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included wonderful variegated colors. The craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on <b>crochet</b> and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.|$|E
