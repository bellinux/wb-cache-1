50|$|Cogs were a type {{of round}} ship, {{characterized}} by a flush-laid flat bottom at midships but gradually shifted to overlapped strakes near the posts. They had full lapstrake planking covering the sides, generally starting from the bilge strakes, and double-clenched iron nails for plank fastenings. The keel, or keelplank, was only slightly thicker than the adjacent garboards and had no rabbet. Both stem and stern posts were straight and rather long, and connected to the keelplank through intermediate pieces called hooks. The lower plank hoods terminated in rabbets in the hooks and posts, but upper hoods were nailed to the exterior faces of the posts. Caulking was generally tarred moss that was inserted into <b>curved</b> <b>grooves,</b> covered with wooden laths, and secured by metal staples called sintels. Finally, the cog-built structure could not be completed without a stern-mounted hanging central rudder, which was a unique northern development. Cogs used to have open hulls and could be rowed short distances. In the 13th century they received decks.|$|E

Two glacial samples and six glaciofluvial samples were taken near the glacier Bertilbreen and one glacial sample and seven glaciofluvial samples were taken near the glacier Hørbyebreen.

40|$|In {{forensic}} science, {{evaluation of}} marks plays {{an essential part}} in proving connections between different offences. Striation marks, caused by a grinding or dragging motion of a tool, form an important class of marks. The forensically relevant striation marks on firearm bullets belong to this category as well as numerous kinds of tool marks, which can be caused e. g. by screwdrivers, knives, or pliers. The subject of this dissertation is the computerized evaluation of such tool marks by applying methods of automated visual inspection. The methodology described opens characteristic individual marks to computerized processing and hence paves the way for automated comparison of marks. In this context, specific properties of tool marks are taken into consideration: In contrast to marks on bullets, <b>curved</b> <b>grooves</b> are frequently found that require a groove straightening {{on the basis of}} adequate signal models. Moreover, many tool marks show gaps in their groove structure thus demanding reliable segmentation of the groove area. Finally, the mostly uncertain orientation of the marks requires an extension of usual comparison algorithms. Using these evaluation strategies, an automated comparison method for tool marks on the basis of correlation techniques has been realized. Experimental results substantiate the performance and the suitability for practical application of the developed identification system...|$|E

40|$|The {{roundness}} {{and surface}} texture of quartz grains were studied in Devonian sediments of 32 drill cores. Roundness was estimated {{in more than}} 800 samples and surface textures were examined under scanning electron microscope on 70 grains. The grains were mostly subrounded to subangular. The concentration of rounded grains in some beds of the Pärnu Formation (Fm.), the basal beds of the Leivu Fm., and {{the upper part of}} the investigated sequence indicates zones of sediment recycling and reworking. Based on the distribution of roundness degrees of quartz grains, some possible ancient coastlines in Pärnu time were defined. Variations in quartz surface textures were detected at different stratigraphical levels, whereas the texture created by mechanical processes was predominating. Abundant abrasion features like V-shaped pits, and linear and <b>curved</b> <b>grooves</b> usually give evidence of transport in a fluvial medium.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of evidence, drawn from ancient human remains and from ethnographic accounts, greatly changed our views on past and “traditional” medicine. Surgical {{treatment}} of the skull, requiring intimate anatomical knowledge and high skills, has been very influential in that process. Forms of trephination, carried out in order to remove part of the injured skull, are documented since the Neolithic through historical times and in recent ethnographic reports. The case presented here provides evidence of a less invasive technique applied to the skull of an adult individual found during archeological excavations in a cave deposit (Garbu du Surdu, Finale Ligure, Savona, Italy). A 14 C AMS date obtained from a fragment of the mandible (Erl- 13879 : 4624 +/- 21 BP) points to a calibrated age range between 3527 - 3328 BC, placing the material {{at the beginning of}} the Copper Age, in agreement with associated archaeological remains that include decorated pottery fragments and shell ornaments. The skull was lying on the surface deposit among other bones belonging to at least six individuals whose inhumations were strongly disturbed by natural events. The commingled state of the material made it impossible to associate any of the postcranial bones to this specific skull. Thus, in the absence of hip bones, sex attribution remains uncertain, although a diagnosis of female is suggested by cranial characteristics such as frontal and parietal bossing, weak glabella and supraorbital ridges, and small mastoid processes. The skull is affected by a left temporal bone fracture healed with loss of bony fragments. The squama appears slightly depressed and, radiographically, shows two main lines of fusion radiating from the lower part of the bone where three lacunae can be observed. On the parietal bone, immediately above the area affected by trauma, the skull exhibits two regularly <b>curved</b> <b>grooves.</b> One, about 3 cm long, starts from the posterior border of the squamosal suture; the other, 9 cm long, runs above the first and reaches the coronal suture. Remodelling of compacta indicates that the two incisions were made during life.

40|$|Despite of the {{extensive}} research around spark erosion of ceramics over the last 3 decades, the particular investigation on micro-EDM capabilities in ceramic machining is in the early stage and requires further study [1]. In this work, the micromachining performance of various ceramics, with mechanical properties ranging from high toughness and strength to exceptional hardness and wear resistance, are examined. They include two commercially available materials, a ZrO 2 -TiN ceramic composite and a TiB 2 grade, and an Al 3 O 2 -TiCN lab-scale composite. Experiments were conducted on a SARIX SX- 100 -HPM micro EDM-milling centre in hydrocarbon oil and de-ionized water. WC and brass cylindrical rods, 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm in diameter, respectively, were used as the tool electrodes. Negative tool polarity was applied through all experiments. Design of Experiments (DoE) methodologies were employed to systematically investigate {{the influence of the}} machine parameters on the volumetric material removal rate (MRR), relative tool wear (TWR) and surface quality (roughness of the primary profile, Pa). Accordingly, suitable process parameters for the efficient micromachining of the materials at low and medium/high energy conditions could be identified. Similar variation trends to the machining of steel were generally observed; the increasing of the pulse energy leads to higher machining rate, but also to worse surface finishing. The ZrO 2 -TiN and Al 3 O 2 -TiCN composites in oil dielectric provided the most efficient results; the MRR increased up to 0. 3 mm 3 /min {{in the case of the}} zirconia composite at high discharge conditions, the TWR remained below 10 % in both cases, and surface roughness less than 0. 2 m could be achieved by gradually reducing the pulse energy. On the contrary, the TiB 2 shows the worst machining performance with TWR peak of 70 % in oil dielectric and machining rate down to 0. 1 mm 3 /min. Surface roughness less than 0. 35 m were easily achievable on all three materials. As generally comparison against to the processing of Si 3 N 4 –TiN ceramic composite, machining efficiency and tool performance are lower, while the surface quality improves to a large extent [2]. The surface topography and cross section of the EDM samples were inspected with the aid of a SEM; additionally, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (X-ray EDS) was performed to characterise the chemical composition of the specimens. Melting and evaporation are recognized as the prevailing material removal mechanisms during machining of Zr 2 O 2 -TiN and Al 3 O 2 -TICN ceramic composites; the recast layers are characterized by the formation of regular craters of increasing diameter with the rising of the pulse energy and within the range of ~ 7 - 50 m (Fig. 1). The presence of cracks was also observed, especially in the alumina composite due to the lowest toughness and strength; the cracks propagate parallel to the surface leading to the detachment of large flakes, even at low energy conditions (Fig. 2). With the variation of the type of dielectric and discharge conditions, different material removal mechanisms, including oxidation, melting and spalling, were observed during machining of TiB 2 samples. Oxidation specifically occurs during the process in de-ionized water at short discharge duration; the formation of TiO 2 and B 2 O 3, which evaporates above 1200 °C, give as result an oxygen-rich, and boron-poor, spongy like structure, weekly attached to the bulk. The damage induced is severe and the generation of cracks deeply propagating vertically into the bulk is observed. On the contrary, melting and spalling become predominant during the process in water as the pulse duration and energy increase [3]. Droplets of molten material are visible on the EDM layer; additionally, pieces of material break off from the surface leading to the exposure of the underlying grains (Fig. 3). No material removal mechanisms different from melting and spalling were observed during machining of TiB 2 in oil dielectric. As proof of the strategies developed, various demonstrators were fabricated. As an example, a 6 mm Ø aerodynamic thrust bearing surface was realized in ZrO 2 -TiN (Fig. 4). The component has a 2 D 1 / 2 structure of geometry similar to a compressor; the <b>curved</b> <b>grooves</b> are 15 m deep and 200 m wide at the rounded tip. A layer by layer approach with a depth of cut of 0. 5 m was employed as milling strategy; the component fabrication took approximately 40 minutes. The geometries of all the grooves show very good consistency and geometric accuracy within +/- 2 m. The component is illustrative of the potential applications that can be developed, such as wear resistance moulds and micro machinery components. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{operational}} efficiency of robot-based shoe manufacturing, a method of shoe-groove tracking based on industrial robot {{is presented in the}} article. First, side surface of a shoe upper with a sole is scanned with a laser scanning device. The presented approach mainly consists of two steps: reconstruction of three-dimensional point cloud and feature curve extraction. It is difficult to extract the closed <b>groove</b> <b>curve</b> on shoe surface. We propose an innovative method to simplify the feature extraction through projecting geometric information from three dimension to two dimension, which is convenient to identify longest groove feature line in two-dimensional space. After detecting the two-dimensional groove line, we back project it to three-dimensional space to identify the three-dimensional thick groove point set. Finally, we thin and fit the <b>groove</b> <b>curve</b> into a trackable sequential curve. The experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively detect the shoe groove and generate trackable sequential curve. We also simulate the robot tracking process in a virtual environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method...|$|R
