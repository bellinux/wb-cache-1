50|$|Allium canadense has an edible bulb {{covered with}} a dense skin of brown fibers and tastes like an onion. The plant also has strong, onion-like, odor. <b>Crow</b> <b>garlic</b> (Allium vineale) is similar, {{but it has a}} strong garlic taste.|$|R
50|$|Allium vineale (wild <b>garlic,</b> onion grass, <b>crow</b> <b>garlic</b> or stag's garlic) is a perennial, bulb-forming {{species of}} wild onion, native to Europe, northwestern Africa and the Middle East. The species was {{introduced}} in Australia and North America, where {{it has become a}} noxious weed.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{they seek}} plants by scent. Any “weed” {{that has a}} scent reduces the odds of them finding crop plants. Examples are <b>Crow</b> <b>Garlic</b> (wild chives) and Ground Ivy (a form of wild mint), both {{dramatically}} masking both plant scent and insect pheromones. They cut down Japanese beetle infestation, and caterpillar infestation, for example cabbage worm, tomato hornworm, and even squash bugs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crow</b> <b>garlic,</b> {{the wild}} chives found in sunny {{parts of a}} North American yard, has all of the {{companion}} plant benefits of other alliums, including repelling japanese beetles, aphids, and rodents, and being believed to benefit the flavor of solanums like tomatoes and peppers. It {{can be used as}} a substitute for garlic in cooking, though it may lend a bitter aftertaste.|$|R
50|$|Allium ursinum is a bulbous, {{perennial}} herbaceous monocot, that reproduces {{primarily by}} seed. The narrow bulbs are formed {{from a single}} leaf base and produce bright green entire, elliptical leaves up to 25 cm long x 7 cm wide with a petiole up to 20 cm long. The inflorescence is an umbel of six to 20 white flowers only, lacking the bulbils produced by some other Allium species such as Allium vineale (<b>crow</b> <b>garlic)</b> and Allium oleraceum (field garlic). The flowers are star-like with six white tepals, about 16-20 mm in diameter, with stamens shorter than the perianth.|$|R
60|$|The {{flowers are}} quite {{different}} from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills. The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of every shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. Orchis latifolia is in plenty, and also Orchis incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey orchis. Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, Orchis conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact Orchis pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and <b>crow</b> <b>garlic,</b> in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Intoxications with {{colchicine}} usually occur by {{ingestion of}} meadow saffron leaves (Colchicum autumnale) which are mistakenly collected for alimentary purposes {{instead of the}} leaves of <b>crow</b> <b>garlic</b> (Allium ursinum). Colchicine, the main alkaloid of Colchicum autumnale, is present {{in all parts of}} the plant. We report a rarer source of mistake, i. e. between the flowers of Colchicum autumnale and Crocus sativus. The similarity in this case is limited to the appearance of the flowers, but Colchicum autumnale, which is also flowering in autumn, lacks the crimson stigma from which the saffron spice is derived from Crocus sativus. Case report: A 47 -year-old woman collected the stamens of a flower resembling Crocus sativus for use as saffron. Her knowledge about Crocus sativus was limited to having seen this plant previously at a museum of saffron (Mund, Switzerland). She prepared a meal with rice using three pinches of ''saffron'' for ten tablespoons of rice. She and her 8 -year-old child, both ate the usual amount of rice (6 and 2 tablespoons, respectively). The 2 brothers (4 - and 9 -years-old) only ate 3 teaspoons of rice each. A slightly bitter taste and the absence of a yellow colouration were peculiar. Three to four hours after the meal, the mother developed nausea and contacted the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre, suspecting a plant misidentification. All family members were referred to the regional university hospital for administration of oral activated charcoal. No other symptoms were reported, notably no symptoms in the 8 -year-old boy and his brothers. Colchicine serum concentration (blood sample obtained 15 hours after ingestion) measured by HPLC-mass spectrometry was 0. 36 mg/L for the mother, and 0. 13 mg/L for the 8 -year-old child, respectively (therapeutic levels: 0. 30 - 2. 5 mg/L). Conclusion: This report demonstrates that a significant amount of colchicine may be absorbed even after ingestion of very small quantities of Colchicum autumnale, which in this case was confused with Crocus sativus. Serum colchicine concentrations in the sub-/therapeutic range can be quantified by HPLC-mass spectrometry, which allows a very sensitive and specific detection of this alkaloid in blood and urine...|$|R
