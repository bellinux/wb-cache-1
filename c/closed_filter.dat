During the Second World War, the Operations Centre of No. 9 Group RAF was housed there in three buildings (Operations Room, Filter Room and Communications Centre), which were partially buried for protection, {{in a similar way}} to buildings for No. 10 Group RAF at RAF Box, No. 11 Group RAF at RAF Uxbridge, No. 12 Group RAF at RAF Watnall, No. 13 Group RAF at RAF Newcastle and No. 14 Group RAF at Raigmore House in Inverness. Operations room (...) The operations room, responsible for directing RAF aircraft in the No. 9 Group area, was located in a bunker on Langley Lane, Goosnargh, 1 mile (2 km) east of Barton Hall. After the war the Royal Observer Corps 21 Group Headquarters and the Western Sector Control of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation took over the bunker. In the bunker was the standby national control of the famous Four-minute warning air raid warning system for the UK. The ROC and UKWMO were disbanded between 1991 and 1995 and the bunker was <b>closed.</b> <b>Filter</b> room (...) The Filter room, responsible for filtering large quantities of intelligence on enemy activity before it was passed to the operations room, was located in a bunker {{on the south side of}} Whittingham Lane, a little further east. The Filter room contained a map table showing the British coast from north Wales through western Scotland. One of the WAAF officers in the Barton Hall Filter Room, Eileen Younghusband recorded her experiences there in [...] "One Woman's War." [...] Communications room (...) The communications room, responsible for accommodating all the communications equipment, was located on Brass Pan Lane, north of Broughton. The communications bunker is currently used to store farm machinery. After the war, Barton Hall itself was the site of the Preston Air Traffic Control Centre which provided the Area Control service between N52.30 and N55.00, with London ATCC (at Heathrow and later West Drayton) to the South and Scottish ATCC (at Prestwick) to the North. The unit closed in 1975, its task having been absorbed by London ATCC and Manchester Sub-centre situated at Manchester Airport.|$|E

We {{prove that}} if J is a maximal <b>closed</b> <b>filter</b> on a space X then IJI = o(X) (= {{the number of}} closed subsets of X), and there exists a space X and a prime <b>closed</b> <b>filter</b> J on X with IJI < o(X).

In this paper we answer the ques tion: If ~ is one of the three properties of Arhangel'skii, then is every countably compact space having property ~r compact? The answer is "yes " for ~ = ultrapure, and is independent of and consistent with ZFC for ~ = astral or pure. 334 Vaughan 1...|$|E

Workers may {{come in contact with}} irritant substances and also with chemically reactive intermediates or drugs that may be potential sensitizers. The skin lesions can be located at the site of contact, usually the hands, although airborne reactions on exposed and even nonexposed areas (eg, by particles trapped under clothing) are not uncommon. Generalized reactions may occur due to inhalation or transcutaneous absorption. An accidental exposure to a highly allergenic compound may cause a chemical burn, followed by primary sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis. The pharmaceutical contact allergens belong to many different pharmacologic classes. If several cases of contact dermatitis occur in multiple individuals in the same company, then the working conditions are implicated and should be changed to prevent their recurrence.

40|$|Aims: We {{present a}} study of the diffuse X-ray {{emission}} in the halo and the disc of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. Methods: After removing point-like sources, we analysed XMM-Newton images, hardness ratio maps and spectra from several regions in the halo and the disc. We introduce a method to produce vignetting corrected images from the EPIC pn data, and we developed a procedure that allows a correct background treatment for low surface brightness spectra, using a local background, together with <b>closed</b> <b>filter</b> observations. Results: Most of the emission from the halo is at energies below 1 keV. In the disc, also emission at higher energies is present. The extent of the diffuse emission along the major axis of the disc is 13. 6 kpc. The halo resembles a horn structure and reaches out to ~ 9 kpc perpendicular to the disc. Disc regions that cover star forming regions, like spiral arms, show harder spectra than regions with lower star forming activity. Models for spectral fits of the disc regions need at least three components: two thermal plasmas with solar abundances plus a power law and galactic foreground absorption. Temperatures are between 0. 1 and 0. 3 keV and between 0. 3 and 0. 9 keV for the soft and the hard component, respectively. The power law component may indicate an unresolved contribution from X-ray binaries in the disc. The halo emission is not uniform, neither spatially nor spectrally. The southeastern halo is softer than the northwestern halo. To model the spectra in the halo, we needed two thermal plasmas with solar abundances plus galactic foreground absorption. Temperatures are around 0. 1 and 0. 3 keV. A comparison between X-ray and UV emission shows that both originate from the same regions.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the mean-line based evaluation system, motif analysis and morphological filters are two techniques oriented to the characterization of functional properties of surfaces.

By linking the functionality of the structuring elements with motif combination criterions, morphological envelopes are computed efficiently.

The proposed morphological method has a sound mathematical basis and is stable. An example of applying the empirical motif method (ISO 12085) and the morphological method is demonstrated. The motif parameters resulted from two methods reveal that they coincide with each other.

40|$|Granular {{filters are}} used for {{protection}} against scour and erosion. For a proper functioning {{it is necessary that}} interfaces between the filter structure, the subsoil and the water flowing above the filter structure are stable. Stability means that there is no transport of subsoil material through the filter to the water above the filter, and that no filter material is removed by currents above the filter. Three types of granular filters can be distinguished; 1) Geometrically <b>closed</b> <b>filter</b> structures, 2) Stable geometrically open filter structures, 3) Unstable geometrically open filter structures. This research is focusing on stable geometrically open filter structures. Recently, a desk study has been carried out by Deltares resulting in a new theoretical formula for single layered geometrically open filter structures (CUR, 2010). Hoffmans improved the theoretical formula that had been founded by Deltares (Hoffmans G., 2012) The goal of this research was to verify the formula found by Hoffmans [2012] for structures loaded by currents (flow parallel to the filter construction). As part of the verification of the design formula ten flume experiments were performed in the Environmental Fluid Mechanic Laboratory at Delft University of Technology. After the execution of the model tests an extensive analysis was made based on the performed model tests and model tests performed in the past (Bakker [1960], Haverhoek [1968], Wouters [1982], Konter et al. [1990], Van Huijstee and Verheij [1991] and Van Velzen [2012]). The analysis showed that the formula is valid for single layered geometrically open filter structures loaded by currents. Two adjustments to the design formula are proposed: 1. The relative layer thickness fits better when related to the nominal diameter of the filter material; 2. The alpha value proposed by Hoffmans [2012] is too high (new alpha values are 30 % to 60 % lower). The original formula as proposed by Hoffmans [2012] gives unrealistic values for situations with wide graded filter material. Model tests showed that the relative layer thickness is better represented when related to the nominal diameter of the filter material. The design formula can be used for design purposes. The design of a single layered geometrically open filter structure can be schematized in two steps; 1. Firstly, determination of the material that should be used for the top-layer; 2. Secondly, determination of the layer-thickness of the filter/top-layer taking into account filter and base material characteristics. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Scour {{formation}} at {{the toe of}} a {{rubble mound}} breakwater can lead to abrupt failure. Nowadays, counteraction of scour via geometrically <b>closed</b> <b>filter</b> rules, geotextiles or combinations is the common practice. Alternatively, in specific cases the use of geometrically open filters can save {{significant amount of time}} and decrease constructional costs. As a primary step towards this direction, the prediction of scour formation through a geometrically open filter can provide important information. Nevertheless, at this moment the knowledge upon this issue is insufficient and limited. A variety of recommendations occurs in literature, separately for toe design/scour protection and for the application of open filter criteria; however none of the studies treats these subjects combined. Therefore the objective of the present thesis is to get insight into scour formation and development through a breakwater toe lying upon sand and designed as a geometrically open filter. Thereby the research aims in drawing the link between scour characteristics with wave loading and filter configuration properties. In order to accomplish the research objective 2 D physical model tests were conducted in the 25 m long, 1 m deep and 0. 6 m wide wave flume of DMC, installed in the company’s laboratory. In total, 23 tests were executed with irregular waves (Jonswap spectrum) and by varying wave loading and filter configuration properties. In particular, 5 different filter/base layer combinations were examined and 3 different wave conditions were used to investigate the effects of relative grain diameter, relative filter thickness, grading of filter layer, base layer stability Number and storm duration. Quantification of damage magnitude was accomplished via laser profile measurements of filter and base layer prior and after the execution of each test. Furthermore, wave particle velocity climate was determined via the use of an Electromagnetic Flow Meter (EMS) placed {{at the center of the}} toe. Finally, temporal evolution scour was captured through the side glass and was examined by digitizing and analyzing snap-shots from predefined time steps. Test results and observations have revealed the highly spatial character of scour formation. Nevertheless, tests with identical boundary conditions showed a surprising convergence in averaged maximum scour depth magnitude. In addition, in the majority of tests an S-curve erosion/deposition pattern was shaped while erosion started immediately at the downstream side of the box threatening breakwater stability. Equilibrium maximum scour depth was reached for less than half the data set; thus erosion process was still in progress. Based on this, two approaches were developed to investigate temporal evolution of scour. Furthermore, dimensional analysis and literature review have revealed the most important parameters that have significant effect in scour formation; their combination has led to the formation of a prediction tool. However, combination of the results from tests with different base materials would not be possible without the introduction of the base material stability Number (critical Shields’ Number). The derived tool is an empirical expression with limited physical background and range of validity. Additionally, it overestimates maximum scour depth due to a serious model effect; the different buoyancy between filter and base layer that was causing initial damage and damage exaggeration. Nevertheless, it is capable of delineating the relative contribution of each parameter in scour depth formation. For an overall view of scour formation, further research will be needed to provide a more accurate quantification of the interrelation between parameters that play a role in scour formation and development, and to implement the effect of missing parameters. Consequently the use of the derived expression as a scour prediction tool in real life is not yet recommended. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
