In this part of the research are presented the results obtained in the Czech Republic: the volume and intensity of physical aktivity. Purpose: The aim of the research is comparison {{of the physical}} activity in the daily program between youth basketball players and regular adolescents in the <b>Czech</b> <b>republic.</b> The project " Health, Fitness and education in Visegrad Countries and neighboring Countries " is focused on mapping and comparison of selected aspects of lifestyle and somatic characteristics of adolescents from Visegrad and other European countries (Poland, <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic,</b> Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine). Methods: The <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> participated in the project with 227 probands (144 boys, 83 girls), basketball players were 137 (93 boys, 44 girls) and 90 pupils from high-schools in the <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> (51 boys, 39 girls). There was „Mezinárodní dotazník pohybové aktivity“ (IPAQ – International Physical Activity Questionnaire, short version) used to collect datas about physical activities. Results: There were not found significant differences between sexes in the number of days spent with physical activities. There were also not found significant differences between sexes in the level of physical activity per day.

As economic conditions in the CZ are different from the traditional developed economies, the AIC might not necessarily exhibit the same characteristics. Thus, the paper tries to identify potential differences on two concrete cases of two schools (faculties) at two Czech universities. The research is based on interviews with companies and stakeholders from the participating faculties. In comparison with the findings known from the literature on this issue in developed countries, the interviews revealed some differences such as a more positive attitude toward engagement of academicians in private companies and further education at universities.

Experts recommend that political support should prioritise national market development programmes for organic food (above all regional producer initiatives, vertical networks, establishment of a national organic logo). With regard to marketing measures, market development can be fostered by expanding the available range of domestic processed and convenience food, changing the price image and improving communication strategies that focus on health and quality aspects.

The microparticle systems were used as delivery systems for immobilisation of model antibacterial agent–nisin. The effect of cross-linking and the initial amount of nisin on their morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, BET analysis, zeta potential measurement and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. Encapsulation efficiency and release profile of nisin from the microparticles were studied by high performance liquid chromatography. Antibacterial activity of the prepared systems was tested by dilution and spread plate technique. Results showed the microparticles in the size range of 9 – 16 μm in diameter with spherical multi-hollow core–shell structure. The presence of cross-linking agent GA influences the release profile of the peptide and has synergistic effect on Listeria monocytogenes growth reduction. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} (IP), {{is mostly}} {{associated with being}} immaterial. The term "property right" refers to a right or a set of rights one can enforce by means of benefits or use over a resource. Those rights may be transferable and may be treated as property or resources themselves. As from a historical point of view, different IP components developed independently on each other, this paper examines patents, utility models, registered designs, trademarks, and copyright individually. In order to answer the first research question "What means of protection are best suited for medical breakthroughs?", it adds a Supplementary Medical Certificate {{to a list of}} possible IPP tools. Even though this mean of protection is not recognized worldwide, it extends the regular protection period of a patent, and thus is commonly used. There are limitations to medical related IP protection as well, e. g. compulsory licensing which occurs when a government allows someone to produce a patented medication without the consent of the patent owner. IPP is also used to secure access to innovative and expensive medications in third world countries by tier pricing or licensing. The second research question "Under what circumstances is applying for a medical related trademark cost beneficial?" is answered through a case study. Its main goal is to extend on the theoretical part, and apply for a trademark with the Intellectual Property Office in <b>Czech</b> <b>Republic</b> (IPO <b>CZ).</b> In addition, the entire application process is thoroughly described and can serve as guideline for future applicants, not only with the IPO CZ as the application process with any national IP office is rather similar.
