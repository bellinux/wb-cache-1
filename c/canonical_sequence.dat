40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mitochondrial genome of eight ori-zero spontaneous petite mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The tandem repeat units of these genomes do not contain any of the seven <b>canonical</b> ori <b>sequences</b> of the wild-type genome. Instead, they contain one, or more, ori-S sequences. These 44 -nucleotide long surrogate origins of replication are a subset of GC clusters characterized by a potential secondary fold with two sequences ATAG and GGAG, inserted in AT spacers, two AT base pairs just following them, a GC stem (broken in the middle, and, in most cases also near the base, by non-paired nucleotides), and a terminal loop. This structure is reminiscent of that of GC clusters A and B from <b>canonical</b> ori <b>sequences</b> and supports the view (Bernardi, 1982 a) that the GC clusters of the mitochondrial genome arose, by an expansion process, from the <b>canonical</b> ori <b>sequences.</b> Like the latter, ori-S sequences are present in both orientations, are located in intergenic regions, {{and can be used}} as excision sequences when tandemly oriented. Again {{as in the case of}} <b>canonical</b> ori <b>sequences,</b> the density of ori-S sequences on the repeat units of petite genomes are correlated with the replication efficiency of the latter, as assessed by the outcome of crosses with wild-type or petite tester strains...|$|R

40|$|This work {{discusses}} bioinformatics {{and experimental}} approaches {{to explore the}} human proteome, a constellation of proteins expressed in different tissues and organs. As the human proteome is not a static entity, it seems necessary to estimate the number of different protein species (proteoforms) and measure the number of copies of the same protein in a specific tissue. Here, meta-analysis of neXtProt knowledge base is proposed for theoretical prediction {{of the number of}} different proteoforms that arise from alternative splicing (AS), single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Three possible cases are considered: (1) PTMs and SAPs appear exclusively in the <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> of proteins, but not in splice variants; (2) PTMs and SAPs can occur in both proteins encoded by <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> and in splice variants; (3) all modification types (AS, SAP, and PTM) occur as independent events. Experimental validation of proteoforms is limited by the analytical sensitivity of proteomic technology. A bell-shaped distribution histogram was generated for proteins encoded by a single chromosome, with the estimation of copy numbers in plasma, liver, and HepG 2 cell line. The proposed metabioinformatics approaches can be used for estimation of the number of different proteoforms for any group of protein-coding genes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Flaviviruses {{include the}} mosquito-borne dengue, Japanese {{encephalitis}}, yellow fever and West Nile and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses. They {{are responsible for}} considerable world-wide morbidity and mortality. Viral entry is mediated by a conserved fusion peptide containing 16 amino acids located in domain II of the envelope protein E. Highly orchestrated conformational changes initiated by exposure to acidic pH accompany the fusion process and are important factors limiting amino acid changes in the fusion peptide that still permit fusion with host cell membranes in both arthropod and vertebrate hosts. The cell-fusing related agents, growing only in mosquitoes or insect cell lines, possess a different homologous peptide. Results Analysis of 46 named flaviviruses deposited in the Entrez Nucleotides database extended the constancy in the <b>canonical</b> fusion peptide <b>sequences</b> of mosquito-borne, tick-borne and viruses with no known vector to include more recently-sequenced viruses. The mosquito-borne signature amino acid, G 104, was also found in flaviviruses with no known vector and with the cell-fusion related viruses. Despite the constancy in the <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> in pathogenic flaviviruses, mutations were surprisingly frequent with a 27 % prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations in yellow fever virus fusion peptide sequences, and 0 to 7. 4 % prevalence in the others. Six of seven yellow fever patients whose virus had fusion peptide mutations died. In the cell-fusing related agents, not enough sequences have been deposited to estimate reliably the prevalence of fusion peptide mutations. However, the <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> homologous to the fusion peptide and the pattern of disulfide linkages in protein E differed significantly from the other flaviviruses. Conclusion The constancy of the <b>canonical</b> fusion peptide <b>sequences</b> in the arthropod-borne flaviviruses contrasts with the high prevalence of mutations in most individual viruses. The discrepancy {{may be the result}} of a survival advantage accompanying sequence diversity (quasispecies) involving the fusion peptide. Limited clinical data with yellow fever virus suggest that the presence of fusion peptide mutants is not associated with a decreased case fatality rate. The cell-fusing related agents may have substantial differences from other flaviviruses in their mechanism of viral entry into the host cell. </p...|$|R

40|$|The workpractices {{associated}} with the use of an information system can be described using semiotic theories in terms of patterns of human communication. A model of workpractices has been created called the systemic semiotic workpractice framework that employs two compatible but distinct semiotic theories in order to explain the complexity of information systems use in organisational contexts. One of these theories called social semiotics can be used to describe atypical workpractice realisations, where a user renegotiates one or more <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> of activities typically {{associated with}} a specific system feature.

40|$|In eukaryotes, {{targeting}} the small ribosomal subunit to the mRNA transcript requires a Kozak sequence at the translation initiation site. Despite the critical {{importance of the}} Kozak sequence to regulation of gene expression, {{there have been no}} correlation studies between its natural variance and efficiency of translation. Combining bioinformatics analysis with molecular biology techniques, and using zebrafish as a test case, we identify Kozak sequences based on their natural variance and characterize their function in vivo. Our data reveal that while the <b>canonical</b> Kozak <b>sequence</b> is efficient, in zebrafish it is neither the most common nor the most efficient translation initiation sequence. Rather, the most frequent natural variation of the Kozak sequence is almost twice as efficient.

40|$|A classic {{feature of}} antigen {{presentation}} for CD 8 ⁺ T cell recognition is that MHC class I molecules generally present peptides of 8 - 10 amino acids in length. However, {{recent studies have}} demonstrated that peptides of > 10 residues {{play a significant role in}} immune surveillance by T cells restricted by some HLA class I alleles. In the present study, we describe several examples of unusually long viral peptides of 11 or 12 residues, recognized by CTLs in the context of HLA-B 35. Interestingly, all these immunogenic peptides completely encompass shorter <b>canonical</b> length <b>sequences</b> that conform to the HLA-B 35 binding motif, but which fail to stimulate detectable T cell responses. The mechanism for this phenomenon appears to involve the preferential binding to HLA-B 35 of the atypically long CD 8 ⁺ T cell target peptides over the overlapping <b>canonical</b> length <b>sequences.</b> These data suggest that the peptide length specificity of some HLA class I alleles is broad, allowing peptides of > 10 residues to sometimes dominate over canonical length class I ligands as targets for T cell recognition...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorylation often regulates protein–protein {{interactions}} {{to control}} biological reactions. The Sld 2 and Dpb 11 proteins of budding yeast form a phosphorylation-dependent complex {{that is essential}} for chromosomal DNA replication. The Sld 2 protein has a cluster of 11 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation motifs (Ser/Thr–Pro), six of which match the <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> Ser/Thr–Pro–X–Lys/Arg, Lys/Arg–Ser/Thr–Pro and Ser/Thr–Pro–Lys/Arg. Simultaneous alanine substitution for serine or threonine in all the canonical CDK-phosphorylation motifs severely reduces complex formation between Sld 2 and Dpb 11, and inhibits DNA replication. Here we show that phosphorylation of these canonical motifs does not play a direct role in complex formation, but rather regulates phosphorylation of another residue, Thr 84. This constitutes a non-canonical CDK-phosphorylation motif within a 28 -amino-acid sequence that is responsible, after phosphorylation, for binding of Sld 2 –Dpb 11. We further suggest that CDK-catalysed phosphorylation of sites other than Thr 84 renders Thr 84 accessible to CDK. Finally, we argue that this novel mechanism sets a threshold of CDK activity for formation of the essential Sld 2 to Dpb 11 complex and therefore prevents premature DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|Auditory {{distraction}} {{of random}} generation – a quintessentially executive control task – was explored in three experiments. Random number generation was impaired by {{the mere presence of}} irrelevant auditory sequences that comprise digits, but not letters, {{and then only}} if the digits were heard in a canonical order (1, 2, 3 … or 3, 2, 1 …), not in random order (Experiments 1 and 2). Random letter generation was impaired by irrelevant letters heard in alphabetical order (a, b, c …) and reversed alphabetical order (i, h, g …), but not by numbers in canonical order or letters in random order (Experiment 3). Attempting to ignore <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> – with items that are members of the same category as the to-be-generated items – reduced the randomness of the generated sequence, by decreasing the tendency to change the direction of the produced sequence for random number generation, and by increasing resampling of responses for random letter generation.

40|$|RegIII {{proteins}} are secreted C-type lectins {{that kill}} Gram-positive bacteria {{and play a}} vital role in antimicrobial protection of the mammalian gut. RegIII proteins bind their bacterial targets via interactions with cell wall peptidoglycan but lack the <b>canonical</b> <b>sequences</b> that support calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding in other C-type lectins. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to determine the molecular basis for peptidoglycan recognition by HIP/PAP, a human RegIII lectin. We show that HIP/PAP recognizes the peptidoglycan carbohydrate backbone in a calcium-independent manner via a conserved “EPN” motif that is critical for bacterial killing. While EPN sequences govern calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition in other C-type lectins, the unusual location and calcium-independent functionality of the HIP/PAP EPN motif suggest that this sequence is a versatile functional module that can support both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent carbohydrate binding. Further, we show HIP/PAP binding affinity for carbohydrate ligands depends on carbohydrate chain length, supporting a binding model in which HIP/PAP molecules “bind and jump” along the extended polysaccharide chains of peptidoglycan, reducing dissociation rates and increasing binding affinity. We propose that dynamic recognition of highly clustered carbohydrate epitopes in native peptidoglycan is an essential mechanism governing high-affinity interactions between HIP/PAP and the bacterial cell wall...|$|R
