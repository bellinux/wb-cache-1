5|$|At the Diet of March 1467, two {{traditional}} {{taxes were}} renamed; the chamber's profit was thereafter collected as tax {{of the royal}} treasury and the thirtieth as the Crown's customs. Because of this <b>change,</b> <b>all</b> previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues. Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues. He entrusted {{the administration of the}} Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant. Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines.|$|E

25|$|How did a {{man named}} Siddhartha become an Enlightened One? By realizing the truth of life and {{cultivating}} himself in the human world, he understood the Principle of Karma. All existence and phenomena arise because of the coincidence of causes and conditions (or Dependent Origination). As these causes and conditions <b>change,</b> <b>all</b> things correspondingly cease to exist. With such an understanding, Siddhartha attained enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft did not <b>change</b> <b>all</b> of the Windows code to 32-bit; {{parts of}} it {{remained}} 16-bit (albeit not directly using real mode) for reasons of compatibility, performance and development time.

These factors immediately began to impact the operating system's efficiency and stability.|$|E
25|$|Humberside was {{abolished}} on 1 April 1996, {{with four}} unitary authorities being formed: North Lincolnshire, North East Lincolnshire, Kingston upon Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire. The name has continued in {{use as a}} geographical term, mainly in the media, and {{in the names of}} institutions such as Humberside Police and Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. These institutions did not change their names mainly due to costs. There are proposals to merge the police force with other Yorkshire forces and then <b>change</b> <b>all</b> the forces' names accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon Bonaparte sold French Louisiana to the United States in 1803, {{including}} all of Arkansas, in a transaction {{known today as}} the Louisiana Purchase. French soldiers remained as a garrison at Arkansas Post. Following the purchase, the balanced give-and-take relationship between settlers and Native Americans began to <b>change</b> <b>all</b> along the frontier, including in Arkansas. Following a controversy over allowing slavery in the territory, the Territory of Arkansas was organized on July 4, 1819. Gradual emancipation in Arkansas was struck down by one vote, the Speaker of the House Henry Clay, allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s {{were fairly}} good years for Colt, but the coming-end of the Cold War would <b>change</b> <b>all</b> that. Colt had long left {{innovation}} in civilian firearms to their competitors, {{feeling that the}} handgun business could survive on their traditional revolver and M1911 designs. Instead, Colt focused on the military market, where they held the primary contracts for production of rifles for the US military. This strategy dramatically failed for Colt {{through a series of}} events in the 1980s. In 1984, the U.S. military standardized on the Beretta 92F. This was not much of a loss for Colt's current business, as M1911A1 production had stopped in 1945. Meanwhile, the military rifle business was growing because the U.S. military had a major demand for more upgraded M16s; the M16A2 model had just been adopted and the Military needed hundreds of thousands of them.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the filmmakers}} had {{initially}} intended for [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] {{to be performed}} by Lumiere to Belle's disoriented father Maurice when the character first discovers the Beast's castle. According to co-director Gary Trousdale, [...] "The song had already been recorded and the sequence partially animated when we decided {{that it would be}} more meaningful if it was directed towards Belle" [...] because [...] "she is one of the two main characters and the story revolves around her coming to the castle." [...] Consequently, the song had to be re-written and the entire scene re-animated. Trousdale explained, [...] "We had to bring Jerry Orbach and all the other vocal talents back into the studio to <b>change</b> <b>all</b> references to gender that appeared in the original recording." ...|$|E
500|$|Orm's chief {{innovation}} was {{to employ}} doubled consonants {{to show that}} the preceding vowel is short and single consonants when the vowel is long (Treharne 2000, p.273). For syllables that ended in vowels, he used accent marks to indicate length. In addition to this, he used two distinct letter forms for g, using the old yogh for [...] and , and the new g for [...] (Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37). His devotion to precise spelling was meticulous; for example, having originally used eo and e inconsistently for words such as [...] "beon" [...] and [...] "kneow," [...] which had been spelled with eo in Old English, at line 13,000 he changed his mind and went back to <b>change</b> <b>all</b> eo spellings, replacing them solely with e alone (ben and knew), to reflect the pronunciation (Matthew 2004, p.936; Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37).|$|E

500|$|In Whitehead's view, then, {{concepts}} such as [...] "quality", [...] "matter", and [...] "form" [...] are problematic. These [...] "classical" [...] concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature {{of the most basic}} elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. [...] What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. [...] After all, people <b>change</b> <b>all</b> the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. [...] These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a [...] "society" [...] of events. [...] By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the [...] "fallacy of misplaced concreteness").|$|E
500|$|On March 11, 2003, Republican U.S. Representatives Bob Ney and Walter B. Jones {{directed}} the three House cafeterias to <b>change</b> <b>all</b> references to French fries and French toast on menus, {{and replace them}} with Freedom fries and Freedom toast, respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie's example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, [...] "the French were 'sitting on the sidelines. As Ney was Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration, the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure with France's [...] "continued refusal to stand with their U.S. allies". The statement further read: [...] "This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on Capitol Hill have with our so-called ally, France." [...] When asked about his view on the change, Jones said it was a [...] "lighthearted gesture".|$|E
500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to <b>change</b> <b>all</b> things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E

500|$|Coeducation would {{dramatically}} <b>change</b> <b>all</b> {{social life}} at Dartmouth College, including the fraternity system. [...] The college first began admitting women as full-time students in 1972. [...] By {{the fall of}} 1973, five local fraternities (Alpha Theta, Foley House, The Tabard, Phi Tau, and Phi Sigma Psi) had all decided to adopt a coeducational membership policy and admit women as full members. [...] The first sorority on campus, Sigma Kappa, was founded in 1977. [...] Many alumni expressed strong concerns {{that the need for}} housing for new sororities would inevitably lead to financial pressure and the possible dissolution of existing fraternities at the college. [...] In response, the Trustees imposed a moratorium limiting the campus to no more than six recognized sororities. Converting from an all-male to a coeducational membership policy was not enough to save at least one Greek organization on campus. [...] In 1981, the Harold Parmington Foundation reorganized itself as a new coeducational fraternity Delta Psi Delta, but the organization never attracted many new members and was finally forced to dissolve in the spring of 1991. [...] In addition, Foley House disassociated from the Greek system in fall 1984, transitioning into an affinity house as part of the college's residential living programs. [...] It moved off Webster Avenue to a new location on West Street (where it is still in operation [...] ).|$|E
500|$|In Argentine society, Messi is {{generally}} held in lesser esteem than Maradona, {{a consequence of}} not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi {{is in some ways}} the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt—he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays—have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi has said: [...] "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would <b>change</b> <b>all</b> my records to make the people in my country happy." [...] In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they haven't been given their salaries for six months. He has stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.|$|E
500|$|Lee ordered Longstreet {{to launch}} a {{surprise}} attack with two divisions straddling, and guiding on, the Emmitsburg Road. Hood's division would move up {{the eastern side of}} the road, Lafayette McLaws's the western side, each perpendicular to it. The objective was to strike the Union Army in an oblique attack, rolling up their left flank, collapsing the line of Union corps onto each other, and seizing Cemetery Hill. The Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson would join the attack against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge at the appropriate time. This plan was based on faulty intelligence because of the absence of J.E.B. Stuart and his cavalry, leaving Lee with an incomplete understanding of the position of his enemy. He believed that the left flank of the Union army was adjacent to the Emmitsburg Road hanging [...] "in the air" [...] (unsupported by any natural barrier), and an early morning scouting expedition seemed to confirm that. In reality, by dawn of July 2 the Union line stretched the length of Cemetery Ridge and anchored at the foot of the imposing Little Round Top. Lee's plan was doomed from its conception, as Meade's line occupied only a small portion of the Emmitsburg Road near the town itself. Any force attacking up the road would find two entire Union corps and their guns posted on the ridge to their immediate right flank. By midday, however, Union general Sickles would <b>change</b> <b>all</b> that.|$|E
