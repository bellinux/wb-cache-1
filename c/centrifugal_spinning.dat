By May 1925, Hofstede Crull already had formulated a solution for the problem - Driving Device For A <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>Spinning</b> Machine and filed for patents in the Netherlands on May 6, 1925 and in the United States on May 3, 1926; thereafter it became fully patented in the United States on March 31, 1931 by the United States Patent office, (Patent No: 1,798,312; inventor R.W.H.H. Crull; by his international law firm, Marks & Clerk-Electric motor-INT SPINPOT EXPLOITATIE MIJ NV) [...] Thereafter, one of Hofstede Crull's companies, De Vijf and the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek formed a joint venture, De Internationale Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij(ISEM) to manufacture and market Hofstede Crull's machines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> {{is a novel}} fibre-forming {{process that}} readily permits the {{incorporation}} of additives while avoiding the thermal damage often associated with conventional melt spinning. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> of a viscous solution of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) mixed with pectin was used to fabricate a range of fibres containing different concentrations of this biologically active agent. The influence of this blending on fibre morphology and in vitro degradation in an accelerated hydrolytic model at 70 ?C and pH of 10. 6 is reported. RESULTS: Blending influenced the physiochemical properties of the fibres, andthis significantly affected thedegradation profile of both the fibre and its PHB constituent. A greater influence on degradation was exerted {{by the type of}} pectin and its degree of esterification than by variations in its loading. CONCLUSION: <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> permits the fabrication of composite fibrous matrices from PHB and pectin. Incorporation of the polysaccharide into the fibres can be used to manipulate degradation behaviour and demonstrates a model for doping of matrices with active biological constituents. The unique features of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> process, as illustrated by the structure of the fibres and the degradation profiles, suggest possible applications of centrifugally spun biopolymers as wound scaffolding devices and in tissue engineering...|$|E

40|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> uses {{high speed}} {{spinneret}} rotation to generate and elongate jets of polymeric material in to fine fibres. Variations of this basic {{technology has been}} used to form ultrafine fibres from: polypropylene (PP), ubiquitous in the nonwovens industry and a key material for nonwovens; polycaprolactone (PCL), a biocompatible polymer used previously as a biological scaffold; and polyvinylpyrrolidone with 1 -triacontane (PVP/TA), a copolymer found in the cosmetics industry. This work demonstrated the melt <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> of PP into sub-micron fibres ≤ 500 nm in diameter, and PCL fibres ≤ 900 nm in diameter. The influences of material properties and processing conditions on the fibre and webs properties were investigated and relationships established. For melt spinning, increasing the rotational speed will reduce the average fibre diameter and when solution spinning PCL a binary solvent produced finer fibres with increased surface textures. The spinning of PVP/TA into fibres demonstrated in this work has been previously unreported. PVP/TA fibres were created by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> at low temperatures were as fine as 1. 5 µm on average. These fibres were used as an adsorbent and showed an affinity for the capture and retention of disperse dyes and hydrocarbons on the fibre surface. Carbon nanotube composite fibres were created by dispersing the nanotubes in both PP and PCL polymers using ultrasonic waves. The addition of carbon nanotubes significantly increased the level of beading during spinning in both PP and PCL as their presence causing an increase in Rayleigh instabilities. The addition of nanotubes did not improve web strength of the products compared to virgin polymer.

In this study, the use of high-yield manufacture of fiber-based dispersion is explored as an alternative approach to monolith production methods. A temperature-controlled solvent-free <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> process was used to produce sucrose-based microfibers containing the poorly water-soluble drugs olanzapine and piroxicam (both BCS Class II); these were successfully incorporated into the microfibers and the basic characteristics of fiber diameter, glassy behavior, drug loading capacity and drug–sucrose interaction assessment were measured. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that bead-free drug-loaded microfibers with homogenous morphology and diameter {{in the range of}} a few micrometers were prepared using our process. Differential scanning calorimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that both drug and carrier were present in the amorphous state in the microfibers, although in the case of piroxicam-loaded microfibers, the presence of small amounts of crystalline drug was observed under polarized light microscopy and in Fourier transform infrared spectra. Drug dissolution performance was evaluated under both sink and non-sink conditions and was found to be significantly enhanced compared to the corresponding crystalline physical mixtures and pure drugs, with evidence of supersaturation behavior noted under non-sink conditions.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general regularized thin-fibre (string) model {{to predict the}} {{properties}} of non-Newtonian fluid fibres generated by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning.</b> In this process the fibre emerges from a nozzle of a spinneret that rotates rapidly around its axis of symmetry, {{in the presence of}} centrifugal, Coriolis, inertial, viscous/shear-thinning, surface tension and gravitational forces. We analyse the effects of five important dimensionless groups, namely, the Rossby number (), the Reynolds number (), the Weber number (), the Froude number () and a power-law index (), on the steady state trajectory and thinning of fibre radius. In particular, we find that the gravitational force mainly affects the fibre vertical angle at small arc lengths as well as the fibre trajectory. We show that for small, which is the regime of nanofibre formation in <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> methods, rapid thinning of the fibre radius occurs over small arc lengths, which becomes more pronounced as increases or decreases. At larger arc lengths, a relatively large results in a spiral trajectory regime, where the fibre eventually recovers a corresponding inviscid limit with a slow thinning of the fibre radius {{as a function of the}} arc length. Viscous forces do not prevent the fibre from approaching the inviscid limit, but very strong surface tension forces may do so as they could even result in a circular trajectory with an almost constant fibre radius. We divide the spiral and circular trajectories into zones of no thinning, intense thinning and slow or ceased thinning, and for each zone we provide simple expre ssions for the fibre radius as a function of the arc length...|$|E

Neglecting surface tension and temperature dependence, the fiber flow is modeled as a three-dimensional free boundary value problem via instationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. From regular asymptotic expansions in powers of the slenderness parameter leading-order balance laws for mass (cross-section) and momentum are derived that combine the unrestricted motion of the fiber center-line with the inner viscous transport. The physically reasonable form of the one-dimensional fiber model results thereby from the introduction of the intrinsic velocity that characterizes the convective terms. For the numerical simulation of the derived model a finite volume code is developed. The results of the numerical scheme for high Reynolds numbers are validated by comparing them with the analytical solution of the inviscid problem.

Materials and methods: Two sets of chitosan fiber composites were prepared, one filled with anti-microbial silver nanoparticles and another one with cinnamaldeyhde. Chitosan powder was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid and dichloromethane followed by addition of the fillers. The fiber output was optimized by configuring the polymer weight concentration (7, 8, and 9 w/w% chitosan) and applied angular velocity (6000 - 9000 RPM) within the spinning process. Results: Scanning electron microscopy revealed fiber diameters ranging from 800 - 1500 nm. Cinnamaldehyde and silver nanoparticles helped to improve and control the anti-bacterial activity.  Through a verified cell counting method and disk diffusion method, it was proven that the chitosan based composite fibers possess an enhanced anti-bacterial/microbial activity against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Both composite systems showed anti-bacterial activity, inhibition zones fluctuating between 5 to 10 mm were observed {{depending on the size of}} the fiber matand no bacteria was found within the mats.

In the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>spinning</b> process, a polymer solution has been pushed by the centrifugal force through small nozzle of a rapidly rotating cylindrical drum. Thereby thin fibers are formed and collected on a collector {{in the form of a}} web. Centrifuge spinning suffered from a strong air resistance which leads to a more deflected jet as well as its rapidly solvent evaporation resulting in thicker nanofibers. In this work, centrifuge spinning has been equipped by a rotating collector, whereas the fabrication process was skillfully sealed from ambient airflow. A comparison was drawn between the trajectory of Newtonian liquid jets fabricated by centrifuge spinning and air-sealed centrifuge spinning. The captured images of the liquid jet trajectory using a high speed camera showed that non-isolated liquid jets were more curved than isolated liquid jets due to air resistance. A pre-presented non-linear analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations was carried out and the numerical solutions were compared with the experiments. There was fairly good agreement between the isolated jet trajectory and the model-predicted one, but there were differences between the non-isolated jet trajectory and the simulation results.

The solid model has advantages of <b>centrifugal</b> force and <b>spin</b> softening effects over beam models. The {{results show that}} the fatigue {{fracture of}} the shaft is mainly due to the torsional vibration,the stress stiffening and spin softening have strong influence on the bending vibration medes,and torsional vibration modes do not changed at different speeds. There is accounting for the effects by an adjustment of the stiffness matrix. By using of solid models,the vibration modes of the intermediate shaft were researched,then the model was optimized in order to avoid resonance...|$|R
