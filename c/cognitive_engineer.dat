40|$|Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA; Rasmussen, Pejtersen & Goodstein, 1994; Vicente, 1999) is most {{familiar}} to <b>cognitive</b> <b>engineers</b> from its successes {{in the area}} of interface design. In this report, we describe how we have used CWA in a variety of other contexts at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) in Australia. First, we describe the five analytic techniques of CWA, and we show how CWA can be used throughout a system’s life cycle, from requirements definition to system retirement. Second, we provide specific examples of projects from the air defense domain in which we have used CWA. These projects include (1) evaluating alternative designs for Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft, (2) evaluating human-system integration solutions for AEW&C, (3) identifying training needs for F/A– 18 pilots and developing functional requirements for a training system that meets those needs, and (4) designing information work spaces for command and control. These examples give strength to the argument that CWA can be used just as effectively in areas other than interface design where the professional contribution of <b>cognitive</b> <b>engineers</b> is required...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cognitive {{engineering}} {{methods in}} a large-scale homeland security program are described. Screening cargo containers at seaports for illicit radioactive material involves substantial staff, technology, and human operator decision making. The systems engineering model {{used by the}} radiation portal monitor (RPM) program entails elements similar to the incremental commitment model, which provides a risk-based focus for applications of cognitive engineering. This model includes meth-ods for defining opportunities and context of use, methods for requirements and design solutions, and methods for evaluation. The application examples illustrate each of these general areas through work domain analysis, signal detection modeling, design of displays for radiation threat likelihood, and evaluation of the design concepts with field test data. The signal detection analysis shows how system detection sensitiv-ity requirements for design can be established for low-probability, high-consequence events such as threats. The threat display concept developed by <b>cognitive</b> <b>engineers</b> has been implemented in new fielded systems. The success of cognitive engineering in the RPM program is largely a result of working with an incremental approach to systems engineering. This perspective provides application focus to those areas most likely to benefit from cognitive engineering within the overall constraints of the work domain, program schedule, and budget...|$|R
40|$|Work-centered {{software}} systems {{function as}} inherent work-aiding systems. Based {{on the design}} concept for a work-centered support system (WCSS), these software systems support user tasks and goals through both direct and indirect aiding methods within the interface client. In order to ensure the coherent development and delivery of work-centered software products, WCSS visual interface requirements must be specified in order to capture the cognitive and work-aiding aspects of the user interface design. Without the ability to specify such original requirements, the probability of creating an accurate and effective work-centered software system is significantly reduced. A new visual requirements specification language based on the User Interface Markup Language (UIML) is proposed as an effective solution to bridging this gap between cognitive systems engineering and software engineering. In this paper, a new visual requirements specification language that can capture and describe work-centered visual requirements within a semi-formal syntax is introduced and explained. The proposed language is also shown to be easily integrated into a UML object model via the use of UML 2 ̆ 7 s extensibility features. Such a specification language for visual requirements could be employed by <b>cognitive</b> <b>engineers</b> and design teams to help convey requirements in a comprehensible format that is suitable for a software engineer. This solution provides coherency in the software modeling process of developing work-centered software systems and contributes towards the specification of unique visual software requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Remote sensing is {{increasingly}} {{used to assess}} disaster damage, traditionally by professional image analysts. A recent alternative is crowdsourcing by volunteers experienced in remote sensing, using internet-based mapping portals. We identify a range of problems in current approaches, including how volunteers can best be instructed for the task, ensuring that instructions are accurately understood and translate into valid results, or how the mapping scheme must be adapted for different map user needs. The volunteers, the mapping organizers, and the map users all perform complex cognitive tasks, yet {{little is known about}} the actual information needs of the users. We also identify problematic assumptions about the capabilities of the volunteers, principally related to the ability to perform the mapping, and to understand mapping instructions unambiguously. We propose that any robust scheme for collaborative damage mapping must rely on Cognitive Systems Engineering and its principal method, Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA), to understand the information and decision requirements of the map and image users, and how the volunteers can be optimally instructed and their mapping contributions merged into suitable map products. We recommend an iterative approach involving map users, remote sensing specialists, <b>cognitive</b> systems <b>engineers</b> and instructional designers, as well as experimental psychologists. ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{theorists have}} argued that <b>cognitive</b> agents <b>engineer</b> their {{environment}} to sustain and amply their cognitive abilities, and also that elements of the surrounding world sometimes {{play a crucial role}} in evoking and sustaining emotion. Such insights raise an interesting question about the relationship between cognitive and affective scaffolding: in addition to enabling the realization of specific affective states, can an affective niche also enable the realization of certain cognitive capacities? In order to gain a better understanding of this relationship between affective scaffolding and cognition, I will examine the use of expressive arts in the context of psychotherapy and peacebuilding. In these settings, environmental resources and interpersonal scaffolds not only evoke emotion and encourage the adoption of particular bodily-affective styles, but also support the development of capacities for self-awareness and interpersonal understanding. These affective scaffolds {{play a crucial role in}} therapy and peacebuilding, in fact, insofar as they facilitate the development of self-knowledge, enhance capacities associated with social cognition, and build positive rapport and trust among participants. I will argue that this is because affectivity is linked to the way that subjects frame and attend to their surroundings. Insofar as the regulation and modulation of emotion goes hand in hand with opening up new interpretive frames and establishing new habits of mind, affective scaffolds can contribute significantly to various modes of cognition...|$|R

40|$|It is easy {{to force}} a weather {{forecaster}} to work out of context—simply move {{him or her to}} some new locale. It takes at least one full seasonal cycle for forecasters to reacquire expertise. Worse, move a forecaster from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere. Major things change. Low-pressure systems spiral clockwise, not counterclockwise. Effects of ocean currents, seasonal variations, and effects of land masses change everything. Any knowledge of trends that the forecaster had relied on are now utterly useless. In the studies we report in this chapter, we did something like this, but the switch involved making us, as <b>cognitive</b> systems <b>engineers,</b> work out of context. Work on forecaster reasoning with which we are familiar (e. g., Hoffman, 1991), including on our own research, has involved the study of forecasters in the U. S. Navy and U. S. National Weather Service. We think we have some ideas about how forecasters think (see chap. 15, this volume), but are we sure? How does what we think we know transfer to, say, forecasting in Australia? Or does it transfer? What if we were to advise building some new tool, only to learn that it does not help forecasters in regions other than the continental United States? Weather forecasting is a complex process. The supporting information is multidimensional, distributed, and often uncertain. It includes both “raw” observations (e. g., current temperature, winds, pressure, clouds, precipitation, radar returns, satellite pictures, etc.) and analytic weather models that predict future weather conditions at various scales of space and time.

However, they are poor at capturing the rationale and underlying intent within the design itself. As a consequence of this, when changes are required at a later stage in the product’s life cycle, the consequences of these are unclear because the affects of and reasons for previous decisions may not be readily understood since the dependencies within a design are not explicitly represented.

Developments in hardware and software have led to (and will continue to stimulate) novel methods for visualizing geospatial data. It is our belief that these novel methods will be of little use {{if they are not}} developed within a theoretical cognitive framework and iteratively tested using usability engineering principles. We argue that cognitive and usability issues should be considered in the context of six major research themes: 1) geospatial virtual environments (GeoVEs), 2) dynamic representations (including animated and interactive maps), 3) metaphors and schemata in user interface design, 4) individual and group differences, 5) collaborative geovisualization, and 6) evaluating the effectiveness of geovisualization methods. A key point underlying our use of theoretical cognitive principles is that traditional cognitive theory for static 2 D maps may not be applicable to interactive 3 D immersive GeoVEs and dynamic representations thus new cognitive theory may need to be developed. Usability engineering extends beyond the traditional cartographic practice of user testing by evaluating software effectiveness throughout a lifecycle (including design, development, and deployment). Applying usability engineering to geovisualization, however, may be problematic because of the novelty of geovisualization and the associated difficulty of defining the nature of users and their tasks.

40|$|Looking {{beyond the}} {{provided}} or presented problem can allow new perspectives to emerge, revealing {{the potential for}} more varied and creative solutions. Current engineering and design research has primarily focused on the generation of ideas, and little research has investigated how engineering designers engage in identifying and refining problem definitions, a process called “problem exploration. ” Past research has established that knowledge about how to perform problem exploration is important for improving {{our understanding of how}} presented problems turn into successful design solutions. However, existing problem exploration methods are not based on learning theory, and there is little empirical evidence about their effectiveness in education or practice. Therefore, the goal of this research is to investigate how engineering and industrial design students and practitioners explore problem spaces. The results characterize the cognitive strategies evident in finding, developing, and refining design problems. This paper presents the results of two studies on the <b>cognitive</b> processes <b>engineers</b> and designers use to explore and define problems. Overall, the results demonstrated that problem exploration is associated with making shifts in design decisions. The first study focused on problem exploration strategies used by engineering and design practitioners through a content analysis of problem statements from web-based design competitions calling for novel solutions. The analysis resulted in an initial set of problem exploration strategies, or cognitive heuristics, extracted from the submitted solutions. The results also demonstrated that a single presented problem can be redefined by designers {{in a number of different}} ways. The second study examined individual cognitive processes through a think-aloud protocol study of five engineering design students (senior and graduate level) as they explored presented problems. The results of this study provided a more in-depth look at the problem exploration process, and demonstrated that while common problem exploration heuristics emerged, each engineer displayed a distinct way of looking at the problem. These results will support the development of instructional materials for dissemination in both educational and practice settings in order to assist students, educators, and practitioners in their problem exploration processes. The project findings will help to better prepare designers and engineers to develop problem descriptions that represent core needs, and to frame them in ways that facilitate innovative solutions, ultimately resulting in solutions that address the real problems of the 21 st Century...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} {{goal of this}} dissertation was {{to evaluate}} the contextual components of instructional strategies for the acquisition of complex programming concepts. A meta-knowledge processing model is proposed, {{on the basis of}} the research findings, thereby facilitating the selection of media treatment for electronic courseware. When implemented, this model extends the work of Smith (1998), as a front-end methodology, for his glass-box interpreter called Bradman, for teaching novice programmers. Technology now provides the means to produce individualized instructional packages with relative ease. Multimedia and Web courseware development accentuate a highly graphical (or visual) approach to instructional formats. Typically, little consideration is given to the effectiveness of screen-based visual stimuli, and curiously, students are expected to be visually literate, despite the complexity of human-computer interaction. Visual literacy is much harder for some people to acquire than for others! (see Chapter Four: Conditions-of-the-Learner) An innovative research programme was devised to investigate the interactive effect of instructional strategies, enhanced with text-plus-textual metaphors or text-plus-graphical metaphors, and cognitive style, on the acquisition of a special category of abstract (process) programming concept. This type of concept was chosen to focus on the role of analogic knowledge involved in computer programming. The results are discussed within the context of the internal/external exchange process, drawing on Ritchey 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) concepts of within-item and between-item encoding elaborations. The methodology developed for the doctoral project integrates earlier research knowledge in a novel, interdisciplinary, conceptual framework, including: from instructional science in the USA, for the concept learning models; British cognitive psychology and human memory research, for defining the cognitive style construct; and Australian educational research, to provide the measurement tools for instructional outcomes. The experimental design consisted of a screening test to determine cognitive style, a pretest to determine prior domain knowledge in abstract programming knowledge elements, the instruction period, and a post-test to measure improved performance. This research design provides a three-level discovery process to articulate: 1) the fusion of strategic knowledge required by the novice learner for dealing with contexts within instructional strategies 2) acquisition of knowledge using measurable instructional outcome and learner characteristics 3) knowledge of the innate environmental factors which influence the instructional outcomes This research has successfully identified the interactive effect of instructional strategy, within an individual 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive style construct, in their acquisition of complex programming concepts. However, the significance of the three-level discovery process lies in the scope of the methodology to inform the design of a meta-knowledge processing model for instructional science. Firstly, the British cognitive style testing procedure, is a low cost, user friendly, computer application that effectively measures an individual 2 ̆ 7 s position on the two cognitive style continua (Riding & Cheema, 1991). Secondly, the QUEST Interactive Test Analysis System (Izard, 1995), allows for a probabilistic determination of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge level, relative to other participants, and relative to test-item difficulties. Test-items can be related to skill levels, and consequently, can be used by instructional scientists to measure knowledge acquisition. Finally, an Effect Size Analysis (Cohen, 1977) allows for a direct comparison between treatment groups, giving a statistical measurement of how large an effect the independent variables have on the dependent outcomes. Combined with QUEST 2 ̆ 7 s hierarchical positioning of participants, this tool can assist in identifying preferred learning conditions for the evaluation of treatment groups. By combining these three assessment analysis tools into instructional research, a computerized learning shell, customised for individuals 2 ̆ 7 cognitive constructs can be created (McKay & Garner, 1999). While this approach has widespread application, individual researchers/trainers would nonetheless, need to validate with an extensive pilot study programme (McKay, 1999 a; McKay, 1999 b), the interactive effects within their specific learning domain. Furthermore, the instructional material does not need to be limited to a textual/graphical comparison, but could be applied to any two or more instructional treatments of any kind. For instance: a structured versus exploratory strategy. The possibilities and combinations are believed to be endless, provided the focus is maintained on linking of the front-end identification of cognitive style with an improved performance outcome. My in-depth analysis provides a better understanding of the interactive effects of the cognitive style construct and instructional format on the acquisition of abstract concepts, involving spatial relations and logical reasoning. In providing the basis for a meta-knowledge processing model, this research is expected to be of interest to educators, <b>cognitive</b> psychologists, communications <b>engineers</b> and computer scientists specialising in computer-human interactions...|$|R
