40|$|Temperature {{programming}} {{was used}} to improve selectivity in the suppressed ion chromatographic (IC) separation of inorganic anions, haloacetic acids and oxyhalides in drinking water samples when using NaOH gradient elution. The programme exploited varying responses of these anions to changes in temperature. Heats of adsorption (ΔH, kJ/mol) for 17 anionic species were calculated from van’t Hoff plots. For haloacetic acids, both the degree of substitution and log P (log of n-octanol–water partition coefficient) values correlated well with {{the magnitude of the}} temperature effect, with monochloro- and monobromoacetic acids showing the largest effect (ΔH = − 10. 4 to − 10. 7 kJ/mol), dichloro- and dibromoacetic acids showing a reduced effect (ΔH = − 6. 8 to − 8. 4 kJ/mol) and trichloro-, bromodichloro- and chlorodibromoacetic acids showing the least effect (ΔH = − 4. 7 to − 2. 4 kJ/mol). The effect of temperature on oxyhalides ranged from ΔH = 8. 4 kJ/mol for perchlorate to ΔH = − 9. 1 kJ/mol for iodate. The effectiveness of two commercial <b>column</b> <b>ovens</b> was investigated for the application of temperature gradients during chromatographic runs, with the best system applied to improve the resolution of closely retained species at the start, middle and end of the separation obtained using a previously optimised hydroxide gradient, in a real drinking water sample matrix.

40|$|The use of high {{temperatures}} (above 100 °C) in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-HTLC) {{has opened up}} novel and enhanced applications for this essential separation technique. Although the favourable effects of temperature on LC have been extensively studied both theoretically and practically, its potential application to method development has barely been investigated. These favourable effects include enhanced speed, efficiency, resolution and detectability, as well as changes in selectivity, especially for polar and ionisable compounds, {{and the emergence of}} new options such as temperature programming and the concomitant use of solvent and temperature gradients, green separations, and so on. The recent availability of silica-based columns that routinely support {{high temperatures}} in addition to more conventional temperature-resistant columns (based on graphitised carbon, polymers and zirconium oxide) and dedicated <b>column</b> <b>ovens</b> that allow accurate temperature control up to 200 °C makes it possible to conceive of RP-HTLC as a routine separation technique in the modern analytical laboratory. On the other hand, the addition of temperature as a new optimisable parameter to RPLC adds further complexity to method development. Thus, new computer-assisted optimisation tools that extend the capabilities of current computer-assisted tools are being specifically developed for this type of separation. A new specially developed computer-assisted method development (CAMD) tool is presented herein, and its efficiency is demonstrated. This CAMD is based on the development of a rugged retention model for peaks, allowing the simulation of any kind of RP-HTLC separation, including isocratic, linear, curved, multilinear and stepwise gradients of solvent composition concomitant with constant, linear and multilinear temperature gradients. Both the retention models and the unattended optimisation of separations are driven by evolutionary algorithms, thus providing negligible-cost, rapid, highly efficient, and user-friendly optimisation processes...|$|R

50|$|SFC with CO2 {{utilizes}} {{carbon dioxide}} pumps that {{require that the}} incoming CO2 and pump heads be kept cold {{in order to maintain}} the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate. The CO2 subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the <b>column</b> <b>oven</b> when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved. SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix, with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas. The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection, and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency. Typically, gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar co-solvent such as methanol, possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations ~1%. The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5 um material. The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate, co-solvent composition, system back pressure and <b>column</b> <b>oven</b> temperature which must exceed 40 °C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO2. In addition, SFC provides an additional control parameter - pressure - by using an automated back pressure regulator. From an operational standpoint, SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar co-solvent. If the outlet CO2 is captured, it can be recompressed and recycled, allowing for >90% reuse of CO2.|$|E

40|$|Short-chain {{chlorinated}} paraffins (SCCPs) are highly complex technical mixtures {{with thousands of}} isomers and numerous homologs. They are classified as priority candidate persistent organic pollutants under the Stockholm Convention for their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Analyzing SCCPs is challenging because {{of the complexity of}} the mixtures. Chromatograms of SCCPs acquired using one-dimensional (1 D) gas chromatography (GC) contain a large characteristic "peak" with a broad and unresolved profile. Comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GCxGC) shows excellent potential for separating complex mixtures. In this study, GCxGC coupled with micro electron capture detection (mu ECD) was used to separate and screen SCCPs. The chromatographic parameters, including the GC <b>column</b> types, <b>oven</b> temperature program, and modulation period, were systematically optimized. The SCCP congeners were separated into groups using a DM- 1 column connected to a BPX- 50 column.

A fish tissue sample was analyzed to illustrate the feasibility of the GCxGC-mu ECD method in analyzing biological samples. Over 1, 500 compounds were identified in the fish extract, significantly more than were identified using 1 D GC. The detection limits for five selected SCCP congeners were between 1 and 5 pg/L using the GCxGC method, and these were significantly lower than those achieved using 1 D GC.

This device was originally designed for rapid cooling of an oven to reduce the time for analysis. In our laboratories, we are using it for trapping volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside a capillary <b>column</b> at cryogenic <b>oven</b> temperatures; as much as 5 mL of headspace vapor can be injected into a medium-bore capillary column without any loss, giving sensitivity 10 - 50 times higher than that by the conventional headspace GC method.

The method is recommendable for wide use in forensic and environmental toxicology, because it is simple and requires no special GC operations {{in addition to the}} above high sensitivity and high resolution. In this lecture, some successful data obtained by the present capillary GC with cryogenic oven trapping are presented for analysis of chloroform, methyene chloride, trichloroethylene, ethyl ether, solvent thinner components, xylene isomers, cyanide and ethanol in human body fluids.

The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) <b>column</b> set, <b>oven</b> temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines. Differentiation among Merlot wines and wines of other grape varieties were mainly perceived through the following components: ethyl dodecanoate, 1 -hexanol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, dehydro- 2 -methyl- 3 (2 H) thiophenone, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, ethyl tetradecanoate, methyl octanoate, 1, 4 butanediol, and 6 -methyloctan- 1 -ol. 201...|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{method is}} presented for determination of thinner components in human body fluids by capillary gas chromatography (GC) with low oven temperature for trapping headspace vapor inside the capillary column. After heating a whole blood or urine sample containing ethyl acetate, benzene, n-butanol, toluene, n-butyl acetate n-isoamyl acetate and ethyl benzene as internal standard in a 7. 5 ml-vial at 90 ℃ for 30 min, 5 ml of headspace vapor was {{drawn into a}} glass syringe. All vapor was introduced through an injection port in the splitless mode into a DB- 624 middle-bore capillary <b>column</b> with the <b>oven</b> temperature at 5 ℃ for trapping all volatile compounds, and the oven temperature was programmed up to 110 ℃ for detection of the compounds by GC with a flame ionization detector. The present conditions gave sharp peaks and good separation of each compound with low background noises. Recoveries of the 6 compounds were 4. 76 - 75. 7 % and 3. 56 - 81. 7 % for whole blood and urine samples, respectively. The CV values of all compounds in whole blood and urine samples were 3. 5 - 9. 5 %. The calibration curves showed linearity in the range 0. 78 - 400 ng/ 0. 5 ml whole blood or urine; the detection limits were 0. 5 - 5 ng/ 0. 5 ml. The data on actual analysis of toluene and n-butyl acetate in postmortem blood were also presented. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReservoir fluid {{characterization}} by {{gas chromatography}} (GC) has an impressive capability of detection and quantification {{of a wide}} range of single carbon number (SCN) groups in oil analyses. However, some researchers prefer to report analyses to C 20 + only, with estimation of the Cn+ fraction distribution obtained using various correlations. Conversely, other researchers prefer to extend GC analysis to the highest possible SCN group using high-temperature gas chromatography (HTGC), with programming to ca. 370 - 430 °C. However, the reliability of extended GC analyses to high carbon number fractions is questioned because of a possible overestimation of light and intermediate fractions in the original oils caused by thermal decomposition products. The thermal stability of heavy hydrocarbons at the above HTGC conditions has been a major concern for some authors based on the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) published by Schwartz et al. [Schwartz, H. E.; Brownlee, R. G.; Boduszynski, M. M.; Su, F. Anal. Chem. 1987, 59 (10), 1393 − 1401], who highlighted thermal instability of heavy oils from around 370 °C. To that end, in this study, a pyrolysis model spanning the n-alkanes (nC 14 H 30 -nC 80 H 162) at low conversion has been developed and applied to mixtures at the GC <b>column</b> pressure and <b>oven</b> temperatures up to 450 °C. On the basis of this model, the minimum SCN, which could possibly be at risk of thermal cracking at some commonly used HTGC temperature programs, has been obtained by comparing the retention time of n-alkane standard mixtures (nC 10 H 22 -nC 75 H 152) and the minimal pyrolysis time at the same SCN range of equimolar, heavy, and light mixtures at different dilutions in He and some low isoconversion pyrolysis curves. Finally, this study gives the first insight into the limitation in the practice of GC and introduces a new approach for calculating the minimum SCN not suffering pyrolysis inside a particular GC column...|$|R
