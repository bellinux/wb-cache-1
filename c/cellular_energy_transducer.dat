40|$|Proton pumping {{driven by}} light or by {{respiration}} generates an electrochemical potential difference across the membrane in Halobacterium halobium. The pH changes induced by light or by respiration in cell suspensions are complicated by proton flows {{associated with the}} functioning of the <b>cellular</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transducers.</b> A proton-per-ATP ratio of about 3 is calculated from simultaneous measurements of phosphorylation and the proton inflow. This value is compatible with the chemiosmotic coupling hypothesis. The time course of the light-induced changes in membrane potential indicates that light-driven pumping increases a dark pre-existing potential of about 130 mV only by a small amount (20 to 30 mV). The complex kinetic features of the membrane potential changes do not closely follow those of the pH changes, which suggests that flows of ions other than protons are involved. A qualitative model consistent with the available data is presented...|$|R

Understanding and improving plants tolerance to an unfavourable environment {{remains one of}} the objectives in the study of plant biotechnology. One growing theory for reducing plant susceptibility to a broad range of stresses is modulation of <b>cellular</b> <b>energy</b> homeostasis. NAD+ (along with ATP) is the most important of <b>cellular</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transducers</b> {{in the form of a}} hydrogen ion donor and acceptor. However, a bigger picture is emerging as its role broadens to include a coenzyme, precursor for secondary messengers and a substrate for protein modifications. Three groups of proteins use NAD+ as a substrate, the NAD+ protein deacetylases, poly ADP polymerases and ADP ribose cyclases. Work on these groups of proteins in model organisms have identified their involvement in many biological roles including DNA repair, increasing longevity, initiating apoptosis and regulation of transcription. However, their role in plants is largely unknown. The aim of this study has been to identify the genes involved which use NAD+ and to further characterise their role in plant stress responses.

40|$|AbstractA {{recently}} proposed {{model for}} proton leakage across biological membranes [Prog. Lipid Res. 40 (2001) 299] suggested that hydrocarbons {{specifically in the}} center of the lipid bilayer inhibit proton leaks. Since cellular membranes maintain a proton electrochemical gradient as a principal <b>energy</b> <b>transducer,</b> proton leakage unproductively consumes <b>cellular</b> <b>energy.</b> Hydrocarbons in the bilayer are widespread in membranes that sustain such gradients. The alkaliphiles are unique in that they contain up to 40 mol% isoprenes in their membranes including 10 – 11 mol% squalene [J. Bacteriol. 168 (1986) 334]. Squalene is a polyisoprene hydrocarbon without polar groups. Localizing hydrocarbons in lipid bilayers has not been trivial. A myriad of physical methods including fluorescence spectroscopy, electron-spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance as well as X-ray and neutron diffraction have been used to explore this question with various degrees of success and often contradictory results. Seeking unambiguous evidence for the localization of squalene in membranes or lipid bilayers, we employed neutron diffraction. We incorporated 10 mol% perdeuterated or protonated squalane, an isosteric analogue of squalene, into stacked bilayers of dioleoyl phosphatidyl choline (DOPC) doped with dioleoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG) to simulate the negative charges found on natural membranes. The neutron diffraction data clearly show that the squalane lies predominantly in the bilayer center, parallel to the plane of the membrane...|$|R

Although primary batteries provide a simple design for powering autonomous sensors, they present several limitations such as limited capacity and power density, and difficulty in predicting their condition and state of charge. An alternative is to extract energy from the ambient (energy harvesting). However, the reduced dimensions of most autonomous sensors lead to a low level of available power from the <b>energy</b> <b>transducer.</b> Thus, efficient methods and circuits to manage and gather the energy are a must. An integral approach for powering autonomous sensors by considering both primary batteries and energy harvesters is presented. Two rather different forms of energy harvesting are also dealt with: optical (or solar) and radiofrequency (RF). Optical energy provides high energy density, especially outdoors, whereas RF remote powering is possibly the most feasible option for autonomous sensors embedded into the soil or within structures. Throughout different chapters, devices such as primary and secondary batteries, supercapacitors, and <b>energy</b> <b>transducers</b> are extensively reviewed.

40|$|SummaryFoxO {{transcription}} {{factors and}} TORC 1 are conserved downstream effectors of Akt. Here, we unraveled regulatory circuits underlying {{the interplay between}} Akt, FoxO, and mTOR. Activated FoxO 1 inhibits mTORC 1 by TSC 2 -dependent and TSC 2 -independent mechanisms. First, FoxO 1 induces Sestrin 3 (Sesn 3) gene expression. Sesn 3, in turn, inhibits mTORC 1 activity in Tsc 2 -proficient cells. Second, FoxO 1 elevates the expression of Rictor, leading to increased mTORC 2 activity that consequently activates Akt. In Tsc 2 -deficient cells, the elevation of Rictor by FoxO increases mTORC 2 assembly and activity {{at the expense of}} mTORC 1, thereby activating Akt while inhibiting mTORC 1. FoxO may act as a rheostat that maintains homeostatic balance between Akt and mTOR complexes' activities. In response to physiological stresses, FoxO maintains high Akt activity and low mTORC 1 activity. Thus, under stress conditions, FoxO inhibits the anabolic activity of mTORC 1, a major consumer of <b>cellular</b> <b>energy,</b> while activating Akt, which increases <b>cellular</b> <b>energy</b> metabolism, thereby maintaining <b>cellular</b> <b>energy</b> homeostasis...|$|R
