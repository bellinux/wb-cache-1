5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled {{thousands of miles}} to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. A <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them {{on the door and}} doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. <b>Chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the millennium on December 31, 1999, the National Christmas Tree's lights turned white at midnight. The following year, Polk Aristo-Craft expanded the model train display {{and a new}} wrought iron fence was erected around the tree (replacing an older <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence).</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{site was}} {{impacted}} through modern anthropogenic modifications of the landscape. Most noticeable was a concrete-filled posthole for a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> The auguring of the posthole {{was the cause}} for discovery of both the Moatfield village and ossuary. Despite the unearthing of human remains, construction continued and the posthole was filled with concrete; an action that impacted the bones immediately adjacent and below the posthole. Electrical wiring and water pipes also transected the site but had no direct effect on the ossuary.|$|E
25|$|Georgia's {{fans have}} only rushed {{the field and}} torn down the goal posts once in the stadium's history. This {{happened}} on October 7, 2000, after the Bulldogs beat rival Tennessee {{for the first time}} since 1988. This statistic is usually credited to the fact that the hedges serve not only cosmetic purposes, but also help with crowd control. Aiding this cause is that the hedges surround, and largely conceal, a low <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> running through their branches around the circumference of the field.|$|E
25|$|By August 15, {{the inmates}} {{reportedly}} surrendered after being {{promised to be}} transferred to a prison in Manila. Gunshots were fired as inmates crossed a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> along with the hostages, some of whom were able to escape while the rest were dragged back into the prison. According to one of the captives who escaped, nine of the hostages, including the Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill, were raped by the inmates. This led the military to storm into the prison later that day after the hostage takers continued to refuse to cooperate.|$|E

25|$|Eddie finally finds Jake. They go to {{the first}} dance venue, but find it is closed {{following}} the discovery of Joey's body. Jake climbs over a tall <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> to retrieve his motorcycle, and Eddie goes after him. On his motorcycle, Jake heads for the exit to circle around and return to Eddie. The killer finds Eddie inside the closed dance venue, and attacks him. Eddie locks himself in a shallow chain-link enclosure. The killer slashes at Eddie with his scythe; {{the tip of the}} blade just touches Eddie's glass eye. Jake arrives with a police officer, and the killer leaves.|$|E
25|$|Renovations {{continued}} through the early 2000s. In 2000 the Conservatory Water opened after a six-month restoration effort, with a $4 million project beginning on the 59th Street Pond, one of the park's most visible and heavily used landscapes. A new Reservoir fence was installed in 2003 under a $2 million capital project that replaced the old <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> with {{a replica of the}} 8,000-foot long steel and cast-iron one that had enclosed the Reservoir in 1926. The new fence, along with removal of invasive trees and shrubs, restored the panoramic views of the park and Manhattan skyline.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the engine}} and tender were {{successfully}} relocated during the Fall of 1960, it was several more years before the steel shed was erected overhead to protect the locomotive. In addition to the Pine Bluff Jaycees, the City of Pine Bluff and the Pine Bluff Park Commission each donated $500. Pine Bluff Mayor Franks personally donated $250 and another $250 was donated by the Townsend Park Commission. Gene Gardner, an engineer with International Paper, designed the green and white steel shed and drew up the plans for it. International Paper Company and the Pine Bluff Sand & Gravel Company furnished the concrete footings for the shed, while Varco Steel did the construction work. Construction of the shed was completed in September 1965 when a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> was installed and the landscaping was finished.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, the Raptors {{added a new}} spectator deck {{large enough}} for 1,200 spectators, two more {{concession}} stands, a Hardball Café, and an additional 2,000 fixed seats to the stadium. A new masonry wall was added, and the <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> was also replaced.|$|R
25|$|During the 1950s, {{the site}} housed a {{research}} group that used radar to scan approaching thunder storms {{as far away}} as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning. Findings by this group were instrumental {{in the development of the}} US weather radar program. The installation consisted of a steel tower supporting a second-hand military radar set, several Quonset huts and box trailers, surrounded by a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the end of the long career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to be one of the few who accurately forecast the path of the destructive Hurricane of September, 1938.|$|E
500|$|The western {{half was}} {{purchased}} by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources as a [...] "satellite area" [...] of Apple River Canyon State Park. The DNR installed a new steel gate to replace the <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> covering the western bore, and is developing the area with nature trails and other improvements. the tunnel is off-limits to public visitation as it is unsafe, due both to rattlesnakes and the ever-present danger of further collapse.|$|E
500|$|... "Kill Switch" [...] {{was written}} outside the mytharc {{of the series}} as a {{standalone}} story, which Gibson intended to be reminiscent of the [...] "dark visions" [...] of filmmaker David Cronenberg and to contain [...] "many obvious pokes and prods at high-end academic cyberculture." [...] Gibson's initial idea for the episode eventually evolved into the episode's final act. This was later combined with Maddox's idea of a deserted house with shuttered windows, surrounded by a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> The episode involved the merging of human and artificial intelligence on the World Wide Web, a concept that had been floating around cyber-futuristic circles at the time. The episode's rewriting and revision process took {{a significant amount of}} time and it was over a year before the episode was completed due to other priorities that series creator Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz had. When they were finally available, they made some revisions to the script, including upping Esther's attitude and Mulder and Scully's reactions to her. A scene involving Scully trying on a fake nose ring was deleted from the script. Gibson originally started watching the series on the suggestion of his daughter, 15 years old at the time. During filming, Gibson spent a majority of his time on the set only [...] "because [...] daughter insisted on being there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of gravel trap in the later half of the 1980s, <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> was used as catch fences in racetracks to slow out-of-control cars down before they impact barriers. In the 2000s they {{continued}} to be used at American dirt tracks.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the firm}} of Barnard, Bishop & Barnard was {{established}} in Norwich to produce <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> by machine.

50|$|The Gehry Residence is {{architect}} Frank Gehry's own house. It {{was originally}} an extension, designed by Gehry and built around an existing Dutch colonial style house. It {{makes use of}} unconventional materials, such as <b>chain-link</b> <b>fences</b> and corrugated steel. It is sometimes {{considered one of the}} earliest deconstructivist buildings, although Gehry denies this.|$|R
50|$|The Anchor Post Fence Co., {{established}} in 1891, bought {{the rights to}} the wire-weaving machine and was the first company to manufacture <b>chain-link</b> <b>fencing</b> in the United States. Anchor Fence also holds the first United States patent for chain-link. The machine was purchased from a man in 1845 from Belgium who originally invented the wire bending machine.|$|R
2500|$|The last Blues {{performances}} on Maxwell Street occurred in 1999-2000, on a bandstand erected by Frank [...] "Little Sonny" [...] Scott, Jr., near the north-east corner of Maxwell and Halsted Streets, on land recently vacated by {{the demolition of}} a historic building. The extension cord ran from the last remaining building in use, the Maxworks Cooperative headquarters, [...] east, at 716 Maxwell Street. One day a University crew arrived and erected a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> between the bandstand and the sidewalk, effectively banning the performances though they continued a few weeks longer on the too-narrow sidewalk.|$|E
2500|$|The Hole in the Horn Buck {{is officially}} {{listed as the}} second largest non-typical white-tailed deer of all time by the Boone and Crockett Club. The buck’s antlers score 328 2/8 non-typical points. The name of the buck derives from the mysterious hole in the buck’s right antler. It was later claimed by eyewitness, George Winters, to be caused from a piece of <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> that pierced the antler shortly before it died. [...] The world record white-tailed deer was stuck under the fence to the Ravenna Arsenal in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|When Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev {{declared}} a unilateral {{moratorium on the}} testing of nuclear weapons, which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40thanniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move {{as nothing more than}} propaganda, and refused to follow suit. In response, US anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the Nevada Test Site, beginning on Easter Sunday in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the [...] "Nevada Desert Experience" [...] group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> at the test site during the underground Operation Charioteer and United States's Musketeer nuclear test series of detonations.|$|E
