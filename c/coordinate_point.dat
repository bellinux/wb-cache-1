5000|$|The {{agreement}} was signed on 25 January 1989. The {{text of the}} treaty sets out a roughly north-south boundary that is approximately [...] long and is composed of a single straight-line maritime segment defined by two individual coordinate points. The boundary passes through the Bougainville Strait and the Solomon Sea. The boundary represents a modified equidistant line between Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

50|$|However, {{the number}} of {{settlements}} {{in the world for}} which population data are available exceeds one million. For each, coordinates, name, and an estimated population is available, but it is impossible to analyze all of them in the detail as shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8. There is no choice, but to place the entire population at one <b>coordinate</b> <b>point,</b> regardless of the settlement’s size, and to assign each settlement a standard distribution of buildings into classes of different earthquake resistance. The only refinement one can afford is to have different standard models for different countries and for at least three settlement size for each country.|$|E
50|$|In {{many large}} cities, the census {{contains}} information on population and building stock by district. A {{model of a}} city in which each district has its own distribution of buildings into classes and its population, is far superior to the basic, primitive model of one <b>coordinate</b> <b>point.</b> If one has the resources to divide a large city into neighborhoods containing similar building stock, then a high quality model can be constructed at a still moderate cost. An example of the mortality rate estimates {{in case of a}} future M8 earthquake off Lima, Peru, shows that there are substantial differences between districts (Figure 9). The differences are due to the distance from the assumed source, the type of soil, {{and the quality of the}} building stock. In addition to the mortality calculation for the entire population, information on the locations and expected damage state of schools, hospitals, fire stations, police posts, and critical facilities would be of great value for rescuers. However, to develop this type of information requires a more substantial effort in countries where the location and construction quality of these facilities are not known.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) in a cloud-based {{radio access network}} (RAN), where each <b>coordinating</b> access <b>point</b> compresses its observation using distributed Wyner-Ziv compression and forwards the compressed signal to the receiving processing unit. We map this architecture to the multiple-relay compress-and-forward (CF) problem, derive the achievable rate of such a system and then show that the achievable rate can be maximized by optimizing the distributed compression rate at each individual <b>coordinating</b> <b>point</b> in a joint manner. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed and numerical results indicate that compared with other coordinating schemes, when the channel between the <b>coordinating</b> <b>points</b> and the processing unit is strong, using distributed compression can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency...|$|R

5000|$|With {{regard to}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. LeVine argues for a 'parallel states' scenario, {{involving}} the dissolution of borders and overlapping sovereignty across the entirety of historic Palestine. LeVine has recently theorized that the only trope which can explain what he calls Israel's 'totalitarian' control over Palestinian people is that afforded by Quantum Mechanics. By totalitarian he {{does not mean the}} systems that prevailed in Nazi Germany, Fascist states, or Communist Russia and China, but the intricate matrix of control established by the Israeli occupation throughout the spatial territory Palestinians inhabit, by virtue of which the Palestinians have no more influence over their life paths than an electron in a field does. This control extends to the airspace, and underground (harvesting the water resources), to the present and the past, making for a unique synergy of [...] "bio" [...] and [...] "necro"-politics. He claims that maps created by ICAND show that a dozen control parameters are in place at any one <b>coordinate</b> <b>point</b> in the West Bank. The result in his view is that the Israeli occupation,'represents criminalized state behavior at the most systematic, intricately planned and executed, widest possible scale, and longest duration.' ...|$|E

Many authors have presented several calibration algorithms with their relative advantages and disadvantages. In a stereovision system, multiple view reconstruction is a challenging task. However, the total computational procedure in detail has not been presented before. Here in this work, {{we are dealing with}} the problem that, when a world <b>coordinate</b> <b>point</b> is fixed in space, image coordinates of that 3 D point vary for different camera positions and orientations. In computer vision aspect, this situation is undesirable. That is, the system has to be designed {{in such a way that}} image coordinate of the world <b>coordinate</b> <b>point</b> will be fixed irrespective of the position & orientation of the cameras. We have done it in an elegant fashion. Firstly, camera parameters are calculated in its local coordinate system. Then, we use global coordinate data to transfer all local coordinate data of stereo cameras into same global coordinate system, so that we can register everything into this global coordinate system. After all the transformations, when the image coordinate of the world <b>coordinate</b> <b>point</b> is calculated, it gives same coordinate value for all camera positions & orientations.
