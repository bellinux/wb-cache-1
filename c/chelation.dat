5|$|<b>Chelation</b> challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. <b>Chelation</b> challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether <b>chelation</b> therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after <b>chelation</b> are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single <b>chelation</b> dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chelation</b> {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of <b>chelation</b> for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. <b>Chelation</b> therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. <b>Chelation</b> therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after <b>chelation</b> is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Chelating agents {{can have}} adverse effects; for example, <b>chelation</b> therapy can lower the body's levels of {{necessary}} nutrients like zinc. Chelating agents taken orally {{can increase the}} body's absorption of lead through the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as <b>chelation</b> therapy. <b>Chelation</b> therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is {{a medical}} emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time <b>chelation</b> therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many <b>chelation</b> agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, <b>chelation</b> therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly <b>chelation</b> therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|This <b>chelation</b> is in {{contrast}} to the mechanism for formation of the over-addition product wherein collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate allows a second addition. The mechanistic conjecture on the part of Weinreb was immediately accepted by the academic community, {{but it was not until}} 2006 that it was confirmed by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses.|$|E
5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by <b>chelation</b> from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours. It {{is used to}} kill cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The <b>chelation</b> prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. <b>Chelation</b> therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP.|$|E
5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951. This treatment had to be injected but {{was one of the}} first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer. The first effective oral <b>chelation</b> agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The cysts of Azotobacter are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some <b>chelation</b> agents. The main constituents of the outer shell are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
5|$|These guanine-rich {{sequences}} may stabilize chromosome ends {{by forming}} structures of stacked sets of four-base units, {{rather than the}} usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack {{on top of each}} other, to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and <b>chelation</b> of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in <b>chelation.</b>|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that <b>chelation</b> therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chelation</b> therapy must be {{administered}} with care {{as it has}} a number of possible side effects, including death. In response to increasing use of <b>chelation</b> therapy as alternative medicine and in circumstances in which the therapy should not be used in conventional medicine, various health organizations have confirmed that medical evidence does not support the effectiveness of <b>chelation</b> therapy for any purpose other than the treatment of heavy metal poisoning. Over-the-counter <b>chelation</b> products are not approved for sale in the United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chelation</b> therapy can be {{hazardous}} if administered incorrectly. In August 2005, an incorrect form of EDTA (edetate disodium) used for <b>chelation</b> therapy resulted in hypocalcemia, causing cardiac arrest that killed a five-year-old autistic boy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chelation</b> {{is useful}} in {{applications}} such as providing nutritional supplements, in <b>chelation</b> therapy to remove toxic metals from the body, as contrast agents in MRI scanning, in manufacturing using homogeneous catalysts, in chemical water treatment {{to assist in the}} removal of metals, and in fertilizers.|$|E
25|$|Both the MDS Foundation and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network MDS Guidelines Panel have {{recommended}} that <b>chelation</b> therapy {{be considered to}} decrease iron overload in selected MDS patients. Evidence also suggests a potential value exists to iron <b>chelation</b> in patients who will undergo a stem cell transplant.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{trials in}} the MDS are ongoing with iron {{chelating}} agents {{to address the}} question of whether iron <b>chelation</b> alters the natural history of patients with MDS who are transfusion dependent. Reversal of some of the consequences of iron overload in MDS by iron <b>chelation</b> therapy have been shown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chelation</b> {{therapy is}} a medical {{procedure}} that involves the administration of chelating agents to remove heavy metals from the body. <b>Chelation</b> therapy {{has a long history}} of use in clinical toxicology and remains in use for some very specific medical treatments, although it is administered under very careful medical supervision due to various inherent risks.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the type and severity. Treatment for those with more severe disease often {{includes}} regular blood transfusions, iron <b>chelation,</b> and folic acid. Iron <b>chelation</b> may be done with deferoxamine or deferasirox. Occasionally, {{a bone marrow transplant}} may be an option. Complications may include iron overload from the transfusions with resulting heart or liver disease, infections, and osteoporosis. If the spleen becomes overly enlarged, surgical removal may be required.|$|E
25|$|Any urine {{testing for}} metals {{should be done}} before, and not after, the {{administration}} of any <b>chelation</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} require regular lifelong {{blood transfusion}} and can have complications, which may involve the spleen. Bone marrow transplants can be curative for some children. Patients receive frequent blood transfusions {{that lead to}} or potentiate iron overload. Iron <b>chelation</b> treatment is necessary to prevent damage to internal organs. Advances in iron <b>chelation</b> treatments allow patients with thalassemia major to live long lives with access to proper treatment. Popular chelators include deferoxamine and deferiprone.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{eating a}} diet low in mercury, removing mercury from medical and other devices, proper disposal of mercury, and not mining further mercury. In those with acute poisoning from inorganic mercury salts, <b>chelation</b> with either dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) appears to improve outcomes if given {{within a few}} hours of exposure. <b>Chelation</b> for those with long-term exposure is of unclear benefit. In certain communities that survive on fishing, rates of mercury poisoning among children have been as high as 1.7 per 100.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolone {{antibiotics}} induce epigenetic {{changes in}} mammalian cells through iron <b>chelation.</b> This leads to epigenetic effects through inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that require iron as a co-factor.|$|E
25|$|The current {{mainstay}} of manganism treatment is levodopa and <b>chelation</b> with EDTA. Both have limited and at best transient efficacy. Replenishing the deficit of dopamine with levodopa {{has been shown}} to initially improve extrapyramidal symptoms, but the response to treatment goes down after 2 or 3 years, with worsening condition of the same patients noted even after 10 years since last exposure to manganese. Enhanced excretion of manganese prompted by <b>chelation</b> therapy brings its blood levels down but the symptoms remain largely unchanged, raising questions about efficacy of this form of treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chelation</b> {{therapy is}} based on the {{principle}} of using chelating ligands with a high binding selectivity for a particular metal to remove that metal from the human body.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{speculation}} that heavy metal poisoning may trigger {{the symptoms of}} autism, particularly in small subsets of individuals who cannot excrete toxins effectively, some parents have turned to alternative medicine practitioners who provide detoxification treatments via <b>chelation</b> therapy. However, evidence to support this practice has been anecdotal and not rigorous. Strong epidemiological evidence refutes links between environmental triggers, in particular thiomersal containing vaccines, and the onset of autistic symptoms. No scientific data supports {{the claim that the}} mercury in the vaccine preservative thiomersal causes autism or its symptoms, and there is no scientific support for <b>chelation</b> therapy as a treatment for autism.|$|E
25|$|Many {{alternative}} therapies and interventions are available, ranging from elimination diets to <b>chelation</b> therapy. Few {{are supported by}} scientific studies. Treatment approaches lack empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Even {{if they do not}} help, conservative treatments such as changes in diet are expected to be harmless aside from their bother and cost. Dubious invasive treatments are a much more serious matter: for example, in 2005, botched <b>chelation</b> therapy killed a five-year-old boy with autism.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{blood transfusions}} {{can result in}} iron {{overload}}. The iron overload related to thalassemia may be treated by <b>chelation</b> therapy with the medications deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox. These treatments have resulted in improving life expectancy in those with thalassemia major.|$|E
25|$|P.A. Riley {{proposed}} an additional selective factor, where heavy metal <b>chelation</b> by melanin may protect peppered moths against the toxic effects of heavy metals associated with industrialisation. This selective advantage would supplement the major selective mechanism of differential bird predation.|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} {{elimination of the}} poison can be enhanced using diuresis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hyperbaric medicine, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusion or <b>chelation.</b> However, this may actually worsen the poisoning in some cases, so it should always be verified based on what substances are involved.|$|E
25|$|Chlorella, {{another popular}} microalgae, has similar {{nutrition}} to spirulina. Chlorella {{is very popular}} in Japan. It is also used as a nutritional supplement with possible effects on metabolic rate. Some allege that Chlorella can reduce mercury levels in humans (supposedly by <b>chelation</b> of the mercury to the cell wall of the organism).|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 1996, Karen Wetterhahn, a {{chemistry}} professor working at Dartmouth College, spilled {{a small amount}} of dimethylmercury on her latex glove. She began experiencing the symptoms of mercury poisoning five months later and, despite aggressive <b>chelation</b> therapy, died a few months later from brain malfunction due to mercury intoxication.|$|E
