5|$|There were {{continuing}} {{disputes with}} the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission {{was appointed to}} settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post {{he was reluctant to}} accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.|$|E

The list was classified and locked in a safe after Director Seppo Tiitinen and President Mauno Koivisto determined that {{it was based on}} vague hints instead of hard evidence. Subsequently, in 2002 the Service suspected and questioned Finnish diplomat, Alpo Rusi, of being a Stasi spy. The investigation eventually leaked to national broadcaster Yle. Rusi was however cleared of all charges in 2007 after court proceedings and won <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to his reputation suffered when the case leaked to the media.|$|E

25|$|As {{had been}} the case for {{ratification}} in 1950, the Labour government concluded in 1965 {{that there was little}} to be lost from giving in to the pressure to recognise the Court and the right of petition. In December 1965, Wilson informed the House of Commons that the right of petition would be recognised for an initial period of three years. At the time the government were concerned that the Burmah Oil Company would take advantage of the new right to contest the legality of the War Damage Act 1965 depriving the company of the right to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> caused during World War II as recognised by a House of Lords' decision, the acceptance was timed to fall outside the six-month limitation period for challenges to the Act and the United Kingdom's acceptance also explicitly stated that it applied only to claims arising after its effective date. The declarations of acceptance were deposited by Robert Boothby MP with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 14 January 1966.|$|E

2500|$|... 2003: In Papua New Guinea, the {{controversial}} Kiunga-Aiambak project, a logging operation {{disguised as a}} road project, was halted. This followed years of advocacy work by CELCOR, RFN's local partner organization, with significant financial support from RFN. The halting of the project marked an important victory for local communities and was a signal to loggers {{that they will be}} prosecuted if they do not abide by the strict logging code of the country. Subsequently, in 2011, the logging company involved in the Kiunga-Aiambak project, the Malaysian company Concord Pacific, was sentenced to pay more than US$90 million in damages to local communities who had seen their livelihoods destroyed - the first time a logging company had been sentenced to pay <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> done to the rainforest in Papua New Guinea.|$|E

40|$|On 15 January 2015 Japan {{signed and}} {{delivered}} {{the instrument of}} acceptance of the Convention on supplementary <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> nuclear <b>damage.</b> This Convention entered into force on 15 April 2015. Since {{this is an important}} instrument relating to liability and <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> caused by a nuclear accident, we are interested in the Western Balkans perspective. The majority of the 	Western Balkans countries (Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Bulgaria, Republic of Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia, and Republic of Macedonia) are part of the international regime of nuclear liability that was established with the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability <b>for</b> Nuclear <b>Damage</b> from 1963. None of them has deposited an instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval for the Convention on supplementary <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> nuclear <b>damage</b> yet. This paper will try to give argumentation why the Western Balkans should, in future, become part of this new international nuclear liability regime. The new nuclear liability regime is the path to a global regime for dealing with civil liability and <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> nuclear <b>damage</b> and, <b>for</b> what is more important, it is the way to accomplish that the citizens of both generating States and non-generating States will receive meaningful <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> nuclear <b>damage</b> promptly with a minimum of litigation and other burdens...|$|R
2500|$|The {{government}}, in asserting eminent domain, {{must pay}} the owner the {{fair market value}} of that land. If the government takes {{only part of the}} property, it must pay both the value of the land that was taken, plus any decrease in the market value of the remaining portion (called the [...] "residue"). A person who contests the value assessed for such a taking is entitled to empanel a committee of jurors to determine the fair value. A resident can also seek <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to the value of real property arising out of government activity through an action for inverse condemnation. The immunity to suit generally enjoyed by local governments does not apply to such actions, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as incorporated by the Supreme Court.|$|E

Further, he supported the intercessions of the Council to the Pope for the erection of a new convent to replace the one that had been destroyed in the bombardment. In giving his consent to this--in a brief dated July 12, 1501--the Pope announces that he does so in response to the prayers of the Council and of the duke.|$|E

For some years there must be sent out of this supply upwards of 20,000,000 tons to France as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> done to French mines, and 25,000,000 tons to France, Belgium, Italy, and Luxemburg;[43] as the former figure is a maximum, and the latter figure is to be slightly less in the earliest years, we may take the total export to Allied countries which Germany has undertaken to provide as 40,000,000 tons, leaving, on the above basis, 78,000,000 tons for her own use as against a pre-war consumption of 139,000,000 tons.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly {{it began}} to dawn upon us that the tables were turned. By degrees it came out that we had made a mistake. Dr. Polperro was really the person he {{represented}} himself to be, and had been always. His picture, we found out, was the real Maria Vanrenen, and a genuine Rembrandt, which he had merely deposited for cleaning and restoring at the suspicious dealer's. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had been imposed upon and cheated by a cunning Dutchman; his picture, though also an undoubted Rembrandt, was not the Maria, and was an inferior specimen in bad preservation. The authority we had consulted {{turned out to be}} an ignorant, self-sufficient quack. The Maria, moreover, was valued by other experts at no more than five or six thousand guineas. Charles wanted to cry off his bargain, but Dr. Polperro naturally wouldn't hear of it. The agreement was a legally binding instrument, and what passed in Charles's mind at the moment had nothing to do with the written contract. Our adversary only consented to forego the action for false imprisonment on condition that Charles inserted a printed apology in the Times, and paid him five hundred pounds <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to character. So that was the end of our well-planned attempt to arrest the swindler.|$|E
6000|$|Caleb never blamed him for this; on the contrary, he greatly {{admired him}} for his courage, seeing that {{if it had been}} found out {{he would have been a}} marked man. It was perhaps {{intelligence}} or cunning rather than courage; he did not believe that he would be found out, and he never was; he told Caleb of these things because he was sure of his man. Those who were interested in the hunt never suspected him, and as to gamekeepers, they hardly counted. He was helping them; no one hates a fox more than they do. The farmer gets <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage,</b> and the hen-wife is paid for her stolen chickens by the hunt, The keeper is required to look after the game, and at the same time to spare his chief enemy, the fox. Indeed, the keeper's state of mind with regard to foxes has always been a source of amusement to me, and by long practice I am able to talk to him on that delicate subject in a way to make him uncomfortable and self-contradictory. There are various, quite innocent questions which the student of wild life may put to a keeper about foxes which have a disturbing effect on his brain. How to expel foxes from a covert, for example; and here is another: Is it true that the fox listens for the distressed cries of a rabbit pursued by a stoat and that he will deprive the stoat of his captive? Perhaps; Yes; No, I don't think so, because one hunts by night, the other by day, he will answer, but you see that the question troubles him. One keeper, off his guard, promptly answered, [...] "I've no doubt of it; I can always bring a fox to me by imitating the cry of a rabbit hunted by a stoat." [...] But he did not say what his object was in attracting the fox.|$|E
