40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides an}} improved method for automatic <b>chick</b> <b>sexing.</b> Under regular lighting, the color intensity of down and feather of baby chicks are {{essentially the same}} {{and it is difficult}} to separate the feathers in the image. By using UV light, the optical system significantly enhanced the feathers by suppressing the downs in images. It produced clear feather signals for subsequent identification and allocation of feathers in the image. The feather image segments could be obtained through thresholding with any value from 200 to 230 on the 255 maximum intensity scale. Important features of the invention include a video camera, special lighting, an image processing system and a computer for analysis. The digital video camera captures a clear image of chick wings using selected light wavelengths including long UV wavelengths and particularly wavelengths from 250 nanometers to 450 nanometers. Special lighting architecture provides maximum illumination enhancement and feature extraction for the camera and the pattern recognition software. The digital image processing system processes signals from the camera and it makes instantaneous image analysis. The computer system hosts the digital imaging system and it executes the decisions made by the digital image processing system...|$|E

40|$|Sexually size-dimorphic species {{must show}} some {{difference}} between the sexes in growth rate and/or length of growing period. Such differences in growth parameters can cause the sexes to be impacted by environmental variability in different ways, and understanding these differences allows {{a better understanding of}} patterns in productivity between individuals and populations. We investigated differences in growth rate and diet between male and female Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks during two breeding seasons at Cape Crozier, Ross Island, Antarctica. Adélie Penguins are a slightly dimorphic species, with adult males averaging larger than adult females in mass (~ 11 %) as well as bill (~ 8 %) and flipper length (~ 3 %). We measured mass and length of flipper, bill, tibiotarsus, and foot at 5 -day intervals for 45 male and 40 female individually-marked <b>chicks.</b> <b>Chick</b> <b>sex</b> was molecularly determined from feathers. We used linear mixed effects models to estimate daily growth rate as a function of <b>chick</b> <b>sex,</b> while controlling for hatching order, brood size, year, and potential variation in breeding quality between pairs of parents. Accounting for season and hatching order, male chicks gained mass an average of 15. 6 g d - 1 faster than females. Similarly, growth in bill length was faster for males, and the calculated bill size difference at fledging was similar to that observed in adults. There was no evidence for sex-based differences in growth of other morphological features. Adélie diet at Ross Island is composed almost entirely of two species [...] one krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) and one fish (Pleuragramma antarctica), with fish having a higher caloric value. Using isotopic analyses of feather samples, we also determined that male chicks were fed a higher proportion of fish than female chicks. The related differences in provisioning and growth rates of male and female offspring provides a greater understanding {{of the ways in which}} ecological factors may impact the two sexes differently...|$|R

Most studies have reported positive HFCs, although there is a strong bias towards investigating HFCs in genetically impoverished populations. We investigated HFCs in a large genetically diverse breeding population of Kentish plovers Charadrius alexandrinus in southern Turkey. This small shorebird exhibits highly variable mating and care systems, and it is becoming an ecological model species to understand breeding system evolution. Using 11 conserved and six anonymous microsatellite markers, we tested whether and how heterozygosity was associated with chick survival, tarsus and body mass growth controlling for nongenetic effects (<b>chick</b> <b>sex,</b> hatching date, length of biparental care and site quality) that influence survival and growth. There was no genome-wide effect of heterozygosity on fitness, and we did not find any significant effects of heterozygosity on growth rates. However, two of the 11 conserved markers displayed an association with offspring survival: one marker showed a positive HFC, whereas the other marker showed a negative HFC. Heterozygosity at three further conserved loci showed significant interaction with nongenetic variables. In contrast, heterozygosity based on anonymous microsatellite loci was not associated with fitness or growth. Markers that were correlated with chick survival were not more likely to be located in exons or introns than other markers that lacked this association...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMaternal {{behavior}} {{is known to}} influence the behavioral development of young.

So, here, we explored if these factors influenced behavioral development of chicks quail when they were brooded, and what characteristics of chicks and foster females could best explain this development. We studied three sets of chick pairs brooded by foster females: unisex male, unisex female, and mixed broods. We found that both emotivity profile and sociality depended on the sex: females were more reactive and less social than males. Females’ emotivity profile was correlated with brood composition and foster female activity during maternal care. In males, only sociality was correlated with foster females’ scores of aggressive rejection. Our results evidence that male and female chicks respond differentially to maternal behavior.

40|$|International audienceNest-bound chicks depend {{entirely on}} their parents for food, often leading to high sibling competition. Asynchronous hatching, {{resulting}} from the onset of incubation before clutch completion, facilitates the establishment of within-nest hierarchy, with younger chicks being subject to lower feeding and growth rates. Because social and nutritional stresses affect baseline stress hormone levels in birds, younger chicks {{are expected to have}} higher levels of corticosterone than their siblings. As previous studies showed that hatching asynchrony magnitude influences the course of sibling competition, it should also affect baseline corticosterone. We measured baseline corticosterone at age 5 days in nestling black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) in 3 types of experimental broods: synchronous, asynchronous, and highly asynchronous. Sexual dimorphism takes place during chick-rearing and might also influence baseline corticosterone, we thus included <b>chick</b> <b>sex</b> in our analyses and also monitored chick growth and survival. Baseline corticosterone did not differ among A-chicks, but was higher in B-chicks from highly asynchronous broods compared with the other brood types, in line with the presumed increase in nutritional stress. In asynchronous broods, A-chicks had higher baseline corticosterone than their siblings, contrary to our expectations. We interpret that result as a cost of dominance among A-chicks. In line with previous studies, mass gain was negatively correlated with baseline corticosterone levels. We found that baseline corticosterone predicted survival in a sex-specific way. Regardless of hatching rank, males with higher baseline corticosterone suffered higher mortality, suggesting that males were more sensitive to high level of stress, independently of its cause...|$|R

But, relationship between feed macronutrients levels and layer-type chicks (male and female) retains little attention. However, as for all developmental stages, starter diet composition may affect layer-type chick juvenile growth {{as well as}} physiological parameters. A total of 684 Hisex Brown layer-type chicks were studied. Chicks were divided, at random, into 3 groups with equal number of males and females: control, Low-Protein Diet (LP) and High Metabolisable Energy Diet (HME). During rearing period, feed intakes were recorded and chicks were weighed individually {{at the end of}} each week. Also, sample of chicks were used to weigh liver, at hatch and at 7, 14 and 56 day-old and to collect blood for glucose, total protein and triglyceride levels determination. Results indicate that layer-type chick growth rate, liver weight and feed efficiency were in following order HME > control > LP. With regard to <b>chick</b> <b>sex,</b> male <b>chicks</b> of HME and control diets grew better than female chicks from d 7 onward. But, in LP group, the weights of male and female chicks were comparable up to 49 d-old. At 7 d post-hatch, serum total protein and triglyceride levels of control chicks were higher than those of chicks of LP group while the levels of HME group were comparable to those of the two other groups. For total protein levels this trend lasted until 56 d of age. It can be concluded that low protein level of starter diet affects negatively feed efficiency and layer-type chick juvenile growth while high level of metabolisable energy improve feed efficiency and growth rate...|$|R

One hundred and eighty (180) day-old Anak, 2000 broiler <b>chicks</b> (mixed <b>sex)</b> were randomly allotted to 3 dietary treatments containing 4 replicates of 15 chicks each. The diets consisted of a maize- based (control) diet and 2 other diets containing 20 % of either raw (RMK) or boiled mango kernel (BMK) meal {{as a replacement for}} maize. Boiling reduced the toxic factor (tannin) content of mango kernel by up to 75. 00 %. During the starter phase (0 - 28 days) birds fed the RMK- based diet ate significantly less feed, gained less weight and recorded a poorer feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the control and the BMK- based diets, but there were no significant dietary effects on these parameters during the finisher period (28 - 63 days). There were no significant dietary effects on the haematological values but serum total protein and globin were markedly reduced on the RMK fed group. From these results it is concluded that 20 % of the maize can be replaced with boiled mango kernel meal in the diet of broilers without adverse effects on growth and blood parameters...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) {{populations have}} {{declined}} across their geographic range {{during the last}} century. They were once widespread throughout the Intermountain West, but lower annual productivity, likely caused by degradation and loss of suitable habitat, has greatly reduced their distribution and population densities. Habitat used for reproduction has been well described, but relationships between habitat characteristics and reproductive output are less understood. Nesting success and chick survival are both important factors influencing annual productivity of sage-grouse. Several studies have investigated the effects of vegetation characteristics on nest success, but due to the variability of vegetation communities across the range, further work is necessary to clarify results from these studies. The relationships between habitat characteristics and chick survival are not as clearly understood. We initiated {{a study in the}} Montana Mountains of northwestern Nevada to describe nesting and early brood-rearing habitat and compare hypotheses describing potential relationships between habitat characteristics and reproductive success. 	In 2004 and 2005, we monitored 84 sage-grouse hens during the reproductive period and quantified fine-scale habitat characteristics at nest and brood sites. We quantified the vegetation structure at successful and unsuccessful nests and related individual habitat characteristics to the odds of a nest hatching successfully. Individually marked chicks were monitored for 3 weeks after hatching to measure associations of forb, grass and sagebrush cover, and food availability with chick survival. 	Grass cover beneath the nest shrub was the best predictor of nest outcome, and increasing amounts of grass cover improved the likelihood of a nest hatching successfully. Conversely, grass cover at early brood sites was negatively associated with chick survival. Early brood sites with greater forb cover were associated with higher sage-grouse chick survival. There was a weak relationship between sagebrush canopy cover at the nest shrub and hatch success, but sagebrush cover did not appear to have an effect on chick survival in the Montana Mountains. 	Finally, we examined the relative importance of maternally-influenced variables for chick survival. Total plasma protein levels (TPP) of pre-laying hens have been linked to reproductive success and may be an indication of early spring habitat quality. We evaluated the association of TPP levels with sage-grouse chick survival, and also tested chick weight and <b>chick</b> <b>sex</b> to determine if they influenced chick survival. Total plasma protein levels were a good indicator of chick survival and may indicate a relationship between early spring forb availability and chick survival. Chick survival {{did not appear to be}} related to sex or weight at capture. 	These results are similar to earlier studies that described the importance of herbaceous understory for both nest success and early brood-rearing. Management activities focusing on the restoration and maintenance of vegetation communities with intact herbaceous understories will likely improve sage-grouse reproductive success and annual production...|$|R
