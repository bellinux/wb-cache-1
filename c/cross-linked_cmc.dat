Microgels are colloidal dispersions of cross-linked gel particles with the ability to swell in response to a change of physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc.). In the last few years, microgels have been investigated due to their biocompatibility, their high water content and their use of biocompatible polymers such as proteins and polysaccharides. Moreover, their controlled drug release at the target site improves the drug efficacy and reduces side effects. The (W/W) emulsions have been formed by a dispersion of an aqueous phase into another aqueous solution. Two mutually immiscible hydrophilic polymers have been used. As other emulsions, (W/W) emulsions are no thermodynamically stable. In the present work, the phase behaviour of the system Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) – Bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures has been was studied at two different pH conditions: neutral and basic. At neutral pH, coacervates were formed and it was not possible to obtain emulsions. However, at basic pH, an immiscibility region with coexistence of the aqueous phases was detected. The respective phase diagram could be drawn and water-in-water (W/W) emulsions were prepared. The emulsion droplets were relatively stable and could be examined under the optical microscope. They presented instability by coalescence, which was reduced by decreasing pH. Emulsions behaviour, which were composed of CMC droplets neutralized with acid, was studied. CMC gels have been cross-linked with Fe 3 + ions, and capsules and beads, made of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>CMC,</b> have been obtained...|$|E

This is the first report in which sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) has been chemically treated by the cross-linking process and thus used as a hydrogel for soft-tissue augmentation through injection with thin needles. The study evaluates, from a clinical point of view, the behavior of cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel used in the aesthetic field and its side effects so as to check the safety and performance of the polymer following intradermal injections. Patients and methods: This work shows the preliminary results of an ongoing clinical study conducted between 2006 and 2009, performed on 84 healthy volunteers (62 females, 22 males) aged between 18 and 72 years, for the treatment of 168 nasolabial folds, 45 perioral wrinkles, and 39 lip volume. Results: Study results show an excellent correction of facial defects. Tolerance and aesthetic quality of the correction obtained indicate considerable safety features and absence of side effects. From a clinical point of view, hydrogel is gradually absorbed into the injection site without migration issues. Conclusion: <b>Cross-linked</b> <b>CMC</b> hydrogel proves to be an ideal agent for soft tissue augmentation with regard to safety and ease of application. It did not cause infection, extrusion, migration, or adverse reactions in the patients who have been followed for two years. Delayed aesthetic results on facial wrinkles were very satisfactory.
