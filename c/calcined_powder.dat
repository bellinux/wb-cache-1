HA derived from the precursor with CA showed a different transformation process from that without CA. It was observed that the content of CaO as an unavoidable major impurity was reduced due to the addition of CA. In the <b>calcined</b> <b>powders</b> from the CA-free precursor, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed an intense CaO peak. For the <b>calcined</b> <b>powders</b> from the CA-addition precursor, XRD analysis showed a very weak CaO peak. It was {{also found that the}} synthesized HA powders from precursor with CA were finer than those without CA. The mechanism of the influence of CA on the formation, purity and particle size distribution of HA powders was discussed...|$|R
