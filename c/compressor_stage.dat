25|$|An {{additional}} variant, the J402-CA-702, {{was developed}} internally by the company. This variant added an additional axial <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> (bringing the total to two axial stages), which increased the engine length by only 4 in (10cm), yet increased the thrust to 970lbf (4.3kN). The engine was later selected {{to power the}} MQM-107D, an improved version of the target drone. The addition of additional <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> increased the pressure ratio and overall airflow through the engine, and necessitated {{the development of a}} new turbine section. Teledyne designed and tested the new two stage axial compressor early in the J402's life (mid 1970s), but did not work on the new turbine (and subsequently the -702 variant of the engine) until nearly a decade later in the mid-1980s. The resulting engine was 45% more power than the -400/-700 variants, yet also had a 24% lower thrust specific fuel consumption (SFC).|$|E
25|$|When {{used for}} cabin pressurization, the bleed {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> at {{temperatures}} as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E

25|$|The IAI Lavi was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} multirole fighter aircraft, principally {{designed to}} conduct high-speed penetration and first-pass bombing missions {{while maintaining a}} high level of manoeuvrability and survivability. It bore considerable similarities in terms of external appearance to the American F-16 fighter, having a similar configuration and several shared design features while being a slightly smaller aircraft. The engine air intake took the form of a plain chin type scoop with a splitter plate, externally resembling that of the F-16, yet internally it was substantially different, not exposing the engine <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> forwards (inverse S-duct), thus drastically minimizing the frontal cross-sections of IR and radar alike. In comparison to the F-16, the Lavi was furnished with a less powerful engine and a consequently lower thrust-to-weight ratio.|$|E
25|$|The AJ, SF, SH and SK 37 {{models of}} the Viggen had {{the first version of}} the RM8A engine with uprated {{internal}} components from the JT8D that it was based on. Thrust was 65.6kN dry and 115.6kN with afterburner. For the JA 37, the RM8A was developed into the RM8B, achieved by adding a third low-pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> over the preceding model, increasing the turbine inlet temperature and fuel diffusion within the combustion chamber. Thrust is 72.1kN dry and 125.0kN with afterburner. Due to the increased length and weight of the RM8B engine over its predecessor, the airframe of the JA 37 was stretched in order to accommodate it. Onboard electrical power was provided by a 60 kVA generator. In the event of an in-flight engine failure, emergency power was provided by an automatically deploying ram air turbine (RAT), capable of generating 6 kVA.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s {{there was a}} need for a similar but more {{powerful}} engine {{for the next generation of}} the cruise missiles and drones. Microturbo addressed this by developing the [...] "Quadri-axial" [...] class of TRI 60 engines. They increased the air flow through the engine and added a fourth <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> (hence the name).|$|E

5000|$|In a {{gas turbine}} engine, a single turbine section {{is made up}} of a disk or hub that holds many turbine blades. That turbine section is {{connected}} to a compressor section via a shaft (or [...] "spool"), and that compressor section can either be axial or centrifugal. Air is compressed, raising the pressure and temperature, through the <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> of the engine. The temperature is then greatly increased by combustion of fuel inside the combustor, which sits between the <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> and the turbine stages. The high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gases then pass through the turbine stages. The turbine stages extract energy from this flow, lowering the pressure and temperature of the air and transfer the kinetic energy to the <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> along the spool. This process is very similar to how an axial compressor works, only in reverse.|$|R

2500|$|The J402-CA-400 was a {{single-shaft}} engine, {{with one}} axial <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> and one centrifugal <b>compressor</b> <b>stage.</b> The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then {{passed through a}} single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the [...] "wooden round" [...] requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant {{efforts were made to}} reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the parent engine) had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the engine accessories, like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the rotor shaft. Engine starting was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.|$|E
2500|$|Choke occurs {{under one}} of 2 conditions. Typically for high speed equipment, as flow {{increases}} the velocity of the flow can approach sonic speed somewhere within the <b>compressor</b> <b>stage.</b> This location may occur at the impeller inlet [...] "throat" [...] or at the vaned diffuser inlet [...] "throat". In contrast, for lower speed equipment, as flows increase, losses increase such that the pressure ratio eventually drops to 1:1. In this case, the occurrence of choke is unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 1970s, Boeing was {{considering}} designs {{for a new}} twin-engined aircraft to replace its highly successful 727. As {{the size of the}} proposed plane grew from 150 passengers towards 200, Rolls-Royce realised that the RB211 could be adapted by reducing the diameter of the fan and removing the first IP <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> to produce an engine with the necessary [...] thrust. The new version was designated RB211-535. On 31 August 1978 Eastern Airlines and British Airways announced orders for the new 757, powered by the -535. Designated RB211-535C, the engine entered service in January 1983; {{this was the first time}} that Rolls-Royce had provided a launch engine on a Boeing aircraft. Eastern Airlines president Frank Borman called the -535C [...] "The finest airline engine in the world".|$|E

50|$|The F119 {{resulted}} from the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). Detailed design of Pratt & Whitney's submission, designated internally as PW5000, began when the JAFE request for proposals (RFP) was released in May 1983. Advances in engine technology, such as those from the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, allowed the design to do more work with fewer stages, with the PW5000 having only 6 <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> compared to the F100's 10 <b>compressor</b> <b>stages.</b> The high pressure and low pressure turbines were single stage and counter-rotating, thus shortening the engine and saving weight. The fan and <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> were to use integrally bladed rotors (IBR) to reduce weight and cost and improve performance. The combustor, designated Floatwall, eliminates welds to mitigate crack growth due to thermal cycling. This technology allows the engine to achieve very high core temperatures to meet the requirement for high specific thrust for supercruising. The original RFP called for maximum thrust in the 30,000 lbf class.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} 11.25 ft long and 1.9 ft in diameter, with eight <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> {{and a single}} turbine stage. It had a {{designed}} thrust of 1,100 lbf kN and a fuel capacity of 140 gal.|$|R
2500|$|Bleed air {{produced}} by gas turbine engines is compressed air that {{is taken from}} the <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least [...] "...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations." [...] Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as [...] "customer bleed air". Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are 200–250°C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).|$|E

5000|$|During {{development}} it {{was decided}} to further improve the basic design by adding another feature then becoming common, a [...] "two spool" [...] compressor arrangement. Earlier engines generally consisted of a series of <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> connected via a shaft to one or more turbine stages, with the burners between them arranged around the shaft. Although this arrangement is mechanically simple, it has the disadvantage of lowering the efficiency of the <b>compressor.</b> <b>Compressor</b> <b>stages</b> run at their maximum efficiency when spinning at a specific speed for any given input air pressure - in a perfect <b>compressor</b> each <b>stage</b> would run at a separate speed. The multi-spool design, first used on the Bristol Olympus turbojet, is a compromise, the compressor being separated into [...] "spools" [...] designed to operate closer to most efficient speed, driven by separate turbines via concentric shafts. Two- and three-spool designs are common; beyond that the mechanical complexity is too great.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{military}} engines {{usually have}} to be able to fly very fast at sea level, the limit on HP compressor delivery temperature is reached at a fairly modest design overall pressure ratio, compared with that of a civil engine. Also the fan pressure ratio is relatively high, to achieve a medium to high specific thrust. Consequently, modern military turbofans usually have only 5 or 6 HP <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> and require only a single-stage HP turbine. Low-bypass-ratio military turbofans usually have one LP turbine stage, but higher bypass ratio engines need two stages. In theory, by adding IP <b>compressor</b> <b>stages,</b> a modern military turbofan HP compressor could be used in a civil turbofan derivative, but the core would tend to be too small for high thrust applications.|$|R

5000|$|In overspray, after a first <b>compressor</b> <b>stage,</b> {{water is}} {{injected}} into the compressor, thus increasing the mass-flow inside the compressor, increasing the turbine output power significantly and reducing compressor outlet temperatures.
