Single-crystal diffraction data were collected using MoKa X-radiation and a CCD-based detector mounted on a Bruker three-circle diffractometer. The crystals have orthorhombic symmetry, space group Pnam, and have similar unit-cell parameters: a 12. 53 – 12. 58, b 13. 01 – 13. 03, c 8. 39 – 8. 40 Å. The structures were refined to agreement indices (R) in the range 3. 7 to 7. 9 %. The structures obtained are in good general agreement with earlier studies; they contain uranyl square bipyramids and uranyl pentagonal bipyramids that share edges and corners to form sheets oriented parallel to (100). There are two symmetrically distinct Pb 2 + cations and one H 2 O group located in the interlayer.

However, the current study indicates that Pb variability in <b>curite</b> is limited, and supports minor variation in the hydroxyl content of the sheet of uranyl polyhedra as the charge-balancing mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} I discuss Foucault's two {{recently}} published courses, Se ¨ <b>curite</b> ¨, Territoire, Population and Naissance de la Biopolitique. Foucault {{notes that he}} has undertaken a genealogy of the modern state and its different apparatuses {{from the perspective of}} a history of governmental reason, taking into account society, economy, population, security, and liberty. In the ``Governmentality'' lectureöthe fourth of the first courseöFoucault says that the series of the titleöthat is, security, territory, populationöbecomes ``security, population, government''. In other words, territory is removed and government appended. And, yet, the issue of territory continually emerges only to be repeatedly marginalised, eclipsed, and underplayed. A key concern of the course is the politics of calculation which Foucault discusses through the development of political arithmetic, population statistics, and political economy. Explicitly challenging Foucault's readings of Machiavelli and the Peace of Westphalia, I argue that territorial strategies should themselves be read as calculative, with the same kinds of mechanisms brought to bear on populations applied here too. I therefore discuss how Foucault's discussions of political economy, the police, and calculation are useful in thinking the history of the concept of territory...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} impact of {{incipient}} weathering on uranium (U) migration at the surface of granitic waste rock piles from former U mines in Limousin (France) operated half a century ago. We used a multi-scale mineralogical and geochemical approach to evaluate {{the impact of}} incipient weathering on uranium mobility in a chaotic waste rock pile. The surficial part of five former mines located in the “La Crouzille” and “La Creuse” mining districts was investigated. Four groups of samples were defined based on field observations and mineralogy, granites, lamprophyres, hydrothermally altered rocks and weathering products. Petrology, mineralogy and geochemistry investigations show the importance of mineralogical and geochemical transformations during incipient weathering over a few decades. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) is successfully {{used to assess the}} weathering state of samples in the waste rock pile chaotic deposit. The mean CIA value is around 60 for unweathered/incipiently weathered granites whereas highly weathered samples have CIA around 70. This means that no significant major element loss occurs in the granitic rocks suffering incipient weathering. Various micron-size secondary U minerals consist in a large diversity of oxidized uranyl minerals (uranophane, uranyl sulfate, <b>curite,</b> autunite and other uranyl phosphates), with dominant uranyl phosphates, indicating local U mobility in the waste rock pile. Autunites micromorphology indicates different degrees of weathering of the samples in which it crystallizes. U is primarily concentrated in the clay fraction (< 2 μm), associated with secondary minerals from granite alteration (clay minerals such as smectite and vermiculite, Fe-oxides and phosphate minerals) and, to a limited extent, relict primary minerals. These weathering products contribute to U(VI) stabilization under oxidizing conditions...|$|E

Two novel Pb uranyl oxide hydrates were found, with structural formulae Pb 2 (H 2 O) [(UO 2) 10 UO 12 (OH) 6 (H 2 O) 2] and Pb 0. 5 [(UO 2) 4 O 2 (OH) 5](H 2 O) 4 (Pb-poor fourmarierite).

The stabilities of their edges differ because of the different arrangements of interstitial species. In becquerelite, the interstitial cations are arranged in rows parallel to [010], whereas in billietite and compreignacite, the interstitial cations are arranged in rows parallel to [100]. For masuyite and protasite, the stability of their edges is defined by large differences in the bond-valence deficiencies of the chains of polyhedra with left and right terminations. The stabilities of edges in <b>curite,</b> Pb 3 [(UO 2) 8 O 8 (OH) 6](H 2 O) 3, are dictated by the low bond-valence deficiencies of the chains of polyhedra parallel to [001] and [011], and by the arrangement of cations in rows parallel to [001].

Uranyl mineral basal surface microtopography, micromorphology, and composition were examined prior to, and after dissolution experiments on micrometer scale specimens using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Evolution of etch pit depth at different pH values and experimental durations can be explained using a stepwave dissolution model. Effects of the cation in solution on etch pit symmetry and morphology can be explained using an adsorption model involving specific surface sites.
