2500|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR, also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship or responsible business) {{is a form}} of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and national or international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in [...] "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law". The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance. In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers. There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak {{in the sense that they}} are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance. 'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law. The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for <b>corporate</b> <b>actions.</b> CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.|$|E

40|$|While {{corporate}} {{social responsibility}} (CSR) has garnered the attention of scholars {{over the past three}} decades, most attention has been focused on a link to financial performance. Grounded in stakeholder theory and a resource-based view of the firm considering the cospecialized intangible assets of CSR and reputation, this research explores the evolution of <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> and firm reputation over time. We draw on data from the KLD database on <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> and concerns, and on the Fortune most-admired company database {{to examine the relationship between}} corporate social behaviour and reputation over time. 	In the thesis, we argue that starting with the broad premise that any <b>corporate</b> social <b>action</b> or gesture can initially enhance corporate reputation, the firm is then both encouraged and also expected to go further. Accordingly, we propose subsequent actions are needed to meet stakeholder expectations to be able to improve or at least sustain firm reputation. We find that over the timeframe of our study that <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> do experience the predicted positive linear growth. 	Drawing on a sample of 285 major US firms and a 2002 - 2006 time frame to provide a 1425 firm year panel, we find <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> to be strongly related to corporate reputation, while the change in <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> also predicts a change in corporate reputation. We also found support for the hypothesis that <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> directed to technical stakeholders have the most significant impact on firm reputation. We do not however find the expected influence of concerns over <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> directed to institutional stakeholders on firm reputation, leading to the intriguing question: why not? 	We provide detailed illustrations with five of the sampled firms and interpret their CSR-reputation relationships. These findings expand our understanding of the effect of the change over time in <b>corporate</b> social <b>actions</b> and the ensuing effect on corporate reputation. We extend the applicability of our findings to management, discuss limitations and propose future research directions. ...|$|R
