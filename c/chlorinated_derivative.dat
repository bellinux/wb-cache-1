500|$|Sugar is {{the generic}} name for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, {{many of which}} are used in food. There are various types of sugar derived from {{different}} sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The [...] "table sugar" [...] or [...] "granulated sugar" [...] most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. Sugar is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes) and it is added to some foods and beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into the simple sugars fructose and glucose. Other disaccharides include maltose from malted grain, and lactose from milk. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol [...] may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Diet food substitutes for sugar, include aspartame and sucralose, a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivative</b> of sucrose.|$|E

Concern has grown over {{the presence of}} pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) as pollutants in aquatic systems because these chemicals are specifically designed to elicit biological effects. To fully assess {{the environmental impact of}} these pollutants, their transformations by engineered and environmental processes must be considered. The transformation of cimetidine, an antacid drug, and triclosan, an antimicrobial compound, by wastewater chlorine disinfection was studied, as well as the photochemical transformations and environmental occurrence of triclosan, its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives,</b> and their dioxin photoproducts. Cimetidine was found to react rapidly with free chlorine, indicating that it will likely undergo significant degradation during wastewater chlorination. Four major products were identified, two of which were estimated to have lower predicted no-effect concentrations than cimetidine. Reaction pathways and reaction mechanisms were proposed. The aquatic photochemistry of triclosan and three of its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> was explored. Reaction kinetics were studied, quantum yields were measured, and photoproducts were identified. Notably, dioxin photoproducts were observed to form at yields of 0. 5 to 2. 5 % from triclosan and its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives.</b> A method was developed to analyze for triclosan and its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> throughout the wastewater treatment process. A five-fold increase in the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of triclosan was observed in wastewater effluent after the chlorine disinfection step, showing this process to be a significant source or these pre-dioxins. Two sediment cores from Lake Pepin, a wastewater-impacted depositional zone of the Mississippi River, were analyzed for triclosan and the dioxin photoproducts of triclosan and its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives.</b> These dioxins were detected at levels that trended with levels of triclosan that increased over the last 45 years since its introduction in the mid- 1960 s, providing strong evidence for the photochemistry of triclosan and its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> as their source. The triclosan-derived dioxins comprised an increasing percentage of the total mass of all dioxins detected in Lake Pepin, reaching as high as 31 % in recent years...|$|R

Chlorine present in drinking water may react with bisphenol A to form <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives,</b> which have demonstrated a heightened level of estrogenic activity. In this work, we have comprehensively validated a method using on-line SPE-UPLC-MS/MS and isotope dilution quantification to measure bisphenol A and its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> in human breast milk according to accepted guidelines. Deutered bisphenol A was used as internal standard. The matrix calibration curve ranged from 0. 40 to 6. 40 ng/mL for each of the target compounds and provided good linearity (r(2) > 0. 99). This method was precise (the intra and inter-day coefficient of variation was < 20 % at two different concentrations (0. 40 and 3. 20 ng/mL) and accurate (recovery ranged from 81 % to 119 %).

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are among the}} most persistent and toxic organic micropollutants present in water and several of them are mutagenic and carcinogenic. Although {{it has been shown that}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of PAHs (Cl-PAHs) may be formed during the water chlorination procedure, little is known about their potential genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. The objectives of the present work were to prepare and characterize the major <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and fluoranthene (Fluo), to develop an analytical methodology for their quantification in water samples and to analyse their potential genotoxicity. Chlorinated standards were prepared by a newly developed two phase method (water/n-hexane) using sodium hypochlorite. 6 -Chloro-benzo[a]pyrene was selectively obtained from BaP, while 1, 3 - dichloro-fluoranthene and 3 -chloro-fluoranthene were obtained from Fluo. All products were isolated and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The formation of BaP- and Fluo-chlorinated derivatives under aqueous chlorination conditions was observed using a SPE-HPLC-FLD methodology. In addition, the cytotoxic and genotoxic activities of the three <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> were analyzed in comparison to their parent compounds, in a human-derived hepatoma cell line using the neutral red uptake and comet assays, respectively. The results showed that, at the equimolar doses of 100 and 125 μM, 6 -Cl-BaP was able to induce a significantly higher level of DNA damage than BaP, suggesting a more potent genotoxic effect. In contrast, neither Fluo nor its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> were genotoxic in the same cell line. The identification of new and possibly hazardous water chlorination by-product from PAHs emphasizes the need to minimize total organic carbon content of raw water and the implementation of safer water disinfection methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{bacterial}} {{community of}} anaerobic sludge could degrade o-chlorophenol, p-chiorophenoi, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid at concentrations {{as high as}} 100 mg/ 1. The time needed for the degradation of a given <b>chlorinated</b> phenol <b>derivative</b> increased 1. 5 - to 2 -fold upon a twofold increase in its concentration (from 50 to 100 mg/l). The duration of the adaptation period depended on the compound studied and on its concentration. The degradation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid proceeded via 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and p-chlorophenol as intermediates; the degradation of o-chlorophenol occurred {{with the formation of}} phenol. The dynamics ofp-chlorophenol degradation and chloride ion accumulation were studied. Key words: degradation, bacterial community, anaerobic sludge, <b>chlorinated</b> phenol <b>derivatives.</b> The problem of environment decontamination from stable xenobiotics, including halogenated organic compounds widely used in industry and agriculture, is currently urgent. Therefore, much attention is paid to research into the biochemistry of bacterial degradation of various halogenated xenobiotics, both aerobic [1, 2] and anaerobic [3, 4]. <b>Chlorinated</b> phenol <b>derivatives</b> are widely used in agriculture as pesticides and belong to the most stable xenobiotics. By now, sufficient data have been accumulated on the degradation of mono-, di-, and trichlorophenols by aerobic bacteria [6, 7], but only a few works have been devoted to the bacterial degradation of phenol and its <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> under anaerobic conditions [8, 9]. The latter processes deserve attention, since {{one of the most widely}} used pesticides is 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), whose degradation results in the accumulation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, p-chlorophenol (p-CP), and o-chlorophenol (o-CP) ...|$|R

Many studies have addressed health risks posed by a life-time exposure to DBPs through chlorinated drinking water or through dermal or inhalation exposure routes. Experimental studies have revealed genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of some DBPs and epidemiological studies evidenced potential associations between chlorinated drinking water and bladder or colorectal cancer. In addition, a possible link between chlorinated drinking water and reproductive/developmental effects has been hypothesized. 	Many DBPs {{have been identified in}} treated water, which justifies the growing concern about the potential health effects of emerging unregulated DBPs, some of which appear to be more genotoxic, in some assays, than the regulated DBPs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most persistent contaminants detected in environmental samples such as river sediments and tap water. Water chlorination can lead to the formation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of PAHs (Cl-PAHs) and the few available toxicological studies have shown that Cl-PAHs possess greater mutagenicity than the corresponding parent PAHs. 	The present study had two main objectives: 1) identification of the major <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and fluoranthene (Fluo) formed as chlorination by-products and 2) evaluation of their potential hazard to humans, through the characterization of their potential genotoxic effects in a human cell line. To synthesize chlorinated standards of PAHs, a newly two phase (water/n-hexane) method was developed for BaP and Fluo. 6 -Cl-BaP was obtained as the major chlorination product of BaP, and 3 -Cl-Fluo and 1, 3 -Cl 2 -Fluo of Fluo. The formation of these BaP and Fluo <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> was also observed under WTPs chlorination conditions after at 0. 5 until 24 h of exposure. The effects of equimolar concentrations of 6 -Cl-BaP vs. BaP and of 3 -Cl-Fluo/ 1, 3 -Cl 2 -Fluo vs. Fluo on cell viability and DNA integrity were assessed by the neutral red uptake (NR) and the comet assay, respectively. Exposure of HepG 2 cells to a dose-range of 6 -Cl-BaP and BaP showed that both compounds are cytotoxic above 50 µM and that, at the equimolar doses of 100 and 125 µM, 6 -Cl-BaP is able to induce a significantly higher level of DNA damage than BaP. On the other hand, no changes of cell viability were observed after exposure to several concentrations of Fluo and its derivatives. Likewise, none of the compounds was able to significantly induce DNA damage. In conclusion, the present data confirmed that <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of BaP and Fluo are formed during WTPs chlorination procedures and allowed the identification of their major <b>chlorinated</b> <b>derivatives</b> that should be further analysed in drinking water. On the other hand, the results from the comet assay evidenced a higher DNA damaging effect of Cl-BaP comparatively to its parent compound, suggestive of a more potent genotoxic effect. In spite of the negative results found for Fluo and its chorinated products, further genotoxicity studies are still needed to allow a definite conclusion. Although health risks of DBPs are small compared to health risks of waterborne diseases, the identification of hazardous Cl-PAHs in water emphasizes the need of development of new and safer water disinfection methods...|$|R
