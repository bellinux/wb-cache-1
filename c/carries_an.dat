From around 1935 the toy figures produced under the brand Elastolin, some of which show motifs from before 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier with a pigeon transport dog.

5|$|The road, {{as well as}} {{all other}} state roads in Croatia, is managed and {{maintained}} by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company. The road <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> annual average daily traffic of about 2,000 vehicles, and the traffic volume increases by up to 1,000 vehicles in summer as the road is used by tourists in the region. The southernmost portion of the road is significantly more congested as it carries Pula suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|Upon opening, the Bloor–Danforth {{line was}} well received: a survey taken {{four months later}} showed that the subway was used by 10,000 riders per hour. As a result, many bus and {{streetcar}} routes were either discontinued or shortened. Various bus and streetcar routes, which connected to the subway stations allowed the line {{to continue to grow}} and become more sustainable. The line <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> average of 519,180 passengers on weekdays during the 2011–2012 operating year.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E

5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2011, the most-traveled part of the parkway is the section north of the Southern State Parkway. This portion <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> average of 106,800 vehicles daily, with the segment between Zeckendorf Boulevard and Old Country Road serving the most at 139,500 vehicles per day. South of the Southern State Parkway, the Meadowbrook Parkway sees only {{an average of about}} 54,000 vehicles daily. The busiest part in this stretch lies between the Babylon Turnpike and the Southern State Parkway, which handles 95,600 vehicles on an average day. The section between the Ocean and Loop parkways is the least-traveled part of the Meadowbrook Parkway, as only 15,400 vehicles use the segment per day on average, although as the gateway to Jones Beach, it is busily traveled during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} in 2011 by NYSDOT, the most-traveled stretch of the Sagtikos State Parkway was the portion between the Southern State Parkway and the Long Island Expressway. The part between the Southern State and Pine Aire Drive handled an average of 87,250 vehicles per day; slightly lower numbers were recorded along the segment between Pine Aire Drive and the Long Island Expressway, with roughly 85,300 vehicles using the section on a daily basis. The portion between the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> average of 67,600 vehicles per day.

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} risk for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which {{increases the risk of}} bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE risk is thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE risk is long-term anticoagulation a common consideration. Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.|$|E

5|$|M-294 runs northward along Beadle Lake Road from I-94 at exit100 north {{through a}} {{commercial}} area. Past these businesses, the adjoining land is not developed {{for a short}} distance, and the roadway runs through some woodlands. North of the intersection with Golden Avenue, the highway passes through a residential neighborhood before terminating at M-96 (Columbia Avenue). The highway lies entirely within Emmett Township just southeast of Battle Creek. The trunkline <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> average annual daily traffic of 6,078vehicles south, and 5,728vehicles north, of Golden Avenue according to a traffic survey completed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2010.

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E

5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} <b>carries</b> <b>an</b> equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E
5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Kindt joined a backfield which {{contained}} quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee, the primary starter at halfback. That season Kindt rushed for 266 {{yards and two}} touchdowns on 61 carries. One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49–7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in the backfield. A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28–0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 <b>carries,</b> <b>an</b> average of 2.9 yards per carry during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E
