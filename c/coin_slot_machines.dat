Belarus became {{the last of the}} former Soviet republics that did not issue coins for general circulation until the July 1, 2016 revaluation of their currency. This move came with growing demand from vendors for <b>coins,</b> especially from <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> industries and those desiring a more efficient system for collecting fare money. The coins were issued in denominations of 10 and 50 tiyin (also spelt tyiyn and tyin) made of brass-plated steel, and 1, 3 and 5 som, made of nickel-plated steel. A nickel-plated steel 10 som coin was issued a year later for 2009. All coins are minted by the Kazakhstan mint in Ust-Kamenogorsk and bear some resemblance to coins of the Russian Federation in their design. There are several commemorative non circulation coins made of silver and gold, and a special collector's issue of brass 1 tyiyn coin.|$|R

This case study, in contrast, turns the tables, and emphasizes the close link between locality and musical production. The setting is that of Opuwo, a small city in northern Namibia, notorious for its bars and shebeens. Here, the music by a local band, Bullet ya Kaoko Concert Group, makes up the soundtrack to the quest for belonging and identity {{that takes place in}} the marginal space constituted by these bars and pubs, whenever people order a drink, play a game of pool, or place <b>coins</b> in the <b>slot</b> <b>machine.</b> Like these drinking places, the music and performances by Bullet ya Kaoko are characterized by the simultaneous articulation of paradoxical images and different models of identification: they use keyboards and synthesizers to reinterpret an old genre (omitandu, prase poems), fuse kwaito moves with the elders’ warrior dance, and weave Herero polyphony into a jive-like beat and structure. Lyrics, music, and dance address the challenges of (post) modern life and give voice to uncertainty and fragmentation.

50|$|Many casinos have {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} metal tokens (and <b>coins)</b> in their <b>slot</b> <b>machines,</b> in favor of paper receipts or pre-paid cards, which, while requiring heavy infrastructure costs to install, eliminate the coin handling expenses, jamming problems encountered in machines which took coins or tokens and can allow more game-specific technology {{in the space of}} a machine which would usually be dedicated to coin mechanisms. While some casinos (such as the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas) which installed the receipt system had kept the $1 tokens around for use as $1 chips, most other casinos using the receipts had simply scrapped the tokens entirely. Most casinos using receipts have automated machines at which customers may redeem receipts, eliminating the need for coin counting windows and decreasing labor costs.Casino chip collecting is a part of numismatics, more specifically as specialized exonumia collecting. This hobby has become increasingly popular with the Casino Chips & Gaming Tokens Collectors Club formed in 1988. Some collectors may value certain casino tokens up to $100,000, which are typically traded on online auction websites like eBay. Several casinos sell custom-made sets of chips and one or two decks of cards stamped with the name of the casino on them. Each set is contained in a small briefcase or box.|$|R

The sample population identified consists of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers busy playing at a specific <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> in the gaming area of the casino. Cluster sampling was used in the selection of the six South African casinos. A total of six hundred and thirty structured questionnaires were obtained through personal interviews in the gaming areas of the casinos.

A racino is a parimutuel racetrack which also offers <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gaming to its customers. Two econometric models were developed, one for <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue and one for total (<b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> plus table game) revenue at riverboats and racinos.

40|$|Abstract — In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing trend of using neural {{networks}} for the development of intelligent systems that are able to simulate pattern recognition and object identification. Physical parameters of a coin are the sole criterion that is currently being used for Coin identification by machines. As physical features can easily be easily imitated another criterion which is not based on physical features but recognises the pattern of the coin helps preventing confusion between different coins of similar physical dimensions and against forgery. The paper purposes a rotation-invariant coin identification system (RICIS) that adds the features of the physical properties like colour, radius and centre to recognize rotated coins by 5 degrees {{and at the same time}} advantages of pattern matching using a neural network and pattern averaging along with the physical features. This Rotation Invariant Coin Identification System, abbreviated as RICIS, firstly pre-processes the image, where meaningful representations of coin patterns are provided removing the background and the unnecessary data within the result images. In the second phase the coin pattern is learned when the optimized data is fed to a resilient back propagation neural network representing the coin images. RICIS has been successfully implemented as shown in this work to identify the 1, 2, 5, 10 rupee coins. This solves a real life problem where physical similarities between these <b>coins</b> led to <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> abuse. An overall 99. 4 % correct identification of coins has been achieved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{games have}} become the most popular form of {{gambling}} worldwide. In Finland, their pervasiveness in public spaces and popularity makes them {{one of the most}} common form of gaming. However, in game studies, gambling games are often regarded as borderline games due to the player’s lack of control. In this thesis I ask whether modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games can be considered as games and if so, what similarities there are between them and contemporary video games. To find out if modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games are in fact games, I compare their features with influential definitions of game and play. After this, I utilize an analysis framework derived from the method of close reading to analyze a popular Finnish video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game Emma. The comparison between modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games and the various definitions of game and play reveals that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games fit very well into these definitions, and thus they can be considered as games. This notion enables them to be analyzed with game analysis methods. The analysis showed that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games feature many elements that are commonly found in traditional video games, such as contextual aesthetics, narratives, interaction, as well as some form of player control via choices. Research regarding <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games as games is scarce despite their many intriguing elements that cross disciplinary borders. Modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games have evolved into a form of complex digital entertainment, which calls for open-minded collaboration of game studies and gambling studies in particular, but many other disciplines as well...|$|R
