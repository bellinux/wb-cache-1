40|$|Abandonment {{is a key}} {{indicator}} of performance and a driver of service level in a call center. Calls that abandon affect the wait times of the remaining calls in the queue {{and the ability of}} call center resources to service the remaining calls. This interaction is further complicated when the call center has multiple arri-val <b>channels,</b> <b>handled</b> by two groups of resources with a shared pool of resources between them. In this case, a valid call center model necessitates a highly accurate method for modeling abandonment. This paper documents a unique application of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to model call center abandon-ment in a discrete event simulation model. The paper also demonstrates the benefits of using Kaplan-Meier verses another approach. ...|$|R

Methods Gem-deficient mice were generated and their metabolic phenotype characterised by in vivo testing of glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance and insulin secretion. Calcium flux was measured in isolated islets. Results Gem-deficient mice were glucose intolerant and had impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, the islets of Gem-deficient mice exhibited decreased free calcium responses to glucose and the calcium oscillations seen upon glucose stimulation were smaller in amplitude and had a reduced frequency. Conclusions These results suggest that Gem plays an important role in normal beta-cell function by regulation of calcium signalling...|$|R
