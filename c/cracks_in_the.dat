5|$|In June 2009, the National Trust {{announced}} plans to reclad the monument {{at a cost of}} £4 million. The painted fence was replaced by an open wire fence in 2010, aiding visibility, but still denying public access {{to the base of the}} monument. Survey work in 2010 showed the extent of <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stonework. In 2013 it was announced that further funding would be needed for the restoration project. Sensors recording the movement of the tower are also to be installed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terrace {{supporting the}} Memorial Gardens, {{and they were}} {{closed to the public}} as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floors.|$|E

5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E
5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as the <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe close. The Doctor has to stay outside this new universe in order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{tooth root}} is {{probably}} the least desirable problem in gear unit operation; it often leads to failure. Signals produced by a gear with a <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tooth root, produced through real operating conditions, and signals caused by a faultless gear are used for the analysis. By monitoring vibrations {{it is possible to}} detect the presence of a crack. A fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tooth root brings about significant changes in tooth stiffness. Other faults are usually linked with modifications of other dynamic parameters. Time Frequency Analysis tools, e. g. Wavelets Analyses, are used to analyse a non-stationary signal. The wavelet transform is chosen for the analysis. The wavelet function similar to the dynamic reaction of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tooth root is selected. By means of the methods and <b>the</b> analysis presented <b>in</b> this paper, <b>the</b> reliability of determining modifications in signal vibrations is improved...|$|R

5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{cooperation}} between Poland and Lithuania {{after the death}} of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, {{with the support of the}} Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in the <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, two trams were {{involved}} in an accident and sent to Firema for reparations. However, the company filed for bankruptcy, and as of October 2010 the trams were still not repaired or returned to Oslo. In 2010, Commissioner for Environmental Affairs and Transport Jøran Kallmyr (Progress Party) stated that the SL95 trams were being considered for replacement, {{at the same time}} as the much older SL79. Problems with the units included excessive noise, excessive amount of time out of order, rust, <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> axles, and increased wear to the infrastructure because they weighed too much. All except two of the SL95 trams were temporarily grounded on 29 April 2013 when it was discovered that rust had damaged the joints between the articulated sections on several trams.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, {{three months}} after the work was {{originally}} scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on £31million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work is due to be completed in 2015. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, it was later decided that the West Stand would be demolished and eventually replaced.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Nvidia {{launched}} the GTX Titan, a consumer graphics card {{that uses the}} same GPU die as the K20X GPUs in Titan. Titan underwent acceptance testing in early 2013 but only completed 92% of the tests, short of the required 95%. The problem was discovered to be excess gold in the female edge connectors of the motherboards' PCIe slots causing <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> motherboards' solder. The cost of repair was borne by Cray and between 12 and 16 cabinets were repaired each week. Throughout the repairs users were given access to the available CPUs. On March 11, they gained access to 8,972 GPUs. ORNL announced on April 8 that the repairs were complete and acceptance test completion was announced on June 11, 2013.|$|E

5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between the <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins {{was in the}} latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually {{at the hands of}} narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
