500|$|Composting, the {{purposeful}} biodegradation {{of organic}} matter by microorganisms, [...] {{is among the most}} simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill. Since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost, the process can be undertaken at home with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process. Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract vermin. The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity {{in the case of a}} <b>compost</b> <b>bin)</b> and the method of composting. Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with other (non-biodegradable) materials, food waste decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases. Similarly to compost created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see uses of compost).|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the species}} most often used for {{composting}} is the red wiggler or tiger worm (Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei); Lumbritttumphyylus (a.k.a. red earthworm or dilong (China)) is another breed of worm that can be used, {{but it does not}} adapt as well to the shallow <b>compost</b> <b>bin</b> as does Eisenia fetida. European nightcrawlers (Eisenia hortensis) may also be used. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, and Belgian nightcrawlers. [...] African Nightcrawlers (Eudrilus eugeniae) are another set of popular composters. Lumbricus terrestris (a.k.a. Canadian nightcrawlers (US) or common earthworm (UK)) are not recommended, as they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate.|$|E

50|$|Under low oxygen {{conditions}} biodegradable plastics {{break down}} slower {{and with the}} production of methane, like other organic materials do. The breakdown process is accelerated in a dedicated compost heap. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home <b>compost</b> <b>bin,</b> while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures. Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone.

30|$|The {{experimental}} design consisted of 15 transparent laboratory scale <b>composting</b> <b>bins</b> of about 20  cm ×  40  cm in size, with lids. The sides and lids of the composters were perforated for aeration purposes. Each of the <b>composting</b> <b>bins</b> contained 1.5  kg of top soil, 300  g {{of crude oil}} sludge and 180  g of bark chips. Different proportions of soybean meal and horse manure were then added to different composters. Accordingly, 1  kg of soybean meal {{was added to the}} first five sets of composters; 500  g of soybean meal and 500  g of horse manure to the next five sets and 1  kg of horse manure to the last five sets. In addition, anionic and non-ionic surfactants were added to the compost matrix at different concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 %.

5000|$|Task Review: Phoenix {{came up with}} {{designs for}} a {{tabletop}} <b>compost</b> <b>bin</b> {{and a set of}} dish-washing gloves, and went for the former, especially when concerns were raised on the gloves after Adam gave misleading information on their popularity. The team faced problems with their pitches, with Duane being forced to step in and rescue their first one after Stephen was poorly received, yet managed to secure orders from both companies. Meanwhile, Sterling came up with designs for a bathtub splash guard and a tap cozy, and went with the former idea after raising concerns on the ease of creating the cozy. Like the men, they also had issues with their pitches; in particular Laura proved to be bad, while the team received strong criticism for incorrect costing and Jane's bizarre attempt sell them one million units. In the end, the women only got orders from Amazon, yet despite it being larger than the men's, it could do nothing to prevent them losing the task.|$|E
