40|$|High activity, carbon {{supported}} Pt electrocatalysts were synthesized using a {{supercritical fluid}} method and a selective heterogeneous nucleation reaction to disperse Pt onto single walled carbon nanotube and carbon fiber supports. These nanocomposite materials were then incorporated into catalyst and gas diffusion layers consisting of polyelectrolytes, i. e., Nafion, polyaniline, and polyethyleneimine using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly techniques. Due to the ultrathin nature and excellent homogeneity characteristics of LBL materials, the LBL nanocomposite catalyst layers (LNCLs) yielded much higher Pt utilizations, 3, 198 mW <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> − 1, than membrane electrode assemblies produced using conventional methods (∼ 800 [*]mW <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> − 1).

Due to the strong coupling between the C- 2 p and metal 5 d orbitals, pre- adsorption of CO molecules on the <b>Pt</b> <b>l</b> Au m {{is found to be}} very effective in not only reducing the activation energy, but also preventing poisoning by sulfur. As result of the coupling, the metal 5 d band is broadened and down-shifted, and charge is transferred from the CO molecules to the <b>Pt</b> <b>l</b> Au m. As SO 2 is adsorbed on the catalyst, partial charge moves to the anti-σ bonding orbitals between S and O in SO 2, weakening the S–O bond strength. This effect is enhanced by pre-adsorbing up to three CO molecules, therefore the S–O bonds become vulnerable. Our results revealed the mechanism of the excellent catalytic properties of the bimetallic complex catalysts. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} the facultative metallophyte plants, Medicago sativa (M. sativa) and Brassica juncea (B. juncea) to {{accumulate}} and translocate platinum (Pt) from aqueous substrates is reported. The influence of Pt concentration in the substrate (5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 ppm), exposure time (24, 48 and 72 h) and substrate pH (2, 3, 5, 7 and 9) was determined. In both plants the concentration of Pt increased with substrate concentration and exposure time. Greater accumulation was detected in the roots of M. sativa than B. juncea, up {{to a maximum of}} 94. 19 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> g− 1 (dry biomass) compared with 38. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> g− 1 (dry biomass) following exposure to 80 ppm Pt after 72 h exposure, respectively. However, at lower substrate concentrations (5 and 20 ppm) greater quantities of Pt were detected in the shoots of B. juncea, ranging between 0. 02 and 0. 32 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> g− 1 (dry biomass) at 5 ppm across the different time intervals studied, compared with 0. 02 − 0. 14 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> g− 1 (dry biomass) for M. sativa, suggesting B. juncea to be a better translocator of Pt under idealised conditions at low concentrations. Higher Pt uptake was also observed in acidic media, with a maximum at pH 2 for M. sativa and pH 3 for B. juncea, indicating the role of net surface charge on the bioaccumulation of Pt. Once sequestered Pt(II) was reduced to Pt(0) due to the action of local metabolites. TEM images of M. sativa root samples showed the in vivo formation of Pt nanoparticles between 3 and 100 nm in size and of varying morphologies in the epidermal root cells. In vivo Pt distribution profiles were assessed using proton induced X-ray emission (μ-PIXE) spectroscopy, which showed even distribution across all tissue systems (epidermal, cortical and vascular) within the roots of both M. sativa and B. juncea. © 2010, Springer.

40|$|Improving oxygen {{reduction}} in {{microbial fuel cell}} (MFC) cathodes requires {{a better understanding of}} the effects of the catalyst binder chemistry and properties on performance. A series of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) polymers with systematically varying hydrophilicity were designed to determine the effect of the hydrophilic character of the binder on cathode performance. Increasing the hydrophilicity of the PS-b-PEO binders enhanced the electrochemical response of the cathode and MFC power density by ∼ 15 %, compared to the hydrophobic PS-OH binder. Increased cathode performance was likely a result of greater water uptake by the hydrophilic binder, which would increase the accessible surface area for oxygen reduction. Based on these results and due to the high cost of PS-b-PEO, the performance of an inexpensive hydrophilic neutral polymer, poly(bisphenol A-co-epichlorohydrin) (BAEH), was examined in MFCs and compared to a hydrophilic sulfonated binder (Nafion). MFCs with BAEH-based cathodes with two different Pt loadings initially (after 2 cycles) had lower MFC performance (1360 and 630 mW m- 2 for 0. 5 and 0. 05 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> cm- 2) than Nafion cathodes (1980 and 1080 mW m - 2 for 0. 5 and 0. 05 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> cm- 2). However, after long-term operation (22 cycles, 40 days), power production of each cell was similar (∼ 1200 and 700 - 800 mW m- 2 for 0. 5 and 0. 05 <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> cm- 2) likely due to cathode biofouling that could not be completely reversed through physical cleaning. While binder chemistry could improve initial electrochemical cathode performance, binder materials had less impact on overall long-term MFC performance. This observation suggests that long-term operation of MFCs will require better methods to avoid cathode biofouling. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

The replica Pt-C composite was synthesized inside of the ordered mesopores (2. 7 nm) of Al-MCM- 41 followed by removal of the template. The contact between the Pt nanoparticle and C was experimentally observed by high-energy resolution <b>Pt</b> <b>L</b> 2 -edge XANES spectra tuned to 11065. 7 eV, at a lower energy by 5 eV than the <b>Pt</b> <b>L</b> 1 peak top for the replica Pt-C pressed to electrolyte polymer (Nafion).

Herein, we provide a geometric analysis of M 2 nLn complexes, and we discuss how size and geometry of the ligand is expected to influence the self-assembly process. The theoretical analysis is complemented by experimental studies using different cis-blocked Pt-II complexes and metalloligands with four divergent pyridyl groups.

Pt/SG also demonstrates unprecedented stability, maintaining 87 % of its electrochemically active surface area following accelerated degradation testing. Furthermore, a majority of ORR activity is maintained, providing 108 mA <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> - 1, a remarkable 171 % improvement over Pt/C (39. 8 mA mgPt - 1) and an 89 % improvement over Pt/G (57. 0 mA <b>mg</b> <b>Pt</b> - 1). Computational simulations highlight that the interactions between Pt and graphene are enhanced significantly by sulfur doping, leading to a tethering effect that can explain the outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, sulfur dopants result in a downshift of the platinum d-band center, explaining the excellent ORR activity and rendering SG as a new and highly promising class of catalyst supports for electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells.

A purpose-built thin-layer cell {{was used in the}} transmission mode and spectra were recorded for the electrode at controlled potentials in the range 0. 10 - 1. 20 V/SCE. Changes in the near-edge spectra (XANES) and in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) are reported and discussed in terms of the structural nature of the surface oxidation process...|$|R
