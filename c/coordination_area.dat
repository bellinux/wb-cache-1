In [14], the authors propose a user {{partition}} method based on user locations, and determine an inter-cluster <b>coordination</b> <b>area</b> by a predefined coordination distance. However, this distance parameter based user partition could be a hard decision for a real implementation. In addition, the effect of shadow fading on the users is ignored. In [28, 29], the user partition is instead based on the long term channel gain, which is more suitable for a practical use. Since the clusters are overlapping in [28, 29], the partition is performed from a cell-specific point of view, where users in each cell are divided into cell-center users and cell-edge users. In this article, we propose a cluster-specific user partition approach based on the long term channel gain, which is defined as follows.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh Speed-Single Frequency Network (HS-SFN) {{is one of}} the {{possible}} multipoint transmission techniques proposed in the 3 GPP standard for High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in order to improve network performance, especially at the cell edge. It allows neighboring cells to transmit simultaneously the same data stream to a User Equipment (UE) in the Handover region (HO). In order to evaluate the user-level performance of this technique, we develop a method based on network simulation coupled with Markov chain analysis. It shows that when the HS-SFN technique is performed in the HO region between adjacent cells, the user data rates increase significantly. However, this is true only when involved cells are partially loaded, which is not always the case. We thus propose an optimized approach that adapts the <b>coordination</b> <b>area</b> based on the average offered traffic observed in the network.

40|$|A {{clustered}} {{base transceiver station}} (BTS) coordination {{strategy is}} proposed for a large cellular MIMO network, which includes full intra-cluster coordination to enhance the sum rate and limited inter-cluster coordination to reduce interference for the cluster edge users. Multi-cell block diagonalization is used to coordinate the transmissions across multiple BTSs in the same cluster. To satisfy per-BTS power constraints, three combined precoder and power allocation algorithms are proposed with different performance and complexity tradeoffs. For inter-cluster coordination, the <b>coordination</b> <b>area</b> is chosen to balance fairness for edge users and the achievable sum rate. It is shown that a small cluster size (about 7 cells) is sufficient to obtain most of the sum rate benefits from clustered coordination while greatly relieving channel feedback requirement. Simulations show that the proposed coordination strategy efficiently reduces interference and provides a considerable sum rate gain for cellular MIMO networks.

Beginning this year, Orbital was classified by the Chemistry <b>Coordination</b> <b>Area</b> on the B 5 rank of CAPES Qualis (Brazil) and, leveled as B 4 by Coordination Areas of Materials and Engineering II.

40|$|Next {{generation}} cellular networks {{will have}} to leverage large cell densifications to accomplish the ambitious goals for aggregate multi-user sum rates, for which CRAN architecture is a favored network design. This shifts the attention back to applicable resource allocation (RA), which need to be applicable for very short radio frames, large and dense sets of radio heads, and large user populations in the <b>coordination</b> <b>area.</b> So far, mainly CSI-based RA schemes have been proposed for this task. However, they have considerable complexity and also incur a significant CSI acquisition overhead on the system. In this paper, we study an alternative approach which promises lower complexity with also a lower overhead. We propose to base the RA in multi-antenna CRAN systems on the position information of user terminals only. We use Random Forests as supervised machine learning approach to determine the multi-user RAs. This likely leads to lower overhead costs, as the acquisition of position information requires less radio resources {{in comparison to the}} acquisition of instantaneous CSI. The results show the following findings: I) In general, learning-based RA schemes can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to CSI-based scheme; II) If taking the system overhead into account, learning-based RA scheme utilizing position information outperform legacy CSI-based scheme by up to 100 %; III) Despite their dependency on the training data, Random Forests based RA scheme is robust against position inaccuracies and changes in the propagation scenario; IV) The most important factor influencing the performance of learning-based RA scheme is the antenna orientation, for which we present three approaches that restore most of the original performance results. To the best of our knowledge, these insights are new and indicate a novel as well as promising approach to master the complexity in future cellular networks...|$|E

The syllables in the input were phonotactically legal combinations but non-existent in the Dutch language, allowing us to assess their role in novel word decoding. Not only trained disyllabic pseudowords were tested but also pseudowords with recombined patterns of syllables to uncover the emergence of syllabic representations. We showed that with extensive training, articulation became faster and more accurate for the trained pseudowords. On the neural level, the initial stage of decoding was reflected by increased activity in visual attention areas of occipito-temporal and occipito-parietal cortices, and in motor <b>coordination</b> <b>areas</b> of the precentral gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus.
