50|$|Three-terminal {{devices such}} as {{transistors}} and FETs also use {{a connection to the}} control terminal of the device being tested such as the Base or Gate terminal. For transistors and other current based devices, the base or other <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>current</b> is stepped. For field effect transistors, a stepped voltage is used instead. By sweeping the voltage through the configured range of main terminal voltages, for each voltage step of the control signal, a group of V-I curves is generated automatically. This group of curves makes it very easy to determine the gain of a transistor, or the trigger voltage of a thyristor or TRIAC.|$|R
50|$|A benistor is a {{controllable}} electron valve capable to independently {{manage the}} amount of voltage and current between generator and load in an electrical circuit. The benistor is able to modulate the value of {{any or all of}} following parameters delivered to a load: maximum voltage, effective voltage, average voltage, maximum current, effective current, or average current. The benistor achieves this modulation by means of several voltage and <b>current</b> <b>control</b> <b>terminals.</b> The benistor’s capability to operate in linear, switching, or self-switching mode of operation, controlling the voltage amount on the vertical axis and the current amount on the horizontal axis (see oscilloscope waveforms), makes it an extremely versatile control device for power management applications, especially for circuits involving non-linear loads, such as LED (Light Emitting Diode) power converters (drivers).|$|R
