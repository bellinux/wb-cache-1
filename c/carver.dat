40|$|Raymond <b>Carver???s</b> {{short fiction}} {{contains}} fascinating parallels to his life. <b>Carver???s</b> childhood was inexorably {{shaped by the}} actions of his parents, especially his father, and these actions continued to influence him in adulthood, as he repeated many of the decisions of his father while experiencing the firsthand challenges and difficulties of fatherhood. This thesis explores how <b>Carver???s</b> fiction was dramatically shaped by these experiences and claims that <b>Carver???s</b> writing acted as a sort of catharsis, allowing him {{to come to terms with}} confusing feelings of hopelessness, disillusion, and powerlessness...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of English. Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 57 - 60). "May 2006. "A {{majority of}} critics examine Raymond <b>Carver’s</b> fiction {{in terms of}} minimalism, but in this thesis, I highlight the themes in <b>Carver’s</b> work rather than emphasize the format. Many women in <b>Carver’s</b> work contrast the futility of their male counterparts by showing a determination {{to move on with}} their lives. By looking at each of <b>Carver’s</b> major collections of short stories, one may find a progression in the way women react to the hopeless situations in their lives. <b>Carver’s</b> early stories, found in "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?", show women who are capable of handling situations, yet unproductive in finding true autonomy. Later stories in "Cathedral" and "Where I’m Calling From" find women working with men and eventually finding their own independence - a characteristic that begins to develop in <b>Carver’s</b> second collection, "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"...|$|R

50|$|The oldest {{stones in}} the {{cemetery}} have been positively identified as the works of two well-known itinerant funerary <b>carvers,</b> Joseph and Elijah Sikes, {{a father and son}} who were active in the region through about 1820.

Stones carved in the mid-19th century, after Elijah's departure from the region, bear stylistically resemblance to his work, indicating that subsequent <b>carvers,</b> including Elijah Phelps, were influenced by his work. Several stones have been attributed in groups to other unnamed <b>carvers.</b>|$|R
