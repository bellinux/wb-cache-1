40|$|Objectives: The attentional <b>control</b> <b>scale</b> is a self- report {{questionnaire}} that assesses {{individual differences in}} attentional control. Despite its extensive use, {{the psychometric properties of}} the Persian version of the ACS are not well understood. Thus, the present study aimed at investigating the psychometric properties of the attentional <b>control</b> <b>scale</b> and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression in Iranian population. Method: Using quota sampling, we asked a community sample of 524 to respond to Attentional <b>Control</b> <b>Scale,</b> mindfulness, emotion regulation, social anxiety, depression, generalized anxiety, worry, and rumination. SPSS (Version 23) was used for data analysis. Results : Exploratory factor analysis yielded 2 factors of focusing and shifting, which accounted for 30. 93 % of the total variance. The results of convergent validity revealed that reappraisal, as an emotion regulation strategy and mindfulness facets, had a positive relationship with focusing, shifting, and the total score of the attentional <b>control</b> <b>scale.</b> Furthermore, worry, rumination, depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms all had negative relationships with focusing, rumination, and the total score of the attentional <b>control</b> <b>scale.</b> In addition, the results of incremental validity revealed that focusing, not shifting, uniquely predicted depression and generalized anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, both focusing and shifting uniquely predicted social anxiety symptoms. Test- retest reliability of focusing and shifting was 0. 80 and 0. 76, respectively. Conclusions : Attentional <b>control</b> <b>scale</b> has been demonstrated to have acceptable validity and reliability in Iranian population. However, further studies are needed to evaluate other aspects of the ACS like CFA.   </p...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to normalize and measure the internal and external validity and reliability of emotion control test. Methods: This standardization study was carried out on a statistical society, including all pupils, students, teachers, nurses and university professors in Kermanshah in 2012, using Williams’ emotion <b>control</b> <b>scale.</b> The subjects included 1, 500 (810 females and 690 males) people who were selected by stratified random sampling. Williams (1997) emotion <b>control</b> <b>scale,</b> was used to collect the required data. Emotional <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> is a tool for measuring the degree of control people have over their emotions. This scale has four subscales, including anger, depressed mood, anxiety and positive affect. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS software using correlation and Cronbach's alpha tests. Results: The results of internal consistency of the questionnaire reported by Cronbach's alpha indicated an acceptable internal consistency for emotional <b>control</b> <b>scale,</b> and the correlation between the subscales of the test and between the items of the questionnaire was significant at 0. 01 confidence level.

30|$|Two {{scales of}} this {{questionnaire}} were used: the Warmth/Affection Scale (Rohner, Saavedra, & Granum, 1978) and the Parental <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> (Rohner, 1989; Rohner & Khaleque, 2003). The PARQ/Control, with its warmth/affection and <b>control</b> <b>scales,</b> assesses individual perceptions {{of warmth and}} parental control among children aged 7  years and over and adolescents. The warmth/affection and <b>control</b> <b>scales</b> consist of 20 and 13 items, respectively, to be assessed on a Likert scale of four possible answers: “Almost always true”, “Sometimes true”, “Rarely true”, “Almost never true”. Each item must be answered separately for the maternal and paternal relationships, to differentiate the results obtained for {{the mother and father}} (or guardians). The warmth/affection scale evaluates adolescents’ perceptions of the love and affection received from their parents (or guardians): acceptance of their personality, interest in their activities and well-being, enjoying free time together, ability to comfort, console, praise, embrace or express their love through words and actions. The parental <b>control</b> <b>scale,</b> on the other hand, evaluates adolescents’ perceptions of the behavioural control (permissiveness or strict control) exercised by their parents or guardians. The vast majority of the questionnaire items refer to the behaviour of parents, rather than their attitudes, to avoid possible difficulties in accounting for the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. The Cronbach’s alpha scores for these two scales were satisfactory, at 0.94 for warmth/affection and 0.86 for parental control.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the scales}} {{reviewed}} by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> or the Depression Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health locus of control {{in a number of}} fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as breast self-examination, weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.|$|R
40|$|Background The {{concept of}} {{perceived}} control {{is central to}} many theories of physical and emotional well-being. However, existing measures are lengthy and generally focus on job control. In epidemiological research, brief measures and those which can be applied across entire populations are needed.

Thus, we evaluated the six-item Life <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> (Bobak, Soc Sci Med. 47 : 269 – 79, 1998) with a population-based sample of middle-aged women.

40|$|The term emetophobia (i. e., {{a fear of}} vomiting) {{exists as}} rather an elusive predicament, often eluding {{conventional}} treatment. The present study involved 149 participants, consisting of 51 emetophobics, 48 phobic controls (i. e. those who suffered from a different phobia), and 50 nonphobic controls. Participants were administered the Rotter (1966) Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Health Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> by B. S. Wallston, Wallston, Kaplan, and Maides (1976). Significant differences were found among the three groups; specifically, that emetophobics had a significantly higher internal Locus of <b>Control</b> <b>Scale</b> score with regard to both general and health-related issues than did the two control groups. It is suggested that vomiting phobics may have a fear of losing control, and that their vomiting phobia is reflective of this alternative, underlying problem.
