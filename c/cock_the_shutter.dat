5000|$|The Zorki 4 came in 2 {{variants}} {{the original}} {{which uses a}} thumb wheel to advance to film and <b>cock</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> The Zorki 4k included a wind lever for easier operation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{routine for}} taking a {{photograph}} with a Stereo Realist is elaborate, compared to a modern camera. One must lift the lens cover, focus, manually set the aperture and shutter speed, <b>cock</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and then take the picture. The wind release button must be depressed briefly while beginning to wind the film to the next frame. [...] The film winding is then completed so that the camera is ready to shoot another pair of images.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} Soviet-era rangefinders, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed {{selector}} rotates when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is released, {{and should not}} be changed until after <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> has been <b>cocked.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed is changed without <b>cocking</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> first, <b>the</b> setting pin can be broken when the film is advanced.|$|R
50|$|The cameras however, {{still have}} a number of quirks that no simple {{servicing}} will remove. The most notable quirk is that <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed on some of the original Kiev 88 cameras should only be changed after <b>cocking</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> (spring-loading <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> mechanism and advancing the film). Changing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed on an un-cocked camera will damage the timing mechanism, so it is recommended that Kiev users get into the habit of always <b>cocking</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> after taking a photo. This is not a problem with the Kiev 60 and Kiev 88CM variants. There are also mixed reports that <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed dial should be turned only clock-wise, never anti-clock-wise. This is certainly known to be an issue with cameras modified by Hartblei to add a mirror lock-up (MLU) feature. Other cameras {{may or may not have}} this problem.|$|R
50|$|To {{take the}} photograph, the {{photographer}} pulls back the ground glass and slides the film holder into its place. <b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> is then closed and <b>cocked,</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed and aperture set. The photographer removes the darkslide {{that covers the}} sheet of film in the film holder, and triggers <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> to make <b>the</b> exposure. Finally, the photographer replaces the darkslide and removes the film holder with the exposed film.|$|R
50|$|The Fed 2 has {{a curtain}} shutter with speeds from B, 1/25-1/500s. After {{detaching}} the back, two screws on under the camera {{allow you to}} adjust the spring tension and change the shutter speeds, which may have become slow over time.As with similar cameras, it's important to <b>cock</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> before operating the shutter speed dial. Failing to do so may harm the mechanism. When firing, this dial will rotate. After re-cocking, the speed set will be indicated correctly again.|$|E

50|$|The {{release of}} the Rolleiflex Automat {{in the middle of}} June 1937 marked another {{significant}} milestone for Franke & Heidecke. Prior to this, after taking a picture, two separate steps were required to advance the film and <b>cock</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> The Rolleiflex Automat combined the two, whereby advancing the film automatically cocked the shutter. Not only did this innovation speed up the whole process, it also eliminated accidental double exposures resulting from inadvertently forgetting to wind on the film. It also had a film-feeler mechanism that automatically started the counter, so no red window was needed.|$|E

50|$|This {{was perhaps}} the most evolved of the TLR variants. Like several of the earlier {{versions}} it did feature a built in light meter. Settings to <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed and aperture had to be made manually but it did allow the camera to be used without an additional handheld meter.This model also allowed the simple conversion form 120 roll film to 220 roll film. Another advantage to this model was <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and film advance were controlled by the film advance handle. Earlier models had a separate mechanism for <b>cocking</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> This system was prone to inadvertent double exposures.|$|R
50|$|The lowest-end point-and-shoot film {{cameras are}} similar to {{disposable}} cameras, but can be reloaded. These cameras have focus-free lenses, with fixed apertures. They {{may or may not}} have a light meter. Most have a wheel or lever for advancing <b>the</b> film and <b>cocking</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> and a crank for returning the film to the canister for unloading. Because of the fixed apertures, models with flash have no way of controlling the exposure from the flash. Therefore, flash pictures have to be taken within a narrow range of distance from the subject.|$|R
5000|$|The Speed Graphic {{was a slow}} camera. Setting {{the focal}} plane shutter speed {{required}} selecting both a slit width and a spring tension. Each exposure required the photographer to change the film holder, open the lens shutter, cock the focal plane shutter, remove the dark slide from the inserted film holder, focus the camera, [...] and release the focal plane shutter. Conversely, if the lens shutter were used, the focal plane shutter (on the Speed Graphic and Pacemaker Graphic models with both shutters) had to be opened prior to cocking using the [...] "T" [...] or TIME setting, and then releasing the shutter in the lens. If indoors, the photographer also had to change the flashbulb. Each film holder contained one or two pieces of sheet film {{which had to be}} loaded into the film holder in complete darkness. Faster shooting could be achieved with the Grafmatic film holder, which is a six sheet film [...] "changer" [...] that holds each sheet in a septum. [...] Even faster exposures could be taken if the photographer was shooting film packs of 12 exposures, or later 16 exposures (discontinued in the late 1970s). With film packs one could shoot as fast as one could pull the tab and <b>cock</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> and film packs could be loaded in daylight. A roll film adapter that used 120 or 220 film was available for 2.25 x 3.25, 3.25 x 4.25 and 4 x 5 inch cameras that permitted 8 to 20 exposures per roll, depending on the model of the adapter. Photographers had to be conservative and anticipate when the action was about to take place to take the right picture. The cry, [...] "Just one more!" [...] if a shot was missed was common. President Harry Truman introduced the White House photographers as the [...] "Just One More Club." ...|$|E
50|$|When using most Zorki cameras, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed {{should only}} be set after <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> has been <b>cocked.</b> Setting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed before <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is <b>cocked</b> can {{permanently}} damage the camera. This especially affects all Zorki cameras with slow shutter speeds under 1/30 of a second, in particular the Zorki-3 and Zorki-4.|$|R
50|$|To load a film, two locks in {{the base}} of the camera need to be turned. The entire back and bottom can then be removed as a single unit, {{allowing}} easy access to the film chamber. Standard 35 mm film cassettes are used, with film being wound onto a removable take-up spool (the latter often becomes difficult to remove on older cameras). Winding <b>the</b> film <b>cocks</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and forwards <b>the</b> frame counter simultaneously. The FED 2 has a manual frame counter located below the wind-on knob, which must be reset by hand when loading film.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in late 1985, the Super was {{identical}} in basic {{shape and size}} to the previous model and accepted the same lenses. Many improvements and changes were included to make this model arguably a better camera than the previous Auto 110. Film winding was improved with a {{single-stroke film advance lever}} that advanced <b>the</b> film and <b>cocked</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> in one winding (the Auto 110 took two strokes to advance the film). A switch around <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release button enabled a new ten-second self-timer mode and a <b>shutter</b> lock; <b>the</b> self-timer activated a red light on the pentaprism housing, which flashed during <b>the</b> 10-second <b>shutter</b> release count-down. A button on the front on the user's left hand side gave a +1.5 EV (exposure value) backlit scene exposure compensation.|$|R
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature is the}} {{combined}} wind-on and shutter release lever. It swings out forward 65 degrees and is operated by the index finger. In the stowed-away position, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is <b>cocked</b> and <b>the</b> film wound on {{ready for the next}} picture. A small rocking lever in front of the accessory shoe serves as a shutter-release lock at this stage, it is disengaged by sliding it to the left-hand side. Depressing the lever releases <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and it relocates to the 65 degrees standoff position. Depressing <b>the</b> lever again <b>cocks</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and winds on the film. At the camera base is a special flash sync connector protected by coin-operated O-ring sealed aluminium plug, as well as an automatic resetting frame counter, visible behind a glass window. No tripod socket is provided. A small rewind knob at the left-hand top is extended for easy access and to engage the film transport mechanism. No rewind release facility is required; a function that was later added to the Nikonos and marked R on the shutter-speed dial.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} type of {{focal-plane shutter}} in 35 mm cameras, pioneered by Leitz {{for use in}} its Leica cameras, uses two shutter curtains, made of opaque rubberized fabric, that run horizontally across the film plane. For slower <b>shutter</b> speeds, <b>the</b> first curtain opens (usually) from right to left, and after the required time with <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> open, <b>the</b> second curtain closes the aperture in the same direction. When <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is <b>cocked</b> again <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> curtains are moved back to their starting positions, ready to be released.|$|R
50|$|The EF used {{a unique}} shutter among Canon's 35mm SLRs: a Copal Square vertical-travel metal blade focal plane shutter. Unusually, long {{exposures}} (from 1 second to 30 seconds) were electronically controlled, while shorter ones (1/1000 second to 1/2 second) were mechanically controlled. This was very useful in conserving battery power, and allowed one {{to use the}} camera even with dead batteries. The light metering system's power switch turned on the meter, removed the lock from <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> trigger button and let the film advance lever pop out 15 degrees from the camera body, all in one flick of the thumb.In the axis of the main switch, a multiple exposure button is located. Pressing this while <b>cocking</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> prevents advancing <b>the</b> film. The frame counter is also blocked, thus preserving the correct frame count.At the time, most cameras did not support longer exposure times than about one second, without having to use the bulb setting. Maybe this was why Canon placed a red LED {{to the left of}} the pentaprism, and had the LED flashing as long as <b>the</b> electronic <b>shutter</b> timer was running. The LED was also used for battery check.|$|R
50|$|The Rollei 16 used special Super 16 film {{cartridges}} with {{a capacity}} of 18 frames. As no film manufacturer was interested in making this film format, Rollei had to manufacture the film itself. A roll of B/W film cost 5 DM, while slide film (available until 1981) cost 12.50 DM, including development. Loading the film simply required inserting the leader into the appropriate slot in the camera. Since there was no take-up spool, the film coiled up loosely on itself. Without a doubt, limited film choice and availability adversely affected camera sales, consequently only 25,000 units were produced. As Rollei also spent a lot on advertising, this camera did little to alleviate its dire financial situation. Reliance on a film format that Kodak, the market leader, did not support was foolhardy. Needless to say, {{the quality of the}} engineering in the Rollei 16 matched its high price; it had a push-pull viewfinder with automatic parallax correction up to 40 cm, whereby extending the viewfinder also wound on <b>the</b> film and <b>cocked</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> In addition, Mutar wide-angle (0.5×) and telephoto (1.7×) conversion lenses were available as accessories. An improved successor, the Rollei 16S, was released in 1965.|$|R
50|$|The Kine Exakta {{controls}} are somewhat {{different from those}} found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release. <b>The</b> film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames {{the other way round}} on the filmstrip. The wind-on lever on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, <b>cocks</b> <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> and increments <b>the</b> manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> may be <b>cocked</b> again by turning <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and delayed action shutter release. It works at <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> setting B and is only settable after <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is <b>cocked.</b> Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with delayed action are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the left-hand front located threaded shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand take-up spool was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{versions}} {{may have}} no connection between <b>the</b> <b>cocking</b> mechanism and <b>the</b> film advance mechanism, making accidental multiple exposures a common problem, although this is a feature of camera manufacture rather than <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|The Pony had a four-speed 'Flash 200' shutter, an Anaston 51 mm f/4.5 triplet lens, and a fitted leather case. The {{body was}} made of bakelite, which was a very common camera body {{material}} at that time. Focus was achieved by estimation and use of a depth-of-field scale {{on the face of}} <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> assembly. A flash attachment could be connected to <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> by way of an ASA post-style connector. <b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> was manually armed--rather than being automatically <b>cocked</b> when <b>the</b> film was advanced after the previous shot, as in more modern cameras.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the limited}} radius of {{available}} space around the fully insertable lens, the use of <b>the</b> normal central <b>shutter</b> was impossible. Therefore, Waaske proposed {{a new type of}} shutter, which was separated into two functional parts. <b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> controlling clockworks were mounted unmovable in the camera body, while <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> lamellas were mounted in the movable sliding tube. The separate parts were mechanically coupled by shafts. Only when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> was <b>cocked</b> and therefore <b>the</b> lamellas were uncoupled, the sliding tube could be inserted into the housing.|$|R
50|$|Normal {{operation}} in an SLR camera involves flipping the mirror {{up out of}} the light-path just before <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> opens, and then returning it when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> closes (although very early SLR's required <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> to be <b>cocked</b> for <b>the</b> mirror to return). This causes vibration of the camera, particularly when the mirror slaps into the top of the mirror box. This vibration quickly dies away so the most motion blur is actually seen with short shutter times that capture multiple 'swings' of <b>the</b> vibration (<b>shutter</b> speeds of 1/2 to 1/60 second are often affected by this). While longer exposures will capture all of the vibrations, the exposure will be dominated by light captured when the camera is vibration-free (assuming a steady mount).|$|R
50|$|The 5/A2/A2e has two dials {{to control}} exposure, one over <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> button {{and one on}} the back of the camera. The dial above <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> button will adjust <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed in shutter {{priority}} Tv/Time value mode, but in aperture priority Av/Aperture value mode this same dial will adjust the lens aperture. In full manual mode, the dial above <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> reverts to adjusting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed, and <b>the</b> back dial controls the aperture.|$|R
50|$|A {{strap hinge}} with a zero offset and an angle pintle matched to the {{thickness}} of <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> will serve in every case. <b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> {{is removed from the}} face of the casing by {{the thickness of}} <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> plus <b>the</b> diameter of the pintle pin. That leaves <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> with a little breathing room and clears the corner of the casing - it's a nice angle between <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and house. <b>The</b> question of security - lifting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and hinges from their pintles is resolved by installing the top pintle in the inverted position.|$|R

5000|$|On more {{advanced}} cameras the open portion of <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> can be adjusted. This shutter setting {{is referred to}} as <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> angle. Adjusting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> angle controls <b>the</b> proportion of time that the film is exposed to light during each frame interval. The angle of <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> forms a proportion to the time that each frame of film is exposed: ...|$|R
50|$|Here <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> in <b>the</b> closed {{position}} fits within the window casement. This was the prevalent {{approach in the}} Colonies from New York and south. I can only assume the precedent was carried from England. An advantage is the additional security in that <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> could not be lifted from the pintles in the {{closed position}}. A disadvantage is that <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> must be matched closely to the inside dimension of the casing and <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> rabbet should match the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> sticky <b>shutter</b> problem {{relates to}} a rubber washer which is {{involved}} in the operation of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> With age and atmospheric conditions, it tends to deteriorate and become sticky, so that it impedes the operation of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> Frequent use can delay the stickiness from 'glueing up' <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> but once started, the only long-term remedy is to have <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> repaired, when <b>the</b> rubber washer is replaced, and so another 10 years or more can be enjoyed with the camera working correctly. A good short term solution is to lightly clean <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> diaphragm with a cotton ball and lighter fluid.|$|R

40|$|A thermal-powered reciprocating-force motor {{includes}} a shutter switchable between a first position that passes solar energy {{and a second}} position that blocks solar energy. A shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator is coupled to <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> to control switching thereof between <b>the</b> <b>shutter's</b> first and second position. The actuator is positioned with respect to <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> such that (1) solar energy impinges on the SMA when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is in its first position so that the SMA experiences contraction in length until <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is switched to its second position, and (2) solar energy is impeded from impingement on the SMA when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is in its second position so that the SMA experiences extension in length. Elastic members coupled to the actuator apply a force to the SMA that aids in its extension in length until <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is switched to its first position...|$|R
50|$|AI Servo AF {{was used}} for moving objects. The lens would {{continuously}} refocus on the object in {{the centre of the}} viewfinder whilst <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release button was pressed half-way. Once <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release button was fully pressed, the exposure was calculated then <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> released.|$|R
50|$|Lenses are {{fitted to}} a lens board by placing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> {{assembly}} through <b>the</b> {{front of the}} board and securing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> assembly by threading a locknut to rear of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> A front lens element will thread onto <b>the</b> mounted <b>shutter</b> and if necessary, a second lens element will thread onto the rear of <b>the</b> mounted <b>shutter.</b> This procedure can be accomplished by a camera technician, or by an end-user with the appropriate tools.|$|R
