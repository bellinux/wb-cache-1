5|$|In 2006, John Koza, a {{computer}} {{science professor at}} Stanford, was the lead author of Every Vote Equal, a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish National Popular Vote. (Koza had previously had exposure to interstate <b>compacts</b> from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch-off lottery ticket.) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.|$|E
5|$|The Hussite Wars, {{also known}} as the Hussite Crusade, {{involved}} military action against the Bohemian Reformation in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the followers of early Czech church reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415. Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431. These expeditions forced the Hussite forces, who disagreed on many doctrinal points, to unite to drive out the invaders. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise <b>Compacts</b> of Basel by the Church and the Hussites.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{running and}} cycling {{communities}} support {{events such as}} the Tulsa Tough cycling race, the Route 66 Marathon, and the Tulsa Run, which features over 8000 participants annually. Gambling is supported by a community of Indian gaming venues that have been allowed to expand gambling options. In 2005, <b>compacts</b> between the state and various tribes allowed facilities to offer table card games and slot machines. Another popular gambling draw, Horse racing events are housed by the Fair Meadows Race Track and Will Rogers Downs in nearby Claremore.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, we {{note that}} any finite subset of R is I-ward <b>compact,</b> the union of two I-ward <b>compact</b> subsets of R is I-ward <b>compact,</b> and the {{intersection}} of any I-ward <b>compact</b> subsets of R is I-ward <b>compact.</b> Furthermore, any subset of an I-ward <b>compact</b> set is I-ward <b>compact,</b> and any bounded subset of R is I-ward <b>compact.</b> Any <b>compact</b> subset of R is also I-ward <b>compact,</b> and the set N is not I-ward <b>compact.</b> We note that any slowly oscillating <b>compact</b> subset of R is I-ward <b>compact</b> (see [6] for the definition of slowly oscillating compactness). These observations suggest {{that we have the}} following result.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that each locally <b>compact</b> {{strongly}} sober topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> Hausdorff topology; just take the supremum of its topology with its dual topology. On the other hand, examples of <b>compact</b> topologies are known that do not have a finer <b>compact</b> Hausdorff topology. This led to the question (first explicitly formulated by D. E. Cameron) whether each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which all <b>compact</b> sets are closed. (For the obvious reason these spaces are called maximal <b>compact</b> in the literature.) While this major problem remains open, we present several partial solutions to the question in our talk. For instance we show that each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which convergent sequences have unique limits. In fact each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which countable <b>compact</b> sets are closed. Furthermore we note that each <b>compact</b> sober T_ 1 -topology is contained in a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology which is locally <b>compact</b> or sequential is the infimum of a family of maximal <b>compact</b> topologies...|$|R

We finally observe that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology is contained in a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology which is locally <b>compact</b> or sequential is the infimum {{of a family of}} maximal <b>compact</b> topologies...|$|R
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the 14 {{counties}} in Massachusetts. Massachusetts has abolished eight of its fourteen county governments between 1997 and 2000; but the {{counties in}} the southeastern portion of the state retain county-level local government (Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Norfolk, Plymouth), or in one case (Nantucket County) combined county/town government. Vestigial judicial and law enforcement districts still follow county boundaries even in the counties whose county-level government has been disestablished, and the counties are still generally recognized as geographic entities if not political ones, along with continuing to provide geographical demarcation for National Weather Service weather warnings. Three counties (Hampshire, Barnstable, and Franklin) have formed new county regional <b>compacts</b> to serve as a form of regional governance.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI, Krycek confesses that Billy Miles {{is one of}} a {{new type}} of aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity's ability to survive the invasion—including Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the {{building}} with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then <b>compacts</b> him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E
5|$|With little {{guidance}} on water allocation from the Supreme Court, {{proponents of the}} dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, {{with the approval of}} Congress. Such <b>compacts</b> were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.|$|E

5|$|She was a costumed crime-fighter like Batman, yet in {{many ways}} not an exact counterpart. For example, the {{contents}} of her utility purse were actually weapons disguised as stereotypical feminine products such as lipstick, cosmetic <b>compacts,</b> charm bracelets, and hair nets. Batwoman appeared regularly {{in the pages of}} Batman and Detective Comics through the early 1960s. Although letters from fans indicated Batwoman had become popular with readers, editor Julius Schwartz considered the heroine, as well as other Batman-related characters, to be inappropriate for the new direction he planned to take the Batman universe. Following the revamp to Detective Comics in 1964, Batwoman was removed from the series. The 'new' Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, not only replaced Batwoman as Batman's female counterpart, she surpassed the original heroine in popularity. Batgirl also proved to be more appropriate for her time period and the realistic approach DC Comics began taking with its characters. Unlike Batwoman, Gordon's Batgirl used a utility belt and various gadgets similar to Batman's, {{in addition to being a}} skilled martial artist and possessing a doctorate in her civilian identity. Despite requests from readers to revive Batwoman, DC's editorial staff initially declined to bring the character out of retirement, considering the fact that she was specifically created to be a love interest for Batman.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and <b>compacts,</b> forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a veliger (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
25|$|Tribes find {{fault with}} the {{provision}} about Tribal-State <b>compacts,</b> because under the Eleventh Amendment, which provides for state sovereign immunity, tribes {{are not able}} to sue any state to enforce the requirement to enter into such <b>compacts.</b> Thus, while the IGRA gives tribes the right to have casinos, the Eleventh Amendment gives the states the right to refuse to negotiate tribal-state <b>compacts.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractHaving in {{mind the}} {{generalization}} of Birkhoff's theorem on doubly stochastic matrices we define <b>compact</b> cellular algebras and <b>compact</b> permutation groups. Arising in this connection weakly <b>compact</b> graphs extend <b>compact</b> graphs introduced by G. Tinhofer. It is proved that <b>compact</b> algebras are exactly the centralizer algebras of <b>compact</b> groups. The technique developed enables us to get nontrivial examples of <b>compact</b> algebras and {{groups as well as}} completely identify <b>compact</b> Frobenius groups and the adjacency algebras of Johnson's and Hamming's schemes. In particular, Petersen's graph proves to be not <b>compact,</b> which answers a question by C. Godsil.
