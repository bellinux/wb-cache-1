50|$|A <b>terrace</b> <b>crossing</b> is a {{geographical}} zone between the sedimentation (downstream) part and the erosion (upstream) {{part of the}} river. This zone develops on the location where the transition of erosion to sedimentation takes place. Upstream of the <b>crossing,</b> <b>terraces</b> will exist. The highest terraces will be the oldest. Downstream of the crossing, older sediments will be buried beneath younger deposits.|$|R

25|$|Away {{fans were}} {{primarily}} {{housed in the}} <b>Cross</b> Street <b>Terrace</b> {{at one end of}} the ground, where 1,400 fans could be accommodated. This area was uncovered and open to the elements. This part of the ground also had work done on it in 2002.|$|R
60|$|She sent Jimmy off {{and looked}} about. Dillon talked to Margaret, and {{although}} Laura imagined a smile would detach {{him from the}} group, she did not smile.

Stannard smiled, but by and by threw away his cigar and knitted his brows. He thought he need not bother about Laura, but he saw no plan for meeting his importunate creditor's demands.|$|R

6000|$|... "They're at the wash," [...] Denis replied rather curtly. This white-trouser {{business}} {{was all in}} the wrong spirit. He was just preparing a scheme to manoeuvre the conversation back to the proper path, when Mr. Scogan suddenly darted out of the house, <b>crossed</b> the <b>terrace</b> with clockwork rapidity, {{and came to a}} halt in front of the bench on which they were seated.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the four sides of the stadium were: The Main Stand, which was all-seated and {{contained}} an area designated as the Family Stand; The Spion Kop - the main terrace - known as The Karen Child Kop from 2008 for sponsorship reasons; The Compton Street stand, running the full length of the pitch opposite the Main Stand; and the <b>Cross</b> Street <b>Terrace,</b> an open terrace where away fans usually stood.|$|R
60|$|He <b>crossed</b> the <b>terrace,</b> swung down {{on to the}} path, {{across a}} lawn, over a wire fence and into the park itself. All the time {{he kept his eyes}} fixed on a certain spot. When at last he reached the tree, there was nothing there. He looked all around him. He stood and listened for several moments. A more utterly {{peaceful}} night {{it would be hard to}} imagine. Slowly he made his way back to the house.|$|R
5000|$|Bridget Driscoll (1851 17 August 1896) was {{the first}} {{pedestrian}} victim of an automobile collision in the UK. As Driscoll, her teenage daughter May and her friend Elizabeth Murphy <b>crossed</b> Dolphin <b>Terrace</b> in {{the grounds of the}} Crystal Palace in London, Driscoll was struck by a car belonging to the Anglo-French Motor Carriage Company that was being used to give demonstration rides. One witness described the car as travelling at [...] "a reckless pace, in fact, like a fire engine".|$|R
50|$|The station will {{eventually}} serve all three lines which pass through it once the Sarawia Street level crossing in Newmarket is removed, which will remove the signalling constraints which currently affect the line. A bridge {{will be built}} to replace the level <b>crossing,</b> linking Laxon <b>Terrace</b> with nearby Cowie Street.|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned against}} the carved balustrade, again looking off toward his boat; but found his eye falling upon the ribbon grass, {{trailing}} along the ship's water-line, straight as a border of green box; and parterres of sea-weed, broad ovals and crescents, floating nigh and far, with what seemed long formal alleys between, <b>crossing</b> the <b>terraces</b> of swells, and sweeping round as if leading to the grottoes below. And overhanging all was the balustrade by his arm, which, partly stained with pitch and partly embossed with moss, seemed the charred ruin of some summer-house in a grand garden long running to waste.|$|R
5000|$|East Terrace (...) {{marks the}} eastern edge of the city centre of Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. It is one of the main north-south {{thoroughfares}} through the east side of the city. [...] Although the terrace essentially runs north-south between North Terrace and South Terrace, unlike Adelaide's other three terraces, its path is far from a straight line; travelling the entire length of East Terrace requires turning at right angles at most intersections. After <b>crossing</b> South <b>Terrace,</b> the street continues through the parklands as Beaumont Road, but unlike other roads through the parklands it is not a thoroughfare; there is a break in the middle of it.|$|R
25|$|The {{system of}} {{underground}} piles and beams {{that has been}} constructed not only supports the cemetery walls and the <b>Cross</b> of Sacrifice <b>terrace,</b> but also supports the graves and headstones as well. Each headstone is installed in an individual base, which is supported by horizontal ground beams, which rests on the vertical piles. All this is needed to isolate the cemetery structures from ground movements.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is perhaps}} most notable for its Georgian townhouses, shops and pubs. Many whole {{terraces}} are listed including much of Liverpool Road (one side of which is in Barnsbury) and Islington High Street/Upper Street. Other multiply listed streets include Arlington Square (one of the UK’s top 10 garden squares) Camden Passage, Compton <b>Terrace,</b> Colebrooke Row, <b>Cross</b> Street, Duncan <b>Terrace,</b> Essex Road, Gibson Square and Milner Square.|$|R
50|$|In October 2002, {{the level}} <b>crossing</b> on Park <b>Terrace,</b> {{immediately}} {{south of the}} station platforms {{was the scene of}} a fatal collision between The Ghan, several cars and a bus. Since then, buses to and from the Interchange have been re-routed away from the level crossing and locking pedestrian gates installed. This is the first installation of this type of level crossing protection in South Australia.|$|R

2500|$|Just {{north of}} the interchange, NY 384 <b>crosses</b> Nottingham <b>Terrace</b> and leaves Delaware Park. Continuing through North Buffalo, the route runs north along Delaware Avenue as a four-lane {{undivided}} boulevard, passing numerous businesses on both directions of the road, crossing under a railroad line in the area. The route changes little through North Buffalo, crossing multiple residential side streets and a junction with Kenmore Avenue. At that junction, the route crosses into the Kenmore neighborhood, and NY 384 becomes a mix of residential and industrial as it crosses north. The route soon crosses into the city of Tonawanda and the Paramount neighborhood, where NY 384 reaches a junction with the divided NY 324 (Sheridan Drive).|$|R
50|$|The Garden of Forgiveness lies {{close to}} Martyrs’ Square and the wartime Green Line (1975-1990). It is {{surrounded}} by places of worship belonging to different denominations, and reveals many layers of Beirut’s past. The area was classified as non aedificandi, not to be built, in the Master Plan of the Beirut City Center. The Garden of Forgiveness is envisioned {{as a place of}} calm and reflection, of understanding and tolerance. In 1998, the winning design of Gustafson Porter brought together different aspects of Lebanon’s ancient heritage and rich landscapes, thus emphasizing national unity. Entering through an enclosed water garden, the visitor descends into layers from the city’s past, <b>crossing</b> <b>terraces</b> of olive and fruit trees. The two main streets of Roman Berytus, the Cardo and Decumanus Maximus, were discovered here. Their shaded colonnades became busy markets on festival days. At other times, the streets would have been frequented by Law School students and citizens passing to the Forum or visiting temples and churches. During excavations, a sacred platform dating from Phoenico-Persian times was found below the crossing of the Cardo and Decumanus Maximus. The Mamluk-Ottoman layers of this district revealed the sites of various religious cults within a network of narrow alleys. In the late 19th century, straight shopping streets replaced the alleys, while the sites of religious worship were enlarged and became prestigious monuments. Embedded in the fabric of Souk al-Nouriyyeh, the Sayyidat al-Nouriyyeh chapel, once a place of worship attended by Lebanese citizens from various confessions, did not survive the Lebanese Civil War. It has been rebuilt as a stand-alone chapel on its original site, now overlooking the Garden of Forgiveness.|$|R
50|$|From {{the swing}} bridge the line swung sharply west and then {{followed}} the southerly alignment of Penpol <b>Terrace,</b> <b>crossing</b> under the present-day Hayle Viaduct, and then turning north, once more under the later Hayle Viaduct, to sidings on East Quay; {{there were also}} siding connections to Harvey's machine factory. North Quay was also served by sidings, with a junction, facing for trains from Redruth, east of the swing bridge.|$|R
60|$|A cold {{twilight}} {{had fallen}} upon the land when Hamel left the Tower that evening and walked briskly along the foot-way to the Hall. Little patches of mist {{hung over the}} creeks, the sky was almost frosty. The lights from St. David's Hall shone like cheerful beacons before him. He hastened up the stone steps, <b>crossed</b> the <b>terrace,</b> and passed into the hall. A servant conducted him at once to the drawing-room. Mrs. Fentolin, in a pink evening dress, with a pink ornament in her hair, held out both her hands. In the background, Mr. Fentolin, in his queerly-cut evening clothes, sat with folded arms, {{leaning back in his}} carriage. He listened grimly to his sister-in-law as she stood with Hamel's hands in hers.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, there were two signal cabins at Kilkenny - one at the Adelaide end of the station {{controlling}} access to sidings, the other at the Woodville Park end controlling the level <b>crossing</b> across David <b>Terrace.</b> In 1930, three-aspect colour-light signalling was installed on this section of the Port line in an effort to accommodate the close headways necessary with the heavy traffic of that era.|$|R
5000|$|Barrack Street commences at Barrack Street Jetty, and the {{adjacent}} Barrack Square. Moving in an uphill direction {{away from the}} Swan River, it passes alongside the Supreme Court Gardens and the Stirling Gardens. <b>Crossing</b> St Georges <b>Terrace,</b> Barrack Street then passes alongside the heritage-listed State Treasury Building and the Perth Town Hall. The town hall location was regularly utilised for special occasions - the Centenary of Western Australia celebrations in 1929, and the Royal Visit in 1901 ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{fact that}} the river {{terraces}} of the Trabancos River cut and <b>cross</b> some <b>terraces</b> of the Duero River indicates the affected Duero River terraces are younger than those not formed from activity of the waters of this river. The [...] "superficie de Alaejos" [...] carve-out intrudes 4 to 6 meters into the Duero River terrace designated TD-7 (+74/80 m) to the northwest of Siete Iglesias de Trabancos village. Likewise, the TT-2 fluvial terrace of Trabancos cuts some Duero River terraces. Since the previously mentioned Duero River terrace named TD-7 has been dated by Alfredo Pérez-González (op.cit.) {{to the beginning of}} the Middle Pleistocene, meaning the river terraces of Trabancos River are younger than the [...] "Superficie de Alaejos", it appears plausible that this postdates the creation of Trabancos valley: the proposed date could, thus, be halfway through the Middle Pleistocene or later.|$|R
5000|$|The Mansions was {{designed}} to be impressive and aesthetically pleasing, utilising high quality materials, generous use of ornamentation and careful composition of building forms, the six individual houses being unified by the overriding use of arcades and the arrangement, in alternating pairs, of entries and roof dormers. The design was well suited to the climate, the arcades providing shade without impeding ventilation. Soon after the residences were completed in late 1889 The Boomerang described them as:"unique in their way, being built after the Queen Anne style of red brick with stone facing. They have been constructed to suit the climate. The mantelpieces are very rich and were specially imported. In fact, its as fine a terrace as any in Australia".Addison published a drawing of The Mansions in 1890 in the Building and Engineering Journal of Australia, describing them as:"convenient and roomy having three reception rooms and ten bedrooms, exclusive of servants" [...] quarters. The front is of brick, relieved with Oomaroo sic stone, the total cost &pound;11,700...".The Mansions as terraced houses were a type of land use that was uncommon in colonial Queensland due to the enactment of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885. This legislation enforced a minimum lot size of 16 perches (404 m2) and a minimum frontage of 30 feet (10 metres) effectively stopping the building of terraced housing in Queensland except as a rental investment. Early pre-legislation versions of terraced housing in Brisbane included Harris Terrace and Hodgson's Terrace (demolished) in George Street; Athol Place in Spring Hill (1860s); Princess Row in Petrie Terrace (1863) and a group of four houses (-85) in Wellington Road, Petrie Terrace. Terraces built around 1885 or afterwards included Byrne Terrace on Wickham Terrace (1885-86, architects John Hall and Son, demolished); O'Keefe Terrace on Petrie Terrace (1886-87, architect Andrea Stombuco and Son); Cook Terrace (1889, possibly Taylor and Richer) on Coronation Drive; <b>Cross</b> <b>Terrace</b> in Red Hill (1886); Petrie Mansions on Petrie Terrace (1887-88); Brighton Terrace in West End (1890 John Beauchamp Nicholson); and two terrace houses on Wellington Street, Petrie Terrace (1894/95). Of these, The Mansions was the grandest and most ambitious architecturally.|$|R
