50|$|Pişmaniye (Turkish) or floss halva is a {{traditional}} sweet, prepared in Kocaeli, Turkey, made by flossing thin strands of halva into a light confection. Made primarily of wheat flour and sugar, the strands are continuously wrapped into a ball shape and then compressed. The result is a halva with a light consistency, similar to <b>cotton</b> candy. <b>Floss</b> halva {{can be found in}} regular and pistachio flavors, and there are brands with halal or kosher certifications.|$|R
40|$|Seed-hairs are fibers {{located on}} the seeds of various plants, {{designed}} by nature {{to make it possible}} for the seeds to spread by the wind.

Other sources include kapok, tree <b>cotton,</b> cat-tail <b>floss,</b> milkweed <b>floss</b> and <b>cotton</b> grass. Kapok is a seed fiber, cultivated in the East Indies and is commonly used for upholstery and lifebelts. None of the others have shown much commercial importance...|$|R
50|$|Today <b>cotton</b> <b>floss</b> is {{the most}} common {{embroidery}} thread. It is a thread made of mercerized cotton, composed of six strands that are only loosely twisted together and easily separable. While there are other manufacturers, the two most-commonly used (and oldest) brands are DMC and Anchor http://www.coatsandclark.com/Products/Hand+Embroidery/Threads/, both of which have been manufacturing embroidery floss since the 1800s.|$|E
5000|$|Embroidery floss or {{stranded}} cotton is a loosely twisted, slightly glossy 6-strand thread, usually {{of cotton}} but also manufactured in silk, linen, and rayon. <b>Cotton</b> <b>floss</b> {{is the standard}} thread for cross-stitch. Extremely shiny rayon floss is characteristic of Brazilian embroidery. Historically, stranded silk embroidery threads were described as sleaved or sleided in the sixteenth century.|$|E

50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, wearing of {{traditional}} smock-frocks by country laborers was dying out, although Gertrude Jekyll noticed them in Sussex during her youth, and smocks were still worn {{by some people}} in rural Buckinghamshire into the 1920s. As the authentic tradition was fading away, a romantic nostalgia for England's rural past, as epitomized by the illustrations of Kate Greenaway, led to a fashion for women's and children's dresses and blouses loosely styled after smock-frocks.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to evaluate bone loss at implant abutments coated with a soda-lime glass containing silver nanoparticles subjected to experimental peri-implantitis. Five beagle dogs were used in the experiments, 3 implants were installed in each quadrant of the mandibles. Glass/n-Ag coted abutments were connected to implant platform. <b>Cotton</b> <b>floss</b> ligatures were placed in a submarginal position around the abutment necks and the animals were subject to a diet which allowed plaque accumulation, and after 15 weeks the dogs were sacrificed. Radiographs of all implant sites were obtained at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the experimentally induced peri-implantitis. The radiographic examination indicated that significant amounts of additional bone loss occurred in implants without biocide coating, considering both absolute and relative values of bone loss. Percentages of additional bone loss observed in implants dressed with a biocide coated abutment were about 3 times lower (p, 0. 006 distal aspect; and p, 0. 031 at mesial aspect) than the control ones.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of implant–abutment interface (IAI) placement depths on peri-implant tissues in the presence of ligature-induced peri-implant inflammation. Materials and Methods. Two implants with screwed-in IAIs (SI) and two implants with tapped-in IAIs (TI) were inserted in one side of the mandible in six dogs eight weeks after tooth extraction. Four experimental groups were constituted: SI placed crestally, SI placed 1. 5 mm subcrestally, TI placed crestally and TI placed 1. 5 mm subcrestally. After 12 weeks, the healing abutments were connected. Four weeks later, <b>cotton</b> <b>floss</b> ligatures were placed around the abutments to promote plaque accumulation. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed at 0, 6 and 12 weeks after ligature placement. The effects of the IAI placement depths on clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed. Results. The alterations of peri-implant probing depths, clinical attachment levels, distances from the IAI to the first bone-implant contact (IAI-fBIC) and depths of infrabony defect were significant larger in the subcrestal groups compared with the crestal groups during the plaque accumulation period. The alterations of clinical attachment levels, IAI-fBIC, depth of the infrabony defect and horizontal bone loss were not significantly different between the SI and TI groups after ligature placement. Conclusion. Tissue destruction in subcrestal implants may be more serious than that in crestal implants in the presence of inflamed peri-implant mucosa...|$|E

E. coli O 157 Vero cytotoxin type 2, phage type 2 was isolated from 23 human cases and environmental animal fecal samples.

On multivariable analysis, only the association between illness and ice cream (odds ratio [OR]= 11. 99, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 04 to 137. 76) and cotton candy (OR= 51. 90, 95 % CI 2. 77 to 970. 67) remained significant.

40|$|Preventive {{maintenance}} practices {{are listed in}} the manufacturers' instruction books. In general, equipment that requires frequent and extensive preventive maintenance is generally the most costly. The manpower spent on these frequent trips to remote areas is such that it is usually better to invest in a more costly system which requires little preventive maintenance. The best preventive maintenance for the system is a good installation. 7. 2 Preventive Maintenance and Inspections With any system, periodic inspection is required because of the corrosive atmosphere and adverse conditions that exist in underground mines. These inspections can spot potential trouble in the system. Repair or replacement at that time averts the possibility of losing effectiveness of {{all or part of the}} system. 7. 2. 1 Cables Approximately once per month all cables in the communications system should be inspected for kinking, chafing, cracking, wear, stretching, or other signs of physical abuse. Particular attention should be paid to cable glands at the entry or exit points to the various units in the system, where the cable goes around sharp corners, in the vicinity of holding cleats which may be clamping the cable too tightly causing potential damage, and across the areas where the cable is exposed to physical damage from outside sources, such as equipment or falling objects. If a cable is damaged, it should be replaced as soon as possible. It is mandatory that the ground leads and connections to carrier current phones be thoroughly inspected and maintained in good condition, since considerable hazard may exist to the operator or equipment if a ground connection is broken. 7. 2. 2 Pager Phones The most readily available test set to determine if a pager telephone is operating correctly is the pager phone itself. The following physical check of the system can be performed at any phone station. 7. 2. 2 a Listen Circuit Remove the handset from its cradle and listen to determine if the circuit is functional, as indicated by the presence of noise or conversation on the line. If no noise or voice signals are present at the handset receiver, take the following corrective action: 1. Operate the handset press-to-talk switch several times. Any corrosion on the contacts of this switch may cause a receiver to be temporarily inoperative. Repeated operation may clear the condition. 2. Open the cabinet and see if the battery cables are properly connected and are making firm contact. Check the handset cable and its connections in the cabinet of the pager phone, and see if there is any evidence of a break in the cable, corroded contacts, or poor connections. 3. Remove the handset receiver earpiece by unscrewing it counterclockwise (to the left), and remove the receiver from the socket. Examine the handset cavity; in some units, a patch of <b>cotton</b> batting or <b>floss</b> is used as a barrier to reduce acoustic feedback in the handset. If the cotton patch has absorbed moisture, remove it and replace with a crumpled ball of soft rubber, stuffed just far enough into the handset so it will not touch the receiver or switch terminals. 7. 2. 2 b Page Circuit and Talk Circuit Push the page switch, squeeze the handset press-to-talk switch, and call any other phone. Release the page switc...|$|R
