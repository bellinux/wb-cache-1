However, despite their significant efforts to do so, patients were eventually forced to return to and rely on <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> because of their efficacy in alleviating and treating symptoms. These findings are discussed in relation to the sociological literature on consumerism, risk and reflexivity in health. We argue that our findings exemplify how living with and managing a chronic illness may not be straightforward and the choices of treatment at hand may be limited. Consequently, this may limit the potential opportunities accruing from adopting a reflexive or consumerist approach to managing illness...|$|R
40|$|Oral Presentation - Genetics, Pregnancy and Paediatric IssuesConference Theme: Applying {{pharmacoepidemiology}} {{to improve}} {{health care in}} AsiaAim/Objectives: To assess the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) during the fi rst trimester, {{the perceptions of the}} women on the safety of CAM and their preferences for CAM. Methods: This study was carried out in two London teaching hospitals. Expectant mothers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to ascertain their CAM use during the fi rst trimester; perception of CAM safety in comparison to conventional medicines; and preference for CAM in treating medical conditions. Results: Six hundred and seven women were approached of which 560 participated in the study; their age was 31. 9 ± 5. 1 years. 40. 5 % of them had used at least one form of CAM in the fi rst trimester. When asked to compare the safety of CAM to <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines,</b> 12. 3 % felt CAM is safer, 27 % thought both CAM and <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> are equally safe, 15. 9 % felt CAM is less safe while 44. 8 % felt they did not know about the safety of CAM compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines.</b> In treating a new medical condition, 17. 1 % of the participants would choose CAM rather than <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> as their most preferred therapy. Conclusions: These fi ndings demonstrate that a considerable proportion of the women had used CAM in early pregnancy. Although almost half of the participants did not know about the safety of CAM compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines,</b> nearly a fi fth would want CAM as a fi rst choice therapy.

Methods: Experiment 1 (1 factor within-participant design); Experiment 2 (1 factor between-participant design). Convenience samples of general population were given a hypothetical scenario and required to make a number of judgements. Results: People believed herbal remedies to be less effective, but less risky than OTC and prescribed <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines.</b> Herbal medicines were not seen as being safer simply because of their easier availability.

Conclusion: People believe that herbal medicines are natural and relatively safe and can be used with less caution.

40|$|The {{application}} of molecular genetics to medicine {{is based on}} the observation that even common diseases have both genetic and environmental components. <b>Conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> are often effective in managing environmental components of disease but are generally ineffective in managing genetic diseases or manipulating the genetic component of multifactorial diseases. The development of therapies aimed at the genetic component of disease will require non-conventional medicinal applications of molecular genetics. Various approaches have been proposed such as diagnosing the propensity for disease to facilitate early intervention with conventional therapies, selectively eliminating mutant genes from human populations, correcting mutations in human chromosomes, and using genes as medicines to modify the genetic components of disease. Of these, it is the development of gene medicines that has the greatest practical potential. The combination of <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines,</b> focused on the environmental components of disease, and gene medicines, focused on the genetic components, will provide the clinician with broad options for managing health and disease.

Methods Opinion of 595 pregnant women in three geopolitical zones in Nigeria {{on the use of}} herbal medicines, safety on usage, knowledge of potential effects of herbal remedies on the fetus and potential benefits or harms that may be derived from combining herbal remedies with conventional therapies were obtained using a structured questionnaire between September 2007 and March 2008. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact tests were used at 95 % confidence level to evaluate the data obtained. Level of significance was set at p Results More than two-third of respondents [67. 5 %] had used herbal medicines in crude forms or as pharmaceutical prepackaged dosage forms, with 74. 3 % preferring self-prepared formulations. Almost 30 % who were using herbal medicine {{at the time of the}} study believed that the use of herbal medicines during pregnancy is safe. Respondents' reasons for taking herbal medications were varied and included reasons such as herbs having better efficacy than <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> [22. 4 %], herbs being natural, are safer to use during pregnancy than <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> [21. 1 %], low efficacy of <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> [19. 7 %], easier access to herbal medicines [11. 2 %], traditional and cultural belief in herbal medicines to cure many illnesses [12. 5 %], and comparatively low cost of herbal medicines [5. 9 %]. Over half the respondents, 56. 6 % did not support combining herbal <b>medicines</b> with <b>conventional</b> drugs to forestall drug-herb interaction. About 33. 4 % respondents believed herbal medicines possess no adverse effects while 181 [30. 4 %] were of the opinion that adverse/side effects of some herbal medicines could be dangerous.

40|$|Background/Purpose: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (KOA) affects 13. 8 % of the US population aged ≥ 26, causing significant burden-of-illness. We {{examined the}} cost-effectiveness of <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and celecoxib and complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) therapies to treat KOA from the US health care payers’ and patients’ perspectives and from 24 -week, 2 -year, and 10 -year time-horizons. Methodology: We constructed a Markov cohort model (10 -year analysis) and a decision-tree model (24 -week and 2 -year analyses). All costs {{were obtained from}} the published literature (converted to 2012 USD) and included both direct and indirect health care costs of medications, drugs associated adverse events, and total knee replacement surgery. Effectiveness was measured in Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Clinical efficacies for treatment strategies under study {{were obtained from the}} Glucosamine/CS Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT). Cost-effectiveness were estimated by severity of baseline knee pain, categorized based on the data from GAIT into overall, mild pain only, and moderate-to-severe pain groups. Multiple published sources were used to obtain rest of the modeling parameters. Base-case results were varied in both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: We found that, in general, CAM therapies are cost-effective than <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> to treat KOA in the US, with CS being the most cost-effective treatment. With CS as the reference, glucosamine was the most cost-effective, except for in mild pain only KOA patients group from 24 -week time-horizon where celecoxib was the most cost-effective. Among the moderate-to-severe pain group, combination therapy of glucosamine and CS was the most cost-effective. A major driver of cost-effectiveness of CAM therapies over <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> was the exclusion of the risk of adverse events associated with the former {{because of the lack of}} evidence. Conclusion: CAM therapies are cost-effective than <b>conventional</b> <b>medicines</b> in treating KOA, both because of adverse events associated with latter and their higher drug utilization costs. Decision-makers could inform their treatment selection decisions from the findings of our study; however, future research is required to examine the long-term effectiveness and safety of CAM therapies in treating KOA.
