5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> as people with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{develop in the}} organ systems most {{dependent}} on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E

5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> in {{pregnant}} women may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> is unknown, since many {{non-lethal}} exposures go undetected. From the available data, <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (which <b>poisons</b> the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium.

40|$|Integration of a {{reformer}} and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is problematic {{due to the}} presence in the gas from the reforming process of a slight amount of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide.</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisons</b> the catalyst of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell subsequently degrading the fuel cell performance, and necessitating the sublimation of the reaction gas before supplying to fuel cells.

Experimental results indicate that the sensitivity increases at temperatures ranging from 100 – 300 °C. Additionally, the best sensitivity is obtained at a specific temperature. For instance, the best sensitivity of SnO 2 thin film thickness of 100 nm at 300 °C is 59. 3 %.

5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> will have a fatal outcome.

5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning,</b> as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E

40|$|The water-gas shift {{reaction}} is an exothermic and reversible catalytic process that converts <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> and water (steam) to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In regard to energy-related issues, the water-gas shift {{is part of}} the process of reforming hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen suitable for fuel cells; <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisons</b> the low temperature fuel cells (phosphoric acid and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells) and must therefore be removed. The reaction is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium at higher temperatures, while kinetics are unfavorable at the lower temperatures. Current commercial technology uses at least two adiabatic beds with cooling between the beds to address this issue. The first bed is a high temperature shift in which reaction rates are high, and the second is a low temperature shift where final equilibrium conversions are high. The high temperature shift is made less unfavorable thermodynamically by reacting the gas with an excess of steam. Membrane reactors are expected to eliminate the thermodynamics/kinetics trade-off by separating either the hydrogen or the carbon dioxide while the forward reaction is in progress. In such a reactor, excess steam migh...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO) <b>poisoning,</b> {{though with}} {{different}} sources, {{is one of}} the most deadly emergencies in all countries. CO can threaten men's life by several paths especially cardiac complications, which can mimic other cardiac problems such as myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to determine ECG findings and serum troponin I levels in CO poisoned patients. In this analytical cross-sectional study, 63 CO poisoning patients were consecutively included from hospital's emergency departments. CO content was measured by a CO-oximeter and an electrocardiography was taken first thing on admission. Arterial blood gas (ABG), troponin I and other data was collected afterwards. Data were divided by age groups (adults and children) and gender. CO content was significantly higher only in subjects with normal T wave compared to patients with inverted T wave in their initial ECG (P= 0. 016). No other significant difference was noticed. None of the ABG findings correlated significantly with CO content. Also no significant correlation was found with CO content after stratification by gender and age groups, but pH in children (r=- 0. 484, P= 0. 026). CO content was significantly higher in adults (P= 0. 023), but other ABG data were not significantly different. Only 3 patients had elevated troponin I. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed no significant cutoff points in CO content for ECG changes.

5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is {{initially}} non-irritating.

It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E

5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.

Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>poisoning,</b> little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues.
