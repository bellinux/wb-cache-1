This study {{attempted}} {{to expand the}} traditional achievement motivation literature to include those individuals who are striving to achieve the socially defined standard of excellence in weight-related appearance. Results from a study on a college population are very promising. High need achievers, identified by the Weight <b>Control</b> <b>Survey,</b> generated significantly more weight control achievement imagery to the Weight Thematic Apperception Test than low achievers. They also {{were more likely to}} use dietary restrictions and be physically active. In addition, very low correlations were found among the more traditional, global achievement measures (including the W 0 F 0 - 3, the CPI, the MAT, and the TAT) and the domain-specific orientation of the Weight <b>Control</b> <b>Survey.</b> This failure to obtain higher correlations calls for a continued expansion of the traditional achievement literature.

40|$|Indoor {{navigation}} or {{positioning systems}} have been widely developed for Location-Based Services (LBS) applications and they come along with a keen demand of indoor floor plans for displaying results even improving the positioning performance. Generally, the floor plans produced by robot mapping focus on perceiving the environment to avoid obstacles and using the feature landmarks to update the robot position in the relative coordinate frame. These maps are not accurate enough to incorporate to the indoor positioning system. This study aims at developing Indoor Mobile Mapping System (Indoor MMS) and concentrates on generating the highly accurate floor plans based on the robot mapping technique using the portable, robot and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) platform. The proposed portable mapping system prototype {{can be used in}} the chest package and the handheld approach. In order to evaluate and correct the generated floor plans from robot mapping techniques, this study builds the testing and calibration field using the outdoor <b>control</b> <b>survey</b> method implemented in the indoor environments. Based on control points and check points from <b>control</b> <b>survey,</b> this study presents the map rectification method that uses the affine transformation to solve the scale and deformation problems and also transfer the local coordinate system into world standard coordinate system. The preliminary results illustrate that {{the final version of the}} building floor plan reach 1 meter absolute positioning accuracy using the proposed mapping systems that combines with the novel map rectification approach proposed. These maps are well geo-referenced with world coordinate system thus it can be applied for future seamless navigation applications including indoor and outdoor scenarios...|$|E

30|$|Recorded working {{times by}} the field {{surveyors}} allowed estimating the efforts associated with collecting data on the different indicators using the BINATS methodology. The average working time per test area (including preparation, excluding driving time) was 4.8 h for habitat structure mapping over the whole test area (625 m × 625 m). Also, 4.8 h on average were spent on the survey of the butterflies on all ten test circles per test area. In comparison to other butterfly monitoring programs (e.g. BDM Switzerland, Butterfly Monitoring Germany), the time effort is high, which is mainly due to our strict methodical guidelines also concerning climatic thresholds and, {{in comparison to the}} other two mentioned projects, the fixed location of the BINATS transects. This 4.8 h survey included finding the location of the ten test circles, measuring the exact position of the test circles, justifying the cardinal points of the transect cross, marking the points of the transect cross with subjects like cloths, performing the survey along the transect cross, identifying habitats within the cross-transect, determining species within each habitat, and an additional <b>control</b> <b>survey.</b> In some cases when weather conditions changed - temperature and wind thresholds had to be abided - the test area had to be visited for a second time, which additionally consumed time. The survey time on the transect cross was from 10 to 20 min depending on the habitat type (e.g. bare fallow or highly structured habitats with higher abundance of butterflies). Additional 5 min were spent for a <b>control</b> <b>survey,</b> which means that the direct survey time for one test area (ten transect crosses) was between 2.5 h as a minimum and 4.17 h as a maximum, excluding the activities mentioned above. For vascular plants and for grasshoppers 5.7 and 7.2 h, respectively were calculated, also including the additional activities listed for butterflies.|$|E
