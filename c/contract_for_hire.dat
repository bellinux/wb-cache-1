40|$|More Roman Catholic clergy enter {{retirement}} every year. Vatican II and the Code of Canon Law, 1983, introduced language {{common to}} the marketplace and changed the framework of support for a presbyter. Changes included, such terminology as wages, remuneration and contract; the values, rights, and criteria to determine the support due to an active, inactive or a retired presbyter. The right to support, including housing, normally for life, resides in the juridical bond of incardination. The pertinent canons {{in the matter of}} support for clergy are canons 281 and 538, § 3. Are the dioceses of Ontario in compliance with the laws pertinent to the support of a presbyter in retirement? Chapter One provides the biblical and historical foundations associated with the support of ministers of religion in the Old and New Testaments, early Christianity up to the Edict of Milan in 313, and in the 1917 Code. Chapter One considers problems associated with "wandering clergy" and the development of the notion of canonical title to ensure the support of the presbyter for life. The titles of benefice, patrimony, and pension existed in the context of property law. The ordinary title for ordination in Ontario, "service to the diocese" is a non-proprietary title included in the 1917 Code that shifted the source of rights to support from property law to law of <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> Chapter Two considers the ecclesiastical documents from Vatican II and the 1983 Code concerning presbyteral support. Social justice and the dignity of the human person and the value of a presbyter's labour is the cause of rights to obtain support in commutative and distributive justice. Canonical issues revolve around the obligation of the Christian faithful to provide support, the sources and loss of support in active ministry, incapacity, and in retirement. Chapter Three considers the law and CCCB decree, No. 31, measured against a number of objective economic standards of time and place. The chapter considers constitutive elements of support, classifications of housing and the tax implications of low rent. According to the narrative accounts of two surveys, the "Priests' Survey on Retirement" indicates the current diocesan practice of providing support is flawed...|$|E

40|$|The recent CAP reform {{introduced}} new {{income support}} instruments much more related on agricultural agents land-use and land-ownership conditions than before. In this perspective the behavioural analysis of land-use and land-ownership decision process {{seems to be}} a basic condition to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of those instruments, and to understand and to forecast the agents response to these stimuli. The land-use and land-ownership behaviour differs according to various land managers, not only on the base of "economic-productive" conditions, but also on the base of exogenous and endogenous "institutional" conditions, such as the presence of formal or informal contracts, cultural values, intergenerational linkages, family-farm organisation and land-market imperfections and regulations. In this study an analytic methodology is presented together with an explanatory model which both try to show the role and the relationships between the various land-use and landownership driving factors at an agricultural agent level. It is also showed the different behavioural response to the exogenous stimuli coming from the "economic-institutional" environment, in which the agents operate. The model was tested in a Southern Italian region case study. In {{the first part of the}} analysis the various "economic-institutional" environment typologies, in which the region is articulated, were detected, on the base of official census data at the communal administrative units level. The Factorial Analysis through the Principal Components Analysis and Groups Analysis, is the analytic methodology used for this aim. In the second part of the analysis two specific "environments" were chosen in which the empirical survey was led at the agricultural agent level. The data coming from the survey were used to test the behavioural explanatory model. The results showed not only some specific "behavioural" paths which may be detected in the two different environments, but also deep differences among the various typologies of agricultural agents inside the same environments, depending on the "economic-productive" size, the presence of strong familiar roles, informal <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>hiring</b> work and renting land, the specific history of the agricultural agent, the perception of land as a productive factor, an investment good or a "social status symbol".

Comparing (with seasonally adjusted data) the second quarter of 2013 with the same quarter of 2012, the share of permanent contracts slightly increased (from 16.8 to 17.5 per cent), as did (very slightly: from 2.6 to 2.8 per cent) that of apprenticeships and (more pronouncedly, from 62 per cent to 67 per cent) that of term contracts. The average length of temporary contracts also increased, due to a little gain in term contracts over 12  months, together with a reduction of very short term contracts (2 - 3  months) (ISFOL 2013 b). On the other hand, the share of “project-related jobs” (a kind of temporary contract tied to the realization of a specific project) decreased from 8.2 to 6.7 per cent and that of agency jobs from 8.5 to 4.4 per cent, while a sharp reduction occurred to the so-called “associazioni in partecipazione” 23.|$|R

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effects}} of {{introducing}} a single open-ended <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> new <b>hires,</b> with increasing severance payments {{as an alternative to}} the current situation in Spain, where both temporary and permanent contracts are available. One of the reasons for the excessive job destruction in this economy is the intensive use of temporary contracts. The main driving force behind firm behaviour is the large gap in severance payments between temporary and permanent contracts (8 vs. 45 days of wages per year of seniority). We use a search and matching type model of job creation and destruction that is able to generate the main properties of a segmented labour market like the Spanish one. We use this model to simulate {{the effects of}} introducing this new design in severance payments. Our results show that this contract decreases unemployment (by 21 %) and job destruction (which is almost halved in contracts with a tenure of fewer than four years) and tempers both the probability of being fired and tenure distribution as severance payments are reduced. Almost 15 % more workers have a tenure of more than 3 years, and there are 23 % fewer one-year contracts. The transition shows that the single open-ended contract would be highly beneficial for a majority of workers (only 8 % would be jeopardised) because job stability would substantially increase. Firms, would also benefit from a reduction in their expected severance costs by about 9 %.
