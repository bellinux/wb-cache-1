50|$|Poncet Platforms do have design limitations. They {{are usually}} {{designed}} to track for 1 hour (15° of tilt) since longer tracking could cause the instrument {{on top of}} it to topple off. After that hour the mount has to be pivoted back to the east to reset the clock drive mechanism. Since the Poncet platform has no roller bearing surfaces that can be driven, the clock drive mechanism itself has posed some design difficulty for telescope makers. Straight line drives such as threaded nut/bolt drives <b>change</b> <b>drive</b> rate when converted to a circular motion. It is also time consuming to reset via spinning the nut back to the starting point. Amateurs have tackled this by employing curved bolt designs and even using specially shaped cams to convert the straight line motion to a variable speed motion. High mechanical loadings from heavy telescopes or using them at low geographic latitudes can cause the mount to bind up, requiring more complicated improved bearing surfaces to overcome this. This has led to equatorial platform variations based on the Poncet design include Alan Gee's platform mount using a more complicated cylindrical bearing surface in place of the inclined plane, and Georges D'Autume's platform design which uses a sophisticated conical bearing system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nitrate {{aerosols}} {{are expected}} to become {{more important in the}} future atmosphere due to the expected increase in nitrate precursor emissions and the decline of ammoniumsulphate aerosols in wide regions of this planet. The GISS climate model is used in this study, including atmospheric gas- and aerosol phase chemistry to investigate current and future (2030, following the SRES A 1 B emission scenario) atmospheric compositions. A set of sensitivity experiments was carried out to quantify the individual impact of emissionand physical climate change on nitrate aerosol formation. We found that future nitrate aerosol loads depend most strongly on changes that may occur in the ammonia sources. Furthermore, microphysical processes that lead to aerosol mixing play a very important role in sulphate and nitrate aerosol formation.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} climate variability, {{population}} growth, {{and land use}} <b>change</b> <b>drive</b> {{the need for new}} hydrologic knowledge and understanding. In the mountainous West and other similar areas worldwide, three pressing hydrologic needs stand out: first, to better understand the processes controlling the partitioning of energy and water fluxes within and out from these systems; second, to better understand feedbacks between hydrological fluxes and biogeochemical and ecological processes; and, third, to enhance our physical and empirical understanding with integrated measurement strategies and information systems. We envision an integrative approach to monitoring, modeling, and sensing the mountain environment that will improve understanding and prediction of hydrologic fluxes and processes. Here extensive monitoring of energy fluxes and hydrologic states are needed to supplement existing measurements, which are largely limited to streamflow and snow water equivalent. Ground-based observing systems must be explicitly designed for integration with remotely sensed data and for scaling up to basins and whole ranges.

40|$|Abstract. The {{meteorological}} conditions associated with elevated and extreme long- and short-timescale forest fire risk are investigated by validating and diagnosing the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) {{in the context}} of Tuscany in Italy, and Thessaloniki, Athens and Heraklion in Greece. The aim is to provide information to assist diagnosing experiments that use output from climate models to calculate FWI values. Links are made from fire risk to the widely used FWI, and then to the underlying meteorology, complementing other more complex fire risk model studies. First, the information about Mediterranean fire risk provided by the FWI is assessed by comparing the observed number of fires per day with FWI values based on the locally observed meteorology. This shows that the FWI provides some relatively consistent information for different locations, and suggests useful FWI thresholds indicating elevated and extreme fire risk. Then, the FWI system is split according to contributions from long- and short-timescale components, in a different way than usually adopted in the literature. Using the FWI thresholds suggested above, the long- and short-timescale {{meteorological conditions}} causing elevated and extreme FWI values are diagnosed. The results may help studies that investigate what aspects of projected climate <b>change</b> <b>drive</b> changes in fire weather risk, compare fire risk calculations from different climate models, or assess how climate models can be improved to provide better fire risk projections...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the introduction of}} biophysical constraints into a disaggregated dynamic New Keynesian (DYNK) model using the example of different resource use scenarios for Europe, derived from global UNEP scenarios. The DYNK model covers 59 industries and five income groups of households and has similar features to a DSGE model (e. g. QUEST). The model solution converges towards a long-run full employment equilibrium, but exhibits short-run institutional rigidities (imperfect credit and capital markets, wage bargaining). The DYNK model links physical energy and material flow data to production and consumption activities. Different sources of technical change are modelled at the disaggregate level: TFP, factor-bias and material efficiency in production and energy efficiency in private consumption. These components of technical <b>change</b> <b>drive</b> - together with relative prices - economic growth and resource use and therefore decoupling. A scenario of modest resource use reduction (per capita) is implemented by shifting the bias of technological change from labour/capital saving to energy/resource saving. As one example for a scenario of radical reduction of resource use per capita, the radical reduction of energy demand and GHG emissions is analysed. The results show the various interlinkages between different categories of material flows, which lead to co-benefits of policies.

Warming climate {{and changes in}} {{hydrology}} may either enable or hinder the spread of non-indigenous species (NIS) and {{little is known about}} how climate change modifies the richness and impacts of NIS in specific sea areas. We calculated from climate change simulations (RCO-SCOBI model) the changes in summer time conditions which northern Baltic Sea may to go through {{by the end of the}} twenty-first century, e. g., 2 - 5 A degrees C sea surface temperature rise and even up to 1. 75 unit decrease in salinity. We reviewed the temperature and salinity tolerances (i. e., physiological tolerances and occurrence ranges in the field) of pelagic and benthic NIS established in-or with dispersal potential to-the northern Baltic Sea, and assessed how climate change will likely affect them. Our findings suggest a future decrease in barnacle larvae and an increase in Ponto-Caspian cladocerans in the pelagic community. In benthos, polychaetes, gastropods and decapods may become less abundant. By contrast, dreissenid bivalves, amphipods and mysids are expected to widen their distribution and increase in abundance in the coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea. Potential salinity decrease acts as a major driver for NIS biogeography in the northern Baltic Sea, but temperature increase and extended summer season allow higher reproduction success in bivalves, zooplankton, amphipods and mysids. Successful NIS, i. e., coastal crustacean and bivalve species, pose a risk to native biota, as many of them have already demonstrated harmful effects in the Baltic Sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) and practices (EBPs) depends on both top-down and bottom-up responsibilities. Many {{articles in this}} special section on Implementation Science in Substance Use Disorders address the interaction between these two approaches when implementing new substance use disorder (SUD) treatments. Generally the articles place this interaction within the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a relatively new and comprehensive synthesis of theories and conceptualizations of the components needed for successful implementation strategies. The range of SUD treatments covered includes well-established behavioral interventions, such as screening and brief interventions for alcohol, {{as well as new}} pharmacotherapies, such as buprenorphine for opiates.

The successful EBT/EBP implementations reviewed in these articles recognized these potential change drivers in designing their strategy for introducing the EBT/EBP, and they modified aspects of the EBT/EBP to satisfy many of these drivers. The CFIR model has limitations, as do the contributions to this special section. The implementation science field is new and developing rapidly, and many of the EBTs and EBPs were developed and tested through controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions under controlled conditions, rather than examining their performance in the broader landscape of addiction treatment programs. These limitations may also be considered as boundary conditions to be explored in further research, implementation, and development of the next edition of the CFIR. © 2011 American Psychological Association...|$|E
40|$|Habitat change, {{invasive}} species, over-exploitation, {{pollution and}} climate <b>change</b> <b>drive</b> biodiversity loss. Together, these anthropogenic effects may have initiated the sixth mass extinction. Between 15 - 37 % of terrestrial species {{may be lost}} by 2050, and the remaining species likely will shift polewards and upwards to create novel assemblages of species. Reliable prediction of which species will go extinct, where they will relocate, and with whom they will associate, can only be achieved through substantial advances {{in our understanding of}} the physical and biological world. Indeed, many models associating species with climate change use oversimplified assumptions about the factors that regulate species survival, abundance and distribution. In reality, there are many biotic (e. g. competitors, predators, mutualists) and abiotic (e. g. temperature, moisture) factors that determine a species survival at micro- and macro-habitat scales. Current work typically focuses on a few abiotic factors at macro-habitat scales, leaving high uncertainty in how species will respond to climate change. The best management strategy for preserving biodiversity will, therefore, be a redress of the human footprint on the biosphere. Local initiatives alone may be ineffective. For example, wildlife reserves will be unsuccessful if climate change shifts temperature and rainfall outside the targeted species optimal requirements. If so, management must address whether the target species can migrate from the wildlife reserve toward suitable habitat. As such, conservation strategies must facilitate species movement that tracks favorable climate, via corridor maintenance and/or careful translocation of species to new habitat. The latter option is contentious given that movement of species might prevent extinction but threaten native species in the introduced range. ...|$|E
