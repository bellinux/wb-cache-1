40|$|Helly 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> is an {{important}} result from Convex Geometry. It gives sufficient conditions {{for a family of}} convex sets to have a nonempty intersection. A large variety of proofs as well as applications are known. Helly 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> also has close connections to two other well-known theorems from Convex Geometry: Radon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> and Carathéodory 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> In this project we study Helly 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> and its relations to Radon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> and Carathéodory 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> by using tools of Convex Analysis and Optimization. More precisely, we will give a novel proof of Helly 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem,</b> and in addition we show in a complete way that these three famous theorems are equivalent in the sense that using one of them allows us to derive the others...|$|R

40|$|Ramsey {{theory is}} a rich field of study and an active area of research. The theory can best be {{described}} as a combination of set theory and combinatorics; however, the arguments to prove some of its results vary across many fields. In this thesis, we survey the field of Ramsey theory highlighting three of its main theorems (Ramsey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 2, Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 4, and Van DerWaerden 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 7), paying particular attention to Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> We discuss the origin (Chapter 5), proofs (Chapters 4 and 5), consequences (Chapter 6), and some generalizations (Chapter 8) of Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> Among generalizations we mention Rado and Szemerédi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorems.</b> Special attention is also paid to upper and lower bounds for Schur numbers. Along the way, we take a couple detours, going into areas of mathematics or history that are relevant to what we are studying. In particular Chapter 3 includes a biography of Issai Schur, and Chapter 6 discusses results related to Fermat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Last <b>Theorem,</b> namely that modular arithmetic does not suffice to provide a proof, and how this can be verified as a consequence of Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> or by using Fourier analysis...|$|R

40|$|It often occurs that a Borel finite measure {{plays an}} {{important}} role in estimating the Hausdorff dimension of a Borel set of the Euclidian space, for example [6, 12, 16, 21, 22]. In particular, in the Euclidean space and homogeneous (in the sense of Coifman and Weiss) space, Frostman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> [8, 14] and Tricot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> [20] hold and those facts imply the equivalence among dimensions and several indices of a finite Borel measure [7]. But it is not known whether Frostman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> and Tricot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> can be extended to general metric space or not. The aim of this paper is to analyse systematically the several fractional dimensions of a subset and a finite Borel measure and establish new relations among them in a general separable metric space. As an application, we prove that Frostman 2 ̆ 7 s and Tricot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorems</b> are equivalent...|$|R
