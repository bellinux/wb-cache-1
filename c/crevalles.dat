25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> jack is a powerful, predatory fish, with {{extensive}} studies showing the species consumes {{a variety of}} small fish, with invertebrates such as prawns, shrimps, crabs, molluscs and cephalopods also of minor importance. Dietary shifts with both age, location and season have been demonstrated, which led some researchers to postulate the species is indiscriminant in its feeding habits. The <b>crevalle</b> jack reaches maturity at 55cm in males and 66cm in females, with spawning taking place year round, although peaks in activity have been documented in several sites. The larval and juvenile growth has been extensively studied, with the oldest known individual 17 years of age. The <b>crevalle</b> jack is an important species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with annual catches ranging between 1000 and 30 000 tonnes over its entire range. It is taken {{by a variety of}} netting methods, including purse nets, seines and gill nets, as well as hook-and-line methods. The <b>crevalle</b> jack is also a revered gamefish, taken both by lures and bait. The species is considered of good to poor quality table fare, and is sold fresh, frozen, or preserved, or as fishmeal or oil at market. The <b>crevalle</b> jack is closely related to both the Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack and the longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack, the latter of which has been extensively confused with the true <b>crevalle</b> jack until recently.|$|R

50|$|The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack, (Caranx caninus), is {{a species}} of large marine fish {{classified}} in the jack family Carangidae. The species is distributed through the tropical waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from California in the north to Peru in the south, including several offshore islands. The species is best identified by its deep body and mostly unscaled breast, {{as well as other}} more detailed anatomical features. The species is known to grow to a maximum length of 101 cm and a weight of 19.7 kg. Disagreement on the status of the species has been significant in the scientific literature, with many claiming it to be conspecific with or subspecific to the Atlantic Caranx hippos (<b>crevalle</b> jack). The most recent review of the <b>crevalle</b> jacks strongly concluded it to be a separate species based on the development of hyperostosis and fin colouring. It is predominantly a schooling inshore species, inhabiting sandy and rocky substrates, although larger individuals are occasionally found living pelagically to depths of 350 m. The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack is a fast-swimming predator, taking a variety of fish, crustaceans, and other small invertebrates. Spawning is thought to occur year-round, although peaks occur during November and May. The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack is an important species to commercial fisheries, with data available from Colima in Mexico indicating it accounts for up to 15% of the entire yearly catch. Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack are highly rated gamefish, taken by both bait and a variety of lures, but are considered relatively poor quality food.|$|R
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> jack {{lives in}} both inshore and {{offshore}} habitats, with larger adults preferring deeper waters than juveniles. In the inshore environment, <b>crevalle</b> jack inhabit shallow flats, sandy bays, beaches, seagrass beds, shallow reef complexes and lagoons. The species {{is also known}} to enter brackish waters, with some individuals known to penetrate far upstream; however, like most euryhaline species, they generally do not penetrate very far upriver.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, a <b>crevalle</b> jack {{caught by}} {{fishermen}} off South Carolina displayed swollen, bulbous mandibles. These swellings were initially {{thought to be}} due to a copepod parasite, however radiographs and subsequent sectioning found them to be bony in nature. The cause of this calcified connective tissue is still unknown, and there remains only a single reported case of such an ailment in <b>crevalle</b> jack.|$|R
2500|$|The giant {{trevally}} {{was first}} scientifically {{described by the}} Swedish naturalist Peter Forsskål in 1775 based on specimens taken from the Red Sea off both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, {{with one of these}} designated to be the holotype. He named the species Scomber ignobilis, with the specific epithet Latin for [...] "unknown", [...] "obscure" [...] or [...] "ignoble". It was assigned to the mackerel genus Scomber, where many carangids were placed before they were classified as a separate family. This later revision in classification saw the species moved to the genus Caranx, where it has remained. Even after its initial description, the giant trevally (and the bigeye trevally) were often confused with the Atlantic <b>crevalle</b> jack, Caranx hippos, due to their superficial similarity, which led to some authors claiming the <b>crevalle</b> jack had a circumtropical distribution. After Forsskål's initial description and naming, the species was independently renamed three times as [...] Caranx lessonii, Caranx ekala and Carangus hippoides, all of which are now considered invalid junior synonyms. The latter of these names once again highlighted the similarity with the <b>crevalle</b> jack, with the epithet hippoides essentially meaning [...] "like Carangus hippos", which was the <b>crevalle</b> jack's Latin name at that time. Despite the resemblance with the <b>crevalle</b> jack, the two species have never been phylogenetically compared, either morphologically or genetically, to determine their relationship.|$|R
25|$|Many older {{publications}} {{list the}} species range {{as from the}} eastern Pacific, which now is known to represent the Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack and is considered a distinct species. There are also often mentions of the species erroneously having circumtropical and Indian Ocean distributions, with these records probably attributable to similar Indo-Pacific species, namely the blacktip trevally and giant trevally. The species distribution overlaps that of the similar longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack in the eastern Atlantic, with careful identification needed to distinguish the two. Within the Atlantic, confusion with both longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack and horse-eye jack, Caranx latus, have also led to erroneous records being made, with Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter suggesting this occurred in the Mediterranean, and the species may actually be absent from waters north of Mauritania.|$|R
50|$|The {{specifics}} of the longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack's biology are not known due its recent description and previous confusion with C. hippos. It is clear that all species of <b>crevalle</b> jack are powerful predators, taking a variety of small, schooling fish species including herrings, other carangids and porgies of the family Sparidae. Small jacks, probably including C. fischeri also are known to take invertebrates including shrimps and crabs. Reproduction is poorly known, with spawning possibly occurring in estuaries and rivers.|$|R
25|$|The <b>crevalle</b> jack is {{a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with the greatest quantity of the species taken from the eastern Atlantic. In some fisheries, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species and therefore of great importance in these regions. In the Americas, the reported annual catch has ranged between 150 and 1300 tonnes since 1950, with catches since 2000 ranging between 190 and 380 tonnes. Most of the western Atlantic catch is from Florida, although Caribbean fisheries, such as Trinidad, take considerable quantities of the fish. The eastern Atlantic catch statistics do not differentiate longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack from <b>crevalle</b> jack, thus must be considered a composite dataset. This region only comprises catch data from Angola, Ghana, São Tome, and Principe. These catches are much larger than in the east, with hauls of between 1000 and 38 000 tonnes per year recorded since 1950, although catches since 2000 only range between 1900 and 10 200 tonnes. <b>Crevalle</b> jack is taken by a number of fishing methods, including haul seines, gill nets, purse seines, trawls, handlines and trolling lines. The abundance of the species in Trinidad leads to the fish being taken in several quite different types of fishery; demersal trawls, artisanal gill nets and even beach seines, which illustrates the species' importance. In Trinidad, recreational fishermen also may sell their catch, which adds to the overall quantity of fish sold. <b>Crevalle</b> jack is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|R

2500|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{discussion in the}} scientific literature regarding the possible conspecifity of the Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack, Caranx caninus, with Caranx hippos. Arguments ranged from the species being conspecific, subspecific or as individual species. This {{led to the creation}} of two trinomial names; Caranx hippos hippos and Caranx hippos tropicus. The former was an attempt to separate the 'subspecies' on each side of the Americas, while the latter was an unnecessary name to divide the Atlantic Caranx hippos into subspecies. The most recent review of the species complex by Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter treated the fish as separate species, citing differences in the development of hyperostosis and differing anal fin colours as evidence of species status. The species' most often used common name, <b>crevalle</b> jack (or 'jack crevalle') is based on the word [...] "cavalla", an earlier word used for the jacks. Other names include common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, yellow cavalli and a host of generic names, such as horse mackerel and <b>crevalle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{common name}} {{preferred}} by most authorities is 'bigeye trevally', 'bigeye kingfish', 'bigeye <b>crevalle</b> jack' or bigeye jack', with other names used including 'great trevally', 'six-banded trevally' and 'dusky jack'.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>crevalle</b> jack is {{a popular}} and highly {{regarded}} gamefish throughout its range, with the recreational catch of the species often exceeding commercial catches. The only amateur catch data available are from the US, which has an annual catch of around 400 to 1000 tonnes per year. In Trinidad, the species {{is the basis for}} several fishing tournaments. <b>Crevalle</b> jack are targeted from boats, as well as from piers and rockwalls by land based anglers. Fishermen often target regions where depth suddenly changes, such as channels, holes, reefs or ledges, with strong currents and eddies favourable. The fish take both live and cut baits, as well as a variety of artificial lures; however, when the fish are in feeding mode, they rarely refuse anything they are offered. Popular baits include both live fish, such as mullet and menhaden, as well as dead or strip baits consisting of fish, squid or prawns. <b>Crevalle</b> jack readily accept any style of lure, including hard-bodied spoons, jigs, plugs and poppers, as well as flies and soft rubber lures. There is some evidence based on long term observations that the species favours yellow [...] lures over all others. Tackle is often kept quite light, but heavy monofilament leaders are employed to prevent the fish's teeth from abrading the line. <b>Crevalle</b> jack are generally considered quite poor table fare, with selection of younger fish and bleeding upon capture giving the best results. The flesh is very red and dark due to the red muscle of the fish, which makes it somewhat coarse and poor tasting. When pulled from the water, this fish snorts in what many people describe as [...] "a pig-like" [...] fashion. The <b>crevalle</b> jack has been implicated in several cases of ciguatera poisoning, although appears less likely to be a carrier than the horse-eye jack.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crevalle</b> was {{launched}} 22 February 1943 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Fisher; and commissioned 24 June 1943, Lieutenant Commander H. G. Munson in command.|$|R

Along with her passengers, <b>Crevalle</b> recovered a group of important documents (the Japanese [...] "Z plan"), and transferred all she could spare in the way of supplies to the guerrillas. In May 1944, while returning with her passengers to Darwin, <b>Crevalle</b> was spotted by a Japanese convoy on the third day of the journey. With four working torpedoes Capt. Walker maneuvered to attack, but was severely depth-charged by a Japanese bomber, a special ordeal for the passengers. The periscopes and radar were knocked out.

50|$|The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack inhabits the {{tropical}} to subtropical {{waters of the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. The species ranges along the western American coastline from Lobos de Tierra Island, Peru {{in the south and}} north to San Diego Bay, California. The species is generally rare north of the Gulf of California, however El Nino events which bring warm tropical waters further north than usual transport Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack and other species beyond their normal range. All occurrences of the species in San Diego Bay have been attributed El Nino events in that year. The species is also known from several offshore Pacific islands including the Galápagos, Malpelo, Cocos, and Revillagigedo Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack is {{most common}} in coastal regions, {{although}} is occasionally found in more pelagic settings, with the species not known to live deeper than 350 m. In coastal waters the species prefers sandy and rocky substrates, including protected bays, lagoons and harbours, where large schools of the species form. Larger individuals are often solitary, and living in deeper offshore environments. Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack are also common in estuaries, usually as juveniles which preferentially inhabit these environments, but also as adults that {{make their way into}} brackish waters and tidal streams. Juveniles are known to penetrate well upstream, indicating a wide salinity tolerance.|$|R

50|$|The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack is a bluish-green to bluish-black dorsally, fading to {{a silvery}} white or golden shade ventrally. Juveniles are {{generally}} lighter in colour, also possessing five dark vertical bars on their sides. The fins are all white dusky {{with the exception}} of the anal fin and lower caudal fin lobe, which are white to brownish orange, with the ventral surface of the caudal peduncle also this colour. This contrasts to the bright lemon yellow anal and lower caudal fins of C. hippos. The Pacific <b>crevalle</b> jack also has a black spot on the base of its pectoral fins, as well as a dark blotch on the margin of the operculum.|$|R
50|$|The longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack, Caranx fischeri, is a {{recently}} described species of large marine fish {{classified in the}} jack family, Carangidae. It inhabits the subtropical waters of the east Atlantic Ocean, ranging along the African coast from Mauritania south at least to Moçamedes in southern Angola, with the species historically present in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an inshore species, known to occasionally penetrate estuaries, possibly to spawn. The species {{is very similar to}} the <b>crevalle</b> jack, Caranx hippos, and is separated by its extended dorsal and anal fin lobes as well as more detailed anatomical features including dorsal and anal fin ray counts. The fish is known to reach 127 cm in length and 20.9 kg in weight. The longfin <b>crevalle</b> jack is a predatory fish, taking small fish as its main prey. Due to longstanding confusion between C. fischeri and C. hippos, the importance of each species to African fisheries is poorly understood, with a known combined catch in this region of between 2,233 and 10,054 tonnes per year in 1995-2004. Like its close relatives, the species is considered a powerful gamefish and highly sought after, although their coarse flesh makes for relatively poor quality food.|$|R
