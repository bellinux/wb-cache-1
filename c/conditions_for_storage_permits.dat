40|$|An analog memory {{prototype}} containing 8 * 128 cells {{has been}} designed in a commercial quarter-micron CMOS process. The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of designing large dynamic range mixed-mode switched capacitor circuits for high-energy physics (HEP) applications in deep submicron CMOS technologies. Special layout techniques {{have been used to}} make the circuit radiation tolerant. The memory cells employ gate-oxide capacitors <b>for</b> <b>storage,</b> <b>permitting</b> a very high density. A voltage write-voltage read architecture has been chosen to minimize the sensitivity to absolute capacitor values. The measured input voltage range is 2. 3 V (the power supply voltage V/sub DD/ is equal to 2. 5 V), with a linearity of almost 8 bits over 2 V. The dynamic range is more than 11 bits. The pedestal variation is +or- 0. 5 mV peak-to-peak. The noise measured, which is dominated by the noise of the measurement setup, is around 0. 8 mV rms. The characteristics of the memory have been measured before irradiation and after 100 kGy (SiO/sub 2 /), and they do not degrade after irradiation. (15 refs) ...|$|R

Implementation and testing of the SiteChar project site characterisation workflow has produced a ‘dry-run’ <b>storage</b> <b>permit</b> application that is compliant with regulatory requirements. A site suitable <b>for</b> commercial-scale <b>storage</b> was characterised, compatible with current and future industrial carbon dioxide (CO 2) sources in the northern UK. Pre-characterisation of the site, based on existing information acquired during hydrocarbon exploration and production, has been achieved from publicly available data. The project concept is to store captured CO 2 at a rate of 5 Mt per year for 20 years in the Blake Oil Field and surrounding Captain Sandstone saline aquifer. This commercial-scale storage of 100 Mt CO 2 can be achieved through a storage scenario combining injection of CO 2 into the oil field and concurrent water production down-dip of the field. There would be no encroachment of supercritical phase CO 2 for more than two kilometres beyond the field boundary and no adverse influence on operating hydrocarbon fields provided there is pressure management. 				Components of a <b>storage</b> <b>permit</b> application <b>for</b> the site are presented, developed as far as possible within a research project.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The annual {{requirement}} of big onion in Sri Lanka is around 200, 000 Metric tonnes {{and only about}} 25 % is locally produced at present. Seasonal cultivation during April to September is mainly limited to dry zone areas of the country. About 30 - 50 % postharvest losses are reported during short-term storage and sprouting and bulb rotting are the major causes of losses. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} to study the present status of the onion postharvest handling, identify optimum storage conditions and analysis of the feasibility of providing those <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> short-term <b>storage.</b> Primary and secondary data related to onion storage and marketing were gathered and analyzed to get information on postharvest handling, storage environment and marketing system. Storage behaviour of big onions under two temperatures: 25 C and 30 oC and three RH conditions; 60 %, 75 % and 90 % was studied using a locally fabricated environment control chamber. A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. Loss of weight and external quality parameters were studied. The rainy season coincided with the storage period developing high RH above 75 %. Both the temperature and RH effects are significant at α = 0. 05 on the percentage losses but there is no interaction effect between these two factors. The difference in the weight reduction due to loss of moisture was significant under two temperatures and three RH conditions at α = 0. 05.

The research was based on the characterisation at different levels of five sites representative of the context and geology a range of potential CO 2 storage complexes in Europe. A key innovation was the development of internal dry-run licence applications for two sites, an offshore hydrocarbon field and an onshore deep saline aquifer formation. These applications helped to refine the storage site characterisation workflow and identify gaps in site-specific characterisation required to secure <b>storage</b> <b>permits</b> under the EC Directive. Economic aspects have also been addressed pointing out the heterogeneity and consequently the highly site-specific structure of the storage costs. Public participation activities were conducted at both an onshore and an offshore site. These ensured local stakeholders views were part of the application process and so successfully incorporate lessons learned from social site characterisation into the permit application.

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on {{thermochemical}} energy storage (TCES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants {{by means of the}} Calcium-Looping (CaL) process using cheap, abundant and non-toxic natural carbonate minerals. CaL <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> CSP <b>storage</b> involve calcination of CaCO in the solar receiver at relatively low temperature whereas carbonation of CaO is carried out at high temperature and high CO concentration to use the heat of reaction for power production by means of a CO closed power cycle. Under these conditions, large CaO particles derived from limestone to be used in industrial processes are rapidly deactivated due to pore-plugging, which limits the extent of the reaction. This is favored by the relatively small pores of the CaO skeleton generated by low temperature calcination, the large thickness of the CaCO layer built upon the CaO surface and the very fast carbonation kinetics. On the other hand, at CaL <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> CSP <b>storage</b> does not limit carbonation of CaO derived from dolomite (dolime).

Dry storage of fuel with zirconium alloy cladding has been licensed in Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Switzerland. In addition, dry storage demonstrations, hot cell tests, and modeling {{have been conducted}} using Zircaloy-clad fuel. The demonstrations have included irradiated boiling water reactor, pressurized heavy-water reactor, and pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies. Irradiated fuel has been emplaced in and retrieved from metal casks, dry wells, silos, and a vault. Dry storage tests and demonstrations have involved {similar_to} 5, 000 fuel rods, and {similar_to} 600 rods have been monitored during dry storage in inert gases with maximum cladding temperatures ranging from 50 to 570 {sup 0 }C. Although some tests and demonstrations are still in progress, there is currently no evidence that any rods exposed to inert gases have failed (one PWR rod exposed to an air cover gas failed at {similar_to} 70 {sup 0 }C). Based on this favorable experience, it is concluded that there is sufficient information on fuel rod behavior, storage conditions, and potential cladding failure mechanisms to support licensing of dry storage in the United States. This licensing position includes a requirement for inert cover gases and a maximum cladding temperature guideline of 380 {sup 0 }C for Zircaloy-clad fuel. Using an inert cover gas assures that even if fuel with cladding defects were placed in dry storage, or if defects develop during storage, the defects would not propagate.

The structure offers 27000 sq ft of closely monitored, climate-controlled <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> film <b>storage</b> and preservation. The Cube has three temperature- and humidity-controlled floors. Two floors are kept at 45 degrees Fahrenheit and 25% Relative Humidity. The third floor is designed to prevent further deterioration of films suffering from advanced Vinegar Syndrome. It is kept at 25 degrees Fahrenheit and 30% relative humidity.|$|R
40|$|PROBLEM: The use of {{eelgrass}} (Zostera marina) seeds {{is increasingly}} being {{recognized as a}} viable option for both small- and large-scale restoration projects. Although methods for hand-collecting, processing and storing eelgrass seeds have advanced to match the scale of collections, the number of seeds collected has limited the scale of restoration efforts, {{as well as the}} scale of ecologically relevant experiments. Recent experience with mechanized harvest of reproductive shoots has transcended the limitations of scale imposed upon divers working underwater during springtime with often severe weather limitations. Processing and storage methodologies and infrastructure previously scaled to hand collection now pose a bottleneck to the expansion of restoration and research to larger, previously unachievable scales. PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to develop methodologies for achieving the full potential for large-scale restoration presented by mechanized eelgrass seed harvesting. The specific goal in this project was to develop techniques and infrastructure to fully exploit potential mechanized seed harvesting capabilities, and to identify optimal <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> and survival of large volumes of harvested seeds. BACKGROUND: One of the goals of the Chesapeake Bay Program (Chesapeake Executive Council 2003...|$|R
