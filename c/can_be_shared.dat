5|$|In {{addition}} to single-player, the title features cooperative multiplayer, where players can accept invitation from {{up to six}} other players to join their game session through either LAN or online connection. Alongside being able to fight enemies together, players can swap messages and exchange loot. There is also a Level Editor available, where players can access developer tools and create their own levels which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> with other players. The editor features {{a large amount of}} options for environment customization, including adjusting the shade of environmental elements like roads.|$|E
5|$|The ReactOS and the Wine {{projects}} {{share the}} goal to run binary Windows software natively and can share therefore many dependencies and development. ReactOS uses {{portions of the}} Wine project {{so that it can}} benefit from Wine's progress in implementing the Win32 API. While Wine's NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code snippets of them and other parts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.|$|E
5|$|In his text, An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion, author Derek Hicks {{suggest that}} “through gumbo, traditions and values are transmitted.” This quote {{represents}} his larger claim that gumbo does this for African American culture, uniting {{a group of}} people by one very powerful dish. According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> among many people.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is fused. These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{provides}} heavier {{integration with}} the Xbox ecosystem. Xbox SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox app, which {{allows users to}} browse their game library (including both PC and Xbox console games), and Game DVR is also available using a keyboard shortcut, allowing users to save the last 30 seconds of gameplay as a video that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> to Xbox Live, OneDrive, or elsewhere. Windows 10 also allows users to control and play games from an Xbox One console over a local network. The Xbox Live SDK allows application developers to incorporate Xbox Live functionality into their apps, and future wireless Xbox One accessories, such as controllers, are supported on Windows with an adapter. Microsoft also intends to allow cross-buys and save synchronization between Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of games; Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are intended as being exclusive to Windows 10 and Xbox One.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{real-time}} {{nature of}} social media, financial services companies {{must be on}} constant alert for potential issues so they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mitigated before any serious damage control is necessary.

25|$|The closest links of the U.S. IC {{to other}} foreign {{intelligence}} agencies are to Anglophone countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. There {{is a special}} communications marking that signals that intelligence-related messages <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> with these four countries. An indication of the United States' close operational cooperation {{is the creation of}} a new message distribution label within the main U.S. military communications network. Previously, the marking of NOFORN (i.e., No Foreign Nationals) required the originator to specify which, if any, non-U.S. countries could receive the information. A new handling caveat, USA/AUS/CAN/GBR/NZL Five Eyes, used primarily on intelligence messages, gives an easier way to indicate that the material <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> with Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|The goal of {{intelligence}} sharing {{is to make}} the HN independent. Clearly, not every HN can afford space-based systems and other advanced, expensive technology. Advanced technologies, for security reasons, may not be appropriate to make available, in raw form, to third countries. Decisions on what <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> and should be shared will involve the HN, the FID nation(s) country teams, the relevant combatant command, and the intelligence community.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two ways}} to give consent: {{explicit}} consent or implied consent. Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared.</b> Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.|$|E
25|$|Information {{within the}} record <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>shared</b> with {{authorities}} without permission when {{failure to do}} so would result in death or harm, either to the patient or to others. Information cannot be used, however, to initiate or substantiate a charge unless the previous criteria are met (i.e., information from illicit drug testing cannot be used to bring charges of possession against a patient). This rule was established in the United States Supreme Court case Jaffe v. Redmond.|$|E
