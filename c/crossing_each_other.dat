25|$|Freyburg’s regular layout is a grid {{of roads}} <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in right angles, a {{distinct}} transverse axis and its nearly exact subdivision in blocks. After the extinction of the Ludowinger dynasty in 1247, the city lost its significance but continued its viticulture {{for which it is}} still known in the Saale-Unstrut region today.|$|E
25|$|Trémaux trees {{also play}} a key role in the Fraysseix–Rosenstiehl {{planarity}} criterion for testing whether a given graph is planar. According to this criterion, a graph G is planar if, for a given Trémaux tree T of G, the remaining edges can be placed in a consistent way to the left or the right of the tree, subject to constraints that prevent edges with the same placement from <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1840, two further acts were obtained, for laying {{additional}} {{lines as}} far as the junction at Corbetts Lane and for improvements and extensions to the stations at London Bridge. These were watched closely by a committee formed by the L, the London & Brighton Railway (L) and the proposed South Eastern Railway. At this time the L and the L exchanged stations to avoid <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at Corbetts Lane. A resited station at Spa Road opened in 1842.|$|E

500|$|The pair of arcs {{flanking}} the 22° halo and <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{are most likely}} a misinterpretation of a circumscribed halo. [...] While the sun is still low, it starts as a V-shaped upper tangent arc which gradually develops into something looking like the unfolding wings of a seagull. As the sun ascends, in rare cases it finally joins with the lower tangent arc to form an ellipse which closes in on the circumscribed 22° halo.|$|E
500|$|One famous {{dance that}} is well known is called the Tinikling, where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about [...] "How rural townsfolk mingle". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on {{opposite}} sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil. Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organization}} of the streets into a right-angled grid pattern was criticized by Andrew Jackson Downing, {{who was at the}} time the foremost expert on landscape design. Downing condemned the use of the street grid outside of cities and saw the hilly and heavily wooded site of Dearman as particularly suited to his own theories, which called for curvilinear roads and irregular lots which followed the contours of the land. With the frequent steamboat, stagecoach, and train transportation available, he felt that Dearman could have been an ideal suburb, instead of [...] "mere rows of houses upon streets <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at right angles and bordered with shade trees".|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{principal}} {{means by which}} touchpads work. In the matrix approach, a series of conductors are arranged {{in an array of}} parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at right angles to form a grid. [...] A high frequency signal is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional grid array. [...] The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location. This method received [...] awarded to George Gerpheide in April 1994.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the city}} centre, the trains run {{underground}} in two tunnel sections, also served by regional trains. Elsewhere {{they are in}} the open, occasionally above or below street level. There is only one underground station, Nørreport, but many stations are elevated above street level (Fuglebakken, Jægersborg, Bernstorffsvej, Nordhavn, Sjælør, Sydhavn, Dyssegård, Jyllingevej, Vanløse and Vigerslev Allé). Flintholm, Ny Ellebjerg and Danshøj stations have tracks <b>crossing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at different levels with platforms on each level, while at Ryparken they are on the same level. The [...] "ring line" [...] or F line has an elevated section including Nørrebro Station, which offers a view {{of some of the most}} populous areas of the city, Nørrebro and Nordvest. Also, the junctions of the Farumbane with the other lines at Ryparken and Svanemøllen include a short elevated section and a short northbound tunnel, respectively. Within the city core (zones 1 & 2) the stations are either elevated or lower than the street level.|$|E

60|$|The fort only mounted, in all, {{seventeen}} cannon, for {{the most}} part small, and, as some of them were upon the other faces, the English fire, although kept up with spirit, could reply but weakly to that of the French.

The roar of the distant artillery continuing day after day was plainly audible at Fort Edward; but although Monro had, at the commencement of the attack, sent off several messengers asking for reinforcements, Webb did not move.|$|E
