5|$|The {{album was}} the idea of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. Parker wished to release an Elvis Presley album through Boxcar Records—a company that he formed to manage Presley's {{commercial}} rights, so that he could profit directly from it. However, since Presley was signed to RCA Records, any recordings made would legally belong to RCA. To circumvent this restriction, Parker compiled audio of Presley talking—material over which RCA could not <b>claim</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression this fee {{was lowered}} to $100 and {{eventually}} $75. All royalties {{went to the}} Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when Walter Karig, who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, tried to <b>claim</b> <b>rights</b> with the Library of Congress in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to <b>claim</b> <b>rights</b> over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E

25|$|The {{shifting}} alliances in the Cossacks {{have generated}} {{a large amount}} of controversy, especially during the 20th century. For Russians, the Treaty of Pereyaslav gave the Tsardom of Russia and later Russian Empire the impulse to take over the Ruthenian lands, <b>claim</b> <b>rights</b> as the sole successor of the Kievan Rus' and for the Russian Tsar to be declared the protector of all Russias, culminating in the Pan-Slavism movement of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Muslims also <b>claim</b> <b>rights</b> to {{that land}} in {{accordance}} with the Quran. Contrary to the Jewish claim that this land was promised only to the descendants of Abraham's younger son Isaac, they argue that the Land of Canaan was promised to what they consider the elder son, Ishmael, from whom Arabs claim descent. Additionally, Muslims also revere many sites holy for Biblical Israelites, such as the Cave of the Patriarchs and the Temple Mount. In the past 1,400 years, Muslims have constructed Islamic landmarks on these ancient Israelite sites, such as the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. This has brought the two groups into conflict over the rightful possession of Jerusalem. Muslim teaching is that Muhammad passed through Jerusalem on his first journey to heaven. Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, claims that all of the land of Palestine (the current Israeli and Palestinian territories) is an Islamic waqf that must be governed by Muslims.|$|E

He published Anthony Holborne's Pavans, Galliards, Almains (1599), the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England. His partnership with Morley enabled him to <b>claim</b> <b>rights</b> to music books, but was short-lived. [...] Morley gave work to the printer Thomas East, and died in 1602. Some publishers ignored Barley's claims, and many music books printed during his later life gave him no recognition.|$|E
40|$|The {{philosophical}} {{literature on}} state legitimacy has recently seen a significant conceptual revision. Several philosophers {{have argued that}} the state's right to rule is better characterized not as a <b>claim</b> <b>right</b> to obedience, but as a power right. There have been few attempts to show that traditional justifications for the <b>claim</b> <b>right</b> might also be used to justify a power right, and there have been no such attempts involving the principle of fair play, which is widely regarded as the most promising basis for a <b>claim</b> <b>right</b> to obedience. William Edmundson argues that the principle of fair play cannot generate power rights, and so any attempt at a fair play account of legitimacy must fail. I explain how fair play could generate a power right, owing to its stipulation that the rules of a cooperative scheme specify the form of participants' repayment...|$|R

[...] Its governor Sir Edmund Andros came to New York that summer to establish his authority and install Francis Nicholson, a captain in the British Army, to administer those colonies as his lieutenant governor.

2500|$|The patrons, {{and other}} {{players from the}} social class known as the [...] "gentry", began to {{classify}} themselves as [...] "amateurs" [...] to establish a clear distinction vis-à-vis the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, {{even to the point}} of having separate changing and dining facilities. The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to <b>claim</b> <b>rights</b> of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their [...] "social inferiors" [...] if they were to win their bets. In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were [...] "officers and gentlemen" [...] whose destiny was to provide leadership. In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed somewhat more than actual expenditure and the derisive term [...] "shamateur" [...] was coined to describe the syndrome.|$|E

We usually secured by fraud homesteads in the {{sections}} containing water, and so, gun in hand, 'stood off' the man who came after. Gradually, after much shooting and lawing, we parcelled out the range and settled down covering practically the whole State. Our adjustments were not perfect, but our system was working smoothly for us who controlled the range. We had convinced ourselves, and pretty nearly everybody else, that the State was only fit for cattle-grazing, and that we were the most competent grazers; furthermore, we were in possession, and no man could come in without our consent.|$|E

6000|$|But however brave a front Mary Sewell {{may have}} {{maintained}} before the enemy, I expect she felt pretty limp when thinking matters calmly over after her ladyship's departure. She knew her lover {{well enough to}} guess {{that he would be}} as wax in the firm hands of his mother, while she herself would not have a chance of opposing her influence against those seeking to draw him away from her. Once again she read through the few schoolboy letters he had written her, and then looked up at the framed photograph that hung above the mantelpiece of her little bedroom. The face was that of a frank, pleasant-looking young fellow, lightened by eyes somewhat large for a man, but spoiled by a painfully weak mouth. The more Mary Sewell thought, the more sure she felt in her own mind that he loved her, and had meant honestly by her. Did the matter rest with him, she might reckon on being the future Countess of ---, but, unfortunately for her, the person to be considered was not Lord C---, but the present Countess of ---. From childhood, through boyhood, into manhood it had never once occurred to Lord C--- to dispute a single command of his mother's, and his was not the type of brain to readily receive new ideas. If she was to win in the unequal contest {{it would have to be}} by art, not by strength. She sat down and wrote a letter which under all the circumstances was a model of diplomacy. She knew that it would be read by the countess, and, writing it, she kept both mother and son in mind. She made no reproaches, and indulged in but little sentiment. It was the letter of a woman who could <b>claim</b> <b>rights,</b> but who asked only for courtesy. It stated her wish to see him alone and obtain from his own lips the assurance that he wished their engagement to cease. [...] "Do not fear," [...] Mary Sewell wrote, [...] "that I shall be any annoyance to you. My own pride would not let me urge you to marry me against your desire, and I care for you too much to cause you any pain. Assure me with your own lips that you wish our engagement to be at an end, and I shall release you without another word." ...|$|E
