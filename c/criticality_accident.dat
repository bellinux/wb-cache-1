5|$|August 21: Harry Daghlian, a physicist, {{receives}} a fatal dose (510 rems) of radiation from a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> when he accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a plutonium bomb core. He dies on September 15.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Cushman Graves (November 4, 1909 – July 19, 1965) was an American nuclear {{physicist}} {{who served}} at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory and the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous nuclear weapons tests during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> in Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|Daghlian was {{estimated}} to have received a dose of 510rem (5.1Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning and his mother and sister were flown out to care for him (his father had died in 1943). He fell into a coma, and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident.</b> His body was returned to New London, where he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident,</b> following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{isotopes}} {{of sodium}} are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is {{created in the}} carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star {{of at least three}} solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear <b>criticality</b> <b>accident,</b> converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the history}} of atomic power development, at least 60 <b>criticality</b> <b>accidents</b> have occurred, {{including}} 22 in process environments, outside of nuclear reactor cores or experimental assemblies, and 38 in small experimental reactors and other test assemblies.|$|R
25|$|In most of {{the acute}} {{exposure}} scenarios that lead to radiation sickness, {{the bulk of the}} radiation is external whole-body gamma, in which case the absorbed, equivalent and effective doses are all equal. There are exceptions, such as the Therac-25 accidents and the 1958 Cecil Kelley <b>criticality</b> <b>accident,</b> where the absorbed doses in Gy or rad are the only useful quantities.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 JST on 12 March, the Japanese {{government}} ordered seawater to be {{injected into}} Unit 1 {{in a new}} effort to cool the reactor core. The treatment had been held {{as a last resort}} since it ruins the reactor. TEPCO started seawater cooling at 20:20, adding boric acid as a neutron absorber to prevent a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident.</b> The water would take five to ten hours to fill the reactor core, after which the reactor would cool down in around ten days. The injection of seawater into the reactor pressure vessel was done by fire department trucks. At 01:10 JST on 14 March, injection of seawater was halted for two hours because all available water in the plant pools had run out (similarly, feed to Unit 3 was halted). NISA news reports stated 70% of the fuel rods had been damaged when uncovered.|$|E
25|$|When a uranium nucleus fissions {{into two}} {{daughter}} nuclei fragments, about 0.1 {{percent of the}} mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the fission energy of ~200MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean fission energy 202.5MeV), typically ~169MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2MeV (total of 4.8MeV). The fission reaction also releases ~7MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~ 6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat). In an atomic bomb, this heat may serve to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100million kelvin and cause secondary emission of soft X-rays, which convert some of this energy to ionizing radiation. However, in nuclear reactors, the fission fragment kinetic energy remains as low-temperature heat, which itself causes little or no ionization.|$|E
5000|$|Any such event {{involves}} the unintended accumulation or arrangement {{of a critical}} mass of fissile material, for example enriched uranium or plutonium. <b>Criticality</b> <b>accidents</b> can release potentially fatal radiation doses, if they occur in an unprotected environment.|$|R

50|$|High-intensity {{ionizing}} radiation in air {{can produce a}} visible ionized air glow of telltale bluish-purplish color. The glow can be observed e.g. during <b>criticality</b> <b>accidents,</b> around mushroom clouds shortly after a nuclear explosion, or inside of a damaged nuclear reactor like during the Chernobyl disaster.|$|R
500|$|Daghlian was {{irradiated}} as {{a result}} of a <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> that occurred when he accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a 6.2kg plutonium–gallium alloy bomb core. This core, subsequently nicknamed the [...] "demon core", was later involved in the death of another physicist, Louis Slotin.|$|E
500|$|These changes did {{not prevent}} another <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> from {{happening}} at Los Alamos the following year. Louis Slotin, a colleague of Daghlian's, was killed in 1946 while performing criticality tests on the same plutonium core. After these two incidents it {{became known as the}} [...] "demon core", and all similar criticality experiments were halted until remote-controlled assembly devices were more fully developed and available.|$|E
500|$|The core {{involved}} {{was intended}} {{to be used in the}} Able detonation, during the Crossroads series of nuclear weapon testing. Slotin's experiment was said to be the last conducted before the core's detonation and {{was intended to}} be the final demonstration of its ability to go critical. [...] After the <b>criticality</b> <b>accident</b> it needed time to cool. It was therefore rescheduled for the third test of the series, provisionally named Charlie, but this was cancelled due to the unexpected level of radioactivity after the underwater Baker test and the inability to decontaminate the target warships. [...] It was later melted down and reused in a later core.|$|E
50|$|Critical mass {{experiments}} {{determine the}} quantity of fissile material required for criticality {{with a variety of}} fissile material compositions, densities, shapes, and reflectors. They can be sub-critical or super-critical, in which case significant radiation fluxes can be produced. This type of test resulted in several <b>criticality</b> <b>accidents.</b>|$|R
50|$|At least sixty <b>criticality</b> <b>accidents</b> {{have been}} {{recorded}} since 1945. These have caused at least twenty-one deaths: seven in the United States, ten in the Soviet Union, two in Japan, one in Argentina, and one in Yugoslavia.
