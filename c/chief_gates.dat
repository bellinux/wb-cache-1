The crowd was immense; the ramparts on this occasion were covered with people. It was an almost sultry night, with every star visible, and clear and warm and sweet. As the royal carriage crossed the drawbridge and entered the <b>chief</b> <b>gates,</b> the whole city was in an instant suddenly illuminated--in a flash. The architectural lines of the city walls, and of every street, were indicated, and along the ramparts at not distant intervals were tripods, each crowned with a silver flame, which cast around the radiance of day.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{they found}} {{themselves}} immediately beneath {{the walls of the}} town, they were not exposed to so murderous a fire as they had been on the bridge itself, but still the work was hot enough. 'Marie Jeanne' had been carried across with them, and was soon brought into play; they had still enough ammunition left to enable their favourite to show her puissance in battering against the <b>chief</b> <b>gates</b> of Saumur. The men made various attempts to get into the town, but they were not successful, though the gates were shattered to pieces, and the passage was almost free; the republican troops within were too strong, and their firing too hot. At last the blues made a sortie from the town, and drove the Vendeans back towards the bridge; M. de Lescure still kept his place in the front, and was endeavouring to encourage his men to recover their position, when a ball struck his arm and broke it, and he fell with his knee upon the ground. As soon as the peasants saw him fall, and found that he was wounded, they wanted to take him in their arms, and carry him at once back across the bridge, but he would not allow them.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWater is {{the major}} factor {{limiting}} the growth and development of many land plants, and stomata, composed of two guard cells, are the <b>chief</b> <b>gates</b> controlling plants’ water loss. Many environmental and physiological stimuli control stomatal opening, but they all do so through the regulation of guard-cell osmolarity. Increased guard-cell osmolarity leads {{to the opening of}} the stomata and decreased osmolarity causes the stomata to close. The prevailing paradigm is that sugars act as osmoticum in the guard cells, thereby contributing to the opening of the stomata. In contrast, we discovered that sugars close stomata via a non-osmotic mechanism. Furthermore, our results show that the guard cells’ response to sugars is dependent on the sugar-sensing enzyme hexokinase (HXK), which triggers the abscisic acid-signaling pathway within the guard cells, leading to stomatal closure. These findings reveal a feedback-inhibition mechanism that is mediated by a product of photosynthesis, sugar via HXK. HXK in the guard cells senses the sugar level and stimulates stomatal closure, thereby coordinating the sugar level with the rate of transpiration. Increased expression of HXK in guard cells decreases the transpiration rate and improves whole-plant water-use efficiency, with no negative effects on photosynthesis, growth or yield...|$|E
