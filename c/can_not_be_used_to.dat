2500|$|Lepuropetalon spathulatum {{entered the}} botanical {{literature}} in 1813 {{with the publication}} by Henry Muhlenberg of Catalogus Plantarum Americae Septentrionalis (Catalog of the Plants of North America). Muhlenberg named the plant Pyxidanthera spatulata, but it is now known that Lepuropetalon {{is not related to}} Pyxidanthera, the latter {{being a member of the}} family Diapensiaceae in the order Ericales. Muhlenberg's name is, in any case, considered a nomen nudum because his description <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> identify the plant. Muhlenberg's information on this plant, and probably some specimens as well, almost certainly came from his friend and correspondent, Stephen Elliott of South Carolina. Parts of the herbaria created by Elliott and Muhlenberg are still preserved, but the specimens of Lepuropetalon are lost from both of them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} of the Milbanke Sound Cones and to other volcanoes throughout British Columbia is not clear. In some classifications, they are grouped with the Anahim Volcanic Belt because they are parallel with its east-west trend. However, this grouping is not widely accepted because the volcanoes are much younger than other magmatic features at {{the western end of}} the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The cause of this significant age change is because the Anahim Volcanic Belt has its origins from the North American Plate moving over the hypothesized Anahim hotspot. This is a mantle plume that is likely responsible for volcanism throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt. Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older west of Nazko Cone, indicating that the North American Plate is moving in a westerly direction with respect to the hotspot, carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of [...] to [...] per year. Thus the hotspot model <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> explain the formation of the Milbanke Sound Group. However, the volcanic group is near the remnants of a 14nbsp&to 12nbsp&million year old magmatic feature that is interpreted to define the westernmost end of the Anahim hotspot track.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deliberations}} of the Senate committee {{are expected}} to last for several weeks, before they reach a decision. According to the Severino law, which became enacted by the Monti government in December 2012, anyone sentenced to {{more than two years}} in prison is deemed ineligible to hold public office for a period of six years (or eight years if convicted for [...] "abuse of power"), and should immediately be expelled from the parliament. Berlusconi has argued that the Severino law <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> expel persons convicted for crimes committed before December 2012, and pleaded for the proceedings to be postponed until the European Court of Human Rights or Italy's constitutional court had ruled, {{whether or not he was}} correct about his interpretation of the law. Berlusconi also stated that he in any case had decided to appeal the court ruling against him to the European Court of Human Rights, as he still claimed the ruling itself to be a political and unjust attempt by his opponents, to deprive him of his political power. The response by Prime Minister Enrico Letta's centre-left Democratic Party was however to reject Berlusconi's plea, accusing him of only launching time-wasting maneuvers. Berlusconi's PDL party then made a threat to withdraw their support for the government if the Senate committee expelled Berlusconi as senator. The Democratic Party replied by warning the PDL that they would reject any blackmail attempts, and in any case only would vote in the Senate committee according to the standard of the Italian law. Ahead of the Senate committee's voting, the leading criminal lawyer Paola Severino, who helped design the Severino law, stated to the La Repubblica newspaper that this specific law in her professional opinion clearly also applied for crimes being committed before its enactment in December 2012.|$|E
