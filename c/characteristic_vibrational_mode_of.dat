The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns reveal that the ZnO nano/microrods are of hexagonal wurtzite structure. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of ZnO powder shows only one significant spectroscopic band at around 417 cm- 1 associated with the <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> Zn-O bonding. The thickness 75 - 300 nm for ZnO nanorods and 0. 2 - 1. 8 Î¼m for microrods are identified from SEM/TEM images. UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnO nano/microrods show the blue shift. The UV band and green emission observed in photoluminescence (PL) spectra are due to free exciton emission and singly ionized oxygen vacancy in ZnO. Finally, the mechanism for organic-free hydrothermal synthesis of the ZnO nano/microrods is discussed. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The interactions between proteins and nanoparticles mainly involve secondary structure changes, which are {{reflected on the}} band of amide I ~[*] 1650  cm− 1 (which may shift a bit) or amide II ~[*] 1550  cm− 1. However, there were no obvious changes of peak position around 1650 or 1550  cm− 1 of ESM before and after MnO 2 was involved, which {{was different from the}} previously reported results that could demonstrate the structural change of protein [53].

30|$|In brief, Raman {{microspectroscopy}} is nowadays {{a broadly}} established technique for materials analysis {{and has been}} shown to be a powerful analytical tool in the context of art conservation and archaeological science, with significant results concerning pigment identification [4 – 7]. It offers high sensitivity and specificity enabling analysis of a wide variety of inorganic and organic materials, often directly on the object under study, non-invasively, in a short time and with very high spatial resolution. The basis for identifying different materials derives from the <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> molecules/materials and their corresponding frequencies, which are recorded in Raman spectra. These frequencies are highly specific enabling one to discriminate hardly distinguishable materials [8, 9] or even different crystal phases of the same minerals [10].

Considering field archaeological or conservation work with a Raman spectrometer, a number of factors needs to be taken into account concerning mobility, operational flexibility and robustness, analytical capabilities and cost [11].|$|R

In case of the opal matrix (densely packed silica spheres, pore diameter up to ~ 50 nm), crystallization of the ferroelectric BaTiO 3 appeared in coexistence with the amorphous phase, but the penetration depth of the crystalline BaTiO 3 was limited. From the apparent temperature independence of the effective wide-frequency dielectric response due to the essentially temperature independent effective soft mode stiffened to ~ 100 cm- 1, we can deduce that no macroscopic percolation of the crystalline BaTiO 3 has appeared in our opal matrix.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [21073168, 21290193]; National Basic Research Program of China [2011 CB 808501]This work {{presents}} a theoretical {{insight into the}} variation of the site-specific intermolecular hydrogen-bonding (HB), formed between C=O group of fluorenone (FN) and O-H groups of methanol (MeOL) molecules, induced by both the electronic excitation and the bulk solvent effect. Through the calculation of molecular ground- and excited-state properties, we not only demonstrate the characters of HB strengthening induced by electronic excitation and the bulk solvent effect but also reveal the underlying physical mechanism {{which leads to the}} HB variation. The strengthening of the intermolecular HB in electronically excited states and in liquid solution is characterized by the reduced HB bond-lengths and the red-shift IR spectra accompanied by the increasing intensities of IR absorption corresponding to the <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> the O-H and C=O stretching. The HB strengthening in the excited electronic states and in solution mainly arises from the charge redistribution of the FN molecule induced by the electronic excitation and bulk solvent instead of the intermolecular charge transfer. The charge redistribution of the solute molecule increases the partial dipole moment of FN molecule and the FN-MeOL intermolecular interaction, which subsequently leads to the HB strengthening. With the bulk solvent effect getting involved, the theoretical IR spectra of HBed FN-MeOL complexes agree much better with the experiments than those of gas-phase FN-MeOL dimer. All the calculations are carried out based on our developed analytical approaches for the first and second energy derivatives of excited electronic state within the time-dependent density functional theory...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} experimental techniques used in two-dimensional (2 D) infrared (IR) spectroscopy, outlines how third-order nonlinear response of a multi-level vibrational system is calculated, and provides a detailed methodology of line shape analysis in 2 D spectroscopy. Specific emphasis is given to inherent sensitivity of 2 D spectroscopy to correlated spectral broadening. The signatures of highly correlated transition energy fluctuations in a model system of two strongly coupled carbonyl stretching vibrations are reflected by the elongation of the cross peaks along the diagonal of the 2 D spectrum. The dynamics of this correlation is monitored by {{the changes in the}} 2 D line shapes and successfully modeled using a correlated spectral diffusion model. The sensitivity of 2 D IR spectroscopy to interactions between multiple vibrational coordinates is also explored in conformationally complex polypeptides and proteins with well-defined secondary structures. 2 D IR spectroscopy of β-hairpins and globular proteins with antiparallel (AP) β-sheet domains is studied to identify 2 D markers of AP β-sheet conformation. The experiments on β-hairpins and proteins with varying percentage of β-sheet character showed that the formation of cross peaks between the two <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> AP β-sheets is a marker of AP β-sheet secondary structure.

The effect of Fe-doping concentration on the physical behavior of ZnO thin films were analyzed and discussed. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns exhibited hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure without any secondary phases for all the films irrespective of the doping concentration. However, the preferential orientation changed from (002) to (101) plane with increase of Fe-doping. The Raman spectroscopy studies showed the peaks at 338  cm- 1, 438  cm- 1 and 574  cm- 1 which are the <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> ZnO.

The optical properties revealed that the films with lower Fe-doping concentration (≤ 2  at. %) showed high transmittance and wide band gap than the pure and highly Fe-doped ZnO films. The evaluated band gap showed a red shift upon doping with the energy band gap decreased from 3. 24  eV to 3. 01  eV for the investigated doping concentration range.

X-Ray diffraction data revealed that both undoped and doped samples crystallize in the tetragonal rutile phase with CoO phase in doped samples. The lattice parameters of doped samples calculated from XRD data do not vary much when compared to undoped one indicating that Co has not substituted the host lattice. The surface morphology investigated by SEM indicates the cluster formation in Co-doped (1 and 3 at. %) nanoparticles and the chemical composition of the samples were analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). UV-Vis spectrum of undoped system showed absorption at 408 nm (3. 04 eV), which is red shifted by 0. 56 eV compared to bulk SnO 2 (3. 6 eV) due to the cluster nature of the sample. The UV-Vis spectra of doped samples showed absorption in the visible region due {{to the formation of}} CoO phase, which is also evident from the XRD spectra. PL spectra showed characteristic UV emission at 409 nm and blue emission at 480 nm. The <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> SnO 2 were studied from FTIR analysis. EPR measurement of Co-doped (3 at. %) SnO 2 nanoparticles showed the paramagnetic behavior which may be attributed to the occupation of Co 2 + ions in the interstitial site rather than the substitutional site. The absence of ferromagnetism is due to the high doping concentration of Co (> 1 at. %) and also due to the high annealing temperature which destroys the hyperfine splitting.

30|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{oxidation}} degree of IOMNPs, we have analyzed the IOMNPs by means of Raman spectroscopy. This technique {{has emerged as a}} powerful tool for the investigation of oxide nanostructures, being capable to discern between different phases of IOMNPs [48]. As it can be seen in Fig.  5 b (spectrum a), the Raman spectrum acquired on IOMNP powder exhibits peaks around 374, 497, and 708  cm− 1. The relative positions of the peaks and the overall shape of the spectrum resemble to that of maghemite (spectrum c in Fig.  5 b), which was obtained by annealing the magnetite powder at 250  °C for 4  h [48]. Note that, upon annealing, the color of the magnetic powder has changed from black to brown, which is characteristic to maghemite phase. The further annealing of the magnetite powder at 550  °C for 6  h induces the formation of hematite. The spectrum e in Fig.  5 b clearly exhibits the <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> hematite [48]. Moreover, the transformation of magnetite into hematite can also be induced by the excitation laser of the Raman spectrometer [49]. Increasing the laser power to its maximum value (150  mW) and the integration time to 20  s leads to the occurrence of different peaks corresponding to hematite phase (spectrum b in Fig.  5 b). For instance, the apparition of a second-order longitudinal phonon mode around 1300  cm− 1 (spectrum b in Fig.  5 b)—a feature characteristic to hematite phase (spectrum e in Fig.  5 b) [49, 50]—confirms the conversion of magnetite intro hematite upon laser excitation. The same laser treatment applied to maghemite powder gives rise to the occurrence of two peaks of low intensity at small wavenumbers characteristic to hematite phases, whereas the three peaks of maghemite are better resolved (spectrum d in Fig.  5 b). Since the maghemite phase is much more stable than magnetite, one can believe that a complete conversion into hematite will require higher energy. It can be thus concluded that IOMNPs are Fe 3 O 4 whose surface is oxidized in maghemite.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} spectroscopic {{approaches to}} study the thermal unfolding dynamics of proteins. The spectroscopic tool is nonlinear infrared (IR) spectroscopy of the protein amide I band. Among various nonlinear IR techniques, two-dimensional infrared (2 D IR) spectroscopy, which is an IR analogue of 2 D NMR, is the most informative. A 2 D IR spectrum is obtained from a double Fourier transform of the heterodyned third-order nonlinear signal, which is generated by three consecutive interactions between femtosecond IR pulses and the vibrations of the system. This technique is sensitive {{to the presence of}} P-sheet structure in proteins through the formation of cross peaks between the two <b>characteristic</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> 0 -sheets. In this work, 2 D IR spectroscopy is used to measure equilibrium thermal unfolding of ribonuclease A and ubiquitin. For transient unfolding studies, the temperature of the solution is rapidly raised by a nanosecond temperature jump (T-jump) laser, which is followed by probing structural changes of proteins with dispersed vibrational echo (DVE) spectroscopy or 2 D IR spectroscopy. (cont.) DVE spectroscopy is a homodyne measurement of the third-order signal, in which the spectrum is related to a projection of a complex 2 D IR spectrum onto one of the frequency axes (03). In spite of its reduced dimension measurement, DVE spectroscopy is sensitive enough to be utilized in transient probing with less experimental challenges. From transient thermal unfolding studies of ubiquitin probed by DVE spectroscopy, complicated non-exponential relaxations are observed on the microsecond timescale, which are followed by ms unfolding. Non-exponential relaxation is interpreted as downhill unfolding of a transient species populated around the top of a barrier (transition state) due to the barrier shift caused by a rapid T-jump. Variations in the unfolding transition state of ubiquitin are further investigated with temperature-dependent T-jump experiments and mutation studies. Experimental conclusions are supported by calculations of the unfolding free energy surfaces using statistical mechanical modeling. T-jump 2 D IR spectroscopy is also performed to remove ambiguities in the projected domain of DVE spectroscopy and provide a new spectroscopic measure for transient unfolding through line-broadening analysis. by Hoi Sung Chung.

As an alternative to solution-based techniques in Raman spectroscopy, we have found that a sandwich architecture in which a surface assembled monolayer (SAM) of 4 -mercaptobenzoic acid (4 -MBA) is sandwiched between a 100 nm thick gold substrate and electrostaticaly immobilized gold nanocubes allows for more reproducible data as well as enhancement factors up to 1013.

With this non-energetic detection method we find a significantly lower activation energy for H/D exchange [...] 3840 ± 125 K [...] than previously reported. Very likely {{this is due to the}} amorphous nature of the interstellar ice analogues involved. This provides reactive timescales (τ 70 K) fast enough for the process to be important in interstellar environments. Consequently, an astronomical detection of D_ 2 O will be even more challenging because of its potential to react with H_ 2 O to form HDO. Furthermore, additional experiments, along with previous studies, show that proton/deuteron swapping also occurs in ice mixtures of water with other hydrogen bonded molecules, in particular on the OH and NH moieties. We conclude that H/D exchange in ices is a more general process that should be incorporated into ice models that are applied to protoplanetary disks or to simulate the warming up of cometary ices in their passage of the perihelion, to examine the extent of its influence on the final deuteron over hydrogen ratio.

The amplitudes <b>of</b> the <b>vibrational</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> undamaged plates are compared to the <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> amplitudes <b>of</b> damaged plates and are shown to be clearly different. VBASS plates for testing are damaged either by a blunt impact to the ceramic plate surface or cracked using a machine-shop press. Data from these tests will be used to design a prototype hand-held device for the nondestructive testing (NDT) of the VBASS plate structural integrity. VBASS plates are used as proof-of-principle samples in the absence of vest body armor samples...|$|R
