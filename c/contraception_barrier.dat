40|$|Background: Family {{planning}} programs, researches, {{and studies}} have focused mainly on women with little attention to men′s role in the contraceptive choices by the couple. Men′s exclusion from these programs has serious implications on the acceptance and use of contraceptives by the couple. Objective: To {{determine the influence of}} male partners on contraceptive use of their spouses. Subjects and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study at a Tertiary Care Centre in Lagos, Nigeria. It was conducted from January 1 to April 30, 2010, where all consecutive consenting pregnant women were given structured questionnaires to give to their partners so as to evaluate the contribution of the male partners to contraceptives use in their spouses as well as assess their awareness and knowledge of contraception. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square test or Fisher′s exact test as appropriate while continuous variables by t-test. P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Of the 370 respondents, only 51. 9 % (192) knew about female contraceptive methods, while 50 % (185) were willing to allow their wives to use <b>contraception.</b> <b>Barrier</b> method (17. 3 %) and periodic abstinence (15. 7 %) were the leading preferred choice for their wives. However, bilateral tubal ligation was the least preferred method (1. 6 %). Previous counseling of male partner significantly influenced their decision to allow their wives to use contraceptives (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: Involving the male partner in family planning counseling {{plays an important role in}} increasing the acceptance and use of contraceptives by the couple...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether use of hormonal contraceptives is associated with cervical dysplasia and cancer in a population where there is widespread use of hormonal contraception and the rates of cervical cancer remain high at 27. 5 / 100, 000. Methods A case-control {{study was conducted}} among women visiting the colposcopy and gynaelogical clinics at a tertiary referral hospital. Two hundred and thirty six cases CIN I (72), II (59), III (54), cancer (51) and 102 controls, consented and were interviewed on use of contraceptives using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) associated with use of hormonal contraception in cases and controls and in low and high risk cases. Recruitment was carried out from 2001 – 2002. Results Contraceptives used were: oral contraceptives – 35 %, injections (depot medroxy progesterone acetate (Depo-provera) – 10 %, Intrauterine devices – 2 %, combinations of these and tubal ligation – 30 %. 23 % reported use of 'other' methods, barrier contraceptives or no form of <b>contraception.</b> <b>Barrier</b> contraceptive use was not significantly different between cases and controls. Current and/or past exposure to hormonal contraceptives (HC) by use of the pill or injection, alone or in combination with other methods was significantly higher in the cases. In multivariate analysis with age and number of sexual partners as co-variates, use of hormonal contraception was associated both with disease, [OR, 1. 92 (CI 1. 11, 3. 34; p = 0. 02] and severity of the disease [OR, 2. 22 (CI 1. 05, 4. 66) p = 0. 036]. When parity and alcohol consumption were added to the model, hormonal contraception was no longer significant. The significant association with high risk disease was retained when the model was controlled for age and number of sexual partners. Depo-provera use (with age and number of sexual partners as covariates) was also associated with disease [OR, 2. 43 (CI 1. 39, 4. 57), p = 0. 006] and severity of disease [OR 2. 51 (1. 11, 5. 64) p = 0. 027]. With parity and alcohol added to this model, depo-provera use retained significance. Exposure to HC > 4 years conferred more risk for disease and severity of disease. Conclusion Hormonal contraception did confer some risk of dysplasia and women using HC should therefore be encouraged to do regular Pap smear screening. </p...|$|E

40|$|RECENT {{research}} in developing countrieshas revealed that men can play animportant role {{in deciding whether}} or not women use a family planning method. 1 - 3 National contraceptive prevalence surveys for many developing countries now include interviews with male respondents and include questions related to communication between partners about family planning. 4 Existing studies show that men’s role varies greatly according to cultural and social context. 5 In the USA, among couples who choose both tubal occlusion and vasectomy, 6 - 10 the woman {{plays a key role}} in the decision to have a vasectomy. Among couples who have chosen vasectomy, women are more likely to have discussed the procedure with their partners and to have known a satisfied vasectomy user before the choice was made. 6, 9 Although vasectomy is an important alterna-tive to female sterilisation for couples who want a permanent method of <b>contraception,</b> <b>barriers</b> to its wider use exist in many places. Service providers who believe men are not interested and who consequently limit information and access are a principal constraint; other barriers are negative attitudes and misinformation. Yet even in Latin America and Africa, where few family planning policymakers believed vasec-tomy would ever be used, experience has shown that when information and services are pro-vided, men will seek out and use vasectomy. 11, 12 Between 1992 and 1995, a qualitative, exploratory study on the vasectomy decision was conducted in four countries where vasectomy prevalence was relatively low – Bangladesh, Kenya, Mexico and Rwanda – and two where vasectomy prevalence was relatively high – Sr...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{emergency}} contraceptive pills are available over the counter, {{the quality of}} consultation, including key areas of contraceptive counseling and prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI), has not been well documented. Objective: To evaluate actual pharmacist services while dispensing emergency contraception through a mystery shopper technique. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 81 pharmacies situated in Delhi by 4 trained mystery shoppers posed as customers over a period of 6 months. Results: None of the pharmacists asked about the time lapsed since last unprotected sexual intercourse or last menstrual period before deciding the eligibility of the customer. The majority were unclear about side effects associated with emergency contraception (78. 57 %) or with anticipated changes in menstrual flow (78. 57 %); 85. 71 % did not know whether subsequent unprotected intercourse would be protected. Only 15. 71 % counseled shoppers regarding risk of STI on asking leading questions and 88. 5 % did not provide any contraceptive advice.

40|$|Contraceptive {{compliance}} {{is defined}} as the correct use (according to the method specific prescriptions given by a medical professional and/or in written form as patient information leaflet) of a contraceptive method. Non-compliance describes a mismatch between the real behaviour of a user and the correct or ideal behaviour. There are various indicators that in general contraceptive compliance is far from ideal. Many studies report a rate of unintended pregnancies of 50 %, half of them terminating in abortion. The abortion rate remains high even in countries with availability of advanced contraceptive technology. Especially with hormonal <b>contraception</b> and <b>barrier</b> methods the gap between correct and real use is large. Discontinuation rates per year reach up to 50 %. Reasons for Non Compliance are (a) Lack of motivation to prevent a pregnancy due to ambivalence regarding the wish for a child as well as sexual and relationship issues (b) Cognitive factors (False information, misconceptions, irrational fears) (c) Difficult or lacking access to contraceptive methods (d) Behavioral errors and mistakes (Forgetting, loosing etc.) and (e) Side effects of the methods used. Three strategies to improve compliance can be distinguished: (a) Improving counselling; (b) Developing contraceptive methods which demand a low level of compliant behaviour by the user; (c) Improving quality of life of users by minimizing the negative side effects and maximizing the non contraceptive health benefits...|$|R
