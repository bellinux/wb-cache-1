25|$|The old {{sandstone}} parapet of {{the bridge}} overlooking the site of Cunninghamhead railway station has many carvings on it, probably made {{over the years by}} local children and pupils from the primary school as they waited and watched the old steam and diesel trains going by on this long <b>closed</b> <b>line.</b> Extensive cattle sidings and docks can still be made out here (2006). Ayrshire or Cunninghame cattle were sent from here to all parts of the United Kingdom and Empire beyond. Ayrshire cattle were sent from nearby Wheatrig Farm to restock the Falkland Islands after the war with Argentina.|$|E
25|$|The Croxley Rail Link is {{a railway}} {{engineering}} {{project in the}} Watford and Three Rivers districts of Hertfordshire, England. The result will connect the two urban lines serving Watford, the London Overground and the London Underground Metropolitan line, at , improving interchange between lines. The Metropolitan line Watford tube terminal station will close, and the line will be diverted and extended from Croxley tube station to Watford Junction via a reopened section of <b>closed</b> <b>line.</b> Two new stations will be built on the reopened line. The main proponent of the scheme is Hertfordshire County Council, {{with the support of}} Transport for London (TfL) which owns the Watford branch.|$|E
25|$|With many {{passengers}} travelling north-south {{through the}} city centre having to walk or use a shuttle bus between Central and Queen Street stations, SPT has long proposed a direct rail link between the North Clyde system and the lines radiating from Glasgow Central (High Level). This would allow direct service from Renfrewshire and Ayrshire stations to Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level), and would also allow new cross-city services such as Airdrie to Paisley. The plan would involve re-opening to passenger traffic the freight-only City Union Line between Shields Junction and Bellgrove, and building a new curve between Gallowgate and High Street. Reopening of the <b>closed</b> <b>line</b> from Strathbungo to Gorbals would allow trains from Barrhead and East Kilbride to use Crossrail. Funding for the scheme {{has yet to be}} sought, and the project remains a long term aspiration only.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} the quake, the Metro stopped {{service and}} {{completely}} shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people {{to get out of the}} tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to get where they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Taxqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were <b>closed.</b> <b>Line</b> 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, local groups {{who opposed the}} closure {{gathered}} together {{for a series of}} meetings at Leicester Central railway station and the Main Line Preservation Group (MLPG) was formed. There had been talk of restoring the entire <b>closed</b> <b>line</b> from [...] to , but this was rationalised to a section from [...] to Leicester and later, because British Rail retained the single track between Loughborough and Ruddington for British Gypsum freight and access to the now-closed Ministry of Defence base, the group's plans focussed on the Loughborough to Leicester section. The published aim of MLPG was [...] "to acquire a suitable length of main line, for the operation of steam hauled passenger trains, at realistic speeds". Work began on salvaging as much reusable material as possible for the project from the recent demolitions.|$|E
