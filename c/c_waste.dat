Construction and demolition waste is currently {{one of the most}} significant problems facing the Irish construction industry. The volume of construction and demolition (<b>C</b> &D) <b>waste</b> generated in Ireland has continually increased since the publication of the first <b>C</b> & D <b>waste</b> estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 1995. The most recent <b>C</b> & D <b>waste</b> volume published by the EPA in 2001 estimated that 3. 6 million tonnes of <b>C</b> & D <b>waste</b> was generated in that year. There is a lack of Irish sourced <b>C</b> & D <b>waste</b> statistics for the estimation of <b>C</b> & D <b>waste</b> volumes on a national basis, and within construction companies. Construction waste volumes are estimated by the EPA using waste data from Irish waste management facilities, and <b>C</b> & D <b>waste</b> rates from the United States.

40|$|The direct grout {{alternative}} {{is a viable}} option for treatment/stabilization and disposal of salt waste containing Cs- 137 concentrations of 1 - 3 Ci/gal. The composition of the direct grout salt solution is higher in sodium salts and contains up to a few hundred ppm Cs- 137 more than the current reference salt solution. However it is still similar to {{the composition of the}} current reference salt solution. Consequently, the processing, setting, and leaching properties (including TCLP for Cr and Hg) of the direct grout and current saltstone waste forms are very similar. The significant difference between these waste solutions is that the high cesium salt solution will contain between 1 and 3 Curies of Cs- 137 per gallon compared to a negligible amount in the current salt solution. This difference will require special engineering and shielding for a direct grout processing facility and disposal units to achieve acceptable radiation exposure conditions. The Cs- 137 concentration in the direct grout salt solution will also affect the long-term curing temperature of the waste form since 4. 84 Watts of energy are generated per 1000 Ci of Cs- 137. The temperature rise of the direct grout during long-term curing has been calculated by A. Shaddy, SRTC. 1 The effect of curing temperature on the strength, leaching and physical durability of the direct grout saltstone is described in this report. At the present time, long term curing at 90 degrees C appears to be unacceptable because of cracking which will affect the structural integrity as evaluated in the immersion test. (The experiments conducted in this feasibility study do not address the effect of cracking on leaching of contaminants other than Cr, Hg, and Cs.) No cracking of the direct grout or reference saltstone waste forms was observed for samples cured at 70 degrees C. At the present time the implications of waste form cracking at elevated curing temperatures has not been fully addressed. The direct grout falls within the definition of NRC Class <b>C</b> <b>waste.</b> NRC requires that Class <b>C</b> <b>waste</b> forms or their containers demonstrate structural integrity to qualify for disposal.
