40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} textural relationships in hydrated upper mantle peridotites emplaced at a non-constructive ridge segment. Development of serpentinites and partially serpentinized peridotites {{takes place in}} four main stages: (1) pervasive serpentinization forming mainly lizardite, (2) a tensional stage forming chrysotile + talc + chlorite, (3) a deformational stage forming antigorite + tremolite, and (4) a late local tensional stage forming another generation of chrysotile veinlets. Mineral chemistry of serpentine pseudomorphs reflects in part primary mineral compositions. Olivine pseudomorphs are typically nickeliferous and depleted in aluminum and chromium. Orthopyroxene pseudomorphs have lower nickel contents and relatively high iron, aluminum, and <b>chromium</b> <b>contents.</b> Clinopyroxene pseudomorphs have very low nickel contents and relatively high aluminum and <b>chromium</b> <b>contents.</b> These chemical patterns in the serpentinites {{can be used to}} help discriminate between harzburgitic and lherzolitic protoliths. Oxygen isotopes and mineral parageneses suggest serpentine is derived from circulation of hydrothermal (200 °C) fluids through the peridotite body. Crystallization of tremolite, talc, and chlorite may have occurred at temperatures up to 525 °C if C 02 /H 20 ratios were less than 0. 25.
