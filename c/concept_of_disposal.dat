40|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> {{of nuclear}} fuel waste in {{crystalline}} rock requires {{the effects of}} microbial action to be investigated. The Underground Research Laboratory excavated in a pluton of the Canadian Shield provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study these effects. Three biofilms kept moist by seepage through fractures in granitic rock faces of the Underground Research Laboratory have been examined. The biofilms contained a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive morphotypes held together by an organic extracellular matrix. Nutrient levels in the groundwater were low, but energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy has shown biogeochemical immobilization of several elements in the biofilms; some of these elements were concentrated from extremely dilute environmental concentrations, and all elements were chemically complexed together to form amorphous or crystalline fine-grained minerals. These were seen by transmission electron microscopy to be both associated with the surfaces of the bacteria and scattered throughout the extracellular matrix, suggesting their de novo development through bacterial surface-mediated nucleation. The biofilm consortia are thought to concentrate elements both by passive sorption and by energy metabolism. By Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, one of the biofilms showed that iron was both oxidized and precipitated as ferrihydrite or hematite aerobically and reduced and precipitated as siderite anaerobically. We believe that some Archean banded-iron formations could have been formed {{in a manner similar to}} this, as it would explain the deposition of hematite and siderite in close proximity. This biogeochemical development of minerals may also affect the transport of material in waste disposal sites...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the thermal}} {{impact on the}} {{hydromechanical}} behaviour of the host rock is one important issue {{in the design of}} underground storages for high level radioactive wastes. The increasing temperature inevitably affects the rock mass behavior with the generation of overpressure and associated mechanical effects. Consequently, it is essential for the designer of an underground storage to have appropriate knowledge of the coupled thermal and hydromechanical behaviour of the rock mass. The French Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) has carried out some research on the mechanical and hydraulic phenomena of rock masses subjected to temperature. The main investigation was performed in the Meuse/Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory (M/HM URL), built in a Callovo-Oxfordian claystone formation. An in situ thermal experiment called TER is performed in the M/HM URL and studied in this paper. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> cells studied by ANDRA for high level activity wastes consists of horizontal micro-tunnels 40 m long and 70 cm in diameter, in which temperature could reach up to 90 °C at the wall. In TER experiment, the level of temperature is similar to the one forecast for concept. The experiment is monitored with several temperature, pore water pressure and deformation/displacement sensors. Prior to the field test, the Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model and the FLAC 3 D numerical code are used for the prediction and interpretation of the measurements. The influence of in situ stress state and a set of basic parameters involved in thermo-hydromechanical processes are discussed via a parametric study. The principal results of the in situ measurements and the numerical analyses of the thermo-hydromechanical behaviour of the underground storage are presented in this paper...|$|E

In this paper, as a direct <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> spent nuclear fuels for deep geological disposal concept, the rod consolidation from spent fuel assembly for the disposal efficiency was considered and analyzed. To do this, a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> spent fuel rod consolidation was described and the related <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> canister and disposal system were reviewed. With these concepts, several thermal analyses were carried out to determine whether the most important requirement of the temperature limit for a buffer material was satisfiedin designing an engineered barrier of a deep geological disposal system.

40|$|Present <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> {{low-level}} {{aqueous wastes}} (LLAW) that contain {{much of the}} fission-product tritium from light water reactors involve dispersal to the atmosphere or to surface streams at fuel reprocessing plants. These concepts have been challenged in recent years. Deep-well injection of low-level aqueous wastes, an alternative to biospheric dispersal, {{is the subject of}} this presentation. Many factors must be considered in assessing its feasibility, including technology, costs, environmental impact, legal and regulatory constraints, and siting. Examination of these factors indicates that the technology of deep-well injection, extensively developed for other industrial wastes, would require little innovation before application to low-level aqueous wastes. Costs would be low, of the order of magnitude of 10 ⁻⁴ mill/kWh. The environmental impact <b>of</b> normal deep-well <b>disposal</b> would be small, compared with dispersal to the atmosphere or to surface streams; abnormal operation would not be expected to produce catastrophic results.

40|$|Radioactive waste exists {{now and it}} will {{continue}} to be produced in the future. In nuclear countries, it results mainly from the nuclear power industries and in some cases from military programs. In the future, in these countries, it will also come increasingly from the decommissioning of facilities that have reached the end of their life, or have become redundant. In non-nuclear countries, radioactive wastes come from medical. Industrial and research uses of radioactive materials. Radioactive waste can be short- or long-lived depending on its intrinsic rate <b>of</b> decay. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> geologic <b>disposal</b> for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, both which are long-lived, involves deep underground repositories that ensure security, i. e. isolation of the waste from malicious or accidental disturbance, and containment of the waste over very long times.

40|$|Concepts for {{the final}} <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> {{radioactive}} wastes are abstract models based upon available basic research data and known technology. The geosciences {{play a major role}} in their development because most involve deep burial below the biospere as well as estimates of the future effects of geological processes over long periods of time (10 3 - 10 6 yr). Disposal concepts are best classified for geological discussion according to two criteria: type of waste and regional significance. Waste type determines the volume of material to be treated and the necessary Containment times, and leads to (1) concepts for low-active waste (LAW) without alpha-emitters (large volume, Containment time ⇐ 10 3 yr) and (2) concepts for high-active waste containing long lived alpha-emitting isotopes (small volume, containment time 10 5 - 10 6 yr). Regional significance defines the organisational framework and leads to (A) <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> burial in the continental crust within national boundaries (strongly dependent on local geological conditions) and (B) <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> in unpopulated, biologically inactive areas on an international basis (directed by global geoscientific considerations). A 2 and B 2 concepts present the greatest difficulties in attempts to turn them into research and development programmes and pilot projects which are both politically acceptable and scientifically sound.

40|$|Spent fuel is an {{inevitable}} residue {{of the production}} of electricity by nuclear power. The main strategies of spent fuel management include the spent fuel direct disposal route and the reprocessing route. Today a new strategy of partitioning and transmutation is being pursued {{for the management of}} long lived actinides and fission products, that can in the future be separated. However, even if this route is successful, it will never be possible to burn all of them in advanced fuel cycles.

40|$|<b>Disposal</b> <b>of</b> spent {{nuclear fuel}} and long lived {{radioactive}} waste in deep clay geological formations {{is one of the}} promising options worldwide. In this <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the geological <b>disposal</b> system, the Boom Clay is considered as a potential host rock when designing a generic waste repository in the Netherlands. For design and evaluation of a repository for geologic <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> nuclear wastes one of its principal concern is the thermal loading. High-level radioactive waste and spent fuel generate considerable amounts of heat. When those waste types are disposed in a geological repository the elevated thermal effect on the behaviour of soils surrounding nuclear waste disposal give rise to change in hydraulic and mechanical properties is a significant factor for repository design. Understanding these time-dependent phenomena processes in relation to both the effects of pore water dissipation and of the thermal expansion is essential for reliably assessing repository performance and evaluating the safety case.

40|$|Cementitious {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> radioactive waste <b>disposal</b> facilities. During the lifetime <b>of</b> these <b>disposals,</b> those materials will undergo physicochemical degradations. To assess their impacts, reactive transport modelling is used. Reactive transport codes modify the transport properties based on the modelled porosity evolution by using Archie's law as a feedback between porosity and diffusive properties. These laws are not suited to cementitious materials, whose pore structure is complex and expands {{over a wide range}} of pore sizes. The ultimate goal of this research is about developing a microstructure-based feedback relation for the diffusive properties of complex porous structures such as cementitious ones. Therefore, we developed an algorithm designed to generate numerical microstructures representative of simplified cement pastes and performed an experimental campaign consisting of dedicated experiments. A random-walk algorithm is used to compute the effective diffusion coefficients of our numerical microstructures. This paper investigates the description of the initial numerical microstructure and how transport properties are sensitive to different microstructural features that can be controlled from the designed algorithm. Simulations both on the experimental microtomograph and the generated microstructures allow to show that our models are complete to describe the microstructure and diffusion transport property of simplified cementitious materials. Sensitivity analysis is also provided, whose results show that a simple feedback relation cannot properly describe these transport properties. This gives confidence in our approach and its future extension toward the description of cementitious material degradations. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Compacted {{bentonite}} {{is proposed}} as an engineered barrier in many <b>concepts</b> for <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> high level nuclear waste.

Radiation induced effects on sorption were in general more noticeable for Co(2 +) than for Cs(+), which generally showed {{no significant differences between}} irradiated and unirradiated clay samples. For Co(2 +) however, the sorption to irradiated MX 80 was significantly lower than to the unirradiated clay samples regardless of the experimental conditions. This implies that gamma-radiation may alter the surface characteristics contributing to surface complexation of Co(2 +).

Experts {{from around the world}} agree that deep geologic <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> nuclear waste in a mined repository is the most environmentally sound means of removing these potential sources of radiation from interaction with the biosphere. Of the 360 millirem of background radiation received annually by the average American, from both natural and man-made sources, less than 1 millirem results from the nuclear fuel cycle. Spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, destined for geologic disposal, are located at 126 sites in 39 states. The proposed repository site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is far more isolated from the general population than any sites where these radioactive materials are presently located. Only solid forms of high-level wastes will be transported for disposal in a geologic repository. For more than 50 years, nuclear materials have been safely transported in North America, Europe, and Asia, without a single significant radiation release. Since the 1950 s, select panels from the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council and interagency advisory groups, and international experts selected by the OECD/Nuclear Energy Agency, have examined the environmental, ethical, and intergenerational aspects <b>of</b> nuclear waste <b>disposal,</b> plus alternatives to geologic disposal.

Due to the phase-out from nuclear energy in Germany the number of boreholes could be less than 100. A simplified, generic safety concept, and the requirements for the diameter of boreholes and containers are derived in this paper. Furthermore, the operational safety of emplacement, the retrieval of waste and sealing of the boreholes is discussed.
