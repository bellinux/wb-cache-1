The aim of this survey is to discover recreational and tourist activity of Scottish residents Main Topics : Variables The Scottish Tourism and Recreation Survey, 1973 consists of three groups of files: the Home Interview files, the Holidays files and the <b>Cordon</b> <b>Survey</b> files. The Home Interview Survey files (SN: 2490) are based on 6938 interviews with 169 questions covering general matters, day trips, outdoor recreation, short stays, additional holidays, Scottish main holidays and theatre. The Holidays files (SN: 2491) amalgamate data from both the Home Interview Survey files and the <b>Cordon</b> <b>Survey</b> files. Each case corresponds to a holiday, including short holidays and winter and early spring holidays for Scottish residents. The <b>Cordon</b> <b>Survey</b> files (SN: 2492) are {{based on interviews with}} holidaymakers as they were leaving Scotland by rail, coach, ferry and plane. Different questionnaires were used at each cordon type, based on a common set of questions. The files consist of direct interview data, self-administered questionnaire data and route map and accommodation diary data...|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} the {{establishment}} survey provides {{a panoramic view of}} freight production and attraction in the metropolitan area of Medellin. Although the <b>cordon</b> <b>survey</b> showed that about 33, 000 tons enter and leave the area of study every day, the establishment survey shows that about 7000 tons are transported between small and medium size establishments; and 1000 tons have a destination outside the region, then the freight movement inside the metropolitan area reaches 6000 ton/day. In terms of trips, the bulk is generated by urban deliveries. Small establishments produce and attract 94, 000 trips which is about 6 times the near 17, 000 truck trips captured in the external <b>cordon</b> <b>survey.</b> In contrast, the tonnage entering and leaving the region is near 12 times the tonnage produced and attracted inside the MMA. Considering the number of trips and cargo, we noticed that large establishments (establishments with more than 200 employees) is not the main source of the freight traffic, but the large number of trips of small vehicles are produced inside this area to distribute the cargo.|$|E
30|$|The data {{collection}} resulted in 2947 establishments (4.4 % {{of the total}} establishments in the city), a <b>cordon</b> <b>survey</b> of 2950 commercial vehicles (17 % of the total vehicle volume) accessing the urban area, and carrier interviews to ten companies and 130 truck drivers. The results indicate that a total of 33, 274 metric tons/day enter the study area, 35, 240 tons/day leave the area; while 7000 tons/day are distributed in the study area. In terms of freight trips, 6600 trips/day enter the study zone and 6600 trips/day leave it.|$|E
30|$|This section {{presents}} the descriptive {{analyses of the}} data. The {{first part of the}} section describes the results for the <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys,</b> while the second {{presents the}} results for the establishments, and carriers, surveys. The results should be analyzed as a global finding because each freight survey complements the rest.|$|R
30|$|Carrier interviews: to {{complement}} the establishment and <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys,</b> a carrier survey was applied to ten companies and 130 truck drivers at the urban area to validate some practices of behavioral aspects of the urban deliveries and logistics practices for different industry sectors. The survey {{was done with the}} help of the police, which collaborated in this process in 2012.|$|R
40|$|For {{successful}} {{prediction of}} traffic load, necessary in infrastructure design, {{it is important}} to gather a lot of data. We gather them with traffic counts and with surveyees participating in traffic surveys. This diplom work deals with different data collection methods such as manual and automatic count method, origin-destination surveys, stated-preference <b>surveys,</b> roadside interviews, <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys,</b> screen-line surveys, travel diary surveys and travel times. Diplom work also describes data collection procedures for all listed methods, points out potential mistakes and errors in procedures that can arise during a survey and describes corrections, additions and confirmations of validity of this data...|$|R
3000|$|This paper {{describes}} the process followed and {{presents the results}} obtained from a multilayer data collection approaches based on Holguín-Veras and Jaller [1]. This approach includes a <b>cordon</b> <b>survey,</b> an establishment-based survey, and a carrier survey. This gathering of freight data is essential to city planning due to the economic implications of it. The study presented here {{provides an example of}} how the freight information collected in Medellin was used to obtain freight patterns of this developing city, and eventually the process could be applied in similar urban areas. 2 [...]...|$|E
3000|$|The {{results of}} the <b>cordon</b> <b>survey</b> show that {{considering}} all the cargo in the city, the amount of freight moved per person in the Medellin Metropolitan Area is about 25  kg/day (total cargo divided by population), without {{taking into account the}} freight passing through the region. This value is an interesting indicator related to the intensity of freight activity and consumption patterns in the region. 4 The amount of cargo consumed by person in a city is related to the proportion of freight activity (population and number establishments) in the regions and to the purchasing power of people. 5 [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} the <b>cordon</b> <b>survey</b> provide a {{panoramic}} view of freight flows of the MMA. The results show that 33, 274 tons enter the metropolitan area every day; 35, 240 tons leave it, and additionally, 27, 653 are external to external flows. An additional 2400 tons of trash as well as 8000 tons of construction materials waste (debris) are produced and transported every day within the metropolitan area. 3 The external-internal and internal-external flows are similar (30 % of the total each) and 85 % of the cargo is transported by trucks. Inside the region, 15 % of the cargo is composed by the flows between small establishments, debris, and trash.|$|E
30|$|Cordon survey: During {{the week}} days, {{it is common}} that about 50 % of the traffic {{entering}} the city is comprised of large trucks, thus the importance of measuring the entering flows though <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys</b> [4]. The questionnaire should contain questions about origin and destination of the trip, commodities being transported (quantity, unit, weight, and industrial sector) and the commercial vehicle being used (vehicle type, vehicle configuration, number of axels, number of stops per tour, capacity, percentage of cargo transported, and load factor).|$|R
30|$|This {{paper is}} based on the work done by Holguín-Veras, et al. [5]. The authors {{identified}} the main freight demand modeling techniques, determined their main data requirements, proposed a data collection methodology combining multiple methods, measuring different units and targeting multiple agents to obtain a comprehensive view of freight activity. In doing so, the authors proposed a data collection framework that includes establishment-based surveys (receiver, shipper, and carrier), trip intercept-based <b>surveys,</b> <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys,</b> vehicle-based surveys, and tour-based surveys. They suggested that the data collected should meet the expectation of the planning agency that is going to use them, should be cost-efficient, should be oriented to fill data gaps, and become the basis for freight demand synthesis. In other words: “the best approach will be the combination of data collection procedures (that best fits the needs and constraints of the participating agencies)” [5].|$|R
30|$|Carrier interviews: to {{complement}} the establishment and <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys,</b> a carrier survey should be conducted to companies and truck drivers at the urban area to validate some practices of behavioral aspects of the urban deliveries and logistics practices for different industry sectors. The questionnaire should contain questions about trip details and patterns of goods and service vehicles; conveyance of goods between vehicles and establishments; and supply chain management between establishments, their suppliers and freight transport operators. The survey {{should be done with}} the help of the private sector officials of the city to facilitate the process.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze freight {{generation}} and freight trip generation {{patterns in the}} metropolitan area of Medellin, Colombia; and to suggest how these freight patterns should be considered for future planning decisions. In doing so, this study presents the basic freight data collection techniques used to depict all the complexity of freight distribution in metropolitan areas. The studies consisted in an external <b>cordon</b> <b>survey</b> to catch the cargo entering and exiting from the area; an establishment survey applied to small and medium size commercial establishment to study the internal movement of cargo; and a series of interviews to some companies of carries and trucks drivers with the objective of precise some logistics practices and to have a more deep knowledge of the urban freight generation. All these surveys complement each other, and must be conducted to have a good depiction of the freight movements in urban areas.|$|E
30|$|Direct {{estimation}} {{enables the}} reconstruction exclusively {{of the present}} demand, without any capacity for future prediction. Strictly speaking, the O–D matrix is not directly observable in its entirety. Indeed, given the huge quantity of data to be collected, carrying out a census would not be economically doable even if, in certain instances, technically feasible. Thus, direct estimation actually consists in making use of sampling techniques together with inferential statistics methods for extending the information content of a sample to the whole analysed system. Different kinds of surveys may be carried out such as on-board <b>surveys</b> (also called <b>cordon</b> <b>surveys</b> if aimed at estimating the crossing demand), household surveys, destination surveys and (e)mail surveys. Additionally, in recent years, given the exponential growth {{in the field of}} Information and Communications Technology (ICT), further survey methods have been developed, namely CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviewing), CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing) and CAWI (computer-assisted web interviewing). However, whatever the approach adopted, as shown by [179], a preparatory design phase of the survey is required. Such a phase consists in first defining the sampling unit and the sampling strategy, which could generally be simple random sampling, stratified random sampling or cluster sampling. Then, according to the sampling method adopted, it is necessary to set up the sample size and the estimator to be applied.|$|R
30|$|<b>Cordon</b> survey: The <b>survey</b> was {{conducted}} between October and November of 2011 to 2950 commercial vehicles (17 % {{of the incoming}} flow) in 11 tollbooths in the boundaries of Medellin to capture the flows entering and exiting the city. The surveys were conducted, for security and practical purposes from 6  AM to 7  PM {{and with the help}} of the highway police.|$|R
40|$|Planning Board (TPB) engaged Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (VHB) {{to review}} how high-growth MPOs {{forecast}} productions and attractions at external stations. TPB {{is interested in}} considering alternative approaches for forecasting external trips. The current 6, 800 square-mile TPB 2, 191 traffic analysis zone (TAZ) system contains 47 external stations. TPB’s last auto external survey was conducted in 1994 and consisted of a license plate survey of inbound vehicles crossing the expanded cordon, and a follow-up mail-out/ mail-back postcard survey that yielded 16, 000 responses. TPB’s last truck external survey was conducted in 1996 and consisted of 5, 000 surveyed trucks at 12 sites near the <b>cordon.</b> All <b>surveyed</b> trucks were inbound except at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge) in Anne Arundel County, where information was collected from outbound trucks (east to the Eastern Shore of Maryland). Together these two surveys form the current external trip base data for the TPB model. The literature review and survey of MPOs resulted in {{the conclusion that the}} methodology for forecasting future external trips is not a “hot ” issue at this time and thus, is not receiving very much attention either from MPOs or the transportation research community. MPOs are quit...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{planning}} in the Greater Copenhagen Region (have {{over the last}} 10 years mainly been supported by the so-called OTM traffic model. The behavioural models in OTM include advanced state-of-the-art utility-based formulations, which are combined with base-matrices in a pivot-correction procedure. Before and after studies of specific projects have shown, that these matrices might be the Achilles heal of the whole model system. Vuk and Hansen (2006) therefore validated the present version of the OTM traffic model (version 4. 0 from summer 2000) and concluded that a major drawback of the model was indeed outdated base 1992 matrices. From January 2005 to March 2007 the OTM model has therefore been in a large-scale process of updating where creation of new trip matrices has been the main focus. The article describes the undertaken methodology for constructing the travel matrices for Copenhagen, and how the improved matrices influence {{the performance of the}} model. A main focus in the work has been to utilise various data sources for estimation of the new matrices. This includes telephone <b>survey</b> data, <b>cordon</b> line <b>surveys</b> and existing transport surveys to construct the base matrices, traffic counts to adjust these, and digital network databases. The article also demonstrates a new approach to adjust public transport matrices to counts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a trip {{distribution}} model is proposed, {{based on the}} concepts of conventional trip distribution, linear regression analysis and power transformation on the independent variable. The proposed model takes into consideration the relationship between trips from an origin to a destination (dependent variable) and attraction of the destination (independent variable). Regression analysis is {{used to determine the}} parameters of the relationship which is optimized by varying the power parameter. Regression parameters and the optimum power parameter are used in formulating the trip distribution model. The functional form of the proposed model has a generalized application. Distinctive models can be derived from the generalized model by using appropriate independent variables to suit the given data. Therefore, this model is termed as Generalized Power model for trip distribution. In this paper two typical applications of the model are given as examples. Both models have been developed using <b>cordon</b> origin-destination (O-D) <b>survey</b> data of Red Deer in Alberta. The paper includes discussion of results and conclusions. ...|$|R
40|$|Road pricing schemes are principally {{based on}} cordon-based pricing. Earlier studies have {{demonstrated}} that the performance of cordon schemes is critically dependent on <b>cordon</b> location. However, <b>surveys</b> of those designing such schemes indicate that they are opting for the simplest designs, in the interest of acceptability, and may well be overlooking designs which achieve greater economic benefit. A set of analytical procedures has been developed for identifying the locations for imposing charges and the charges at those points which are optimal in terms of economic efficiency. These are demonstrated on a simplified network of Cambridge. Tests on a larger network confirm that performance is very sensitive to cordon location. However, they also show that charging points selected by even a simple analytical procedure can achieve economic benefits around 50 % higher than predefined cordons, and that relaxing the requirement to have uniform charges at all charging points can produce further substantial increases in economic benefits. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cargo Terminal {{which has}} 70 units space is holding control of freight {{passing through the}} city center and {{as a place of}} loading and {{unloading}} of goods vehicles which do not have a warehouse. However, the activity of loading and unloading of goods is still widely practiced in the right of way which causes traffic jams. This triggers the Denpasar government to develop Terminal Kargo Denpasar  so as to supply the demand for parking and loading and unloading activities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the characteristics of the parking and future parking needs in developing Terminal Kargo Denpasar . The method used to obtain data through direct surveys such as  inventory <b>survey</b> and <b>survey</b> <b>cordon</b> parking and secondary data obtained from the relevant agencies. The analysis shows the volume of parking of vehicles is 44, 5 vehicles / hour, parking capacity is 36 vehicles / hour, parking supply as much as 372 vehicles and 4 for Parking Index that indicates there has been a problem of parking in the Terminal Cargo Denpasar. It is show Terminal Kargo Denpasar  has been unable to supply activity goods vehicles. The amount of the parking requirements for development of Terminal Kargo based on parking characteristic analysis are 101 spaces...|$|R
