25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) {{has been known for}} a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission.</b> It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the role of Rituximab in eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) in HCL patients after a pre-treatment with 2 -chloro-deoxy-adenosine (2 -CdA). Ten patients received four cycles of Rituximab after administration of Cladribrine. Before starting anti-CD 20 antibody, two patients were in complete remission, six in partial remission and two showed no significant response to Cladribrine. All cases resulted IgH-positive. Median time from the last 2 -CdA infusion was 5. 7 months. Eight of 10 patients [four in partial remission (PR), two in complete remission (CR) and two unresponsive after 2 -CdA] were evaluable for response. Two months after the end of anti-CD 20 therapy, all evaluated patients presented a <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission.</b> Moreover, Rituximab increased percentage of molecular remission up to 100 % 1 yr after the end of treatment.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and adverse effects of lenalidomide in the treatment of inter-mediate‑ 1 risk non‑ 5 q deletion [non‑del (5 q) ] myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A total of 30 patients with MDS were classified through G‑banding chromosome karyotype analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). According to the International Prognostic Scoring System scores, among the 30 patients, 23 and seven cases had scores of 0. 5 and 1. 0, respectively. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®), 10 mg/day) was administered for 21 days every 28 days. All 30 cases were treated with lenalidomide for at least three cycles, including 20 cases with four cycles. The patients did not require erythropoietin, cyclosporine or iron chelation treatments. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 13. 0, and comparisons among groups were conducted using a t‑test. The efficacy of lenalidomide was demonstrated in patients with intermediate- 1 risk non-del (5 q) MDS. Peripheral blood cell counts were improved following treatment, and absolute neutrophil, haemoglobin and platelet counts increased following 2 ‑ 4 cycles of treatment. All patients became stable having undergone three cycles of treatment; however, 17 patients with chromosomal abnormalities had no cytogenetic response to the treatment, as confirmed through the FISH test.

In CEL with FIP 1 L 1 -PDGFRA (n = 16) or various PDGFRB fusion genes (n = 5), <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> (CHR) was achieved in 95 % (20 / 21) after 3 months. Complete molecular remission (CMR) was seen in 75 % (12 / 16) of cases with FIP 1 L 1 -PDGFRA positive CEL by 6 months, and in 87 % (13 / 15) after 12 months. CMR was achieved in three of five PDGFRB fusion positive patients after 3, 9 and 18 months respectively. All patients are currently on imatinib (100 mg; n = 13, 400 mg; n = 8) and no molecular relapse has yet been observed (median 26 · 7 months; range, 6 · 9 – 39 · 9). Imatinib was less effective in HES and CEL without known molecular aberration (n = 15); CHR was observed in 40 % (6 / 15) of patients, two patients relapsed after 4 · 8 and 24 · 5 months. Three patients died due to imatinib-resistant progressive CEL (n = 2) or myocardial infarction (n = 1) unrelated to study treatment.

40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{this works}} is the {{presentation}} of two cases of relapsed Ph positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) to which the tyrosine inhibitor Imatinib (Glivec, Novartis) was applied. This therapy was earlier shown to be very helpful {{in the treatment of}} chronic myeloid leukemia. Case discriptionCase 1 : A 17 year old patient with Ph positive T-ALL relapsed after allogenic transplantation of marrow and was treated with Imatinib in escalating doses from 200 to 600 mg per day. After 4 weeks of treatment the blastosis in the marrow had fallen from 96 % to 7 %. Blasts disappeared from the cerebrospinal fluid. At the same time, progression of hepatic and renal failure related to GVHD was observed. Imatinib withdrawal resulted in relapse, uncontrolled proliferation and the death of the patient. ResultsCase 2 : Imatinib was used {{in the case of a}} 45 year old patient with Ph positive null-ALL and a mediastinal tumour. After autologous bone marrow transplantation, Imatinib therapy was begun for maintenance [...] Daily doses of the drug amounted to only 200 mg owing to associated gastric complaints. After two months of therapy, an increase in blast cells in the bone marrow to 18 % was noted. FLAM chemotherapy was given and <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> was achieved.

40|$|Background and aims: We {{report a}} case of a 27 -year-old male {{affected}} by acute myeloid leukaemia MLL-PTD positive. After autologous stem cell transplantation, he was monitored based on cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus 6 (HHV- 6) DNA quantification in blood. Relapse occurred one year after transplantation; then the patient underwent to allogenic bone marrow transplantation using genotypically HLA-identical donor (sister). HHV- 6 DNAemia was positive and persistently elevated, either after autologous either after allogenic transplant suggesting the occurrence of HHV- 6 chromosomally integration. The work aim is to prove the occurrence of chromosomally integrated-HHV- 6 (ci-HHV- 6). Materials and Methods: HHV- 6 DNA extraction was performed by automated extractor and DNA was amplified-quantified by Real Time polymerase chain reaction. Species identification was performed by sequencing HHV 6 -U 100 glycoprotein using automated sequencer and sequencing products were analysed using the Blast program. Results: After autologous transplantation HHV 6 -DNAemia was 5. 4 log copies/mL setting to 3. 9 log copies/mL for a long period post allogenic transplantation. The patient’s hair follicles were tested for HHV- 6 DNA having positive results. Sequences of both strains of HHV 6 extracts from blood and hair follicles resulted species B. HHV 6 viral load decreased significantly after Lymphocyte Infusion by ci-HHV 6 negative donor (sister), having steady viral load during the following six months of monitoring. One year later, patient is in <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission.</b> Conclusions: Detection of HHV- 6 in hair follicles and HHV- 6 DNAemia persistently elevated before allogenic transplant, confirm the occurrence of ci-HHV- 6. The observed important decreasing viral load is potentially due to the successful engraftment of ci-HHV- 6 -negative donor marrow after allogeneic transplant...|$|E
40|$|The clonality {{of mature}} {{peripheral}} blood-derived myeloid and lymphoid cells and bone marrow haemopoietic progenitors from 18 females with myelodysplasia (MDS) (five refractory anaemia, RA; one RA with ringed sideroblasts, RARS; three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, CMML; four RA with excess of blasts, RAEB; five RAEB in transformation, RAEB-t) was studied by X-chromosome inactivation analysis. Using the human androgen-receptor (HUMARA) assay, we analysed the clonal patterns of highly purified immature CD 34 + 38 - and committed CD 34 + 38 + marrow-derived progenitors, and CD 16 + 14 - granulocytes, CD 14 + monocytes, CD 3 + T and CD 19 + B lymphocytes from peripheral blood. In high-risk patients (RAEB, RAEB-t), clonality {{analysis was performed}} before and after intensive remission-induction treatment. All patients, except one with RA, had predominance of a single clone in their granulocytes and monocytes. The same clonal pattern was found in CD 34 + progenitor cells. In contrast, CD 3 + T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14 / 18 patients. X-chromosome inactivation patterns of CD 19 + B cells were highly concordant with CD 3 + T cells except for two patients (one RA, one CMML) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes, therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of MDS and a B-cell disorder in these particular patients. After high-dose non-myeloablative chemotherapy, polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission.</b> Therefore we conclude that most haematological remissions in MDS are associated with restoration of polyclonal haemopoiesis. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the last}} decade the {{importance}} of ethnicity, socio-economic and gender differences in relation to disease incidence, diagnosis, and prognosis has been realized. Differences in these areas have become a major health policy focus in the United States. Our study was undertaken to examine the demographic and clinical features of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients presenting initially at the LAC+USC Medical Center, which serves an ethnically diverse population. Results Patients were evenly split by gender, overwhelmingly Hispanic (60. 9 %), and quite young (median age 39, range 17 – 65) compared with previously reported CML patient populations. Previous CML studies identified significant anemia (Hgb 450 × 10 9 /l), and significant leukocytosis (WBC > 50 × 10 9 /l) as significant adverse pretreatment prognostic factors. Using these indicators, {{in addition to the}} validated Hasford and Sokal scores, patients were stratified and analyzed via gender and ethnicity. A significantly greater proportion of women presented with significant anemia (p = 0. 019, Fisher's exact test) and significant thrombocytosis (p = 0. 041, Fisher's exact test) compared to men, although no differences were found in risk stratification or treatment response. MCV values for women were significantly (p = 0. 02, 2 -sample t-test) lower than those for men, suggesting iron deficiency anemia. Focusing on ethnicity, Hispanics as a whole had significantly lower Hasford risk stratification (p = 0. 046, Fisher's exact test), and significantly greater likelihood (p = 0. 016, Fisher's exact test) of achieving 3 -month <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> (CHR) compared with non-Hispanics at LAC+USC Medical Center, though differences in treatment outcome were no longer significant with analysis limited to patients treated with first-line imatinib. Conclusion Female CML patients at LAC+USC Medical Center present with more significant adverse pre-treatment prognostic factors compared to men, but achieve comparable outcomes. Hispanic patients present with lower risk profile CML and achieve better treatment responses compared to non-Hispanic patients as a whole; these ethnic differences are no longer significant when statistical analysis is limited to patients given imatinib as first-line therapy. Our patients achieve response rates inferior to those of large-scale national studies. This constellation of findings has not been reported in previous studies, and is likely reflective of a unique patient population. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: AL {{amyloidosis}} {{and multiple}} myeloma result in extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar protein in tissues and organs. Untreated median survival {{has been documented}} at 12 months. Cardiac infiltration decreases survival to five months. Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) {{have been shown to}} improve survival when <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> is documented. This study aimed to assess if remission could result in cardiac structural improvement. Methods: 269 patients were treated with BMT for amyloidosis from 1997 to 2010. Cardiac amyloidosis was identified in 30 patients by echocardiographic criteria. Echocardiography was performed before and after BMT. Results: Thirteen of 30 patients with cardiac amyloidosis died during follow-up. No change in cardiac structure was seen in 11 patients. Average survival was 49 months from BMT for non-responders. Fifteen patients had cardiac normalisation (responders). The average time to normalisation was 25 months. Only two responders died. Average survival for responders was 71 months (p < 0. 0001 compared with non-responders). Normalisation of cardiac structure was highly predictive of survival (Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test p= 0. 0025, relative risk 0. 18). Conclusions: Cardiac amyloidosis patients with <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> after chemotherapy and BMT may subsequently normalise cardiac structure and function.

High doses of prednisolone led to remission of the renal disease but <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> did not occur. Persisting pancytopenia and repeated infections terminated in sepsis, {{two years after the}} onset of MDS. Patient 2, who had refractory anemia with clonal monosomy 19, manifested bowel disease, hepatospleno- megaly, anaemia and non-organic specific autoantibodies. Prednisone led to both clinical and <b>haematological</b> <b>remission.</b> Haematologic disease relapsed 12 months later, when nephrotic-range proteinuria, haematuria and mild azotaemia were also found. Corticosteroid treatment led to long-lasting renal and haematologic remission, maintained by a small dosage of prednisone. In both patients renal biopsy findings were consistent with those seen in idiopathic NS. A Medline search disclosed 16 cases of glomerulopathy in the course of MDS in adult patients. Clinical features included NS, usually accompanied by renal insufficiency with either acute, chronic, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. On biopsy, membranous nephropathy, crescentic or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and AL amyloidosis, were found. We conclude: (1) that glomerular disease may be present and should be searched for in patients with MDS; (2) that MDS can be added to the list of rare conditions associated with corticosteroid-responsive NS in children...|$|R
40|$|Chronic myeloid leukaemia is {{a chronic}} {{myeloproliferative}} disorder characterised by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and thereby {{formation of the}} Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib mesylate (STI- 571) is a potent and selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and {{has emerged as a}} treatment of choice in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients in chronic phase. It has shown activity in CML patients in the chronic phase or blastic phase. However there is poor penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) by the drug or its active metabolites. Therefore the CNS acts as a sanctuary site for malignant cells for CML patients treated with Imatinib. We report cases of two CML patients on Imatinib therapy, who were in <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> but developed CNS disease...|$|R
40|$|Seventeen adult {{patients}} with previously untreated {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} (ALL) were entered into a schedule of chemotherapy in which 3 combinations, each of 4 drugs, were administered in a predetermined cyclical rotation in combination with cranial irradiation and intrathecal injections of methotrexate. Of the 17 patients, 16 completed induction therapy and 15 (94 %) entered remission. The only patient with T-ALL died before receiving any therapy. The median survival for all patients (17) was 22 months. Meningeal leukaemia did not occur during the <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> phase although 3 patients developed this complication following relapse. The authors conclude that the addition of cyclophosphamide and cytosine arabinoside to vincristine/prednisone provides excellent remission induction but the aggressive maintenance schedule employed has not led to significant long-term survival...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study on 190 children with {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} and marrow relapse on therapy demonstrated a universally poor prognosis with {{a high risk of}} extramedullary leukaemia. 49. 1 % of children achieved a second remission, the median duration of <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> being 97 days. The median duration of survival was 157 days, with no survivors beyond 2 years 3 months from relapse. Children with high white blood counts at diagnosis, those relapsing early and older children had a particularly poor prognosis. Children who achieved a first remission with difficulty and those receiving regular vincristine and prednisolone in their remission were less likely to achieve a second remission. Those who failed to go back into remission with the more commonly used drugs were not usually responsive to other drugs...|$|R
40|$|Out of 64 {{consecutive}} unselected {{patients with}} acute myeloid leukaemia studied during 1973 - 6, five developed clinical evidence of {{spread to the}} central nervous system (CNS). Neuroradiological examination showed cerebral deposits in three, in whom rapid symptomatic relief was obtained with radiotherapy. In two of these patients who developed solid intracranial deposits <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> could be reinduced or maintained; they were still alive 86 and 134 weeks later. When patients presented with spread to the CNS complicating generalised uncontrolled leukaemia they had short survivals. CNS infiltration may respond dramatically to appropriate treatment provided that it is not associated with generalised uncontrolled leukaemia, which has a poor prognosis. In view of this, routine "prophylaxis" of the CNS in adult acute myeloid leukaemia does not seem justified at present...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{positive}} Philadelphia chromosome adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with a novel unbalanced translocation t(17; 19), leading to trisomy of 17 q 21 -qter. The patient did not obtain <b>complete</b> <b>haematological</b> response and died {{a few months after}} diagnosis. The significance of the 17 q 21 -qter trisomy, resulting from this novel translocation, and its possible role in the progression of the leukaemia is discusse...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 18 -month-old girl with renal and cardiac manifestations of {{atypical}} haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS), and a novel complement factor H mutation. Transient <b>haematological</b> <b>remission</b> was achieved with intensive plasmapheresis, but cardiac function deteriorated and renal function was not restored. Initiation of eculizumab after 6  months of dialysis significantly improved organ function. At 43  months after presentation, haematological values had normalised and cardiac function had improved. Dialysis was discontinued after 10  months (the longest reported time in a patient with aHUS) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate had recovered to 70  mL/min/ 1. 73  m(2). In conclusion, treatment of aHUS with eculizumab, even after long-term dialysis, can significantly improve renal function. Discontinuation of dialysis and resolution of cardiac function has implications on the potential recovery and treatment choice of such patients. Earlier initiation of eculizumab, however, might have prevented the irreversible renal sclerosis and cardiac dysfunction. status: publishe...|$|R
