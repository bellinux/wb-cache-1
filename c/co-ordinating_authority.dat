5000|$|Until {{at least}} the 16th century, {{individual}} Officers of State had separate property, powers and responsibilities granted with their separate offices by Royal Command, and the Crown and the Privy Council constituted the only <b>co-ordinating</b> <b>authorities.</b> In England, phrases such as [...] "cabinet counsel", meaning advice given in private, in a cabinet {{in the sense of}} a small room, to the monarch, occur from the late 16th century, and, given the non-standardised spelling of the day, it is often hard to distinguish whether [...] "council" [...] or [...] "counsel" [...] is meant. The OED credits Francis Bacon in his Essays (1605) with the first use of [...] "Cabinet council", where it is described as a foreign habit, of which he disapproves: [...] "For which inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice of France, in some kings’ times, hath introduced cabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease". Charles I began a formal [...] "Cabinet Council" [...] from his accession in 1625, as his Privy Council, or [...] "private council", and the first recorded use of [...] "cabinet" [...] by itself for such a body comes from 1644, and is again hostile and associates the term with dubious foreign practices.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1977 The Martin Report's {{proposal}} that {{the control of}} teacher education outside universities should be by statutory state Boards of Teacher Education funded partly by the Commonwealth, was initially rejected. However the states gradually relinquished some control as the demands for expanded teacher education facilities became more urgent. At the same time, the Commonwealth Government, anxious to assist smaller colleges of advanced education and their growth prospects, offered substantial funding for teacher education within smaller c. a. e. 's. In Victoria, pressure from the principals and staffs of the teachers' colleges through their respective associations led to negotiations for the independence of teachers' colleges. An advisory Teacher Education Authority was proposed by the Education Department as an initial step {{in the evolution of}} teachers' colleges to independence. Later, an Education Department Committee proposed the formation of a Victoria Institute of Teacher Education, as the umbrella authority supervising independent member colleges with their own Councils. These latter proposals would finally constitute the basis of the State College of Victoria Act. In 1970, the Minister of Education established the Victorian Fourth University Committee which considered the possibility of established teachers' colleges forming a multi-campus fourth university. However the question of the relationship between a fourth university and teachers' colleges was left unresolved by a substantially divided committee, so the Minister accepted the view of the V. F. U. C., supported by the V. A. P. T. C. and the C. T. C. S. A. (V.) that the colleges establish a separate <b>co-ordinating</b> <b>authority.</b> The Minister established a Committee of Advice to help implement the proposal. In the meantime, the Commonwealth Government announced significant policy alterations to the funding of teacher education. State teachers' colleges which were being developed as self-governing tertiary institutions under the supervision of an appropriate <b>co-ordinating</b> <b>authority</b> would be funded on the same basis as universities and colleges of advanced education. By the end of 1972 the State College of Victoria Act was passed by the Victorian Government. The teachers' colleges outside Education Department control, which included Melbourne Kindergarten Teachers' College, four Catholic teachers' colleges and Mercer House (Associated Teachers' Training Institution), had actively participated in the negotiations for an independent <b>co-ordinating</b> <b>authority.</b> With the support of the State Government and the funding of the Commonwealth Government, Melbourne Kindergarten Teachers' College had little difficulty negotiating entry as a foundation member of the S. C. V. Four Catholic teachers' colleges joined together to form the Institute of Catholic Education and applied for admission as a single entity to the S. C. V. Negotiations for its entry, which extended over eighteen months, were finally successful. Its success was considerably enhanced when the Commonwealth Government offered funding to approved 'private' teachers' colleges. In the meantime, Mercer House negotiated for entry to the S. C. V. as a separate entity without success, but finally agreed to amalgamate with the S. C. V. at Toorak in 1975. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|E
40|$|Business {{networks}} {{consist of}} several independent businesses that enter into interrelated contracts, conferring on the parties {{many of the}} benefits of co-ordination achieved through vertical integration in a single firm, without creating a single integrated business such as a corporation or partnership. Retail franchises are one such example of a network, but the most common instance is a credit card transaction between a customer, retailer, and the issuer of the card. How should the law analyse this hybrid economic phenomenon? It is neither exactly a market relationship - because that overlooks the co-ordination, relational qualities and interdependence of the contracts - nor is it a type of business association or company, since it lacks a centralised <b>co-ordinating</b> <b>authority</b> that receives the residual profits. This book is a translation of Gunther Teubner's classic work on networks, setting out his novel legal concept of 'connected contracts'. In it he explains how this concept addresses the problems posed by networks, such as the question whether the network as a whole can be held legally responsible for damage that it causes to third parties such as customers. A substantial introduction by Hugh Collins explains the analysis of networks in the context of German law and the systems theory from which Teubner approaches the topic. The introduction also explores how far the concept of connected contracts might assist in the common law world, including the UK and the USA, to address the same problems that arise in cases involving networks. As well as making a contribution to comparative law and legal theory, the book will be of interest to scholars interested in contract law, commercial law and the law of business associations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{investigating}} the means which rule the social worker’s choice of institution placing youths and how they match the youth’s individual need compared with the type of home. The questions were: Which significance has the characteristics of the youth and their family for the placing? Which significance has the characteristics of the institution? Which significance has the social workers’ way of working, investigation, theories, economy etc. ? A qualitative way of interviewing has been used. Eight interviews were done; six with social welfare secretaries who place youths and two social workers who work with coun­selling and placement. The choice of respondents was made from a systematic selection be­cause they were considered having knowledge of the subject. The interviews were taped, which enabled several revisions. Then concentrations and structural analysis were made in order to look for both common and deviant patterns in the material. The analysis and inter­pretation is based upon the theory of risk, behaviour, response and systems alongside with earlier studies in the subject. The conclusions were that there was a combination of factors which ruled the choice: the need of the youth, earlier experience of institutions, and pro­fes­sional network connections. The social welfare secretary realized the importance of matching but saw difficulties in acute placing and shortage of places. In order to facilitate for the social welfare secretary there is a need for a system where they can get objective informa­tion about the institutions for example from a <b>co-ordinating</b> <b>authority.</b> Syftet med studien var att undersöka vad som styr socialarbetarens val av institution vid pla­cering av ungdomar och hur de matchar behandlingshem utifrån ungdomens individuella be­hov. Frågeställningarna var: Vilken betydelse för placeringen har egenskaper hos ungdomarna och deras familjer? Vilken betydelse för placeringen har egenskaper hos institutionen? Vilken betydelse för placeringen har socialtjänstens arbetssätt, utredningar, teorier, ekonomi mm? En kvalitativ intervjumetod har använts. Åtta stycken intervjuer gjordes varav sex med pla­ce­rande socialsekreterare och två socialarbetare med rådgivnings- och placeringsfunktion. Ur­valet av respondenterna gjordes utifrån ett systemiskt urval då respondenterna antogs be­sitta relevant kunskap i ämnet. Till grund för analys och tolkning ligger risk-, behovs- och respon­sivitetsteorin, systemteorin samt tidigare forskning i och omkring ämnet. Slutsatsen blev att det som styr valen av institution var en kombination av barnets behov, tidigare erfaren­het av institutioner och professionellt kontaktnät. Socialarbetaren insåg vikten av matchning men såg svårigheter vid akuta placeringar och platsbrist. För att underlätta för social­arbetaren behövs ett fungerande system där de kan få objektiv information om institu­tionerna som exempelvis en samordnande instans...|$|E

A good many of the ladies studied it in the Continental times, you know, when we had all those Martha Washington parties--or, I forgot you were out of the country--and it will be done perfectly. We're going to have the ball-room scene on the tennis-court just in front of the evergreens, don't you know, and then the balcony scene in the same place. We have to cut some of the business between Romeo and Juliet, because it's too long, you know, and some of it's too--too passionate; we couldn't do it properly, and we've decided to leave it out. But we sketch along through the play, and we have Friar Laurence coming with Juliet out of his cell onto the tennis-court and meeting Romeo; so that tells the story of the marriage. You can't imagine what a Mercutio Mr. Putney makes; he throws himself into it heart and soul, especially where he fights with Tybalt and gets killed. I give him lines there out of other scenes too; the tennis-court sets that part admirably; they come out of a street at the side. I think the scenery will surprise you, Miss Kilburn. Well, and then we have the Nurse and Juliet, and the poison scene--we put it into the garden, on the tennis-court, and we condense the different acts so as to give an idea of all that's happened, with Romeo banished, and all that. Then he comes back from Mantua, and we have the tomb scene set at one side of the tennis-court just opposite the street scene; and he fights with Paris; and then we have Juliet come to the door of the tomb--it's a liberty, of course; but we couldn't arrange the light inside--and she stabs herself and falls on Romeo's body, and that ends the play. You see, it gives a notion of the whole action, and tells the story pretty well. I think you'll be pleased." ...|$|R
40|$|Authority {{control is}} the {{backbone}} of the library catalogue and therefore a critical library activity. Experienced staff create authority records to assist users in their quest for information. The focus of this study is on authority control as a means of co-operation in academic library consortia using a union catalogue maintained by a Central Office for Authority Control. Literature studies were conducted on three sub-problems: the development of academic library consortia in South Africa, and various forms, characteristics and functions of academic library consortia in general; the characteristics, principals and objectives of authority control; and the functions of union catalogues with special reference to the role of Z 39. 50 within virtual union catalogues. The conclusion was that existing and new authority records should be made available as widely as possible within consortia through a union catalogue. It is however a partial solution, because not all the libraries within the consortium have the expertise to create new authority records. Two empirical studies were conducted. A cost analysis was done to determine the cost of creating and changing authority records within academic library consortia in South Africa, in order to choose a system within which authority control can be performed effectively and speedily. 						 Secondly, a questionnaire was sent to libraries in the United States to gather information on their experiences with regard to authority control, library co-operation in general, and virtual union catalogues. The United States was the natural choice because it could be regarded as the birthplace of modern library consortia. Inferences drawn from the information received was used to develop the structure and functions for a Central Office for Authority Control in academic library consortia in South Africa. It was found that authority control within an academic library consortium using a union catalogue could be conducted most cost-effectively and timeously through such a Central Office for Authority Control. The purpose of the Central Office would be to <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>authority</b> control within the consortium. Pooling available resources within the consortium would keep the cost of authority control as low as possible. Libraries with the required infrastructure and expertise would have the opportunity to create authority records on behalf of other libraries and be compensated for their services. Through such a Central Office more authority records created according to mutually accepted standards would be available for sharing within the consortium. Information ScienceD. Litt. et Phil.

40|$|Abstract—Residential {{broadband}} gateways (comprising modem, router, and WiFi access point), though individually consuming only 5 - 10 Watts of power, {{are significant}} contributors to overall network energy consumption due to large deployment numbers. Moreover, home gateways are typically always on, {{so as to}} provide continuous on-line presence to household devices for VoIP, smart metering, security surveillance, medical monitoring, etc. A natural solution for reducing the energy consumption of home gateways is to leverage the overlap of WiFi networks common in urban environments and aggregate user traffic on to fewer gateways, thus putting the remaining to sleep. In this paper we propose, evaluate, and prototype an architecture that overcomes significant challenges in making this solution feasible at large-scale. We advocate a centralized approach, whereby a single <b>authority</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> the home gateways to maximize energy savings in a fair manner. Our solution can be implemented across heterogeneous ISPs, avoids client-side modifications (thus encompassing arbitrary user de-vices and operating systems), and permits explicit control of session migrations. We apply our solution to WiFi traces collected in a building with 30 access points and 25, 000 client connections, and evaluate via simulation the trade-offs between energy savings, session disruptions, and fairness. We then prototype our system on commodity WiFi access points, test it in a two-storey building emulating 6 residences, and demonstrate radio energy reduction of over 60 % with little impact on user experience.

There are approximately 250 children and young people in public care in The Borough. In total, the study involved 66 children i. e. 22 looked-after children with criteria-defined emotional and behavioural difficulties at School Action Plus of the SEN Code of Practice or having a Statement of SEN for emotional and behavioural difficulties, 22 in Control Group 1 - children not in public care, but at School Action Plus of the SEN Code of Practice or having a Statement of SEN for EBD and 22 in Control Group 2 - children not in public care and not presenting emotional and behavioural difficulties. Measures of attainment, school attendance, fixed-term exclusion, authorised absence, unauthorised absence, behaviour and mental health were obtained. Statistical and descriptive differences and trends between and within all three groups were examined. Children's views regarding services received from the corporate parent were obtained. In turn, the interpretive views of representatives of the corporate parent about the children's views were elicited.

40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of the Petroleum industry on the North West Shelf of Western Australia has been comparatively rapid and raised concerns about its cumulative and regional impact on the marine environment. The present {{study was conducted to}} review environmental protection procedures in place for the Petroleum Industry on the North West Shelf and to suggest directions for policy formulation. A regional framework which would enable informed decision making in relation to petroleum exploration and development along the North West Shelf, while also maintaining and protecting the ecological integrity of the region, was a prime concern of this study. Base line studies for petroleum exploration and development proposals, together with annual and triennial environmental monitoring reports represent a substantial but currently largely unused resource. Little use has been made of this database because of limited staffing resources in the EPA and Mines Department. A major recommendation of the present study is that a thorough review of this database be undertaken. Moreover, it is recommended that the review be undertaken as a cooperative venture of the public and private agencies involved in the North West Shelf. Such a review will identify information gaps, ecosystem research priorities leading probably to significant changes in the type of information required in the future for Environmental Impact Assessment and subsequent monitoring programmes; It is also recommended that the cumulative impacts of the commercial and recreational fishing industries and the tourism industry on the North West Shelf should be more carefully assessed. Increasingly, the multi-purpose use of the North West Shelf for transport, petroleum exploration and development, fishing, recreation and conservation will require more sophisticated regional management. In the short term, an increased role for the Petroleum Environment Liaison Committee is envisaged. With the increasing complexity of these issues for regional management, it is recommended that in the medium term the establishment of a <b>co-ordinating</b> Regional Marine <b>Authority</b> be considered...|$|R
