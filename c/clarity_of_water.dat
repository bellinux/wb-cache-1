50|$|Though much of {{the state}} {{receives}} ample precipitation, there are several important spatial and temporal issues complicating the distribution of water. Due to the state's predominantly Mediterranean climate regime, precipitation is nearly entirely confined to the months between October and April, meaning that water sources can be intermittent from year to year. Furthermore the extremely fertile agricultural regions of the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California receive relatively little precipitation, while the coastal urban nexuses of Los Angeles and San Francisco receive adequate precipitation but lack storage capacity. Finally, the broad floodplains of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers require extensive hydrological engineering {{in order to be}} converted to agricultural land and to prevent flooding. In this environment <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> rights and fairness in distribution are essential, but competing rights doctrines and a system of adjudication based entirely on litigation defeated attempts to formally codify water rights.|$|E

40|$|Water {{turbidity}} is {{an important}} characteristic of surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents {{as well as a}} key indicator of water quality. Turbidity is the lack of <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> caused by microalgae and other particles that attenuates light. The cost of clarifying water can be high. This is primarily due to the physical and chemical steps that must be taken to remove the extremely small entrained particles and colloidal substances that cause high turbidity, and the large amounts of water that generally must be process for such small masses of entrained materials. This paper discusses the results of a series of experiments of a potentially new method of clarifying water by incorporating microfiltration through a high throughput filter operating under a centrifugal force. The results have shown that significant reductions in turbidity can be achieved at relatively high water flux values through a commercially available filter. This indicates the potential of the technology as a water clarifying method by means of this low energy separation device...|$|E

40|$|Turbidity is a {{measurement}} of the <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{that has been used}} as an indicator of the environmental health of water bodies (GIPPEL, 1989). This physical property of water is caused mainly by the presence of suspended solids, such as silt, clay, organic matter, plankton, microorganisms and colored substances that cause the incident light to be scattered and absorbed instead of transmitted through the water sample (SADAR, 1996; UNITED STATES, 1999). It {{has been used as a}} surrogate measure of suspended solids in water analyses, in monitoring programs of water quality (LEWIS, 1996; SADAR, 1996; ORWIN; SMART, 2005). A detailed description of the principles of turbidity measurement and instrument designs can be found in SADAR (1996). As an ecological factor, its role is fundamental, affecting many aspects of the trophic webs at different levels: it affects the availability of light and the capability of primary producers being suspended in the water column, the encounter rates between prey and predators, modifies the behavioral responses of prey to control the risk of predation and induces changes in the diet of some piscivorous fishe...|$|E
40|$|Turbidity is {{a measure}} of the <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The greater the amount of {{suspended}} solids in the water, the murkier it appears and the higher the measured turbidity. The major source of turbidity from construction- and development-related activities is sediment. Fine sediments (clay and fine silt) are so slow to settle that water containing them will remain turbid for days or weeks even if held in a settling or stilling basin. Turbidity can have a number of undesirable effects on the environment. Heavy suspended sediment loads and turbidity reduce light penetration for aquatic plants, fill lakes and bays, and smother benthic habitats. Fine particulate material also can clog or damage sensitive gill structures, decrease their resistance to disease, prevent proper egg and larval development, and potentially interfere with feeding. Very high levels of turbidity for a short period of time or lower turbidity for longer periods can both have significant impacts on aquatic organisms. Turbid water also tends to absorb sunlight, increasing temperature and decreasing the dissolved oxygen level, and stressing or even killing the organisms in the water.

The collection of suspended-sediment concentration data is costly and time consuming, and poses risks to field personnel, yet many managers and scientists require these data. Turbidity is an optical property of the <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which, if correlated to suspended-sediment concentration, can produce timely, high resolution data at significantly reduced cost. The correlation of suspended-sediment and turbidity has been proven {{in a number of}} streams, but the success is site specific and limited by changing variables such as sediment particle size, sediment color, and presence of organic and biological material, among other factors. This study determines the ability of turbidity to predict suspended-sediment concentration at nine sites in the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico, using correlation, and simple and multiple linear regression models. These models ranged from quite weak (adjusted r² = 0. 3903 at Rio Grande San Felipe, NM) to useful (adjusted r² = 0. 9213 at Rio Grande above highway 380 near San Antonio, NM). While statistical significance may be lower than desired, suspended-sediment concentration was more correlated with turbidity at all sites than it was with streamflow, thus proving suspended-sediment to have a stronger relationship with turbidity than the broadly accepted relationship with streamflow in the Middle Rio Grande, NM...|$|E

Microfiche. xviii, 137 leaves, bound maps (some col.) 29 cmIn one out {{of every}} two years, 20 percent of Bangladesh is inundated. Floods that occur at frequencies of one in 5, 10, 20 and 50 years inundate 30, 37, 43, and 52 percent of the country, respectively. The nation pays a heavy price in human sufferings and property from these floods. The purpose of this research is to assemble a prototype decision support system that could enable extension agents to search for alternative ways to minimize flood damage to agricultural crops and policy makers to assess yield losses and prepare for food shortages. The prototype system consists of a crop simulation model for rice, a rule-based system for assessing rice yield loss from flooding and a geographic information system for aggregating site-specific flood damage into yield loss for the entire nation. The system is designed to accommodate more than one crop, but this study was restricted to the rice crop. It is able to simulate the growth, development and grain yield of rice varieties cultivated by Bangladeshi farmers in any location and season under a wide range of management options. Simulated rice yields for a flood-free crop is used as a basis for computing yield loss from floods of varying severity. A rule-based system called FLOODEX was developed to compute yield loss from flooding which is expressed as a percent of the simulated non-flooded grain yield and computed on the bases of yield loss from depth of submergence, duration of submergence, growth stage and <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The expected yield is a fraction of the simulated yield, and production for a homogeneous area is the product of yield and area. The geographic information system enables yield loss and production levels to be displayed spatially. A major constraint to early application of the system was the lack of site-specific input data to operate the crop simulation models. These data include a minimum set of crop, soil, and weather data for benchmark locations in the country. The immediate value of this system may lie in its capacity to serve as a framework for organizing interdisciplinary research and prioritizing resource allocation...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{refers to the}} ecology of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus (L.)), a {{recently}} introduced species at the ecosystem of the artificial lake Kerkini of Serres prefecture in Greece. The physicochemical characteristics of this biotope were studied and specifically: the temperature, the conductivity, the <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> the dissolved oxygen, the pH, the total hardness, the sulfuric, the orthophosphates, the nitrogen compounds (ammonia. nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites), the chlorophyll. a and the biological oxygen demand (B. O. D. 5). The structure of zooplankton community of the lake was also studied, {{as well as the}} factors that affect it during the year and the dominance of trochozoans at the population was found out. The study of benthic organisms at the two stations of sampling demonstrated the differences of the population composition in the lake, which are significantly influenced by the composition of the bottom sediments. The benthos of the lake was dominated by water warms of the genus Lumbriculus and Tubifex as well as water insects. larvae. The sampling of the 1095 specimens of pumpkinseed was carried out by monthly efforts with the use of fluke nets. The age determination was based on scale. s annual ring formation counting and the time of those rings formation was found to occur in January. The older pumpkinseed specimen was found to be eight years old. The annual growth of pumpkinseed was calculated for length as well as for weight based upon the observed as well as the calculated values, according to the method of backcalculation growth. The application of this method was based on the relationship of the fork length to the scale radius. It was found out that males overcome female. s fork length in most of age and length classes. The maximum annual growth, which was found to be 40, 59 mm, was observed {{during the first year of}} their lives. The final length (L?) that pumpkinseed can attain in lake Kerkini was calculated to be 270, 61 mm for males and 202, 24 for females. By the length. weight relationship it was found that pumpkinseed. s growth is allometric. By the Clark. s condition factor calculation it was found that the females. values are higher than the males. ones and the gain occurs from May to September for both sexes. The sexual dimorphism was examined and it was found that there is a statistical difference between male. s and female. s pelvic fins length. Bigger pelvic fins probably serve males to the reproduction procedure. The study of the reproduction, carried out on ready for reproduction females, according Kesteven. s index, showed out that the age of first maturity for pumpkinseed in lake Kerkini is 2, 53 years. The reproduction period starts from May until August, considering the multiple spawning behavior of the species. The fecundity was studied according to the gravimetric method. Mean absolute fecundity was calculated to be 1, 952 eggs, and relative fecundity to 260 eggs/g of body weight. The absolute fecundity as well as the egg size was found to increase according to length, weight and age of the fish. Pumpkinseed. s diet was studied based on the quality and the quantity of stomach content of 287 specimens. The numerical and the frequency of occurrence methods were used. The total food species number that concluded to comprise pumpkinseed. s diet were eleven, ten of them being benthic organisms. Bigger individuals consumed smaller fish even of the same species (cannibalism). Despite that, there is no doubt that the pumpkinseed. s diet is based almost completely on larvae and pupae of water insects. Younger individuals are fed with zooplankton. Finally, participation of gastropods in pumpkinseed. s diet in Kerkini was limited as well as in other European biotops, compared to its native biotops. ...|$|E
