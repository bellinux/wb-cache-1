40|$|The {{role of the}} thymus in HIV- 1 {{pathogenesis}} remains unclear. We {{developed an}} assay to quantify the number of recent thymic emigrants in blood based on the detection of a major excisional DNA byproduct (termed � 1 circle) of T cell receptor rearrangement. By studying 532 normal individuals, we found that � 1 <b>circle</b> <b>numbers</b> in blood remain high for the first 10 – 15 yr of life, a sharp drop {{is seen in the}} late teen years, and a gradual decline occurs thereafter. Compared with age-matched uninfected control individuals, � 1 <b>circle</b> <b>numbers</b> in HIV- 1 – infected adults were significantly reduced; however, there were many individuals with normal � 1 <b>circle</b> <b>numbers.</b> In 74 individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, we found no appreciable effect on � 1 <b>circle</b> <b>numbers</b> in those whose baseline values were already within the normal range, but significant increases were observed in those with a preexisting impairment. The increases in � 1 <b>circle</b> <b>numbers</b> were, however, numerically insufficient to account for the rise in levels of naive T lymphocytes. Overall, it is difficult to invoke thymic regenerative failure as a generalized mechanism for CD 4 lymphocyte depletion in HIV- 1 infection, as � 1 <b>circle</b> <b>numbers</b> are normal in a substantial subset of HIV- 1 –infected individuals.

This research was conducted in October 2014 until January 2015 in the experimental station on the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Riau, Bina Widya Campus Km 12. 5 Simpang Baru Village, Tampan District, Pekanbaru. This research was conducted by using a completely randomized design (CRD) with 6 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments sludge palm oil waste are: S 0 = 0 g/polybag, S 1 = 50 g/polybag, S 2 = 100 g/polybag, S 3 = 150 g/polybag, S 4 = 200 g/polybag and S 5 = 250 g/polybag.

40|$|Abstract. Dense {{packing of}} equal circles on a sphere is investigated. A {{systematic}} algorithm, the Minimum-Zenith Method (MZM), is proposed in this report. Started from a proper initial configuration, a circle is sequentially packed {{one by one}} so that the zenith angle is as small as possible. It is necessary to fix {{the size of the}} circle and some initial configuration. Circle configurations we examined have three- to six-fold rotational symmetry. The densest one among them for a specified <b>circle</b> <b>number</b> is the desired configuration of the method. All the cases up to N = 150 are studied in this paper. The obtained packing densities are equal to or slightly smaller than those by other methods (exact solutions, Monte-Carlo method, etc.) in spite of simplicity of the method. 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{evaluating}} the probabilities of arbitrary random events {{with respect to}} a given multivariate probability distribution, specific techniques are of great interest. An important two-dimensional high risk limit law is the Gauss-exponential distribution whose probabilities can be dealt with based on the Gauss–Laplace law. The latter will be considered here as an element of the newly-introduced family of (p, q) -spherical distributions. Based on a suitably-defined non-Euclidean arc-length measure on (p, q) -circles, we prove geometric and stochastic representations of these distributions and correspondingly distributed random vectors, respectively. These representations allow dealing with the new probability measures similarly to with elliptically-contoured distributions and more general homogeneous star-shaped ones. This is demonstrated by the generalization of the Box–Muller simulation method. In passing, we prove an extension of the sector and <b>circle</b> <b>number</b> functions...|$|E
