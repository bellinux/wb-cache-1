The taxon Morchella fallax, proposed by Clowez in 2012, is a synonym of this species.|$|R
60|$|He {{went downstairs}} {{in his shirt}} and then {{struggled}} into his pit-trousers, which were left on the hearth to warm all night. There was always a fire, because Mrs. Morel raked. And the first sound {{in the house was}} the bang, bang of the poker against the raker, as Morel smashed the remainder of the coal to make the kettle, which was filled and left on the hob, finally boil. His cup and knife and fork, all he wanted except just the food, was laid ready on the table on a newspaper. Then he got his breakfast, made the tea, packed the bottom of the doors with rugs to shut out the draught, piled a big fire, and sat down to an hour of joy. He toasted his bacon on a fork and caught the drops of fat on his bread; then he put the rasher on his thick slice of bread, and cut off chunks with a clasp-knife, poured his tea into his saucer, and was happy. With his family about, meals were never so pleasant. He loathed a fork: it is a modern introduction which has still scarcely reached <b>common</b> people. What <b>Morel</b> preferred was a clasp-knife. Then, in solitude, he ate and drank, often sitting, in cold weather, on a little stool {{with his back to the}} warm chimney-piece, his food on the fender, his cup on the hearth. And then he read the last night's newspaper--what of it he could--spelling it over laboriously. He preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even when it was daylight; it was the habit of the mine.|$|R
50|$|Morchella esculenta, (commonly {{known as}} <b>common</b> <b>morel,</b> morel, yellow morel, true morel, morel mushroom, and sponge morel) is {{a species of}} fungus in the Morchellaceae family of the Ascomycota. It {{is one of the}} most readily {{recognized}} of all the edible mushrooms and highly sought after. Each fruit body begins as a tightly compressed, grayish sponge with lighter ridges, and expands to form a large yellowish sponge with large pits and ridges raised on a large white stem. The pitted yellow-brown caps measure 2 - 7 cm broad by 2 - 10 cm tall, and are fused to the stem at its lower margin, forming a continuous hollow. The pits are rounded and irregularly arranged. The hollow stem is typically 2 - 9 cm long by 2 - 5 cm thick, and white to yellow. The fungus fruits under hardwoods during a short period in the spring, depending on the weather, but it is also associated with old orchards, woods, disturbed grounds and burnt areas. Although a process was reported in 1982 to grow the fruit bodies under controlled conditions, attempts to cultivate the mushroom commercially have only been partially successful.|$|E

The eggs become fully grown stinkhorns very rapidly, over a day or two. The mature stinkhorn is 10 to 30 cm tall and 4 to 5 cm in diameter, topped with a conical cap 2 to 4 cm high that is covered with the greenish-brown slimy gleba.
