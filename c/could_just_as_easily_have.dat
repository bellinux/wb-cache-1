In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's—and {{as far as we know}} they were the only ones there in a position to identify him—it was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine.|$|E
2500|$|However, Ptolemy placed Venus' deferent and {{epicycle}} entirely {{inside the}} sphere of the Sun (between the Sun and Mercury), but this was arbitrary; he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> swapped Venus and Mercury {{and put them on}} the other side of the Sun, or made any other arrangement of Venus and Mercury, as long as they were always near a line running from the Earth through the Sun, such as placing the center of the Venus epicycle near the Sun.

2500|$|PC Formats Matt Avery {{summarized}} Tropico 2 as [...] "short-lived {{fun with}} information overload {{in place of}} interaction." [...] Although he remarked that [...] "statisticians will have a field day" [...] with the game's detailed economics, he disliked Tropico 2s lack of direct control over units, and found the overall product [...] "rather limited." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, Stephen Poole criticized the game's combination of piracy and management gameplay, which he found awkward, unrealistic and unsatisfying. He also argued that the game's musical style is incongruous with its setting. Poole concluded that Tropico 2s theme is [...] "barely a skin-deep covering on a sim that <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been made about the ACME Widget Factory." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{variants}} of the town's name {{have appeared in}} both English and Spanish. Stanley Harbour was originally known as [...] "Port Jackson", and this name would have applied to the area before the town was built, although it <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been called Sapper Hill. Although the town is officially known as [...] "Stanley", one frequently hears it still referred to as [...] "Port Stanley", especially in British reports about the Falklands War. This {{is in line with}} various other settlements around the islands, e.g. Port Howard and Port Stephens. However, [...] "Stanley" [...] without the [...] "Port" [...] prefix was established long before the war, and on 2 August 1956, the Officer Administering the Government of the Falkland Islands reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|After O'Bannon {{handed him}} a copy of Giger's book Necronomicon, Scott {{immediately}} saw the potential for Giger's designs, and chose Necronom IV, a print Giger completed in 1976, {{as the basis for}} the Alien's design, citing its beauty and strong sexual overtones. That the creature <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been male or female was also a strong factor in the decision to use it. [...] "It could just as easily fuck you before it killed you," [...] said line producer Ivor Powell, [...] " [...] made it all the more disconcerting." [...] Fox studios were initially wary of allowing Giger onto the project, saying that his works would be too disturbing for audiences, but eventually relented. Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on Necronom IV, saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Giger signed on to design the adult, egg and chest-burster forms, but ultimately also designed the alien planetoid LV-426 and the Space Jockey alien vessel.|$|E

60|$|Rubens, on the contrary, whose {{pictures}} I detested {{with all}} the energy of my soul, I knew and felt all the time, by the very pain he gave me, {{to be a real}} living artist. There was a Venus and Cupid there, as fat and as coarse as they could be, but so freely drawn, and so masterly in their expression and handling, that one must feel that they were by an artist, who <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> painted them any other way if it had suited his sovereign pleasure, and therefore we are the more vexed with him. When your taste is crossed by a clever person, it always vexes you more than when it is done by a stupid one, because it is done with such power that there is less hope for you.|$|E
