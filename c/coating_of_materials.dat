40|$|In {{the area}} of manufacturing, surface <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> is a widely-used process {{representing}} a multi-billion pound per annum industry. {{the choice of a}} suitable coating allows the design engineer to choose a material for its optimum bulk properties but, at the same time, tailor the surface properties for a specific application. For example, components made of iron have good mechanical strength but, because the iron surface forms an oxide, a suitable coating (usually chromium-based) is used to protect the product. Over the last decade interest has surged in the potential use of more exotic coatings with controlled micro- and nano-structure. Professor John Colligon and Dr Vladimir Vishnyakov have developed techniques for production of such coatings...|$|E

In this study to improve the thermal performance of the piston different Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) have been imposed and their thermo mechanical performance have been evaluated through software tool.

40|$|We review {{research}} {{investigating the}} application of intense pulsed ion beams (IPIBs) for the surface treatment and <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> The short range (0. 1 - 10 {mu}m) and high-energy density (1 - 50 J/cm{sup 2 }) of these short-pulsed ({le} 1 {mu}s) beams (with ion currents I = 5 - 50 kA, and energies E = 100 - 1000 keV) make them ideal to flash-heat a target surface, similar to the more familiar pulsed laser processes. IPIB surface treatment induces rapid melt and solidification at up to 10 {sup 10 } K/s to cause amorphous layer formation {{and the production of}} non-equilibrium microstructures. At higher energy density the target surface is vaporized, and the ablated vapor is condensed as coatings onto adjacent substrates or as nanophase powders. Progress towards the development of robust, high-repetition rate IPIB accelerators is presented along with economic estimates for the cost of ownership of this technology...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} is {{the main}} cause of implant failure, despite the existence of numerous preventive strategies and use of antibiotics. Procedures regarding the sterile environment in the operating theatre have been optimized to a near maximum and due to the fading discovery of new and better antibiotics, combined with the rise of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains, there are decreasing options for treatment. Surface <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> has been applied as a biomaterial surface modification to prevent the adhesion of bacteria, the first step in biofilm formation. In this thesis we describe surface modifications to prevent bacterial adhesion using two approaches; 1) by creating surfaces with a repulsive nature towards bacteria, while also presenting regions adhesive to the native human cells, 2) using coated enzymes to bacteria and biofilms. Additionally, even though the initial adhesion of bacteria is a main focus in the prevention of biomaterial associated infections and the number of potential strategies developed to fight bacterial adhesion is increasing, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the friction forces between surfaces and bacteria, in order to gain knowledge about the role of lateral forces in the adhesion process. Secondly, we studied the influence of specific interactions between bacteria and surfaces on the lateral forces that arise when bacteria move along the surface...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a review}} of acid {{aluminum}} phosphate for the binding and <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> The acid aluminum phosphate {{in the form of}} a solution obtained by dissolving aluminum hydroxide in phosphoric acid, with a P/Al molar ratio of 23, is effective for the binding of fibrous or particulate materials. Porous ceramic articles are made using this binder by wet forming, followed by heat treatment. The binder resides at the junction of the adjacent fibers in the porous fibrous ceramic article. No free binder was observed in fibrous or particulate articles. The porosity is 45 %– 90 % in fibrous articles, and is 25 %– 82 % in particulate articles. Porosity above 61 % in particulate articles is attained by adding carbon particles and subsequent removal of them by combustion. The binder proportion is 3 – 10 wt % in fibrous articles, and is ∼ 0. 1 wt % in particulate articles. Porous ceramic articles made using a silica binder instead of the acid aluminum phosphate binder are inferior in permeability, mechanical properties and creep resistance, and exhibit a wider pore size distribution. Free silica binder was observed in articles made with the silica binder. The acid aluminum phosphate with a P/Al ratio of 12 or 23 is also effective for coating materials, particularly graphite for the purpose of oxidation protection.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the preparation and characterization of ultra-thin hydrogel films, ultra-thin hydrogel nanofibers and silver nanoparticles functionalized nanogels based on crosslinked polymers. The crosslinking {{was performed by}} “click” chemistry applying the well-known azetidinium-amine coupling reaction. Hydrogel properties, such as water swelling behavior, metal chelating ability, antimicrobial activity and cell toxicity, have been investigated in detail. This new type of hydrogel particles offers tunable material properties from macrostructure to nanostructure. Furthermore, this approach offers the great opportunity to design functional hybrid hydrogels by incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles, e. g. silver nanoparticles. The polymer used in for the new approach is the commercially available poly(vinylamine) (PVAm), which is a weak cationic polyelectrolyte bearing primary amine group among the polymer backbone. PVAm is a useful material for coupling other molecules or chelating metal ions due to the nucleophilic character of primary amines. Poly(amideamine-epichlorohydrin) (PAE) is a reactive polymer resin and a weak cationic polyelectrolyte, which has a four-membered 3 -hydroxy-azetidinium ring among the polymer backbone. The developed PVAm/PAE hydrogels could be successfully applied {{to a wide range}} of applications ranging from surface modification of silicon oxide surface and wool fibers, to electrospinning from aqueous gelating solution or to the fabrication of polymeric nanoparticles as an antimicrobial coating on fabrics. In summary, the developed PVAm/PAE hydrogels are a promising platform for various applications. The systems can be easily modified to fulfill different tasks. The systems can be easily adjusted to a specific application. To this respect, PVAm/PAE hydrogels will be applied to surface <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> for further textile as well as biomedical applications...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMicrobiologically Influenced Corrosion (MIC) {{can occur}} {{unexpectedly}} {{in any kind}} of system in which metal surfaces are involved, leading to integrity problems and economic loss. To manage and control MIC we need a clearer understanding of the microbial communities attached to the metal surfaces and how they influence the chemical processes involved in corrosion. There are several methods (e. g. biocide dosing, <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> removing water) for controlling MIC, but the effectiveness of these methods depends on the type of microorganisms present and the prevailing conditions. A threat analysis is a multidisciplinary approach for determining the critical control points of MIC and with this, to manage the problems and set up mitigation strategies. One of the essential disciplines for understanding MIC is the understanding of the microbiology. Molecular Microbiological Methods (MMM) are increasingly recognized as important identification tools for MIC threat assessment. However, these current methods are based on known microbial systems and processes (i. e. sulfate reduction/sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB)) that are involved in MIC. However, if systems are less well studied, other MMM are necessary to perform a proper threat assessment. Here we show that Next Generation Sequencing combined with automated QPCR primer design leads to a methodology {{that can be used to}} predict MIC threats in relatively new systems. The identification tools are based on the total genetic (DNA/RNA) information of a sample and give insight in the present microbial communities and their potential activities. Thereby it becomes possible to assess MIC related threats beyond the current state of knowledge. In this paper, a practical case is presented in which the biofilm on metal surfaces in sea water was analyzed using NGS and further processed to determine the threat that MIC is responsible for the deterioration of the metal surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philopsophy (PhD) This thesis {{begins by}} {{examining}} the optical characteristics of organic photovoltaics (OPV) as the thesis continues the focus shifts steadily to practical considerations around {{the implementation of the}} OPV technology. The first chapter demonstrates an implementation of transfer matrix methods to model absorption in the active layer. The calculation is separated into two distinct material components and used to deduce the exciton generation rates for the two species in the blend. The calculation of the individual component absorption is performed for bulk hetrojunctions (BHJ) that all use P 3 HT as the donor polymer and use three different types of fullerenes, PCBM, ICBA and PC₇₀BM. The second chapter examines the P 3 HT:PCBM case again but in this case the active layer has now be formed by the deposition of the blend particles in discrete nanoparticles (NP). The NP films are examined optically and dielectric models that accurately describe their behaviours are developed for a range of weight ratios of polymer to fullerene. The calculation in the first chapter that attributed absorption to each of the species in the blend is now performed for the NP case over the weight ratios examined. The optimisation curve that examines the relationship between thickness and absorbed photons is calculated for the nanoparticles and compared to an equivalent curve using a BHJ dielectric function. In the third chapter the angular dependent current and performance characteristics is examined for both BHJ and NP₋OPV devices. The fourth experimental chapter examines a solution processable material that improves device performance in NP-OPVs in a similar manner to the evaporated calcium layer. The goal of this work was to find a material that was solution processable, that would enable the scale up of the nanoparticle system to roll-to-roll processes, and allow for the electrical inversion of devices. Different formulations of the thoroughly researched ZnO interface are examined to find a interface material, with the best candidate to be found being zinc acetylacetonate Zn(ac) ₂. While the material found did not function as well in this role as calcium it did provide a significant improvement over its absence from the interface. In the final experimental chapter efforts to coat organic layers are outlined. Initially the coating efforts began as a group project in organic solvents with the lessons learned from that process being transferred to the NP coating. The coating regimes for achieving uniformity from chloroform and water were found to be significantly different. Additional challenges such as dewetting of the substrate, low evaporative rate and viscosity made the process of finding optimal conditions to print uniform films harder. Suitable conditions were discovered and functional devices were manufactured using a drawbar coating technique that had been developed earlier for the <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> from solvent...|$|E
