40|$|I {{have come}} to believe that a great teacher is a great artist … {{teaching}} might even be the greatest of the arts since the medium is the human mind and spirit" - John Steinbeck Summary: Back in the 1980 s, clinical scope of practice for general practitioners (GPs) working in local and rural hospitals was based on the deemed skill set of the individual applicant rather than the selection of ‘tickets’ they held. This meant that inpatient, outpatient, emergency and procedural work was spread across the GPs attached to the hospital in a somewhat egalitarian fashion. By the early 1990 s, mandatory certification enforced by government was progressively introduced across the entire breadth of clinical practice. The impact on clinicians was profound, as <b>clinical</b> <b>privilege</b> committees increasingly required structured, objective evidence of competence, often with mandatory evidence of having passed an appropriate summative assessment. This lead to a surge of interest in attending courses and programs, especially with formalised assessment processes and, consequently, a growing army of medical educators to provide these education and training programs.

Because {{of the number of}} practitioners in the FGP, the organization instituted a more formal process of credentialing that verifies that practitioners are not only licensed to practice, but also are competent to provide direct patient care. In contrast to other dental schools that have established similar protocols, HSDM approached the process not from the academic side, but rather from the clinical practice side, explicitly taking into account whether the FGP could accommodate another practitioner when an academic department wished to appoint a new faculty member.

Contingency management (CM) is an empirically validated treatment for {{drug abuse and}} is an effective component of treatments for many types of substance use disorders. CM arranges consequences to increase desired behavior and decrease undesired behavior. In most cases this is accomplished through reinforcement of drug-abstinent behavior using vouchers, opportunity to win a prize, money, or earning <b>clinical</b> <b>privileges.</b> Reinforcer magnitude and reinforcer delay are two important factors which contribute to CM efficacy. Reinforcers with greater magnitude are generally associated with greater clinical efficacy. Delay to reinforcement is generally associated with poor outcomes in clinical settings. The current experiment used an analog model of CM {{for the treatment of}} drug abuse to study the effects of reinforcer magnitude and reinforcer delay on abstinence from drug use. It was predicted {{that there would be no}} effect of delay in the high magnitude condition, and that delay would be associated with a decrease in target behavior in the low magnitude condition. Results indicate that high magnitude of reinforcement, both with and without delay, is associated with higher rates of abstinence when compared with the rates of abstinence maintained by low magnitude of reinforcement. Delayed high magnitude reinforcement was associated with shorter intervals to relapse to smoking when compared to immediate high magnitude reinforcement. No effect of delay was detected in the low magnitude condition. Implications for CM based treatment of addiction are discussed. Department of Psychology, Washington State Universit...|$|R

An invasive radiology suite, {{the only one in}} town, is staffed by a single invasive radiologist and two vascular surgeons. They perform about 150 diagnostic angiograms and endovascular procedures each year, about half of which are generated by consultation requests from the cardiologists. The invasive radiology team has worked together for the last 5 years, since an endovascular fellowship-trained vascular surgeon joined the staff. The invasive radiologist helped to develop an endovascular team and mentored the more senior vascular surgeon until he could accumulate the requisite number of procedures to become credentialed. The program’s finances and work schedule have been arranged to the satisfaction of all three participants. Until recently, whenever cardiologists found evidence of vascular occlusive disease during catheterizations, they changed host arteries; if symptoms and signs indicated a need for therapy, they referred patients to the invasive radiology clinic.

40|$|Purpose: Identify {{specific}} legislative {{barriers to}} full practice authority (FPA) legislation and describe {{how they were}} overcome during the 2013 legislative session in Nevada. Background: Legislative restrictions in 31 states prevent nurse practitioners from practicing to {{the full extent of}} their education and training. FPA legislation is introduced, but not often signed into law. A comprehensive literature review revealed multiple barriers to autonomous practice: conflict between medical and nursing roles, lack of nurse practitioner role recognition, financial challenges, and a lack of business knowledge. Barriers caused by policy limitations were most frequently mentioned: limited scope of practice, limited prescriptive authority, limited <b>clinical</b> <b>privileges,</b> credentialing limitations and reduced reimbursement rates. Methods: This study employed a qualitative, multiple case study design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four actively-involved contributors to the 2013 FPA initiative in Nevada. Homogeneous questions were used, guided by the use of a predetermined set of questions based on Kotter’s (1995) Change Management Model. Each interview began with the question, "What prompted this movement and why was it introduced at this time?" Participants were asked to identify perceived barriers to FPA legislation, and how they were overcome. Recorded interviews were transcribed into text, which led to thematic analysis. Results: Repetition of shared perceptions revealed eleven barriers separated into six main themes. 1) Vision includes the barrier of lacking a clear and shared vision. 2) Physician Support includes the barrier of lacking the support of physicians and Organized Medicine. 3) Addressing Stakeholders includes the barriers of the inability to address stakeholders, lack of role recognition and community support, and social media. 4) Community Organization Support includes the barriers of having a Board of Nursing with a poor reputation, and a lack of support from the Board of Pharmacy. 5) Leading Coalition includes the barriers of lacking a strong, leading coalition lacking history of leadership and legislative experiences, and choosing a legislator without experience, authority, and respect in the legislature and the community. 6) Resources include the barrier of lacking necessary resources including time and preparation. Implications: The findings of this study may be useful for those living in one of the 31 states without FPA legislation. This {{is one of the first}} published studies to identify the importance of literature identifying legislative barriers to FPA, and starts to fill the current gap in the literature surrounding this topic. This information may be invaluable in the preparation and introduction of FPA legislation in other states. The findings may also act as a stepping-stone to addressing the provider shortage in the U.

40|$|Government {{prescription}} {{for the management}} of clinical risk and patient safety relies upon the development of a shared perspective between stakeholders engaged in the delivery of healthcare about what constitutes clinical risk and what mechanisms are suitable to manage such risk to ensure patient safety. However, there are tensions arising from notions of clinical risk and its management, specifically between healthcare professionals and those managers given responsibility for implementation of policy. Central to these tensions are issues of legitimacy, power and identity in claims about how risk should be managed. Aligned with an emerging body of literature that takes a narrative approach to change in healthcare systems (e. g. Currie and Brown 2003), including patient safety (e. g. McDonald et al. 2005, 2006), our paper examines how healthcare professionals make sense of the regulation of single use medical devices (SUDs) in anaesthesia.

40|$|Contingency {{management}} (CM) is an evidence-based treatment intervention {{recommended by}} the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). It is based on principles of behaviour modification and aims to incentivise and then reinforce changes in behaviour {{with the aid of}} vouchers, privileges, prizes or modest financial incentives that are of value to the client. Providing incentives is supported by government as a way to “nudge” people to change their behaviour in a positive direction across a wide range of health and social policy domains. Used properly and implemented carefully (see next section), CM can be a useful intervention within a balanced treatment system. Alongside other interventions, {{it can be used to}} encourage and support: •abstinence from drugs of dependence, usually alongside substitute medication and relapse prevention •engagement in recovery related activities •engagement in treatment by incentivising attendance •Improved compliance with health promotion, such as preventing BBVs, an example of which is hepatitis B vaccination. NICE recommended: “Drug services should introduce contingency management programmes… to reduce illicit drug use and/or promote engagement with services for people receiving methadone maintenance treatment. … Where possible, implementation in the NHS should draw on the experience so far (albeit limited) of contingency management in the NHS and on the experience of agencies such as the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) in the implementation of service developments in drug misuse. ” In 2009 the NTA conducted a demonstration programme that looked at the implementation of CM in selected drug treatment services. Since the programme concluded, CM for drug use has been included as an intervention in the NDTMS modality codes. Meanwhile, the expertise of the pilot sites has been placed at the disposal of the ConMan programme of five linked research studies that started in 2009 and runs to 2014. The aim of the study is to develop a UK evidence base for contingency management in addiction treatment. The programme, which is funded by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grant, is being led by the South London & Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust, but is a collaborative venture by investigators based at three London NHS trusts and universities. Implementation of contingency management: To maximise the use of resources, local partnerships need to consider where CM would genuinely add value beyond the standard treatment offer. This will depend on local population need and what health gains and recovery orientated outcomes are considered priorities. CM programmes should have the following characteristics: •Focus on a discrete behaviour under voluntary control •Have quantifiable targets e. g. good behaviour from a child •Have identified reinforcement (incentives, rewards) e. g. praise, vouchers, prizes, privileges, cash •Have a clear contingent relationship between behaviour and reinforcement (schedules of reinforcement which are consistent and immediate – at least initially) Any treatment service wishing to set up a CM programme should think carefully about the behaviours they are seeking to change and how the programme will fit into the service they deliver. A number of implementation tips were provided by services that took part in the NTA’s CM demonstration programme, in 2009. These included: •Make sure you have the resources to run a CM programme – in terms of funding and staff ◦Services often underestimated these costs and how much staff time the programme would take up. •Think about the logistical and practical aspects of running a CM programme ◦Services that assessed the impact CM would have on their other activities were more successful at implementing CM. •Make sure staff are provided with the right level of training and supervision ◦Staff training not only provides them with the knowledge they need to deliver a CM. programme, but can also be useful for persuading sceptical staff of CM’s benefits. ◦Supervision is a central tool for monitoring staff performance and also provides a means of support and professional guidance. •Keep it simple – don’t overcomplicate the process ◦Services that tried to run more than one model of CM often struggled to deliver them simultaneously. •Make sure you use appropriate incentives e. g. <b>clinical</b> <b>privileges</b> or vouchers ◦And make sure they are meaningful and available at the point the behaviour is achieved. •Consider the implications of partnership working ◦Some CM programmes (such as BBV CM programmes) can operate across wide areas, such as a whole local treatment system. •Have a CM champion/someone who takes ownership of the programme ◦Having a dedicated CM champion was a common feature of services that delivered CM successfully...|$|R
40|$|Background: Variability in {{clinical}} practice {{may result from}} the use of diverse information sources to guide clinical decisions. In routine <b>clinical</b> practice, nurses <b>privilege</b> information from colleagues over more formal information sources. It is not clear whether similar information-seeking behaviour is exhibited when critical care nurses make decisions about a specific clinical practice, where extensive practice variability exists alongside a developing research base. Purpose: This study explored the preferred sources of information intensive care nurses used and their perceptions of the accessibility and usefulness of this information for making decisions {{in clinical}}ly uncertain situations specific to enteral feeding practice. Methods: An instrumental case study design, incorporating concurrent verbal protocols, Q methodology and focus groups, was used to determine intensive care nurses' perspectives of information use in the resolution of clinical uncertainty. Findings: A preference for information from colleagues to support clinical decisions was observed. People as information sources were considered most useful and most accessible in the clinical setting. Text and electronic information sources were seen as less accessible, mainly because of the time required to access the information within the documents. Discussion: When faced with clinical uncertainty, obtaining information from colleagues allows information to be quickly accessed and applied {{within the context of a}} specific clinical presentation. Seeking information from others also provides opportunities for shared decision-making and potential validation of clinical judgment, although differing views may exacerbate clinical uncertainty. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The social exchange of clinical information may meet the needs of nurses working in a complex, time-pressured environment but the extent of the evidence base for information passed through verbal communication is unclear. The perceived usefulness and accessibility of information is premised on the ease of use and access and thus the variability in information may be contributing to clinical uncertainty.

40|$|Background: Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) and {{telemedicine}} {{are positioned}} by policymakers as health information {{technologies that are}} integral to achieving improved clinical outcomes and efficiency savings. However, evaluating {{the extent to which}} these aims are met poses distinct evaluation challenges, particularly where clinical and cost outcomes form the sole focus of evaluation design. We propose that a practice-centred approach to evaluation - in which those whose day-to-day care practice is altered (or not) by the introduction of new technologies are placed at the centre of evaluation efforts - can complement and in some instances offer advantages over, outcome-centric evaluation models. Methods: We carried out a regional programme of innovation in renal services where a participative approach was taken to the introduction of new technologies, including: a regional EPR system and a system to support video clinics. An ‘action learning' approach was taken to procurement, pre-implementation planning, implementation, ongoing development and evaluation. Participants included clinicians, technology specialists, patients and external academic researchers. Whilst undergoing these activities we asked: how can a practice-centred approach be embedded into evaluation of health information technologies? Discussion: Organising EPR and telemedicine evaluation around predetermined outcome measures alone can be impractical given the complex and contingent nature of such projects. It also limits the extent to which unforeseen outcomes and new capabilities are recognised. Such evaluations often fail to improve understanding of ‘when' and ‘under what conditions' technology-enabled service improvements are realised, and crucially, how such innovation improves care. Summary: Our contribution, drawn from our experience of the case study provided, is a protocol for practice-centred, participative evaluation of technology in the <b>clinical</b> setting that <b>privileges</b> care. In this context ‘practice-centred' evaluation acts as a scalable, coordinating framework for evaluation that recognises health information technology supported care as an achievement that is contingent and ongoing. We argue that if complex programmes of technology-enabled service innovation are understood in terms of their contribution to patient care and supported by participative, capability-building evaluation methodologies, conditions are created for practitioners and patients to realise the potential of technologies and make substantive contributions to the evidence base underpinning health innovation programmes...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho apresenta uma pesquisa realizada entre os anos de 2005 a 2007, cujo objetivo {{principal}} foi analisar como é feita a Avaliação Inicial do aluno com indícios de Deficiência Mental e que se encontra freqüentando a Escola Regular, na perspectiva inclusiva, e de que forma essa avaliação pode contribuir para o processo de aprendizagem desse aluno. Tal pesquisa apresenta como aporte teórico o referencial sócio-histórico, mais especificamente as contribuições de Lev Seminovich Vygotsky, que defendia a realização de uma avaliação contextualizada da criança e levando em conta o contexto social onde ela está inserida, as relações desse contexto com a sua conduta e as relações da própria criança com o seu todo. A abordagem escolhida foi de natureza qualitativa, tendo como espaço a Rede Municipal de Ensino de Porto Alegre. Como instrumentos metodológicos, foram utilizados: entrevistas semi-estruturadas com professores especialistas que atuam em Salas de Integração e Recursos - SIR da referida rede, visto terem sido identificados como os profissionais que atualmente realizam a avaliação inicial; análise de documentos relativos à avaliação dos alunos encaminhados a essas salas e o diário de campo de toda a trajetória de pesquisa. Buscou-se compreender quais concepções os sujeitos possuem com relação à Avaliação Inicial e qual a sua importância para o processo de aprendizagem do aluno com necessidades educacionais especiais, mais especificamente, com deficiência mental; como tais sujeitos percebem o espaço de apoio no qual atuam - a SIR e de que forma contribuem com a inclusão desse aluno no ensino comum; que sentimentos vivenciam no desenvolvimento de seu trabalho; e, por fim, qual a análise que fazem do movimento inclusivo e como percebem os alunos que atendem e a si mesmos dentro desse movimento. O desenvolvimento da pesquisa possibilitou uma visão de caminho percorrido pela avaliação inicial, que deixa de seguir um modelo clínico para privilegiar um enfoque mais educacional, sendo realizada por educadores especialistas e dentro do próprio ambiente escolar. Embora tenha sido observada certa ausência de sistematização dos procedimentos avaliativos, como também uma relativa variedade quanto aos referenciais teóricos que servem como base para a sua prática, ficou evidenciado que essa avaliação inicial apresenta características de um processo contínuo, que possui estreitas ligações com a avaliação do próprio processo de aprendizagem do aluno. Assim, a maneira como é realizada indica avanços em seu percurso na direção de novos olhares, novas práticas e novos modos de viver em relação. The present work {{presents a}} research carried through between {{the years of}} 2005 and 2007, whose main objective was to analyze how is made the Initial Evaluation of the pupil with indications of Mental Deficiency that is frequenting the Regular School, in the inclusive perspective, and in which forms this evaluation can contribute for {{the process of learning}} of this pupil. Such research presents as theoretical support the social-historical referential, more specifically the contributions of Lev Seminovich Vygotsky, that defended the accomplishment of a contextualized evaluation of the child and taking in account the social context where the child is inserted, the relations of this context with the child’s behavior and the relations of the proper child with everything. The chosen approach was of qualitative nature, having as space the Municipal Network of Education of Porto Alegre. As methodological instruments, it has been used: half-structuralized interviews with professors specialists that work in Rooms of Integration and Resources - SIR of the related network, since they have been identified as the professionals who currently carry through the initial evaluation; analysis of documents regarding the evaluation of the pupils directed to these rooms and the field log of all the trajectory of research. It was searched to understand which conceptions the subjects possess regarding the Initial Evaluation and its importance for the process of learning of the pupil with special educational necessities, more specifically, with mental deficiency; as such subjects perceive the space of support in which they act - the SIR and in which ways they contribute with the inclusion of this pupil in common education; which feelings they live deeply in the development of their work; and, finally, what analysis they make of the inclusive movement and how they perceive the pupils they take care of and themselves inside of this movement. The development of the research made possible a vision of the way covered to the initial evaluation, that stops to follow a <b>clinical</b> model to <b>privilege</b> a more educational approach, being carried through by educators specialists and inside of the proper school environment. Although it has been observed a certain absence of systematization of the evaluative procedures, as also a relative variety regarding the theoretical references that serve as basis for its practice, it was evidenced that this initial evaluation presents characteristics of a continuous process, that possess narrow links with the evaluation of the proper process of learning of the pupil. Thus, the manner it is carried through indicates advances in its way in the direction of new looks, new practices and new ways of living in relation...|$|R
