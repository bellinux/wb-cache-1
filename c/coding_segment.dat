50|$|V(D)J {{recombination}} {{begins when}} V(D)J recombinase (through {{the activity of}} RAG1) binds an RSS flanking a coding gene segment (V, D, or J) and creates a single-strand nick in the DNA between the first base of the RSS (just before the heptamer) and the <b>coding</b> <b>segment.</b> This is essentially energetically neutral (no need for ATP hydrolysis) and results {{in the formation of}} a free 3' hydroxyl group and a 5' phosphate group on the same strand. The reactive hydroxyl group is positioned by the recombinase to attack the phosphodiester bond of opposite strand, forming two DNA ends: a hairpin (stem-loop) on the <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> and a blunt end on the signal segment. The current model is that DNA nicking and hairpin formation occurs on both strands simultaneously (or nearly so) in a complex known as a recombination center.|$|E
50|$|Noncoding DNA {{separate}} {{genes from}} each other with long gaps, so mutation in one gene or part of a chromosome, for example deletion or insertion, {{does not have a}} frameshift effect on the whole chromosome. When genome complexity is relatively high, like in the case of human genome, not only between different genes, but also inside many genes, there are gaps of introns to protect the entire <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> and minimise the changes caused by mutation. Non-coding DNA may perhaps serve to decrease the probability of gene disruption during chromosomal crossover.|$|E
50|$|RAG enzymes {{work as a}} multi-subunit {{complex to}} induce {{cleavage}} of a single double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule between the antigen receptor <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> and a flanking recombination signal sequence (RSS). They do this in two steps. They initially introduce a ‘nick’ in the 5' (upstream) end of the RSS heptamer (a conserved region of 7 nucleotides) that is adjacent to the coding sequence, leaving behind a specific biochemical structure on this region of DNA: a 3'-hydroxyl (OH) group at the coding end and a 5'-phosphate (PO4) group at the RSS end. The next step couples these chemical groups, binding the OH-group (on the coding end) to the PO4-group (that is sitting between the RSS and the gene segment on the opposite strand). This produces a 5'-phosphorylated double-stranded break at the RSS and a covalently closed hairpin at the coding end. The RAG proteins remain at these junctions until other enzymes (notably, TDT) repair the DNA breaks.|$|E

In particular, orthomyxoviruses show rapid fluctuation in the proportion of viral variants coexisting in an infected individual, especially under strong selective pressure. This is particularly relevant in salmon production carried out under confined and stressful conditions where one of the most feared pathogenic agents is the Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus, an orthomyxovirus family member whose biological behavior is only recently beginning to be understood. Pathogenicity of the virus has been mainly associated with deletions of the HPR region in <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> 6 and the presence or absence of a specific insertion in a key region in <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> 5. In this study we report, for the first time in Chile, the coexistence of two variants in fully asymptomatic fish. Of five samples analyzed, two were identified as the non-pathogenic variant, HPR 0, and two as the highly pathogenic HPR 7 b variant, though with no clinical signs detectable in the fish. Interestingly, one of the samples unequivocally carried both variants, again without any clinical signs. Considering that in none of the samples the typical insertion in <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> 5 was detected, it is our impression that this may represent a shift from the non-pathogenic HPR 0 variant towards the highly infective HPR 7 b variant.

The two minor proteins that are initiated within this pre-s segment are immunogenic and {{may be involved in}} virus attachment to hepatocytes. We have constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus that contains the predicted <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> for the large surface protein (LS) under control of a vaccinia virus that contains the predicted <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> for the large surface protein (LS) under control of a vaccinia virus promoter.

The presence of pre-s epitopes in the 39 - and 42 -kilodalton polypeptides was demonstrated by binding of antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide. Synthesis of the 42 -kilodalton species was specifically inhibited by tunicamycin, suggesting that it is N-glycosylated. Despite apparent glycosylation, LS was not secreted into the medium of infected cells. Nevertheless, rabbits vaccinated with the purified recombinant virus made antibodies that recognized s and pre-s epitopes. Antibody to the NH 2 terminus of LS appeared before or simultaneously with antibody that bound to the major surface protein.

40|$|Efficient {{performance}} tuning of parallel programs is often hard. Optimization is often done {{when the program}} is written as a last effort to increase the performance. With sequential programs each (executed) <b>code</b> <b>segment</b> will affect the total execution time of the program. Thus, any <b>code</b> <b>segment</b> that is optimized in a sequential program will decrease the execution time. In {{the case of a}} parallel program executed on a multiprocessor this is not always true. This is due to dependencies between the different threads.

The <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> for mature β-casein was subcloned into the T 7 expression system, {{in which the}} expression of recombinant β-casein was controlled by the T 7 gene 10 promoter and ribosome binding site. High level expression of Met-β-casein to ∼ 20 % of the total soluble proteins was obtained in Escherichia coli within 2 h after induction of T 7 RNA-polymerase synthesis. In an attempt to induce secretion the <b>coding</b> <b>segment</b> for mature β-casein was coupled to the ompA translations initiation signal and signal peptide coding sequence but no secretion of the fusion protein and no processing of the signal peptide from the fusion protein was observed. Instead, the Met-β-casein could be isolated in asoluble form from E. coli cells after an osmotic shock, indicative of a periplasmic location. This procedure did not lyse the cells. The protein was purified to homogeneity after a pH 4. 8 isoelectric precipitation followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The β-casein cDNA was altered to change the main chymosin cleavage sitein β-casein at position 192 – 193 in two ways, namely from Leu–Tyr to Pro–Pro and to Leu–stop. These mutations were designed to prevent generation of the bitter peptide βcasein(193 – 209) by chymosin cleavage. The mutant Met-β-caseins were expressed in E. coli to {{the same level as}} wild-type Met-β-casein.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{software}} partitioning is to assign <b>code</b> <b>segments</b> {{of a given}} computer program {{to a range of}} execution locations such as general purpose processors or specialist hardware components. These execution locations differ in speed, communication characteristics, and in size. In particular, hardware components offering high speed tend to accommodate only few <b>code</b> <b>segments.</b> The goal of software partitioning is to find an assignment of <b>code</b> <b>segments</b> to execution locations that minimizes the overall program run time and respects the size constraints. In this paper we demonstrate that an additional speedup is obtained if we allow <b>code</b> <b>segments</b> to be instantiated on more than one location. We further show that the program run time not only depends on the execution frequency of the <b>code</b> <b>segments</b> but also on their execution order if there are multiply instantiated <b>code</b> <b>segments.</b> Unlike frequency information, however, sequence information is not available at the time when the software partition is selected. This motivates us to formulate the software partitioning problem as a robust optimization problem with decision-dependent uncertainty. We transform this problem to a mixed-integer linear program of moderate size and report on promising numerical results.

Because of the generality of this response, it seemed possible to examine the expression of isolated heat shock genes in a heterologous system. Phage 122 DNA, containing two identical genes coding for the Drosophila 70, 000 -dalton heat shock protein (hsp 70 genes), was microinjected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. The Drosophila hsp 70 genes are transcribed efficiently in heat-treated oocytes (35 - 37 degrees C) to give RNA of the correct size and sequence content. Transcription is sensitive to low levels of alpha-amanitin and therefore is carried out by RNA polymerase II. At normal temperatures (20 - 28 degrees C) essentially no Drosophila-specific RNA is formed.
