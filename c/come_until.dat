5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not {{equipped with the}} neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals.

The 3DS version was released in Japan in September 2014, and in North America, Europe, and Australia the following month.

5|$|Despite its name, Old Louisville was {{actually}} {{built as a}} suburb of Louisville starting in the 1870s, nearly a century after Louisville was founded. It was initially called the Southern Extension, and the name Old Louisville did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> the 1960s. Old Louisville was initially {{home to some of}} Louisville's wealthiest residents, but saw a decline in the early and mid-20th century. Following revitalization efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a high concentration of students and young professionals.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's second {{bowl game}} did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> nearly 20years after its first. On December 10, 1966, the Hokies faced off against the No. 9 Miami Hurricanes in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tennessee. Tech {{came into the}} game having gone 8–1–1 {{during the regular season}} under head coach Jerry Claiborne, while the Hurricanes boasted a 7–2–1 regular-season record, {{including}} wins over Southern California and Florida. The Hokies were led by All-America safety Frank Loria, who caught threeinterceptions and returned threepunts for touchdowns as a junior during the 1966 season. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, the Hurricanes were led by All-American Ted Hendricks.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and moved on to other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E

Tozer had his loan extended twice: the first extension <b>came</b> <b>until</b> 9 January 2011 and the second extension <b>came</b> <b>until</b> the end of the season.

5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E
5|$|Capitol Hill {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{as the site}} of a subway stop in unimplemented plans from 1911 and 1968, but voter approval did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> 1996. It was built as part of the University Link Extension, which began construction in 2009 and opened on March 19, 2016. Construction of the station required the demolition of two city blocks along Broadway, which will be redeveloped into a transit-oriented, mixed-use complex in 2019. Light rail trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. The station is also served by the First Hill Streetcar and several King County Metro bus routes at nearby stops.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{shifting}} front line, the 2nd Battalion's first major engagement of 1917 did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> 9 April when, {{on the periphery}} of the Arras offensive, they took part in an attack on Hermies, one of the outpost villages of the Hindenburg Line. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Milligan, who had taken over on 17 March, the battalion had departed Haplincourt at 7:30pm the previous evening and marched to their form-up point. The plan was to attack with the battalion's four companies advancing side-by-side from the north-east to attack from behind the German defences, sweeping down on the village like a fan with the left-most company providing flank protection and establishing a series of posts to stop the garrison from escaping while the two centre and the right-most companies took the village. At the same time, two companies from the 3rd Battalion would attack the German main defensive position from the south-west.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing and washing clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran {{from one of the}} hot springs outside the city. In 1943, the first district heating company was started with the use of geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{earned his}} first win a week later, an 8–3 {{victory over the}} Philadelphia Phillies on July 16. The victory came in relief of Frank Seward, who started the game but pitched only one inning. He pitched four innings, {{allowing}} only one run; Ace Adams followed with four scoreless innings and earned the save. His fourth decision, a second career victory, did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> July 31, when he defeated future teammate Jim Konstanty in a 9–7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Hansen appeared again in a relief role, but pitched eight innings of one-run ball after starter Bill Voiselle allowed six runs in the game's first inning. At the plate, Hansen got his first major-league hit and scored his second career run while striking out once.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Crofts joined Gillingham as a trainee and was {{a regular}} in the club's youth and reserve teams during the 2000–01 season.

The following season, he suffered a broken leg during a reserve team match and missed several months of the season. Although he returned to action in early 2002, his next appearance for the first team did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> October, when he came on as a substitute in a League Cup match against Stockport County.

5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected.

5|$|On October 14 {{before the}} Week6 trade deadline, Roy Williams {{was traded to}} the Dallas Cowboys for a first, a 3rd and a 7th-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, making Johnson the Lions' {{starting}} wide receiver and the last big threat on the offense. In his first game without Roy Williams alongside him in the week7 game against the Houston Texans, Johnson caught only two passes, totaling 154yards receiving; the first pass did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> quarterback Dan Orlovsky threw a pass up for grabs {{at the end of the}} first half which Johnson caught for 58yards and the second pass came on a 96-yard touchdown catch-and-run.

5|$|The no-hitter {{cemented}} Holloman's spot in {{the starting}} rotation for the next month. In his next start against the Athletics, he lasted barely an inning, allowing two runs and three walks before leaving the game due to a blistered finger. His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians, but his third win did not <b>come</b> <b>until</b> a month later against the Boston Red Sox, where he allowed two hits in eight innings of work. Outside of the three wins, however, Holloman was ineffective; in 22 games, 10 of them starts, Holloman had a 3–7 record with a 5.23 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 50 walks. As a result, after his final appearance on July 19, the Browns put him on waivers, and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
