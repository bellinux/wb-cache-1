25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} {{disrupt the}} motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing <b>crystallite</b> size is a common way to improve strength, as described by the Hall–Petch relationship. Since grain boundaries are defects in the crystal structure they tend to decrease the electrical and thermal conductivity of the material. The high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding in most grain boundaries often makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the precipitation of new phases from the solid. They are also important {{to many of the}} mechanisms of creep.|$|E
30|$|In this study, rod- and flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> were {{synthesized}} using a facile hydrothermal growth method. XRD analyses {{showed that}} the rod- and flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> have mainly hexagonal phases. The faster crystal growth rate on the c-axis than on the other crystallographic planes in the hexagonal CdS phase under the given growth condition might account for the anisotropic growth behavior observed in the rod- and flower-like architectures of the CdS <b>crystallites.</b> The flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> exhibited more defective crystal features than did the rod-like CdS <b>crystallites.</b> Moreover, the flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> exhibited a broader visible light absorption range {{than that of the}} rod-like CdS <b>crystallites.</b> Therefore, the photoactivity of the flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> is higher than that of the rod-like CdS <b>crystallites.</b> The postannealing of the flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> in ambient air also resulted in the formation of a CdO phase on the surfaces of these <b>crystallites.</b> In this study, the existence of heterointerfaces in the CdO@CdS heterostructure was beneficial for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and therefore, the photoactivity of the flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> was further improved.|$|R
30|$|CdS <b>crystallites</b> with rod- and flower-like {{architectures}} were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal growth method. The {{hexagonal crystal}} structure of CdS dominated the growth mechanisms of the rod- and flower-like <b>crystallites</b> under specific growth conditions, {{as indicated by}} structural analyses. The flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> had a higher crystal defect density and lower optical band gap value compared with the rod-like CdS <b>crystallites.</b> The substantial differences in microstructures and optical properties between the rod- and flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> revealed that the flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> exhibited superior photoactivity, and this performance could be further enhanced through appropriate thermal annealing in ambient air. A postannealing procedure conducted in ambient air oxidized the surfaces of the flower-like CdS <b>crystallites</b> and formed a CdO phase. The formation of heterointerfaces between the CdS and CdO phases mainly contributed to the improved photoactivity of the synthesized flower-like CdS <b>crystallites.</b>|$|R
40|$|Supported Pt <b>crystallites</b> were {{prepared}} by two different methods, physical deposition by vacuum evaporation of Pt metal, and chemical impregnation from a precursor solution. Physically deposited Pt forms large elongated <b>crystallites</b> of approximately pillbox or inverted boat shape with an irregular, highly striated surface. while Pt <b>crystallites</b> from impregnated catalysts {{are small and}} have regular boxlike morphology. H- 2 treatment of the physically deposited Pt results in fragmentation of the Pt <b>crystallites</b> into smaller but irregularly shaped particles. Pd <b>crystallites</b> prepared from a tetraammine precursor are large and ellipsoidal in shape, while the <b>crystallites</b> prepared from a tetrapyridine precursor are small and have emeraldlike morphology. The shape distribution of the supported particles for Pt and Pd impregnated catalysts shows that only 30 % to 40 % of the <b>crystallites</b> have an equilibrium aspect ratio of 1. 0 and 60 %- 70 % have an aspect ratio > 1. 0 characteristic of metastable morphology...|$|R
25|$|Enhanced {{magnetic}} coercivities for hematite {{have been}} achieved by dry-heating a 2-line ferrihydrite precursor prepared from solution. Hematite exhibited temperature-dependent magnetic coercivity values ranging from 289 to 5,027 Oe. The origin of these high coercivity values has been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and <b>crystallite</b> size growth rates at increasing annealing temperature. These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale. At lower temperatures (350–600°C), single particles crystallize however; at higher temperatures (600-1000°C), the growth of crystalline aggregates with a subparticle structure is favored.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} {{tungsten}} light bulb filaments attempts to reduce creep deformation. Sagging of the filament coil between its supports increases with time {{due to the}} weight of the filament itself. If too much deformation occurs, the adjacent turns of the coil touch one another, causing an electrical short and local overheating, which quickly leads to failure of the filament. The coil geometry and supports are therefore designed to limit the stresses caused by {{the weight of the}} filament, and a special tungsten alloy with small amounts of oxygen trapped in the <b>crystallite</b> grain boundaries is used to slow the rate of Coble creep.|$|E
500|$|Protein {{crystals}} {{are almost}} always grown in solution. The most common approach is to lower the solubility of its component molecules very gradually; if this is done too quickly, the molecules will precipitate from solution, forming a useless dust or amorphous gel {{on the bottom of}} the container. Crystal growth in solution is characterized by two steps: nucleation of a microscopic <b>crystallite</b> (possibly having only 100 molecules), followed by growth of that <b>crystallite,</b> ideally to a diffraction-quality crystal. The solution conditions that favor the first step (nucleation) are not always the same conditions that favor the second step (subsequent growth). The crystallographer's goal is to identify solution conditions that favor the development of a single, large crystal, since larger crystals offer improved resolution of the molecule. Consequently, the solution conditions should disfavor the first step (nucleation) but favor the second (growth), so that only one large crystal forms per droplet. If nucleation is favored too much, a shower of small crystallites will form in the droplet, rather than one large crystal; if favored too little, no crystal will form whatsoever. Other approaches involves, crystallizing proteins under oil, where aqueous protein solutions are dispensed under liquid oil, and water evaporates through the layer of oil. Different oils have different evaporation permeabilities, therefore yielding changes in concentration rates from different percipient/protein mixture. The technique relies on bringing the protein directly into the nucleation zone by mixing protein with the appropriate amount of percipient to prevent the diffusion of water out of the drop.|$|E

2500|$|Micro{{extrusion}} is a microforming extrusion process {{performed at}} the submillimeter range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990. Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later. Regardless of method, {{one of the greatest}} challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. [...] "The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes." [...] Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the <b>crystallite</b> (grain) structure and boundaries.|$|E
2500|$|Dissolution is {{not always}} an {{instantaneous}} process. It is fast when salt and sugar dissolve in water but much slower for a tablet of aspirin or a large crystal of hydrated copper(II) sulfate. [...] These observations are the consequence of two factors: the rate of solubilization (in kg/s) {{is related to the}} solubility product (dependent on temperature) and the surface area of the material. [...] The speed at which a solid dissolves may depend on its crystallinity or lack thereof in the case of amorphous solids and the surface area (<b>crystallite</b> size) and the presence of polymorphism. Many practical systems illustrate this effect, for example in designing methods for controlled drug delivery. Critically, the dissolution rate may depend on the presence of mixing and other factors that determine the degree of undersaturation in the liquid solvent film immediately adjacent to the solid solute crystal. In some cases, solubility equilibria can {{take a long time to}} establish (hours, days, months, or many years; depending on the nature of the solute and other factors). In practice, it means that the amount of solute in a solution is not purely determined by its thermodynamic solubility, but also depends on kinetics of dissolution (or precipitation).|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{introduced}} {{to measure the}} free-energy barrier W(sup *), the activation energy, and activation entropy to nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> in amorphous solids, independent of the energy barrier to growth. The method allows one to determine the temperature dependence of W(sup *), {{and the effect of}} the preparation conditions of the initial amorphous phase, the dopants, and the crystallization methds on W(sup *). The method is applied to determine the free-energy barrier to nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> in amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films. For thermally induced nucleation in a-Si thin films with annealing temperatures in the range of from 824 to 983 K, the free-energy barrier W(sup *) to nucleation of silicon crystals is about 2. 0 - 2. 1 eV regardless of the preparation conditions of the films. The observation supports the idea that a-Si transforms into an intermediate amorphous state through the structural relaxation prior to the onset of nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> in a-Si. The observation also indicates that the activation entropy may be an insignificant part of the free-energy barrier for the nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> in a-Si. Compared with the free-energy barrier to nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> in undoped a-Si films, a significant reduction is observed in the free-energy barrier to nucleation in Cu-doped a-Si films. For a-Si under irradiation of Xe(2 +) at 10 (exp 5) eV, the free-energy barrier to ion-induced nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> is shown to be about half of the value associated with thermal-induced nucleation of <b>crystallites</b> in a-Si under the otherwise same conditions, which is much more significant than previously expected.
