40|$|Abstract: Oblique {{incidence}} {{laser triangulation}} {{was used to}} detect medium and heavy plate flatness in this paper. The article mainly focused on point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> extraction algorithm. In field detection of medium and heavy plate flatness, according {{to the problem of}} the point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> extraction difficulty in interference condition, and for enhancing lightness of <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> filed, an extraction algorithm of point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> is put forward in this paper which combines threshold method and square-weighted gray level based on floor board effect and traditional centroid method. Under no interference condition, point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> extraction using traditional centroid method has high accuracy. In the field detection with dusts, oil drops, water drops or other interferences, measurement precision has since fallen sharply. On this background, according to a kind of point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> with the interference of water drops or oil drops, classification extraction algorithm of point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> was put forward in this paper. At the first level, the spot and the drop contour was extracted with Sobel Operators. At the second level, the spot area was extracted. And then, this <b>spot</b> area <b>center</b> was extracted by a point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> extraction algorithm which combines threshold method and square-weighted gray level. And the center we get is point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center.</b> The validation results show that with the water drop interference, the accuracy with a point laser <b>spot</b> <b>center</b> extraction algorithm which combines threshold method and square-weighted gray level is obviously improved by 94. 17 % than the traditional centroid method. ...|$|R
