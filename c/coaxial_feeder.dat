50|$|A mast {{radiator}} {{may need}} various electrical connections {{other than the}} transmitter feed line. Such connections include static drain chokes (which drain off static charges caused by wind, clouds, etc.), spark-gap balls for lightning protection, power supplies for aircraft warning lamps, and <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeders</b> for ancillary antennas mounted on the mast. A variety of techniques are used to 'isolate' these connections from the high RF voltage on the mast, such as chokes, parallel tuned circuits and coupling loops, on a base-fed mast. On a shunt-fed mast, where the base is grounded, such measures are unnecessary.|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} automation, {{robotics}} and communications technology has established {{the need for}} the development of a communications infrastructure capable of supporting future underground hard rock mine automation systems. A series of underground experiments were undertaken at Copper Cliff North Mine to evaluate the design criteria and performance of several communications infrastructures. The work successfully demonstrated the capability of real-time operation of voice, data and stationary video communication as well as surface-to-underground tele-operation of a load-haul-dump machine. This was achieved with a communications system consisting of a broadband bus linked to leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>coaxial</b> cables by means of distributed antenna translators. The success of the trials permitted a strategy for mine automation to be devised. The economic benefits of mine automation were estimated by means of economic models developed for the mine. Projected benefits, evaluated in terms of mining cost reduction, throughput time and quality improvement, were concluded to be significant. As a result of the analysis, future research and development is concluded to be best targeted at improving ore grade, optimizing process productivity and maximizing machine utilization...|$|R

40|$|A spiral array {{radial line}} slot antenna (SA-RLSA) is {{designed}} in 22 GHz band. A SA-RLSA excited with a <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeder</b> suffers from aperture illumination fluctuation in amplitude and {{phase in the}} circumferential (φ-) direction while in the radial direction, reasonably uniform distribution is observed. Rotational symmetry of radiation patterns is degraded and especially the sidelobe levels are unbalanced. This fluctuation {{is associated with the}} generation of the higher order modes in the φ-direction and is the unique defect of SA-RLSA which uses oversized waveguide. In this paper, a novel feeding structure with two pairs of parasitic pins around a <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeder</b> is proposed and designed so as to compensate the rotational asymmetry of aperture illumination. A measurement using the model antenna designed in 22 GHz band demonstrates the enhancement of the rotational symmetry; the circumferential fluctuation is reduced from 5. 1 dB and 33 degrees to 1. 8 dB and 12 degrees, while the fluctuation in the first sidelobe level suppressed from 10. 7 dB to 1. 2 dB...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{monopole}} {{with double}} sleeves, {{which consists of}} a resonant loading and a conventional sleeve monopole, is experimentally investigated. The loaded monopole is put vertically in a parallel-plate waveguide and driven by a <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeder.</b> The new structure exhibits a remarkably broad impedance bandwidth. In this paper, a modal expansion technique is used to numerically evaluate the impedance characteristics of the monopole by modeling the fields between the plates using cylindrical harmonic functions. A Fourier least-square integration is applied to finding the expansion coefficients by the boundary and continuity conditions. Prior to modeling the proposed sleeve monopole, the developed analysis scheme is examined for its convergence and accuracy. Calculated results are validated by the measurements. For the optimum design at 5. 8 Ghz, we investigate {{the effects of the}} structure parameters on the impedance characteristics. 2001 John Wiley &...|$|E
40|$|A 4 × 2 {{array antenna}} is {{developed}} {{using a new}} nanocomposite polymeric magneto-dielectric substrate. The permittivity and permeability factors have been accounted in designing the proposed array antenna at the frequency of 2. 6 GHz. A pure polydimethylsiloxane (P-PDMS) (ε r = 2. 7) solution is mixed with ferrite III oxide (μ r = 1. 2) to generate this new nanocomposite polymeric magneto-dielectric (NPMD) substrate. The NPMD surface is then hardened and located in between two P-PDMS layers. The 4 × 2 radiating elements are immersed {{to the top of}} P-PDMS layer, while SMA <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeder</b> is fed from underneath the ground layer. This sealing technique enabled the proposed antenna to be waterproof and flexible. This combination contributes to bandwidth enhancement of 52. 65 %, size miniaturization of 176 × 156 mm 2 and high gain of 10. 8 dB. The measured results show a good agreement with simulations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation to establish methods to improve the performance of area radio based communication systems for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The considerable scale on which an area radio network is used as a telecommunication network is quite unique to South Africa {{due to a lack of}} high bandwidth telecommunication systems in rural areas. Research was done to establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the performance of the area radio telecommunication systems. Two KPIs were chosen, namely Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) availability and Control Success Rate (CSR). These KPIs were trended over a three-year period to measure the effectiveness of measures taken to improve the systems. Two measures were implemented, namely to change the RTU radios, antennas and <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeder</b> cables and to redesign the communication systems in such a way to restrict multiple RTU protocols on the same area radio telecommunication network. The installation of new digital radios together with low loss coaxial cable and specific antennas improved the RTU availability from 96. 87 % for the year 2002 to 99. 17 % for the year 2004, which realised in an increase of 2. 83 % for 432 installed RTUs. This measure, however, did not influence the CSR. The implementation of the newly designed communication networks had a significant influence on the control success rate of the SCADA systems and the KPI increased from 77. 65 % for the year 2002 to 78. 76 % for the year 2003 and 80. 88 % for the year 2004. A drastic increase in performance was observed after the restriction of multiple RTU protocols on the same network during May 2004, where the value for twelve months prior to September 2005 was measured at 84. 38 %. The utilisation of area radio telecommunication networks was measured for two operational networks and it was found to be well within the specifications of international accepted standards. One of these networks comprised of three repeaters and 84 installed RTUs and an average utilisation of 17 % and a peak utilisation of 25 % was measured. The other network had an installed base of 4 repeaters and 15 installed RTUs’s and an average utilisation of 3 % and a peak utilisation of 8 % was measured. This compares favourable with the IEEE standard 999 - 1992 [20], which recommends a channel utilisation of between 40 % and 60 %.

40|$|In {{use of a}} {{stationary}} television set in a ship which changes the direction of its bow continually by the direction of wind or the effect of tide while anchored, or according to its movement in operation, {{it is a problem}} how to control the directivity of the antenna to the maximum direction of the coming wave which undergoes continual changes as the ship moves. The purpose can be attained by utilizing the meridianseeking moment of the gyrocompass or the magnetic compass, or by setting the detection current of the television set at a certain value so that theservo-motor may be operated by the alteration of the electric current according to the directional change, or by employing the diversity method. In practice, however, these methods require much expenses and in addition they are attended with much difficulty. Therefore, the three-element Yagi antenna with a common reflector, a cheaper and simpler apparatus, was manufactured for experiment and used in practice. Some results obtained in the experimental use are as follows: 1. As one set of the three-element Yagi antenna which was formerly used could not catch the direct wave and the echo at the same time because its directive angle was about 70 °, the ship was often brought out of the visual angle owing to the change of the ship's direction, and a great trouble to control the directivity of the antenna was experienced every time. But this experimental antenna can cover all the directions and catch the coming wave at any time, and the picture can be controlled to obtain the best condition by only turning the antenna switch. 2. The experimental antenna can bring about a condition free from the disorder by the sea-surface echoes and the effect of the multiplied echoes by the antenna handling. 3. With very solid construction having decreased in number of elements by the use of a common reflector, and designing the length of the elements so as to resonate with the short wave channel it is durable for all the wind pressures in the sea. 4. In case of applying the experimental antenna to more than one television set, each set is to be fixed with an antenna switch. The reason is that each set needs to select its own condition of antenna because the incoming angle of the echo varies except when both sets receive the direct wave. 5. Although the standing wave ratio and the current transmission rate had low values in calculation because a <b>coaxial</b> <b>feeder</b> with low inpedance was used for the purpose of noise suppression and prevention of salt erosion, the quality of picture was not so bad in practice because the test was carried out in a strong field intensity. ﻿ 1. 従来使用していた 3 素子八木アンテナ 1 組では指向角度が約 70 度であったから,直接波と反射波を同時に捕捉出来ないため船体の方向によってはしばしば難視角内に入り,その都度アンテナの指向を修正せねばならない不便があったが,試作アンテナ使用後は全方向をカバーするので常に到来波があり,アンテナ切換器を操作するだけで画面を最良﻿態に調整出来る. 2. 試作アンテナでは海面反射波による擾乱や多重反射波の影響をアンテナ切換器の操作により除去し得る. 3. 反射器を共用にして素子の数を減らし,短い波長のチャンネルに共振するように各素子の長さを設計したので構造も堅牢に出来て海上での風圧にも充分耐える事が出来る. 4. 試作アンテナを 2 台以上のテレビに使用する際は,各テレビにアンテナ切換器の取付けが必要である. 理由としてはともに直接波を受像する場合を除いて反射波の到来角が異るので各個にアンテナの選択が必要となるからである. 5. 雑音防止と塩害を考慮してインピーダンスの低い同軸型き電線を使用したので,定在波比や電流透過率は計算上悪い結果となったが,強電界中で試験したため画面の品位は余り下がらなかった...|$|E
