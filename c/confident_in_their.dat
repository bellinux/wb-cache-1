5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply.

Rajasthan captain Rahul Dravid won the toss and elected to bat. Both captains wanted to bat, stating {{it appeared to be}} a good pitch to bat on. Dravid and Ajinkya Rahane provided a solid but slow start to reach 42 without loss after 6 overs. Harbhajan then entered the attack and took the wickets of Rahane and Shane Watson, Royals' top scorer of the season, in his first two overs. Apart from Dravid, who also fell to Harbhajan for 43 runs, only Stuart Binny and Dishant Yagnik made good scores. Yagnik's quick scoring helped Rajasthan get 46 runs from the last 3 overs and finish with 165 for 5. Mumbai were <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> chase as Smith helped them reach 125 for 1 after 14 overs.

25|$|Willow meets stoic Oz in {{the second}} season. Their {{courtship}} is slow and patient. Oz is bitten by a werewolf, and just as Willow begins to confront him about why he does not spend time with her, he transforms and attacks her. She must shoot him with a tranquilizer gun several times while he is wild, but her assertiveness in doing so makes her more <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> relationship. Oz's trials in dealing with a power he cannot control is, according to authors J. Michael Richardson and J. Douglas Rabb, a model for Willow to reference when she encounters her own attraction to evil. When Willow and Oz decide to commit to each other, Willow is enthusiastic {{that she has a}} boyfriend, and, as a guitarist in a band, one so cool. Her relationship with Oz endures the high school storylines of exploring her attraction to Xander, which briefly separates them. She worries that she is not as close to Oz as she could be. They stay together through graduation into college, but Oz is drawn to Veruca, another werewolf. He admits an animal attraction to Veruca, which he does not share with Willow. He sleeps with Veruca and leaves shortly after to explore the werewolf part of himself. Willow becomes very depressed and doubts herself. She drinks, her magical abilities are compromised, her spells come out wrong, and she lashes out at her friends when they suggest she get over it ("Something Blue").|$|E

500|$|Aware that Imperial {{troops had}} {{breached}} the Schellenberg's defences Marlborough launched a third assault.

[...] It was not long, however, before the Franco-Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of Baden's infantry approaching {{from the direction of}} the town. Many of the officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet's garrison in DonauwÃ¶rth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact Baden's troops. [...] "They [...] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, without our being aware of the possibility of such a thing." [...] Wrote de la Colonie. [...] "So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post..." [...] After establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, Baden's men now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling them to re-align in order to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough's assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted English dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill.

500|$|Kim is {{voiced by}} American actress Christy Carlson Romano, {{who was only}} 16 {{years old when she}} was first cast as the character. The titular role was {{originally}} offered to actress Anneliese van der Pol, who turned it down in favor of co-starring as Chelsea Daniels in the Disney Channel Original Series That's so Raven. Before being cast as Kim, Romano had already been well-known for starring as Ren Stevens in the Disney Channel sitcom Even Stevens. The actress was finally introduced to the show's creators by Disney Channel executives after Schooley and McCorkle had already auditioned several people for the role. According to McCorkle, Romano [...] "nailed" [...] her audition, which he described as [...] "just fantastic."Kim was Romano's first voice-acting role. Upon being cast as Kim, Romano immediately identified with the character because they were [...] "both dealing with teenage issues" [...] at the time. During the show's first season, Romano {{and the rest of the}} Kim Possible cast recorded at different locations. Like her character, Romano also balanced her acting profession with schoolwork, and agreed that they are both <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> endeavors. Because the actress was enrolled in high school in New York City at the time, she was often required to participate in cast meetings and table reads via telephone; Romano was actually unable to attend her own senior prom because she was working on Kim Possible. Occasionally, the actress herself would serve as creative inspiration for the writers; one episode in particular, [...] "Blush", was based on the fact that Romano is a shy and easily embarrassed person who tends to [...] "blush at even the slightest compliment/awkward situation." [...] The writers also gave Kim several interests that are similar to Romano's own. Schooley enthused that the actress [...] "add something to [...] that makes it more than a typical gag-oriented cartoon", crediting both her and co-star Will Friedle, voice of Ron, among reasons fans connected with the characters.|$|E
