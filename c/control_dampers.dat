40|$|This paper mainly {{treats the}} seismic {{behavior}} of lead-rubber bearing (LRB) isolation systems with superealstic {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) bending bars functioning as damper and self-centering devices. The conventional LRB isolators that are usually installed at the column bases supply extra flexibility to the centrically braced frame (CBF) building {{with a view to}} elongate its vibration period, and thus make a contribution to mitigating seismic acceleration transferred from ground to structure. However, these base isolation systems are somehow susceptible to shear failure {{due to the lack of}} lateral resistance. In the construction site, they have been used to be integrated with displacement <b>control</b> <b>dampers</b> additionally withstanding lateral seismic forces. For this motivation, LRB isolation systems equipped with superelastic SMA bending bars, which possess not only excellent energy dissipation but also outstanding recentering capability, are proposed in this study. These reinforced and recentering LRB base isolators are modeled as nonlinear component springs, and then assigned into the bases of 2 D frame models used for numerical simulation. Their seismic performance and capacity in the base-isolated frame building can be evaluated through nonlinear dynamic analyses conducted with historic ground motion data. After comparative study with analyses results, it is clearly shown that 2 D frame models with proposed LRB isolators generally have smaller maximum displacements than those with conventional LRB isolators. Furthermore, the LRB isolation systems with superelastic SMA bending bars effectively reduce residual displacement as compared to those with steel bending bars because they provide more flexibility and recentering force to the entire building structure...|$|E

's {{annealing}} furnace, new {{nickel aluminide}} intermetallic alloy rolls provide greater high-temperature strength and wear resistance {{compared to the}} conventional H series cast austenitic alloys currently used in the industry. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Bethlehem (ISG) partnered under a U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Industrial Technology's Emerging Technology Deployment Program to demonstrate and evaluate the nickel aluminide intermetallic alloy rolls {{as part of an}} updated energy efficient large commercial annealing furnace system. Many challenges were involved in this project, including developing welding procedures for joining nickel aluminide intermetallic alloys with H-series austenitic alloys, developing commercial cast roll manufacturing specifications, working with several commercial suppliers to produce a quantity of high quality, reproducible nickel aluminide rolls for a large steel industrial annealing furnace, installing and demonstrating the capability of the rolls in this furnace, performing processing trials to evaluate the benefits of new equipment and processes, and documenting the findings. Updated furnace equipment including twenty-five new automated furnace <b>control</b> <b>dampers</b> have been installed replacing older design, less effective units. These dampers, along with upgraded flame-safety control equipment and new AC motors and roll-speed control equipment, are providing improved furnace control and additional energy efficiency. Energy data shows up to a 34 % energy reduction from baseline after the installation of upgraded furnace damper controls along with up to a 34 % reduction in greenhouse gases, potential for an additional 3 to 6 % energy reduction per campaign of light-up and shutdown, and a 46 % energy reduction from baseline for limited trials of a combination of improved damper control and straight-through plate processing. The straight-through processing is now possible because of the nickel aluminide rolls which also provided plate product surface quality improvement that will allow the additional processing of surface critical material. Benefits also include associated large reductions in maintenance, reduction in spare rolls and associated component costs, and potential for greater through-put and productivity. Estimated project fuel cost reductions alone for processing 100, 000 tons/yr through this furnace are almost $ 0. 5 million/yr with the new dampers, and more than $ 600, 000 /yr with straight-through processing and new damper control, assuming natural gas prices of $ 6. 00 /MMBtu.

40|$|Vibration {{control of}} {{high-rise}} buildings under wind loads with {{application of the}} mega-sub-control method is studied in this paper. A building with a megasub-configuration consists of two major structural components - a megastructure as the main structural frame and several sub-structures for residential and/or commercial usage. The authors have previously proposed a ‘megasub-control method’ in which the sub-structures are designed to serve as vibration <b>control</b> <b>dampers.</b> The control objective is to suppress certain critical building responses such as inter-story drifts of the mega-structure {{for the purpose of}} structural safety and acceleration response of the sub-structures for the purpose of protecting contents and improving human comfort. The feasibility of this method has been explored by the authors in previous publications. In this study, the procedure of optimally designing dynamic parameters of a megasub-controlled building under stochastic wind loads is developed, together with two possible structural configurations which provide a mega-sub-control mechanism. The mega-structure of a mega-sub-building is modeled as a cantilever beam to retain the dominant bending mode characteristics of highrise buildings, and the sub-structure as a shear building to retain the shear mode. The fluctuating wind speed is modeled as a non-white random process in both time and space domains. The power spectral density (PSD) of critical building responses is obtained using the random vibration theory. The mean square value (MSV) of those responses, as functions of the dynamic parameters including the stiffness and damping ratio of the sub-structures, are evaluated from their PSD by numerical integration in the frequency domain. The optimal values of the dynamic parameters are determined by minimizing the MSV of certain critical building responses. An example building is used to demonstrate the design procedure and the numerical simulation of the response quantities in the time domain is carried out to verify the MSV of the building responses obtained from the random vibration theory in the frequency domain. The results show that the proposed design procedure is suitable to apply to a mega-sub-building with different sub-structural configurations. The MSV obtained from the random vibration theory in the frequency domain and from the numerical simulation in the time domain exhibit an excellent agreement. It is also found that the megasub-control method is robust in the sense that slight change in the dynamic parameters affects the building's performance very little. With the design procedure developed, and the corresponding favorable building response demonstrated, this paper has enhanced the feasibility of application of the mega-sub-control method to actual high-rise buildings for wind vibration suppression...|$|E

40|$|Demand {{controlled}} ventilation (DCV) {{is considered}} as an energy efficient solution for air-based cooling and {{indoor air quality}} control. Considerable energy savings can be achieved when the airflow rate is continuously adapted to the actual load condition. However, in order to assure the desired performance of the system, {{it is essential to}} know the requirements that the DCV system and its components should fulfil. The objective of this work has been to clarify the requirements for a well functioning DCV system. This includes cooling performance as well as sensor based air quality control. The work is based on theoretical analysis, field measurements of occupancy and system performance as well as laboratory investigations of DCV supply air diffusers and sensors for air quality control. This thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} implement in existing as well as in new buildings an uncomplicated DCV solution that requires no active <b>control</b> <b>dampers</b> in the duct system. This, however, requires variable supply air diffusers with good airflow control properties and with a low noise generation even at a high pressure drop over the device. Also, in cooling applications the devices must provide a comfortable airflow pattern in the room within the entire airflow range and with low supply air temperature. In addition, the duct system must manage the wide airflow range, including the design minimum supply air temperature for cooling, with negligible heat gains. Tests carried out with such a DCV configuration show that high requirements set on the system components can be fulfilled. An additional focus in this thesis is the application of DCV systems for air quality control. This requires sensors that can monitor the air quality and/or pollution to control the hygienic ventilation rate. Quantitative requirements for such sensors have been developed based on ventilation guidelines and standards. A detailed sensor study was carried out with a number of CO 2 -sensors and mixed-gas sensors. Results show that, depending on the requirement, several tested CO 2 -sensors could fulfil the established requirements set on sensors. However, the application of the tested mixed-gas sensors for ventilation control is undecided. It is not clear how the output of mixed-gas sensors should be interpreted. Another limitation comes from the lack of available standards describing acceptable concentrations for many common air contaminants for nonindustrial buildings. Finally, this thesis also provides some information on the actual occupancy patterns in a commercial building in operation.

40|$|In {{commercial}} buildings the building services systems {{may account for}} {{a substantial part of}} the need of energy. There is, at least in Sweden, a large existing stock of 20 to 30 year old office buildings, which are supplied with centralised constant air volume flow (CAV) air conditioning systems with the primary function to keep the room temperature at an acceptable level summertime. However, since the heat loads are only occasionally at the peak level, considerable amounts of energy can be wasted during periods when cooling is not needed or when rooms are not in use. Substantial energy savings can be achieved by changing the system to variable air volume flow (VAV) operation. Nevertheless, such a change becomes meaningful only if the system as a whole is adapted to the new configuration. The aim of this work is to clarify the prerequisites for a well functioning VAV system in office buildings. A special focus has been that the system solutions should be uncomplicated and possible to implement in existing buildings as well as in new ones. Adopting VAV in office buildings without having to install active <b>control</b> <b>dampers</b> in the duct system is one way of building up a simple VAV system. To obtain this, some special demands must be set upon the VAV variable supply air diffusers. They must have good controlling properties and a low noise level even at a high pressure drop over the device. Also, a comfortable airflow pattern in the room must be ensured within the variable volume flow range in question. One example of uncomplicated system configuration, which in theory has properties that fulfil the demands, was tested both in the laboratory and studied in plants in function, with focus on the indoor climate and the need of energy. Furthermore the influence of a variable air volume flow on duct heat gains was analysed and mathematically evaluated. The results indicate that it is clearly possible to obtain a well functioning system with a technical solution in accordance with the studied one. The indoor climate demands are essentially fulfilled. The noise levels in rooms can be kept at a well acceptable level. The draught appeared to be considerably low despite low supply air temperatures. The field monitoring of energy consumption showed that the tested VAV systems worked energy efficiently. The heat recovery system managed to cover all the heating need of the supply air, i. e. any additional heating with the heating coil was not needed even at low outdoor temperatures...|$|E
