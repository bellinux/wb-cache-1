Many homophobic <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Jeff during an argument with Russell after the first Power of Veto ceremony were edited out of the first Tuesday broadcast episode while the comments remained uncensored online.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown visited Doncaster North {{during the}} general {{election}} campaign to support his former adviser. Miliband was elected on 5 May 2005, with 55.5% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 12,656. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 23 May, responding to <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> future Speaker John Bercow. In Tony Blair's frontbench reshuffle in May 2006, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office, as Minister for the Third Sector, with responsibility for voluntary and charity organisations.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 1970, some ethnic {{violence}} has persisted. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> a newspaper reporter. Rioters in Kaduna killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins at}} a funeral, {{attended}} by Guy, Caroline, Boyce (Oliver Chris), Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) and Sue White (Michelle Gomez). References {{made in the}} episode lead the viewer to first {{believe that it is}} Mac's funeral, but then a giant picture of Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), who left the hospital in series two, appears. The cause of her death is not fully explained, although <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the characters indicate she died in a hunting accident with a moose. The plot then splits between three groups of characters.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced {{arrest on}} a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Irwin about {{the actions of}} the Philadelphia {{ownership}} during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded some of his best players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring stretch in 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came {{with the end of the}} 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to manage that team for a couple of seasons.|$|E

5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E
5|$|The FN {{was hurt}} in the snap 1988 {{legislative}} elections by the return two-ballot majority voting, by the limited campaign period, and by the departure of many notables. In the election the party retained its 9.8% support from the previous legislative election, but {{was reduced to a}} single seat in the National Assembly. Following some anti-Semitic <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Le Pen and the FN newspaper National Hebdo in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Other quarrels soon also left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN's early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno Mégret as the unrivalled de facto FN deputy leader. The FN only got 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, now including at local level. In the 1989 European elections, the FN held on to its ten seats as it won 11.7% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe started 2000 {{looking to}} add a third {{individual}} event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by <b>comments</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> German head coach Manfred Thiesmann accusing him of using steroids. Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample {{due to lack of}} containers. After the standoff was resolved, Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5s from his world short course record in the 200m freestyle. Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level. On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by Speedo.|$|E
