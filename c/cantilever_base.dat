This paper presents a <b>cantilever</b> <b>based</b> biosensor which converts biological recognition analysis into measurable mechanical displacement which is highly sensitive in nature. As the sensitivity of a device {{is the most important}} factor regarding to biomedical equipments, this paper deals with the sensitivity of a device. Sensitivity of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>based</b> biosensor decreases with decrease in the concentration of analytes. The sensitivity depends on its deflection of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>based</b> Bio-MEMS due to interaction between the analyte and its complementary bio-receptor molecules.

AFM contains basically a base-excited microcantilever with nano tip along with a sensing circuit for scanning of images. Design and analysis of this microcantilevers is a challenging task in real time practice. In the present work, design and dynamic analysis of rectangular microcantilevers in tapping mode with tip-mass effect is considered. Computer simulations are performed with both lumped-parameter and distributed parameter models. The interatomic forces between the nano tip mass and substrate surfaces are treated using Lennard Jones (LJ) model and DMT model. The equations of motion are derived for both one-degree of freedom lumped parameter model with squeeze-film damping and distributed parameter model under the harmonic base excitation. Also the nonlinearity of the cantilever is investigated by considering cubic stiffness. The distributed parameter model is simplified with one mode approximation using Galerkin’s scheme. The resulting nonlinear dynamic equations are solved using in numerical Runge-Kutta method using a MATLAB program. The natural frequencies of the microcantilever and dynamic response are obtained.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design and {{experimental}} validation of an in-plane assembly method for centimeter-scale bulk-microfabricated components. The method uses mesoscaled deep-reactive-ion-etching (DRIE) -patterned cantilevers that deflect and lock into small v-shaped notches {{as a result of}} the hand-exerted rotation between the two components of the assembly. The assembly method is intended for MEMS arrays that necessitate a 3 -D electrode structure because of their requirement for low leakage currents and high voltages. The advantages of the assembly method include the ability to decouple the process flow of the components, higher overall device yield, modularity, reassembly capability, and tolerance to differential thermal expansion. Both tapered and untapered cantilevers were studied. Modeling of the cantilever set shows that the springs provide low stiffness while the assembly process is in progress and high stiffness once the assembly is completed, which results in a robust assembly. In addition, analysis of the linearly tapered cantilever predicts that the optimal linearly tapered beam has a cantilever tip height equal to 37 % of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>base</b> height, which results in more than a threefold increase in the clamping force for a given cantilever length and deflection, compared to the untapered case. The linear taper profile achieves 80 % of the optimal nonlinear taper profile, which would be impractical to fabricate. Analysis of the experimental data reveals a biaxial assembly precision of 6. 2 -mum rms and a standard deviation of 0. 6 mum for assembly repeatability. Electrical insulation was investigated using both thin-film coatings and insulating substrates. Leakage currents less than 1 nA at 2 kV were demonstrated.

Recent advancement in biomechanics refers to a significant relationship between cell stiffness and cell condition. Mechanical stiffness can be used to identify abnormal cell populations as in tumors in detecting cancer and can be employed as a diagnostic parameter for various diseases. In this study, we introduced micro fabrication technology to develop polymer <b>based</b> <b>cantilevers</b> integrated with thin chromium film resistor as a transduction scheme. Cantilevers are beam like micro structures anchored only at one end with the other end freely suspended. When a force or load is applied {{along the length of the}} cantilever or at the free end, the cantilever bends and stresses are induced on the cantilever surface which changes the resistance of thin chromium film resistor. A custom built amplifier allows for a sensitive response to the deflection. Cantilevers with different dimensions and stiffness were calibrated. The force detection was in the range of 5 - 500 μN. The <b>cantilever</b> <b>based</b> sensor was used to find the stiffness of an elastic Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro pillar of diameter 200 μm and height 100 μm.

A PDMS film containing micro pillars was fabricated using UV lithography and soft lithography techniques. When the cantilever was moved against the PDMS micro pillar with the help of mechanical stage displacement, the cantilever deflected and the PDMS micro pillar displaced as well. Using the measurements and calculations from cantilever calibration and cantilever manipulation with elastic PDMS micro pillar, the stiffness of elastic PDMS micro pillar of diameter 200 μm and 100 μm was measured which was 0. 97 Nm- 1.
