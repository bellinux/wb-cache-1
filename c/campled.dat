40|$|A first-order {{gradient}} model {{based on}} the Eringen nonlocal theory is presented. The variational formulation, the governing differential equation and both classical and non-classical boundary conditions of nonlocal nanobeams subjected to torsional loading distributions are derived using a thermodynamic approach, thus providing closed-form solutions. Nanocantilevers and fully <b>campled</b> nanobeams are considered to investigate the size-dependent static behavior of the proposed model in terms of torsional rotations and moments. The results are thus compared {{to those of the}} Eringen model, gradient elasticity theory and classical (local) model...|$|E
