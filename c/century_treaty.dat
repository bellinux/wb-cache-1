The original seat of the bishopric appears to have been at Peel, on St Patrick's Isle, where indeed it continued to be under English overlordship; the Bishopric of the Isles as it was after the split was relocated to the north, firstly Snizort and then Iona.|$|E

50|$|The {{legitimacy}} of an adjudication depended on regular and just proceedings, and departures from {{internationally accepted standards}} of fairness risked ongoing litigation by disgruntled shipowners and their insurers, often protracted for decades. For example, during America's Quasi-War with France in the 1790s, corrupt French Caribbean prize courts (often sharing in the proceeds) resorted to pretexts and subterfuges to justify condemning neutral American vessels. They condemned one for carrying alleged English contraband because the compass in the binnacle showed an English brand; another because the pots and pans in the galley were of English manufacture. Outraged U.S. shipowners and their descendants continually challenged these French colonial kangaroo court decisions of the 1790s, litigation called the French Spoliation Cases which lasted well over a century, until 1915. Together with Indian tribal claims for 18th <b>century</b> <b>treaty</b> breaches, the French Spoliation Cases enjoy the dubious distinction of figuring among the longest-litigated claims in U.S. history.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the early}} part of the 20th <b>century,</b> <b>treaty</b> fishing rights were met with little opposition. In the 1942 Tulee v. Washington case, native fishing rights met their first major contest. In the case, Sampson Tulee was convicted of {{catching}} salmon with a net, without having first obtained a state license. Because of a treaty made between the federal government and the Yakima nation, Tulee claimed that it was unlawful for the state to require him to obtain a fishing license. The case was brought before the Supreme Court and the opinion was delivered by Justice Black. It was determined that, while a state could not require Indians to pay a license fee, they did have the power to [...] "impose on the Indians equally with others such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation as are necessary for the conservation of fish".|$|E
5000|$|At the time, the cession of Mumbai (or Bombay) was {{of minor}} {{importance}} - but retroactively it gained a crucial importance when the place passed from the Portuguese to the English in 1661 {{as part of the}} dowry of Catherine of Braganza, and became a major trade center - making this the treaty's most important long-range result.Bassein was the Portuguese northern capital from the time of their 16th <b>century</b> <b>treaty</b> with the Sultan.Under Portugal, the fort was the Northern Court or [...] "Corte da Norte," [...] second only to the City of Goa, functioning as the headquarters of the Captain of the North. For 150 odd years, the presence of the Portuguese made the surrounding area a vibrant and opulent city.

5000|$|The [...] "far north" [...] {{is synonymous}} with the areas north of the tree line: the Barren Grounds and tundra. This area {{is home to the}} various sub-groups of the Inuit, a people {{unrelated}} to other Aboriginal peoples in Canada. These are people who have traditionally relied mostly on hunting marine mammals and caribou, mainly barren-ground caribou, as well as fish and migratory birds. This area was somewhat involved in the fur trade, but was more influenced by the whaling industry. This area {{was not part of the}} early 20th <b>century</b> <b>treaty</b> process and aboriginal title to the land has been acknowledged by the Canadian government with the creation of autonomous territories instead of the Indian reserves of further south. Very few non-Aboriginal people have settled in these areas, and the residents of the far north represent less than 1% of Canada's total population. The far north is also often broken into west and eastern halves. The eastern Arctic which means the self-governing territory of Nunavut (much of which is in the true Arctic, being north of the Arctic Circle), as well as Nunavik, an autonomous part of the province of Quebec, and Nunatsiavut an autonomous part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and perhaps a few parts of the Hudson Bay coast of Ontario and Manitoba. The western Arctic is the northernmost portion of the Northwest Territories (roughly Inuvik Region) and a small part of Yukon, together called the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.|$|E
40|$|The {{boundaries}} between accounting and law are contingent on time-space intersections. Here, these margins are explored {{in the realm}} of international relations by focusing on the Asiento, an 18 th <b>century</b> <b>treaty</b> granting Britain the monopoly to trade slaves with the Spanish American colonies. Although a relatively minor concern of treaty-makers, noncompliance with provisions of the Asiento by the South Sea Company placed accounting centre stage in conflicts between Britain and Spain. In combination with geo-strategic and domestic political circumstances, reporting failures exacerbated the commercial dispute between the two nations which culminated in war in 1739. The accounting provisions of the Asiento are examined by drawing on managerialist and realist theories of treaty compliance. It is shown that British noncompliance with accounting obligations under the treaty was driven by realist self-interest and the maximisation of material gain. Given that such motivations dominated behaviour attempts to manage noncompliance through the routine processes and structures of international politics proved unsuccessful. Managerial devices such as diplomatic exchanges over treaty ambiguity and securing greater informational transparency merely provided further opportunities for the pursuit of self-interest. It is suggested that divergent perceptions of the role of accounting in international relations stem from the unique political, legal, social and cultural configurations of nation states. The study highlights the limitations of accounting as an instrument of treaty verification. Its effectiveness in that capacity is diminished where there is no shared understanding of the significance, purpose, content and interpretation of accounting information. ...|$|E

The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919.

The state appealed, and the Seventh Court of Appeals' decision also upheld the rights of the Ojibwe. The state appealed again, but the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the state's argument to reverse the lower court decision. After the highest court refused to reverse, five other Chippewa bands joined the Lac Courte Oreilles' legal action.

40|$|Conventional {{views on}} state-formation {{examined}} within nation political and resource constraints to assess changes that took place. In my dissertation, I explored how external stressors such as international treaties affected domestic legal reforms.

I used Chisquare tests of variance to deduce that geographic {{origins of the}} treaty partners affected the types of treaties signed {{and the level of}} symmetries for treaties. The year of when the treaties were signed also had an effect. Further, treaties tended towards mutual benefits around the early 20 th century as cross-regional tensions declined.

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} research project combines {{the fields of}} nautical archaeology and computer visualization {{in order to create}} an interactive virtual reconstruction of a Portuguese nau. Information about the shipbuilding process is gathered from 16 th and 17 th <b>century</b> <b>treaties</b> by Fernando Oliveira and Joao Batista Lavanha, as well as from Dr. Filipe Castro (Texas A&M Department of Anthropology). Eight registered tonnage formulas from the 15 th to 17 th century are used to estimate the cargo capacity of the nau. Using this information, I develop an algorithm that creates a parametric computer model of a nau hull and calculates its registered tonnage. This parametric model allows the user to choose between the Oliveira and Lavanha hull shapes, adjust parameters to fine tune the hull shape further, and save the information about the hull shape for future editing. The eight registered tonnage estimates are compared to the volume of the parametric hull model below a generic waterline. The process I use to adapt the information provided by the two shipbuilding treatises into an algorithm determines the hull shape of a nau. This allows for projects in the future to introduce other shipbuilding approaches and information as it becomes available to this parametric model...|$|R
